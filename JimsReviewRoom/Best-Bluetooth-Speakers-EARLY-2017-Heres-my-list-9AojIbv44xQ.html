room here's my buyers guide going
through the best of the best Bluetooth
speakers from small to large and I'll go
over just the major features of each for
the full details you gotta watch my
reviews now keep in mind these are
speakers that I've personally tested
there are some that I obviously couldn't
get to by the time this video here if
there's some worthy ones out there
please leave a comment in the comment
section below
to help some others out there find their
way as always
I'll place my Amazon links in the video
description below click on my links and
they'll give you the most updated prices
in real time now getting right into this
starting with the small speaker category
first up is the JBL flip 3 offering a
loud performance better bass response
over most other small bluetooth speakers
better life is rated at 10 hours of
playtime and probably best of all at the
time this video the price has dropped
down to $79 now the flip 3 is splash
resistant and the base radiators are
very tough but they are indeed still
exposed now if you need the absolute
most rugged speaker out of them all at
around this price range the UE roll 2 is
an excellent alternative it is lacking
in bass and that's probably the only
thing that I didn't like about it but
the UE roll 2 still provides decent
audio it makes up for that lack of bass
with absolute ruggedness I've tossed
this in the mud spray this in water toss
dry dirt on this thing it's still
surviving it's almost nearly bulletproof
basically the battery life is up to 9
hours on this with a price tag of 99
dollars now for those who want something
at home and not needing waterproofing a
Sony x-33 is next on my list add up to
12 hours of use which is on the upper
end with the clear Audio plus function
the x-33 tunes your audio output and
gives a nice and clear experience very
neutral sound signature here that's very
fine and easy to listen to
now this one is also priced at $99 at
last and this is for those who have a
much bigger budget but absolutely
requires a small size that same
ruggedness waterproofing and values the
best audio performance for the small
speaker category it be a no a 1
Bluetooth speaker has it all it's priced
at 249 dollars which is
very expensive but again it's about the
same diameter as the Yui roll - but the
audio performance is the best for the
size last if you absolutely are on a
budget don't need the bells and whistles
and just looking for purely audio
I reviewed the DOS sound box earlier
this year here it's priced at just 32
dollars make this one the cheapest
Bluetooth speakers ever reviewed it's
clean clear and not distorted I know
many folks are worried about buying
super cheap speakers here but I have
reviewed this I have offered these sound
samples on my review channel and it
works great as a again simple Bluetooth
speaker for casual use again all the
updated prices will be in the video
description below click on them for the
most updated prices now moving on to the
mid size here the JBL charge 3 is still
one of my favorites for it's insane
better life at up to 20 hours features
include a charge out port to charge
other devices it's not just splash proof
but you can fully dump this underwater
the JBL connect feature allows me to
hook up two speakers at the same time to
have a much bigger audio presence and
possibly best of all this sound for its
price basically its value at just $149
retail the audio is very impressive as
it gives a bass boost in center it's
very loud in general the speaker's
designed to jam out with not just for
casual listening now for a few the bass
is a bit harsh at times but use an
equalizer and the charge 3 is a great
pet as an alternative if you want
absolute bass the Sony Xperia L zit
water resistance up to 24 hours of
battery life
very solid design and the reason why
this is on this list here is it does
provide better value over the beats pill
plus the newest pill plus still provides
a great audio I personally like the
design but it featured only 12 hours of
better performance there's no water
resistance and again that's subjective
to your needs here and the pill plus is
retailing for 230 dollars which is quite
expensive here no other mid to your
speakers to consider is the UE boom - it
gets super loud but it didn't offer the
bass of the other aforementioned
speakers but again the ruggedness water
submersion the fact that the speaker can
float in water if you do accidentally
drop us into the pool or lake mix up for
its shortcomings
now up to 15 hours of better life and
one
yet most unique features here you
introduce this thing called party up
allowing you to connect up to 50 UE
speakers together not just two speakers
likely charge three or beats pill plus
lasts till one of the best all-around
speakers for nearly every genre here the
post sound like mini 2 is still one of
my favorites offering more of an open
sound stage more so than other speakers
out there and offer one the best in
fidelity in detail versus the other
models I've mentioned so far now boast
doesn't provide that in your face bass
boosted sound signature but a neutral
very clear experience the mini 2 retails
for $200 I've seen them on sale 480 here
and almost forgot here battery life is
sadly though the shortest at just 10
hours of use
now last up on the large size bluetooth
speakers Marshall Stanmore makes it on
my list here for its looks styling and
uniqueness this does require to be
plugged into the wall but the loud audio
outputs the room filling music goes a
long way not much features on this
besides the building knobs emulating the
iconic marshall amps of the past and
present but the auto cad turistic focus
on generous of rock instrumental and
vocals this one is for short worth
looking into the Stanmore is priced
though it's kind of expensive but it's
priced at 349 dollars moving on the fugu
sport XL and the UE mega makes it return
on my list here both providing full
water submersion both speakers can float
in the water if you do accidentally drop
it in the lake or again the pool and
both provides absolute loud audio
performance for outdoor entertaining the
mega boom is simply rugged all around
here but the fugu sport XL takes a
slightly different approach here by
offering a outer protective shell that
you can actually remove from the speaker
itself now there's more drivers on each
side of the fugu here to give it a more
fuller sounding speaker when you're
outdoors and not only that it offers
best-in-class 35 hours of battery life
which no other speaker can come close to
that I've personally tested so far if
you ask me which one does sound better I
choose the fugu XL over the mega boom
both of these models retails for $300
again check my links for the current
sale prices and be very less speaker on
this entire list here is the JBL extreme
and
minutes started to show its age though
it doesn't have the best battery
performance at just 15 hours which is
still not bad though to be honest with
you and you cannot connect more than two
speakers like you can with the Yui
products these days and it's only splash
proof you cannot submerge this
underwater but from my testing gear is
still the best sounding large portable
bluetooth speaker on the market if
you're using this at your backyard
barbecue around the house in the park
the Xtreme still sounds the most
impressive with its bass boosted audio
performance it's loud outputs and simply
at the end day it's just immersive more
than the others more so than the other
speakers that I've mentioned so far the
extreme retails for $300 but lately I've
seen them around for 250 around the
Christmas season as low as 225 again
click on those links at the via
description for the updated prices so
that's it for my list here hopefully it
helped you in some way again I haven't
tested every speaker in the markets but
I have tested a bunch on this specific
channel here be sure to show your
support by liking and subscribing and
following me on Facebook and/or
Instagram
you guys take care and I'll see you on
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
