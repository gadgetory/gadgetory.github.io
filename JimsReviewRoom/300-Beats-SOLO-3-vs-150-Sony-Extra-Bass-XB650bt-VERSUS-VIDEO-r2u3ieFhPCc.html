welcome back to another one of my videos
today we're revisiting the boats solo
threes and the reason being I uploaded
the review a couple days ago and in the
first two days I was reading all of your
comments almost every one of you guys
almost every one of you guys said how
could sound like garbage they're
overpriced there is better out there I
understand where you guys are coming
from
escapement during that review uh it was
really more intended for the audience
that prefer based heavy headphones I was
reviewing it at that standpoint now for
those who prefer a more accurate sound
signature a flatter sound signature
of course there is better out there but
again this is that wouldn't be comparing
apples to apples to be upfront and
honest with you guys I still love my B&amp;amp;O
h6s
I love the Sony 180 ends I think that
both QC 35 does a little bit better than
the Sony's if I wanted a bass boosted
signature not bass heavy just bass
boosted the Sennheiser wireless
Momentum's I still have mine upstairs
and those are great as well but getting
back on track here these are $300 retail
a couple guys in the comment section set
to review some Sony's and do a
comparison I went out and got these
myself
these are they Sony xb6 50 BTS and I got
the box right here for you guys these
are also based focus headphones basic
focus headphones
whoops bass focus headphones at 150
dollars bass focus headphones at $300 so
we'll see what the difference is and how
did it sound to me again with all biases
aside of course as a reviewer here like
I said I do prefer those other
affirmation headphones but again there's
just reviewing for those based focus
anyways if you guys have these solo 2
that didn't mention this in my review
real briefly there's no reason to
upgrade unless you want better battery
life the old solitudes had 12 or 14
hours better left I can't recall it was
somewhere down there but these have up
to 40 hours I tested these this got
about 56 hours worth of use at 50 to 60%
volume with these they're claiming up to
30 hours I got about 34 hours with the
same volume level so it's not too big of
a difference either or both or
phenomenon of course beats does beat the
Sony but in general for the average
consumer
I think this is
still really good at the 30 35 hour mark
impressive signals signal wise this does
better this claims up to 300 linear feet
I did test this in my house left the
phone on one side walk down stairs to
the other side of the house here the
signal went through several walls of
course the first floor ceiling here no
problems whatsoever with these for the
average consumer
again if you're staying within your
house I didn't have any problems once it
did go outside about what maybe 60
linear feet 50 linear feet that's when I
start to crack a little bit that's when
I start to lose connection these I
didn't but again the average consumer I
don't think you're gonna be are you
gonna be walking that far away so just
keep that in mind
I'm not trying to defend Sony but I'm
just being realistic as my channel does
cater towards the average consumer now
comfort wise when I put these on for you
extend the arms real quick here make
sure I got the correct side here active
noise cancellation of course but these
way in about two hundred fourteen grams
they are still considered lightweight to
me anything around 200 grams really is
comfortable
I did notice my ears warm up a little
bit in the first 30 minutes but after
that it was perfectly fine so if you
guys can see that and I'm going to put
on these Sony's here and these are
actually under 200 grams and just like
the bno h6 is just like the post QC 35
which are under 200 grams they are
seriously lightweight these weigh in
about 196 grams then I measured on my
scale and these feel phenomenal they're
super super lightweight compared to
these it's not a dramatic difference but
you will notice the difference if you
were to have both these back-to-back and
put them on and off you know back to
back for your own comparisons so there's
buttons down here that physical buttons
that it has you skip songs pause songs
volume up and down a micro USB port for
charging and the power on and off these
have just little clicky buttons here
where you hold down press it up press it
down for volume skipping songs as well
so it's a little bit more discrete on
these well these have physical buttons
just out but you can actually feel where
you're pushing so I don't know that's a
plus or minus to you they still work
perfectly fine now keep in mind
beats do fold just like this they're
foldable ear cups these do not fold in
unfortunately
but they do collapse or fold inwards I
guess you can say they don't fold what
they don't you know they don't fold
inwards for you guys but anyways so
stowing these are packing these away
this does take a wider footprint you can
say so just keep that in mind for
traveling if you guys are into that
quality wise this does as well as the
beats solo threes the beats solo threes
did crack or one of the seams did pop
and you notice that with these Sony's it
does stretch out a little bit after you
do that bend test and I know you guys
are not going to do it at home but I
want to show you guys how durable this
is compared to you know other headphones
that do the same test basically and it
helped that getting it back does help
out a little bit here same thing with
the solos no problems that I'm doing the
same test that it did in the other video
no big deal it does retain its shape a
little bit better but nonetheless and
like I said in the review the headband
does pop out a little bit there I just
have to squeeze it up push it back in
but nothing breaks thank goodness so not
a hundred percent the best quality that
I've seen on headphones with the beats
here there has been better but
nonetheless at least nothing is breaking
on me so with all that being said let's
get into the audio sound signature both
does provide a good amount of bass if
you guys prefer bass heavy headphones
these two I think sound almost
equivalent with each other in regards to
how deep the basic goes these Sony's
with the mid-range it's not as
pronounced or not as pushed forward or
not as bright as these solo threes and
the solo two since they sound exactly
the same some average consumers do
prefer a brighter sound signature I
person prefer a brighter sound signature
I feel like the vocals are pushed little
bit more forward a little bit more
clarity's pronoun or present the highs
and the Sony's are not as high-pitched
as well so the Sony's actually are a
little bit louder or higher in frequency
verses or the Sony's here another thing
that I noticed that I wish the Sony did
have though was the soundstage was just
ever so slightly
less performing over the solo three the
soundstage nsolo threes you can hear
sound distinctly from the left from the
right two in front of you behind you
from slightly above you two below you
the soundstage on these are pretty
pretty darn good compared to the the
Sony's here but with everything being
said I gotta say the sony is just ever
so slightly a lower performer than the
the beats solo threes not saying it's a
dramatic decrease but for a hundred and
fifty dollars for a slight decrease in
performance in general it's a lot of
value a lot of bang for your buck at
$150 sometimes I've seen them on sale
for even lower than that so keep an eye
out for that I'll put my link in the
video description below but with
regarding the soul of threes the part
that really shines is again the better
life the wireless range it does sync
with iCloud which is another feature
from more for Apple users so with that
being said it's a minut difference if
you guys don't have the money don't have
300 bucks and I admit 300 bucks is a lot
of money you get these Sony's here it's
the again xB 650 BTS they are a lot they
have a lot of value and I'm seeing here
has NFC as well this doesn't have NFC
but this has a lot of value this will
give you a little bit better performance
but again you're shelling out 300
dollars in total so that's it for this
comparison video here hope you guys
enjoyed it hope you find some value
behind it let me know in the comment
section below which one do you guys
prefer I'm thinking mostly guys based on
the content in the review you guys would
prefer the stony regardless bombs again
just being upfront and honest and just
testing this over the last what three
days almost four days or so just trying
to distinguish what the differences are
Sony ah just very minor bit just a
little bit under the beat so of threes
so guys follow me on social media at
Facebook Twitter and or Instagram follow
me on my personal social media account
at Jimmy Leung official everything
should be on your screen right now I am
planning to give these away at my
200,000 sub video when I do my draw my
