review room now carrie has been around
for some time and if you haven't owned
one yourself you probably see them at
the office indeed compared to the
traditional coffee machine keyrings are
quite expensive especially with their
cake ups but once you factor in the
convenience of not messing with coffee
filters no cleaning up after coffee
grounds and the hassle-free method of
just brewing one cup at a time instead
of an entire pot and also with the
option of making hot tea hot chocolate
and other miscellaneous drinks at your
choosing you can say it justifies its
price now prices are on your screen and
the particular model I have here is DK
450 so without further ado welcome to
another review
to distinguish which model might be
right for you here's a list of all three
and what each has to offer the biggest
difference is the water reservoir being
6070 in 80 ounces respectively now all
three are now able to brew a carafe or
what's known as a coffee pot which was
not an option in the past with the mid
tier K 450 and the most expensive k550
you're able to program when you want the
correct to brew in the morning you can't
do so with the K 350 and last with the
most expensive model that differentiates
it from the mid tier it just comes with
a bigger touchscreen and previously
mentioned that bigger reservoir now
going over the physical construction
everything is made of plastic with a
slight feeling of being Hollow you can
hear it when handling the machine and
even opening and closing the reservoir
lid overall the build quality is still
good though with no defects or poor
craftsmanship which is the important
part
considering this would just sit
stationary on the countertop with its
beautiful glossy black finish and shiny
chrome accents even at night there's an
ambient white light in the water
reservoir just giving this machine a
very sophisticated look now going over
its 2.4 inch touchscreen it's very
responsive once you place in your k-cup
it's really simple with the bottom left
offering the option to produce a
stronger brew in the middle is a button
to select other drinks besides coffee
like hot tea or chocolate n to the top
right is your drink size selection
ranging from 4 6 8 and up to 10 ounces
and keep in mind the new 2.0 systems are
able to brew from that special craft
sized k-cups which in turn you're able
to make from 2 cups of coffee up to 5
cups of coffee in that one pot now
regarding the k-cup themselves this has
to be the biggest downfall of this unit
in 2012 Kia regs patent for their K Cups
expired allowing many third-party makers
to make their own pods that fits right
into the K machines and considering
these third-party options are cheaper
Keurig is losing in their own fight so
in turn the newest machines uses
infrared light to scan the lids reading
a specific ink if it's not an approved k
cup it's not going to work showing you
this message that I have on screen now
this really is a downfall for the
consumer as many other options are no
longer accessible and perkier eggs
website they can only use K cups with
the white ring going around
with the black circle in the middle
indicating both quote-unquote cure egg
brood and I would assume also you cannot
take advantage of the cure eggs reusable
filter for which you are once able to
use your own coffee grounds again
another cheaper alternative not in
regards to my actual news it does work
flawlessly and brews coffee as it should
the only nuance is a slight splash on
almost every cup that I make which isn't
a big deal but be weary of standing
nearby fabrics now all three models do
offer ad scalar mode to help with
removing any water deposits over time
and cleaning in general is quite easy
keep in mind none of these items are
dishwasher safe including the carafe now
some features I wish were integrated on
any one of these three models is
temperature control I do like my coffee
a little bit hotter and second although
there is an auto brew timer for the
carafe it would have been nice for a
single cup Potter brew option when I
wake up in the morning as well now those
are more wishes on this device here that
I think is really a flaw but overall
although it's a new machine the new
limitations really hurt from the
consumer standpoint if you already own a
Keurig it may be more beneficial to stay
where you are and if you're intending on
buying the biggest benefit is indeed the
carafe and it's time to brewing
accompanied by the more modern and
stylish touchscreen display so if you

Facebook Twitter or Google+ and if this
