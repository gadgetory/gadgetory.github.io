room I'm giving a try to a more
budget-friendly pair of earphones since
the less ever ones I reviewed so far has
been around 150 dollars or so these are
the Sennheiser momentum in your earbuds
retailing for $99 but since they've been
out for a while now you can click on the
link in the video description below for
more updated pricing so without further
adieu I'm here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room going over the
physical features first these look great
in my opinion however contrary to belief
the main housing is not metal but it is
plastic and although it doesn't feel
ultra premium they are very very
lightweight to work with and very easy
to wear now taken off the air tip this
is where we actually see some metal used
regarding the wire guard this is very
unique it's simple and also original yet
it still provides enough protection and
preventing the wire from accidental
poles and tugs moving down to the wire
the court feels decent and definitely
not cheap they're very similar to lay
flat cables and helping to prevent the
cables from tangling a huge plus when I
do throw this in my bag and take them
out for later
moving down the right earbud there is an
inline volume controller with a built-in
microphone to answer phone calls the
bottle have here is for Apple devices
but Sennheiser does make the same
earbuds here for Android phones too now
here's a quick test on how it sounds hey
it's me hey what's up a few minutes I
got a test out this microphone and these
pair ear but ya know come cool so I got
them on right now just working as usual
how do I sound
does it sound clear to you are you
actually sound pretty clear with you're
actually on the phone all that clear
okay good oh the other thing I want to
test out is the wire I'm going to bump
the wire gently and just let me know if
you hear any wire chatter or any kind of
rustling around ready all right I'm
pumping it right now do you hear a
little bit of noise or any kind of noise
a little bit of like a clicking noise
when you tap it I think ok and how about
now
nope nothing nothing awesome okay that's
really good all right I thought I needed
thanks in regards to Fitz Sennheiser
does provide a total of four sets of ear
tips for your ear canal the sizes do
very good bit so having these work for
your particular ears I wouldn't see as
being an issue now wearing these
personally for me has been very
comfortable providing a pretty good snug
fit and a pretty good bit of passive
noise isolation however if you are
intending on using this while mostly
walking like some ear buds on the market
you do hear a little bit of wire chatter
when the wires bounces on your shirt or
your coat it sounds like the wires are
rustling around a little bit however in
all their circumstances they are of
course perfectly fine now as for what
else that comes in the package you do
receive a very nice hard case with the
exterior being a neoprene like fabric
and on the inside its felt line there's
no pockets but it does come with the
optional cord management system here and
a storage tray with or without the tray
to be honest with you I still very much
like the low profile of the case itself
so to the moment that you've been
waiting for how do they sound now
sennheiser for me has always provided a
sound signature that's just bright
enough in the mids with slight bass
boost just enough to get most people to
enjoy a wide variety of genres
now with these here the momentum in ears
bass is deep and these deeper than usual
than what I'm used to from Sennheiser
but sub bass levels will provide a nice
Rumble without distortion bass is also
punchy and sounds slightly pushed
forward and if you're not big on bass
I'm sure these will turn you away
but bass heads these are worth
definitely worth a consideration mid
ranges are clear voices do stand out at
higher volumes as well and seldomly on
more bass heavy songs there is slight
spillover from the low end into the low
mid range now regardless it's still a
pleasure to listen to if you're into
bass the highs are really neutral in my
experience there were nowhere close to
being ear ringing or too high to cause
discomfort the only thing that I can see
as an improvement was just a little bit
more spatial sound or more of an open
soundstage and compared to these
slightly more expensive ear buds that
I've tried it is missing a little bit of
detail or resolution in its audio
characteristics but again these are $100
earbuds basically and these are bass
focused and although they don't sound
like $200 earbuds that I've test
that they for sure sound more than what
Sennheiser is asking for so how this
