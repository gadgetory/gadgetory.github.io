looks just like a watch
now there's other smartwatches out there
but if you don't need notifications
caller ID and all that cool stuff that
makes a SmartWatch two to three hundred
dollars and up the winnings activity a
pop might be the answer now I personally
bought this for testing at the retail
price of a hundred and forty nine
dollars as of this video making this
slightly more expensive than the other
fashionable yet simply functioning
misfit shine and we'll take a look at
how it feels and how it performs to see
if this fits your needs so I'm here to
help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's review
now the activity path looks almost
identical to its bigger brother the four
hundred and fifty dollar activity but
subtle differences does reflect the
price point of this particular model now
first off is the watch strap itself
offering a silicon material it's ideal
for those who are active it offers a
traditional buckle to keep the watch
tightly around your wrist and it works
very well keeping everything snug with
an ample amount of notches to fit all
sizes and after testing so many bands I
do gotta admit though it is slightly
stiffer and not as flexible as other
brands that I've tested in the past it's
still comfortable though but it does
feel as it reflects its price point but
overall it's super lightweight it looks
fashion illegal I think it doesn't snag
those long sleeve shirts because it's
somewhat of a low profile and the face
of the watch isn't gargantuan making
this ideal for both males and females
but let's take a look at the dial here
and see some of its main selling points
as you can see the face is a traditional
analog screen with a sub dial indicating
their activity progress throughout the
day now unfortunately the dials do not
glow in the dark nor is there any
backlight so in pitch black or let's say
in the middle of the night you can't see
it at all but surprisingly in low lights
and bright light situations the contrast
of whites and the colors offered makes
the hand very visible not as for the
mineral glass use it does feel somewhat
new plasticky if that's a word to
describe it and not a solid piece of
glass like an traditional watches at
least it doesn't feel like it and when
the activity pop first came out with
ings in several news outlets did confirm
the glass breaks or at least scratches
somewhat easily now weddings has
addressed that and with all new models
including mine here now offers a much
durable manufacturing process to prevent
those issues a fellow fan and eventually
confirming with weddings all new models
with a blue dot on the bottom of the
packaging indicates this is a band
that's good to go as the new
manufacturing process intact and today I
don't see any fine scratches from normal
day-to-day activities and I did bump
this pretty bad before and as you can
see the glass is still pristine now
other features you can't see right away
is this band does utilize a cell battery
that lasts up to eight months
the highly convenient considering most
other activity trackers you do have to
charge it every five to seven days on
average
and not to mention once the battery goes
bad there's no way to replace them now
talking about replacement here it's easy
to do with witting supply tool you just
basically pry open the back take out the
old one and put in the new one and
that's basically it now another feature
you cannot see is the activity pop has
the ability to automatically know when
you're sleeping
walking and running and even swimming
and yes this band is water-resistant for
swimming up to 165 feet or basically 50
meters
deep and a last feature is the band
offering a silent vibrating alarm which
does good but I felt stronger vibrations
on other bands before now if you're a
deep sleeper afraid this might not work
for you now everyone's a little bit
different though so of course you have
to test it out yourself so that's
basically it for the band it's very
simple it's very basic there's no GPS no
heart rate tracking no special screens
just a simple classic watch that does
offer all-day tracking and it does it
all automatically for you but let's take
a look at the app and look over all this
data that you're collecting and see how
it can help you here's the HeartMate app
as weddings calls it so with this app
this does work on Apple devices with iOS
7 or higher and Android powered devices
version 4.3 and up and sorry window
phone users out there you're kind of Sol
in this case now you don't necessarily
need your phone with you all the time
the band does save your information and
when you're back home or even the next
day you can sync at that time to save
your information on to the app now one
issue that I've personally found so far
and this has been acknowledged by
weddings and their customer support page
there are times the band does not sync
when I wanted to turning it on off the
settings that is where the resets
doesn't seem to help this issue either
now it's really after multiple
miscellaneous tries that eventually I
see the band talk to the app and
eventually sync my data together so just
a heads up on that and I'm pretty sure
weddings is working on getting that
fixed now starting with the main page
here is your timeline now up top you
have your total steps so far the
percentage of reaching your step goal
which you can customize if needed and
the far right is your leaderboard for
comparing any peers that are following
you and vice versa via this app now you
can swipe right to reveal the vibrating
alarm settings in which you can select
any combination of days which is a huge
plus considering some bands only offer
weekends or weekdays only now selecting
okay and going back onto the screen here
the main screen that is one more swipe
to the right offers manual entries for
your weight that provides a friendly
reminder to weigh yourself daily to see
if your weight is going up or down now
regarding the plus sign here again you
can manually enter this information for
blood pressure and heart rate to see
over time how you're doing in those
areas and keep in mind the activity PAP
itself doesn't have a heart rate tracker
built in now moving down a little bit
further here is the meet of the app
itself offering previous day's
performance charts now clicking on each
one here you can break down how active
you were throughout your days with a
nice bar chart up top now below again
our steps taken with a goal meter to the
right and below that our elevation
changes technically it's there for other
devices not for the activity pipe itself
now moving on estimated distance travel
active calories that were burned off
during those active moments and last is
a total amount of calories burn for that
entire day now on the very bottom if you
did go for a run which I did here you'll
see an orange
that once clicked on will review your
total active minutes the estimated
distance and also the pace but backing
out here as you can see there isn't a
card here for that active run that I
just showed you the only thing displayed
is your sleep and daily step information
now opening up sleep it's pretty
detailed with indications and how long
you are actually in bed for versus the
actual total sleep that you achieved and
from my experience overall the data
collected is very much accurate with
minimal to no counts
while I'm either typing at my keyboard
or driving and a sleep recording does
appear to be accurate with times I'm
just sitting still let's say at the
movie theater or so and it's not
recording me as being asleep basically
at one last area of the app I wanted to
show you is the dashboard which looks
very simplistic but there are some
helpful features behind the scenes this
wellness level butterfly looking icon
fills up based on your progress no
tapping on it and then tapping a
category say activity here since I'm
lacking that area gives me app
suggestions for example I do personally
use RunKeeper
and with the Withings here this shares
data with my RunKeeper account as well
now to mention other popular apps like
My Fitness Pal endomondo runtastic met
my fitness etc you can see a full list
on Withings website but overall those
are the main key points the only
downfall that I did see what this app
though being offered is the history it
provides is limited to days and weeks
monthly comparisons I could not find and
they're basically not available on the
app now it's really hard to see if I'm
improving in my overall activity over
the year as I felt weekly comparisons
we're still a bit short for long term
health goals and I also did sign into
the Withings website and viewed my data
there which has some really nice charts
there too but again only daily and
weekly numbers are available not monthly
comparisons but other than that
considering its price point considering
this product is meant to be a very
simple all day and all night tracker and
having the looks doesn't hurt either
I really do like it I guess the only
question now is is it too simple for you
or is it just enough let me know in the
comments below so hope this video helps
you in some way if you do like my work
add me gyms review room to Facebook
Twitter Instagram or Google+ and you can
see behind the scenes
pictures and photos and ask me questions
on there as well again this is Jimmy
with Jim's review room you guys take
care now see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
