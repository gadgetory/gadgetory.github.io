by Jim's review room now receives
several messages of people asking me
about these Chromebooks from Google and
asking what are they so I'll do a
general overview of Chromebooks as a
whole and hopefully with this video they
can help you see what Chromebooks are
all about and see if it fits your needs
or at least watch this video to
basically feed your curiosity so without
further ado we'll get started now first
and foremost how are Chromebooks doing
now as the year 2013 has gone its way
we're starting to receive interesting
data indicating on what consumers are
really buying now as some of you may
know Windows and Apple laptops for 2013
saw a decrease in sales and it's
confirmed by reputable market research
company and PD group but the one product
that grew over 4,000 percent when
comparing 2012 to 2013 and basically
accounted for nearly 21% of laptops sold
in the latter year is the Chromebook by
Google so what is the allure of these
Chromebooks that basically sold almost
nothing in 2012 - the fastest growing
laptop product by the end of 2013 and
one of the big reasons is pricing
Chromebooks are no question considered
as the budget laptop of today the
cheapest Chromebook that I've
encountered so far as of this video
today is the Acer c720 and that's priced
at $199 us now from what I can gather
the average price sits around 250 with
the bigger options topping 300 now for a
laptop those prices are not bad at all
now what you get that's very different
is the operating software and this is
where some people might be turned on or
turned off by what Google Offers now
Chromebooks do not run on Windows but it
runs on their own developed software
called Google OS everything is performed
in a browser actually and over the cloud
there's no programs specifically Exe
file extensions that you can install as
well
everything is initiated through apps
that you download through the Google
store and then actions are performed
through Google Chrome now Google intern
basically puts every Google service into
their Chromebooks so if you're already
using Gmail or know of some other
applications like Google Hangouts Google
Voice Google Maps the list goes on of
course you shouldn't have a tough
transitioning at all and of course your
existing account right now can be
basically used to log into your new
Chromebook and because of that one
account that one username and its data
can be pulled up anywhere that you sign
in now all of your documents are saved
into the cloud again under that one
account and for example here if I'm
using my computer at work or at school
and save something onto Google Calendar
later in the week and whether at home or
on my smartphone I can pull up that
calendar again and find the work I
entered previously now that information
is available even though I'm not on the
original computer and used initially and
just putting it out there and just
trying to keep Jim's review honest
integrity here one of the biggest
downfalls though if you happen to need a
program that only runs on Windows or iOS
then you can't use it now in college and
at work if your school or employer
required you to install a certain type
of software and again it requires
Windows you're basically Sol again a lot
of the programs that are able to be
installed again are tailored more
towards Windows 7 Windows 8 I think any
kind of Apple products as well so in my
opinion a Chromebook has the versatility
of a laptop with his connections and
keyboard but it works off of apps like a
tablet or smartphone so if you're okay
with that the limitation per se
shouldn't be much of an issue for you
and just real quick here before I move
on to the physical aspects one very
important note to make Google Docs is
free and pre-installed so if you can't
of course install Microsoft Word docs
just works just like Microsoft Word for
typing up your papers and there's also a
very good Excel app called Google sheets
if you need that and those programs you
can save them as a Word or Excel
document respectively so Microsoft can
read your save files down the road now
the second feature of Chromebook is
being light now these things weigh
anywhere from 2.3 pounds to the HP 14
inch model that basically weighs in a
little over four pounds now either/or
they're very lightweight and very thin
making these things ultra portable but
being light weight alone isn't what
Chromebooks are known for but their
light in design and functionality and
from my experience they're usually just
enough ports to satisfy the average user
all Chromebooks have at least two USB
with an SD card slot HDMI and also audio
ports are built in now wireless internet
is of course available with Wi-Fi
signals for a B G and n connections and
Lesley is Bluetooth connectivity for
your Bluetooth devices now in regards to
performance this really depends on your
usage
now with the focus of being quote
unquote light the processor consumes
very low electricity and they do very
light workloads now typically with
Chromebook they're good for day-to-day
activities like browsing the internet
Facebook Twitter - watching
high-definition videos on Netflix Hulu
and YouTube and of course it is also
tailored more towards students as well
who just basically need this laptop to
type up papers now what you won't see is
gaming on a high level like I said
earlier apps run in the internet browser
so when you're gaming it opens a new
browser window in the game's website is
then open their games are now played
basically through that open window now
another issue our games that shows
available in the Google store after
downloading the app revealed it's not
playable either because Chromebook again
doesn't run on Windows or the Chromebook
doesn't support Java and then for games
that are able to be found and able to
run they're not real heavy hitting
blockbuster titles but they're more of
these 2d based kind of games now getting
off the topic of games in general
because of the processor is not working
so hard and everything is basically ran
through the web browser the battery life
on these latest models claims up to
eight and a half to even nine and a half
hours of use which is really good for a
laptop so overall as you can see
Chromebooks in general has a purpose and
does fulfill this certain demographic in
my opinion if you're on a budget and
need a computer just for the basics this
really fulfills that need without
breaking the bank
but it just be aware if you are
intending and installing programs on
your computer then Chromebook isn't for
you so I hope I helped you in
understanding what Chromebooks are and
how they actually function again this
isn't a in-depth review of course but
this can give you some consideration if
Chromebook is right for you now the
videos playing are basically reviews
I've done previously on the latest
Chromebooks and definitely feel free to
watch them if you haven't done so please
