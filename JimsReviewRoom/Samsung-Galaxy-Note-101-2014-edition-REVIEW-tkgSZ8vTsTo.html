review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the brand new Samsung
Galaxy Note 10.1 and this is of course
as labeled the 2014 edition so hope with
this review if you're in the market for
a new laptop or considering of
purchasing a tablet I hope with this
review it can help you decide if it may
be a worthwhile purchase for you or not
the specific model I have here is the 16
gig Wi-Fi only version that comes in
black it also comes in white and it
comes with the same 16 and 32 gig
configurations and they're both priced
at five hundred and forty nine dollars
and five hundred and ninety nine dollars
respectively and we'll start with the
physical features first with this year's
model the note 10 comes in more Square
and refined-looking with straight lines
and less curves around the edges that a
unit almost measures the same as last
year's with a slightly slimmer profile
at nine point six inches wide six point
eight inches high and point three inches
thin and shackling with as much crammed
into this it's only 1/100 of an inch
bigger than the brand new iPad air now
the note 10.1 is actually one of the
thinnest tablets on the market today as
well and lastly it comes in weighing at
nineteen point zero five ounces and
continuing with its physical features
this year's model has imitation leather
backing which upon looking at it seems
very sophisticated in high-end but then
touching it yields no grip enos nor soft
and supple feedback you've come to
expect from leather now it's plastic
that is molded to look like leather then
you have this faux stitching as well
around the border of the back of the
tablet now it looks great but it doesn't
perform on that aspect
unfortunately nonetheless the Galaxy Tab
itself is a very solid built machine
with a sense of quality when you hold it
in your hands so most of the layout is
the same as last years with the power
button up top and the rocker volume
buttons right next to it you have your
infrared blaster here to remotely
control your TV and on the top right has
your S Pen and we'll go more into that
once we get to the performance section
review now on the top left here though
you have your three
1/2 millimeter headphone port and on
both sides of the tablet has your
integrated speakers now regarding the
sound quality
it wasn't anything spectacular but if
anything was okay in my opinion now
valium on maximum was slightly distorted
on very high notes other than that again
I would just consider them a just
average speakers next you have your
microSD slot so you can expand memory
and transfer files with a little bit
more ease which is a huge plus since
some tablets on the market don't even
offer that and to finish up you have
your micro USB charging port here and
your standard home back and app buttons
on the front face along with a 2
megapixel camera on the front and 8
megapixel camera on the rear with a very
bright LED lighting in regards to the
camera sample pictures are shown on your
screen right now with both low lighting
bright lighting and a zoomed in photo as
well and in bright lighting the camera
worked exceptionally well as you can see
it looks amazing even when zoomed in you
can see even the fine details for a
tablet low lighting performance was
pretty good there's not much noise or
distortion in the pictures as I thought
so moving on to the screen now the
screen features a 2560 by 1600 display
and that translates to a 299 pixels per
inch
now again the more pixels per inch
they're more detail and content meaning
more crisp images and letters that
you'll have
so just for comparative purposes the
newest iPad air released at November 1st
2013 has 264 pixels per inch but to be
honest when I place them side-by-side
and zoom in on my photos I don't see a
difference at all
and sometimes it's not all about pixels
anyways but comparing color reproduction
now the Galaxy Tab has more warmth and
natural skin tone coloring the images
doesn't appear as washed out when
comparing to say the iPad as shown here
and most new tablets today in ways and
the reviews I've done so far like the
Nexus 7 in the Kindle Fire HDX are on
par and they all look great with
accurate colors so with this Galaxy Note
tablet it hangs in there with today's
standards
now moving on internally the unit
features Samsung's newest and fastest
housing a 1.9 gigahertz quad-core
processor with three gigs of RAM using
the latest Android platform which is
Android jelly bean 4.3 now for everyday
tasks and the average tablet user it
will run anything you throw at it it's a
beast in that essence and in all my
reviews for all the new tablets coming
out it's probably going to be the same
verbage now computing power today with
no questions can handle the basics
emailing web surfing YouTube even down
to even the more demanding 3d games
it all works very well with this tablet
and as you can see in the video now
although it's priced at $550 starting
out and being able to do what other
tablets can do at a basic level the
following features are what really sets
this tablet apart and make it a worthy
buy for you we'll start with the s-pen
now any time you pull out the stylus pen
air command opens automatically on the
screen and you can access this anytime
by pressing the button on the pen itself
as well you have a fan of shortcuts that
supplements your use with the stylus so
the first action is action memo here you
handwrite whatever you choose and
eventually associate the words with an
action so for example to add a contact
with the action memo open just handwrite
the name phone number and/or email and
then click on the action button and you
just click on contact as you can see it
pre-populates for you and Samsung does a
very good job of recognizing my
handwriting as well as you can see it's
not the best either my handwriting that
is but again the Samsung is able to read
it very easily you can also do this with
emails searching the internet and even
going through Google Maps and looking up
an address one handy feature is making a
list on the fly and having it saved in
your tasks and I'll demonstrate here
real quick for you now what I'm making
is basically a really quick grocery list
and after making a list of these items I
save it as a task as you can see here
the list saves conveniently for pulling
up later in the day
the next feature of Air Command is
scrapbook the name implies it's action
you can snip a part of your screen and
save it an example of this is if you're
house hunting or let's say considering
of new paint colors or so through all
your web pages you've searched you can
save those photos just snip it right off
of that web page and where you found
them without the screenshot of your
entire tablet so if you're looking up
close or I guess for females if you're
looking up shoes or dresses that you
like you can save what you see and have
it categorized into your custom folder
screenwriter is the next option that
enables you to take a screenshot and you
can hand write notes and memos right on
that save image and email to anyone that
you choose to an example this is if I
were to do some remodeling or I wanted
to illustrate moving a sofa or
indicating what wall I needed to paint
over I can do so with this feature here
another example is indicating what I'm
trying to point out in a photo rather
than trying to describe it I guess this
is a little bit more handy versus you
know going on your laptop or computer
and using Photoshop or Microsoft Paint
and it's a little bit more streamlined
doing it this way since you can do it on
your tablet the next one is s finder
which is just a search tool it's pretty
self-explanatory where you can search
for anything on your tablet that you've
saved viewed or even they can pull up
your handwritten notes as well again
it's pretty self-explanatory now breeze
through that there and lastly is pen
window where once activated through air
command you draw a square anywhere on
the window and you're able to open the
following shortcuts which includes a
calculator alarm YouTube contacts Google
Hangouts and even a small web browser
and a small window pops up with that app
which sits on the foreground while the
background still remains seamless and
also active as well now you can work on
both areas and even move the small
window while in use you can also
minimize the app in the foreground and
it becomes a small icon for movement as
well so the only limitation I found with
this was I couldn't find a way to add
more apps into the pen window for news
and if there is a way let me know in the
comments below it's something I might
have overlooked but I think
everywhere so if you can't help out
that'd be great lastly is regarding
multitasking you do have a feature
called multi-screen which is a little
bit different from Penn window but no
question is definitely worth noting
though this is probably people's most
favorite feature now you have an array
of applications on your left-hand side
of the screen at all times and you can
hold and drag a bat icon onto your main
area of the screen and it will split
into two now this is perfect for looking
up let's say you looking up an address
on a web page and then you pull it up on
Google Maps on the other window that you
have opened up side by side or let's say
you're doing a research paper and you
have the internet on one side while
you're typing on the other or
handwriting on the other in this case
you can also do two high definition
YouTube videos side by side which I
thought was at first a little bit too
demanding for the tablet but it worked
without an issue it's really good to see
that offered on a tablet itself so again
kudos to a Samsung there now for anyone
who's never used the Samsung Galaxy
product overall the music is fairly
simple and straightforward the interface
as seen in this video so far consists of
your home page and the filing pages are
basically your apps that you can
customize and move around notice the
Samsung proprietary features are what
makes this Samsung product unique and
stand out if you already have an s4
smartphone or a Samsung Note then you'll
be pretty much familiar with the Samsung
interface already if you're purchasing
this for let's say a nano tech savvy
individual to use some of the features
that might be it might be a little bit
too much for them and I know it'd be a
little bit too much from our mother and
my mother's about 65 so again if it's
not so tech savvy individual they might
have a little bit of trouble just
utilizing these features using the
tablet overall the better life on the
2014 model claims up to nine hours of
music and I was able to get a little
under nine hours straight with surfing
the internet and this leaving the
brightness settings on auto and while
this device is charging with my personal
tricity consumption test it consumes
three watts while charging and the
screen is has gone dark or sleep mode
and while in use it only consumes about
11 watts so if none better
all so overall this device is very
promising
yet original in its own right however
there are some mentioning is worth
noting in regards to this $550 tablet
now Alby --it this tablet having the
latest and fastest processors Samsung
itself has the offer I'd once in a while
notice a not so smooth transition
between apps and the homepage though
certain screen actions you can see a
slight stutter causing it just to give
this not so smooth transition another
perfect example is when you're opening
up the air command menu and in brief
hold is present or even just using some
of the camera features there is always a
slight delay involved which is not
detrimental but it was noticeable and
kind of a slight letdown considering how
powerful this machine is a second that
imitation leather on the back of the
Samsung really kills it I rather see
them put the same texture they use on
the Kindle Fires or the nook HD pluses
it's kind of like a rubber / silicone
like material that feels somewhat
sophisticated in your hands but more
importantly it doesn't slip out of your
palm and I can care less about the all
aluminum body that Apple has and I
personally own an iPad - so I'm not a
iPad fanboy or anything like that or
anything but try not be biased and
lastly the price is up there though for
some folks it might be a little bit high
for a tablet again $550 just starting
out but yet again to stress the
importance this tablet has many features
that puts other tablets behind and
considering I've owned an iPad for
several years now the new iPad air has
arrived along with new tablets coming
out this season and this Samsung feels
as though it's lightyears ahead of them
and not only form and function such as
offering infrared micro SD card even
offering support for wireless AC
technology which is the newest Wi-Fi
standard but also ahead and software
with multitasking capabilities and some
original tricks like I don't having your
eyes away from the screen and the video
would pause etcetera so in my conclusion
it's a great tablet both physically and
software wise and I'll say yes it's
worth the money if you will intend on
using its features though so me
personally I'll be
I just love using the s-pen versus my
fingers my screen just stays relatively
clean for now so that's it for my review
I know it's a bit long but I hope this
review did help someone out there as
always I appreciate all the support if
there's anything I left out as a
