review room what I have here is one of
three bands Fitbit has introduced this
year and after that recall with the
Fitbit force this company in one way or
three ways in this case is making a huge
comeback
now the surge features built-in GPS
heart rate monitoring and notifications
to name a few features to be excited
about but of course how do they perform
so without further ado welcome to Jim's
review room out of the three bands
Fitbit offers the surge is the biggest
model some people may be accepting of
this considering the surge blurs the
lines of being a SmartWatch and an
activity band at the same time but when
placing this right next to the charge HR
I'll be honest it does seem quite large
but for my personal experience in
regards to aesthetics it doesn't look
bad at all once you personally see it
and actually wear it and without any
other comparisons now I don't have a
huge bill but to be honest with you it
didn't look awkward on me but of course
this is subjective and you can be the
judge for yourself now for the office
workers out there long-sleeve shirts
sadly do snag along the cuff now
depending on your style and fitments
this may be of a nuisance to you now the
one area that's more important though is
comfort now surprisingly this is very
comfortable
similar to the other Fitbit bands the
strap itself is very elastic which comes
in handy for anyone that's into
weightlifting or doing moderate amounts
of movements throughout their day now if
you look real quick at a stiffer
competitor like they now old Nike
FuelBand or the newer Microsoft band
it's completely solid and flexing the
wrist back does cause some discomfort as
you can see here while I'm doing
push-ups now getting deeper into its
physical build I have worn this nearly
24/7 and during my testing this screen
has yet to scratched from normal
day-to-day activities not even a fine
stretch that can tell now rotating to
the back here where the magic happens I
guess you can say again no scratch is
observed over the infrared light sensors
then I'll get into the heart rate
monitoring aspect a little bit later now
one of the biggest benefits of going
with a surge over the fitbit products
and some other competitors as well it's
rated at 5 atm meaning you can
go swimming with this now showering with
us and submerging it under shallow water
from my testing has been perfectly fine
now other bands most that are rated at
just one ATM are only splash and rain
resistant now of course read the
instruction manual or contact fitbit's
for more information but now going into
what the band can display and this is
where it gets really interesting it's a
very smooth and fluid touch screen
revealing your time with a radial dial
that shows how active you are during
that one hour swiping right reveals your
steps with a small horizontal bar going
across indicating how close you are to
achieving your daily goal the next
screen is your heartbeat in real time
next here is your estimated distance
traveled calories burn to follow flights
of stairs climbs and lasts it goes back
to the clock
and speaking of clocks here there's four
different phases that you can choose
from through the app here Flair is what
you've just seen here but the other
three orbit digital and analog or on
your screen no overall the displays
stays on all the time which is a huge
plus and I don't have to look down and
press a button to see what time it is
when I want to but I did notice though
if you are previously looking at other
data for example my calories burned the
watch doesn't automatically reset back
to the clock after a certain amount of
time so I would basically look down for
a quick glance for the clock or the time
here and I would catch myself needing to
go back to that screen by swiping or
pressing the menu button twice it's not
a big deal but I find myself doing this
quite often throughout the day trying to
see what time of day it is
overall the screen is very much readable
in all light situations even in direct
sunlight and also in very dim lighting
with a backlit screen that you would
activate now getting to its features
pressing the menu button once offers you
possibly the most popular exercise which
is running but first I want to scroll
write showing the exercise feature and
this reviews what other activities that
you can record right off of your wrist
ranging from my favorite here which is
weight lifting to workouts hiking being
on the elliptical spinning classes yoga
and even martial arts are on there now
each activity you select will record for
that category and be revealed on the app
now going back to running here real
quick to demonstrate once I tap on this
several more options are offered now
like performing a free run being on the
treadmill or running a lap and timing it
now I press the checkmark button on the
bottom right here and the built-in GPS
starts searching for its signal now
that's one of the biggest benefits of
the surge here as it doesn't rely on
your smartphone's gps but a built-in GPS
right on your wrist you don't basically
have to bring your phone along with you
and your run if you don't want to and
although i'm showing off running here
this screen will look identical to any
other exercise you perform on the search
press play and the timer starts and your
distance is revealed your pace is also
shown on the bottom here with other
useful information i'm scrolling through
for your convenience and once you're
finished press pause and then on the top
right here is a checkered icon to finish
your run or activity now i summary pops
up which you can pause or rewind this
video to watch over again with useful
information being displayed and that's
practically it but let's see how this
information is transferred into the app
how accurate is the heart rate
monitoring and how all this data can
help you in the long run now I get this
question a lot what is my favorite app
to use now if I had to rank them jawbone
is my first and most favorite with
Fitbit being a very very close second
and then in the you can say almost a
distant third or so is Garmin but Fitbit
again it's a very clean very simple
intuitive app to use starting with the
top here you have your steps heart rate
in real-time estimated distance calories
burned flights of stairs climbed in your
active minutes when you were moving more
vigorously but before proceeding further
down here each category I've mentioned
so far can be broken down for example I
click on steps and a nice bar chart is
revealed showing your last seven days of
performance now down below are your
actual numeric steps with a green star
to the right on days you've met or
surpassed your daily step goals but all
this data isn't worthwhile unless you
can compare yourself now tapping on the
chart allows you to compare data on a
weekly monthly and yearly basis that way
you can see if you're making progress or
not and as stated earlier the data
being revealed here is the same for all
the other metrics being measured
that's distance calories burned etc
which all had the same bar graph and
history chart shown now going into heart
rate tracking recently the charge HR my
testing showed the numbers to be
accurate but it was deemed a lagging
indicator when watching the numbers
record in real time the chest heart rate
monitor bipolar appear to present data
again in real-time much faster in
regards to the surge it's not as laggy
though but a similar matter as you'll
see in this video playing as shown on
your screen performing 100 jumping jacks
and some other random jumps towards the
end here you can see how the numbers
climbed again the chest heart rate
monitor here appears to work much faster
however in regards to accuracy I found
the surge was nearly identical to my
physical pulse when counted I place my
finger on the carotid artery on my neck
and it was closed within about five to
eight pulses each time I measured now I
also use the infrared measurement on my
phone in a different instance and again
the HR recording was accurate on another
device and as mentioned in the charge HR
video after a minute of cooldown all
indicators the polar chest strap
checking my physical pulse the
cross-referencing of other devices the
heart rate on the search is spot-on
across the board and at least within
tolerance to about 5 beats of each other
and for me being anal here and used
another branded chest heart rate monitor
and cross-reference with that and you
can see again here it was identical in
the video being shown so from what I can
personally gather I believe for an
entire run you'll have all your data
there at the end the calories burned the
distance ran based on GPS and again your
heart rates and all that data I would in
the end presume as being accurate now
during the run however it appears to be
about 40 seconds to a minute behind what
a chest strap is offering and one last
note here from just normal day-to-day
activities to working out the surge
retain a pulse reading almost the entire
time more so than the charge HR which
lost a connection here and there but
with all that information and going back
to the app here here's what it all looks
like you have a chart above with the
last
days of your resting heart rate a
horizontal timeline for each day which
is intriguing see as you can tell when
you fell asleep versus actually being up
and clicking on either one of these
lines you can obtain information on your
workout to determine how much time was
in the fat-burning zone or if you're in
cardio to strengthen that heart of yours
and what's great about the chart and why
there's an emphasis on resting heart
rate typically healthier people who do
train on a regular basis
they usually have lower resting heart
rates there's less effort for the heart
to pump blood when it's a healthy and
strong heart so in these charts here
hopefully over the months here you can
see your heart rates or resting heart
rate that is average go down but back to
the main page here for the avid runners
out there you can track your workouts by
using your phone's GPS as well when you
go for a jog enabling tracking will have
Fitbit record your trail on a map and
all it data associated with it but a
feature I really enjoy is if you have
any earbuds you can turn on audio cues
from the menu Fitbit will advise your
statistics at every minute or mile that
you choose the voice comes on over your
phone or earbuds and advises you your
distance time and even pace preventing
the need to stop and pull out your phone
now going back here on one screen the
data over time can be kept on your
calendar and reviewed for comparative
purposes but backing out here again to
the main page you can track your weight
by entering in your measurements daily
in addition if you have or aren't able
to measure your body fat percentage
Fitbit allows you to put this into the
app as well and record it over time and
like every chart on this app here you
can make comparisons on your previous
performance and see what's working for
you and what's not now moving on to the
next feature here sleep mode is very
accurate and spot-on with my test you
don't have to tell the band when you're
in bed as the search does and will
automatically do so for you now looking
at your sleep gives you a breakdown of
restful sleep versus not so restful
sleep and awoke in moments now the odd
part here it doesn't show you a daily
breakdown numerically below the graphic
as it did with the previously mentioned
data now the top right here allows you
to view your previous weeks months and
years once again and overall it's ok
Meishan but if you ever get to see
jawbone zap the sleeping detail is much
more detailed and easier to read now
backing all the way out again here a
food log is provided for calorie intake
by manually entering in your food now
although this feature is provided where
other bands don't it's not as deep or as
intuitive again as Jawbone's you can
type in your food for example I'm doing
here the Asiago sandwich from Panera
Bread one of my favorites which it does
find but once added it's lacking a lot
of information with jawbone it does the
same search but it answers in all of
your data like calories trans fat sugars
and salts just to name a few there not
to mention jawbone has the ability to
scan your packages UPC codes on the back
of the box or bag here and enter
information that way then using My
Fitness Pal the very popular food
locking app also appears to be easier
and accurate than using fitbit's though
and doing a bit of research it shows
Fitbit data is able to be transferred to
my Fitness Pal and a few other apps and
vice-versa and the very last health
aspect here is water intake which is
very important as I barely drink enough
water in a day you can get a mug or a
water bottle at a certain size and after
finishing each bottle click the login
button and this will keep a record for
you pretty simple and straightforward
but highly beneficial and now this leads
us to the non health aspects of the band
which sometimes makes or breaks a
purchase decision for some people
clicking on the top left provides
several options and settings to take
advantage of first up is friends
allowing you to add random people that
are also using Fitbit products and that
way you can compete and compare with
others with leaderboards and progress
reports it's one way to motivate people
when they see other people do well and a
friends option clearly is optional is
always a plus now next up here are
challenges activate one of these here
and challenge others and last are your
devices you have associated with this
phone and app again pretty much
self-explanatory and please feel free to
pause the video if I'm going through
these parts a little bit too faster if
you're interested in seeing them now
moving to the next area here and into
your settings basically is your profile
that you can change at will name age
weight height
with your units being able to change two
kilometers or kilograms for distance and
weight respectively and one feature here
that surprisingly many people ask are
the alarms more people use this than
what I anticipated with this alarm this
will suddenly wake you up by offering a
pretty strong vibration to your wrist
when it goes off now for the basics you
can set up a one-time alarm but more
beneficial for those who have a
consistent work schedule you can set up
which days for it to go off for example
the work days Monday through Fridays
here or you can just set it up just for
weekends only now it's always a great
feature to have when you don't want to
wake other people around you and now the
very last feature here is caller ID now
when someone calls in the phone number
will scroll through on your wrist here
prior to picking up another feature
which is not included on the charge or
the charge HR is notifications being
displayed on the band now when someone
taxes or messages you a brief indication
of the message shows for your
convenience the only thing that I did
not see here are push notifications from
other apps for example I have Dropcam
here in the house and when there's
motion detected I received a
notification on my phone but no
notification on the wrist now I don't
know if this is an issue or firmware
issue but it is I personally found it on
my particular unit here now it's the
same with Facebook and other
miscellaneous apps again I'm notified on
the phone but not on the wrist something
or somewhat odd in my opinion so overall
after testing this and wearing this
nearly non-stop Fitbit claims up to
seven days of battery life I personally
achieved six days and seven hours which
is still considered good and slightly
above the average here of five days for
other bands and recharging this from a
dead battery to fall takes one and a
half hours to complete via the supplied
USB charger so that's it for the review
here I know it's been quite long here
but this is a fully featured kind of
activity band so if you do like my work
here add me Jim's review room answer
Facebook Twitter Instagram or Google+ as
I normally post updates on items I'm
currently testing before I actually put
them on the website
and it's a great way to stop by and say
hi to me as well again this is Jimmy
with Jim's review room you guys take
care
you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
