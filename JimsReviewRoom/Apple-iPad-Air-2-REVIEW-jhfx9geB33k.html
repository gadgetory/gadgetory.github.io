room so last year when I reviewed the
iPad air it was the very first iPad
where I felt this is what an iPad should
have been it felt good in my hands the
removal of those big bezels on the sides
and just a more streamlined look and
feel overall to the device and not to
mention performance as well but before I
get any deeper into this review don't
think I like apple or am against it for
mentioning its pros and cons and of
course Apple has its fair share of both
I'll be looking at this objectively and
hopefully help a viewer out there that's
on the fence of buying an iPad in
general so that being said welcome to
another review
as always going over its physical bill
first this looks identical to last
year's model when looking at the front
and the back it's the same dimensions
the same size bezels same screen size at
nine point seven inches but differences
are more in feel and function now the
heirto is now the thinnest tablet in the
world at 6.1 millimeters beating these
samsung tempests and also the sony
xperia z3 tablets which were six point
six and six point four millimeters
respectively now from my experience
playing around with the finished tablet
in the world at first it feels great in
the hands as it's something you've never
felt as thin before but then when
carrying this around there is a slight
subconscious that you might drop this
since there isn't much to hold but over
time though you do grow to appreciate
the fitness and grow in confidence that
it won't slip now the physical build is
still aluminum with chamfered metal
edges and it's even lighter than last
year's coming in a little under a pound
now managing the device from switching
hands to pleasant in your bag taking it
in and out it gives a sense of airiness
due to its thinness and lightness and
there's no pun intended there now when
placing the iPad air from last year's
down it feels like a tablet obviously
but when placing the heirto onto a table
that feeling it just feels like a thin
hardcover children's book and goes not
the best analogy but it's a sense that
you get light thin and used with ease
now going to the top you have your 3.5
millimeter headphone inputs to the right
the rotation lock button is no longer
found but just vibe rocker buttons now
Apple has now milled the aluminum giving
a slightly more premium look and feel
when compared to all the previous
generations buttons are still clicking
with a good amount of feedback and going
to the very bottom offers the Lightning
port connection with two speakers on
either side and a friendly reminder for
those who haven't owned an Apple product
recently Apple uses its own proprietary
connection getting all these micro USB
cables laying around your house you can
use it to charge this device you're
stuck with that one cable that's
supplied by Apple unless you buy more or
you're fine with moving this one cable
around the house now sound output is
good for a tablet for just personal
listening but the location is
the problem as it is covered by your
hands when holding it horizontally and
watching movies or videos on YouTube now
the sound appears to be slightly louder
than last year's model but it's very
hard to tell
even when putting them side-by-side and
alternating between both iPads and the
last side which is the left side here
has nothing to speak of now starting
with the front ample now for the first
time on their iPads offer touch ID to
place your thumb on the reader and now
it can unlock the iPad from the lock
screen or purchase apps from the app
store saving you the convenience of
entering your password every time now
from my experience it works very well
and I encountered barely any issues with
the security feature but for logging
into your iPad yes a fingerprint is more
secure as it is unique to yourself but
one can simply slide the screen to the
left here and enter your chosen password
if they knew it but nonetheless there
are definite uses though again for
making app purchases and that's where
it's convenient and the last feature
before I go into the screen is the
camera now I know a lot of people don't
take photos with their tablets as it's
huge to hold in public and most people
do have smartphones nowadays anyways but
just on the off chance you need to use
it here are some photos from the new
rear-facing camera and when compared to
other tablets Apple is very much on the
low end in regards to megapixel size now
if you're looking for huge photos for
editing an alternative will offer much
higher resolutions but to be honest the
average consumer won't be doing that at
least that's my opinion if you're just
uploading to Instagram or Facebook etc
just sharing photos like that 8
megapixels offered by Apple is surely
enough but looking at the photos on
screen low-light performance is still
not that great with noise being present
colors are more neutral you can say some
may say it looks more natural which they
prefer some may say it looks a little
bit lackluster and not as vibrant as one
would like and I'll leave that up to you
guys to decide all these pictures shown
here are unedited I didn't do any
retouching or anything like that but
what's more intriguing is a few new
features from Apple in regards to video
recording now first up here is
claps set your iPad stationary set the
time lapse mode to on and you can record
as much footage as you have in memory
it's ideal for videographers providing
that unique style or look for some of
their shots and it performs very well
the video quality is by no means like a
DSLR but the functionality of time
limits is there the last feature for the
rear facing camera is it's 120 frames
per second recording it's the slow-mo
option offering another unique style a
welcome addition and I'm personally
pleased to have it but I'm somewhat
disappointed as the iPhone 6 that was
recently launched has 240 frames per
second recording offering even a slower
video offering a bit more Wow and its
content but as you can see on your
screen are some samples right from the
iPad itself with no color grading or
video editing and the 120 frames per
second is only recorded in 720p
resolution is not recorded in full HD at
1080p and one other item again
introduced on the iPhone 6 but didn't
make it onto the iPad is image
stabilization and I think this is a huge
one here since we have some new video
recording features which is just
completely odd to me considering that
the iPad is technically more powerful
and again the iPhone 6 has it so shaky
hands and shaky video will be evident at
this camera again for the lack of image
stabilization overall this is the best
camera to be honest with you that Apple
has to offer so far with some unique
features but enough fine cameras here
how about the screen
Appl states this is the first tablet to
offer this unique anti-glare screen
technology reducing glare by 51% making
this the world's least reflective tablet
and by bringing this outside it's pretty
accurate
again it's a 51% reduction so you still
see some reflections of course but as
you can see in the video when compared
or paired next to the arrow one it's not
as glaring it actually works in works
better indoors as well and if this is
truly the only tablet on the market
right now they can do this more points
to Apple but overall the screen is still
the same resolution at 2048 by 1536
coming in at a pixel density of 264 for
every square inch and the screen now I'm
pretty sure that you're aware now Apple
is not much in the battle over specs
anymore with other manufacturers and
that rings true for the resolution but
when it did a bit more research on other
mainstream 10-inch tablets the air tube
pixel density is not too bad
the only other notable tablets are the
Samsung Galaxy Note pro series and if
you want to count the Nexus 9 which is
technically smaller comes in the same
exact resolution as the air 2 but
because it's smaller it has a pixel
density of 288 per square inch now
overall the screen still looks good I
personally prefer Samsung's more
saturated and contrasting looks but
Apple does offer a more neutral and to
be honest slightly more accurate color
palette depending on your taste you
might say it looks washed out a bit or
you may say it's natural and again
accurate I think this area is a little
bit more subjective so I'll let you guys
decide but as for these screens glass
there's a new laminated process fusing
what used to be three separate layers
into one layer of glass now now Apple
claims to have better contrast and
clarity because of that and from my test
putting this side by side the screen
does offer whiter whites versus a slight
tint at last year's model colors are
slightly richer in my opinion after
looking at many high resolution photos
and playing Netflix side-by-side and
also some YouTube videos as well the
physical bezels look darker and even
pressing on the heirto versus last
year's air it feels more like glass
making last year's model feel a little
bit more
plastic-like you can say when I press
down now all the items mentioned above
to be honest you will more than likely
not notice unless you put this side by
side with another tablet nonetheless
right next to an iPad air but it's
something that I did notice and want to
point out since Apple is claiming this
is new technology they're putting into
their iPads now as for performance apple
claims they're a 8x processor is 40%
faster than its a7 chip as this time
around the internals features a
second-generation 64-bit tri core
processor running at 1.5 gigahertz and
now with double the RAM at 2 gigabytes a
first for Apple now for real-world
performance indeed there is an
improvement with even fewer stutters
experienced overall it's still in my
opinion a very zippy and fast experience
overall
but when compared to last year's model
it's only a nominal increase in power
trying both side-by-side
sometimes the a7 completed the tasks
faster sometimes the a8x loading really
basic applications but very popular ones
like Facebook Pandora Netflix Google
Earth to name a few
they both performs a very similar the
most did a apps and tasks performed fine
for specific websites several viewers
asked me to pull up the verge as their
website is supposedly slow to load at
times I did notice this it is apparent
but when compared to the air from last
year it makes this year's model look a
little bit better again its nominal now
visiting random sites from Digg calm
some stutters but slightly better
performance again on the air - and now
for the first time ever Apple has now
included two gigs of RAM versus just one
they've been using for so long and you
do notice the iPad can keep up a bit
better with several more internet tabs
open in the web pages Scrolls almost
flawlessly in general and regarding
performance from the operating system of
iOS 8 - using apps and surfing more
intensive websites it's still a champ
and I still consider this a very fluid
experience in some last mentionable
features this year now includes Apple
pay but this is only limited to in-app
purchases now I'm not suggesting to take
your tablet and use Apple pay at a
register but Apple pay does require NFC
or near field communications and
although this tablet has been broken
down and shown online in pictures Apple
did include a NFC chip inside however
NFC is not in
labeled you there's no way that you can
connect this to any Bluetooth speakers
or any kind of NFC devices for
communication or pairing as well
now this isn't available as well on the
iPhone 6 but at least NFC is at least
confirmed working but on the tablet
again it's not available now regarding
new wireless radio the air 2 now
features wireless AC technology which is
the latest and fastest on network Wi-Fi
communication and last is its battery
life with Apple claiming up to 10 hours
of news which leaves me a little bit
skeptical since everything has been
shrunken down including the battery as
well and I just hope that with the more
efficient processor it can keep that 10
hour battery life but with my testing
here using the tablet all day running
Pandora when I'm not using it with
random web surfing in between and
playing to movies and Netflix the
battery died in 9 hours and 18 minutes
to be exact and no other reviewers may
have a little bit lower numbers but that
was actually my numbers that's what I
actually recorded so overall the iPad
air 2 is for sure an upgrade if your
current iPad is a bit old and if you're
deciding to stay with Apple no question
this is worth the upgrade if you
currently have last year's air I don't
think it's worth a jump over just yet
and for the Android users out there I
don't think the air 2 is the end-all
be-all tablet it's still a very good
device with great build no question
about that a very optimized and fluid
user experience for the average consumer
but as many Android users States Apple
has found a bit behind in innovation
despite offering anti-glare screen the
120 frames per second and being the
thinnest tablet in the world although
out very much a bit it's all impressive
I don't think it's the must-have
features for the average consumers I
would have still loved multi-window
image stabilization and I think it's a
must now maybe Apple should have made
the tablet six and a half millimeters
thick instead of going thinner actually
and kept it on par with the competition
but now offer maybe 11 hours of battery
life if not more all those features just
mentioned I believe is what the average
consumer would use on a daily basis and
Android already has some of those
features so I hope this review helped
you in some way if you enjoyed my work
