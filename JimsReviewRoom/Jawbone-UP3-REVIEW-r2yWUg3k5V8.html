press release way back in November of
2014
today on job One's website that's
claiming to be the world's most advanced
activity tracker offering multi-platform
sensors including a new accelerometer a
bio impedance sensor to measure heart
rates and more on that a little bit
later skin and ambient temperature
readings and the list goes on now it
wasn't until recently that the up three
is available for the general public now
I've put all those fancy words aside and
really see how this fits our lifestyle
in the real world that is what I want to
do is put all those pros and cons away
from what we heard so far and that's all
those delays all that hype and we'll get
down to what is truly available today I
have been talking with internal members
of jawbone to gain a better
understanding and addressing some of the
issues I'm sure we all have questions
about especially the heart rate readings
now as always visit my website for
reviews on activity band and other
consumer products I'm Jimmy wood Jim's
review room comm and I'm here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review
going over the physical features first
if you read or watch my job on up to
review the band is almost identical it's
offering very smooth with hypoallergenic
TPU rubber now on the inside of the band
are your sensing electrodes and besides
the casing up top this is the only thing
that's different from the up two and I
have a section dedicated to heart rate
tracking and the sensors later in this
review but regarding the band it's a
very subtle look very narrow it is a one
size that fits all and it's really easy
to wear even with long sleeve shirts now
regarding comfort the up to is
comfortable to wear right out of the box
the addition of sensors on the up three
however made for a slightly
uncomfortable first couple of days now
since the sensors do create a slightly
firm contact point this did leave some
red marks or right on my wrists Goblin
says to wear this not tight but snugged
and by doing so it did cause some
discomfort ever so slightly now
loosening this did help and the sensors
are still reading my pulse and steps
accurately and today and for the rest of
the month wearing it at a more
comfortable level despite leaving these
indentations in the skin here there's no
more discomfort for me so be mindful
your experience may vary now regarding
the class pier just like in the up to
that loops through the bottom and slide
into a movable latch it works well for
adjusting to your wrist size but because
it's not a true locking mechanism it's
really held on by tension actually the
clasp will undo itself if brushed
accidentally against your shirt or your
body again once you do wear the snug
then it stays on your wrist pretty well
they run after and the last physical
piece here the touch sensitivity I've
found to be fine for me and from my
experiences you tap twice to activate
the device and once it blinks you hold
your next touch and this will switch
between being awake or tell the band to
start tracking or sleep
the band also vibrates as a silent of
vibrating alarm to wake you up without
bothering or significant other or
roommate here and the vibrations can
remind you of any alerts that needs
noticing all set up through the app the
band will also vibrates giving you a
friendly reminder to get up and move if
you have been inactive for an hour or
more and again all those anfor mention
times can be adjusted which I'll show
you once we get into the software side
of things now this isn't necessarily a
flaw here but kind of a
down you can say since Javon did confirm
initially this would be wearable for
swimmers due to the manufacturing issues
jawbone has stated this is only splash
sweat and shower proof
you just can't submerge the band in
water and we're in this in the shower
proved perfectly fine in regards to
build quality but because of the water
hitting the touch surface the band does
go in and out of being active and in
sleep mode from time to time so with all
that being said here the most unbiased
and fair answer that I can provide here
the first several days when you do get
the band you're trying to find the right
fit meant you might find the tapping
cumbersome as well and the clasp may be
of an issue it's clearly not intuitive
right away and it's not so great for
first impressions but after giving it
some time the band does hold on the band
works of course here and the band is
then comfortable it honestly just takes
time which is kind of tough as products
for the average consumer should be able
to be picked up and used right away but
let's get away from the physical band
here and start looking into what I think
is one of the best all-around activity
apps available and also get into the HR
stuff as well here's the jawbone app and
what it has to offer
the main page consists of two main tabs
purple is for sleeping and orange is for
steps the green one that I have here is
if you decide to log in your food intake
which I'll show you shortly but starting
with sleep the up three provides more
data than any other jawbone product at
the time there's moments that you've
been awake to REM sleep light sleep and
last is deep sleep now on the up to
model only light sleep and sound sleep
are available a sound sleeper jawbone is
associated when the body is particularly
still now after consulting with jawbone
and how they up three works they advise
it's not just movements that they're
relying on but as you guessed it the
heart rate monitoring throughout the
night that differentiates when you're in
REM sleep versus deep sleep now the
other area is resting heart rate now
when I spoke with jawbone asking why
resting heart rate was the focus they
informed me resting heart rate is the
best indicator of overall health the
healthier you are the lower resting
heart rate that you'll have some
athletes have them as low as 45 beats
per minute which is crazy to believe the
resting heart rate is automatically
taken right before you get up before any
stress is introduced to your heart
that's before taking any caffeine before
you start interacting with the kids or
maybe before you're reminded to get to
work so with all that being said there
is for sure value behind a resting heart
rate reading and / even the Mayo Clinic
here a lower heart rate at rest
generally means a more efficient heart
and better cardiovascular health I want
to ask job on why not real-time HR
monitoring and here's the big answer I'm
sure not anyone else to probably answer
this as of yet but it did disclose to me
that is for sure coming in a firmware
update now as to when they say they
could not tell me at that time so that's
something to look out for and you heard
it here first
but getting out of here and looking at
my steps now don't mind my numbers I
work in my office in studio most of the
day so I am no athlete by any means but
it has an easy-to-read bar graph up top
with numeric data on the bottom here
differentiating times you are active
versus being idle and if you had gone
for a workout you can log it in
afterwards when you're done by tapping
the plus sign up top and selecting the
many
you can label your workout as there's
running weights yoga tennis and if it
doesn't happen to be in there you can
always select others right at the end
and label it to whatever you'd like at
that time
below is your self-proclaimed effort
level with the time and duration that
you would enter in manually but now I'm
backing out to the main homepage and
this is one area that really does make
the up to and up three very much
different from most other bands at the
market over time wearing this band it
learns your sleep patterns your daily
movements and the more you log in your
workouts and food intake the band will
create a unique profile for you it
unfortunately takes about three weeks
per job on that is until the band has
enough data where the band will start
recognizing your habits and what I'm
talking about is smart coach now in the
beginning the app will give you really
generic pointers but after some time
when data is collected for me with sleep
here it started suggesting to sleep at a
specific time based on my previous
night's performances now with data
showing I'm not achieving as much RAM or
deep sleep it would suggest to me
basically take a nighttime shower to
help cool my core temperature down in
turn helping my body create that signal
to become drowsy and there's supposedly
some kind of science behind that the per
jawbone but same thing with food logging
suggesting foods that I need to eat
after it sees my overall health eating
habits which per jawbone wasn't
compassed so overtime smart coach will
learn you basically and give you
personalized feedback and overtime for
example if you normally run let's say
the band will learn your motions and on
the next run if it senses similar
motions again the band the app can
basically tell that you just ran a run
here and you don't have to manually
enter it in but now moving on to the
rest of the app food logging is done
from the home page here with the plus
sign you can also input your mood and
manually enter in your way to keep track
of that you can also manually input your
sleep here if you were to ever forget to
put your band into sleep mode prior to
knocking out and I'm curious to know if
this will ever sense me sleeping without
going into sleep mode in the future so
we'll see about that
but food logging you can scan your food
packages or manually type them in and
once you've done so a food score is
present on the homepage and tapping at
each one here will give you your total
intake
fiber calories fats sugars and proteins
as you can see on your screen while
backing up once more here to the home
page and tapping the band icon provides
information on how much better you have
remaining and jawbone does claim up to
seven days of use and I personally timed
it and now is personally able to achieve
7 days 9 hours and 53 minutes now
continuing down the list of features
here activating sleep mode from the
phone here a stopwatch feature to
segment your workouts manually instead
of doing your workouts and afterwards
labeling it as I described earlier in
the video sadly it's not a real clock or
traditional stopwatch that displays a
number next here is a smart alarm offer
waking you up at the most optimal time
within a 30-minute window prior to the
actual set time so what this all means
basically the smart alarm is meant to
wake you up when you're not in deep
sleep preventing you from waking up
groggy or irritated from a deep slumber
now next is idle alarm where the band
vibrates at your set interval of
inactivity
it's again a friendly reminder to get up
and move the activity alert vibrates
your band and gives you a notice on your
phone when you achieve certain
milestones for that day you can set this
up to vibrate everything 1,000 steps and
so on or have a summary provided to your
phone at a set time and now the last
option here is reminders again vibrating
your wrist and displaying a notification
on your phone of a note that you would
have manually entered in previously
through the app now going through the
far left side here are your other
options there's your goals that you can
basically adjust you can aim to sleep 8
hours at night and also move how many
steps you will try to achieve basically
on a daily basis but trends is the other
option it's a great tool allowing you to
compare one metric versus another for
example compare your total steps versus
your total sleep and you see basically
if there's any kind of correlation
obviously you can compare the total
amount of calories consumed with how
many steps you've taken so far over time
and see if you need a catch-up and any
exercise that you need doing now backing
out and going into team you can add in
basically random online friends or
friends that you personally know that
has a band as well you can compare and
compete with each other and as you've
seen on my home page you can see Jenny's
information shows up on there as well
and it does kind of motivate me to be
more active as she is and those days
when I'm kind of
lacking and you can firmly set up a duel
as well challenging one of your friends
to a step challenge here for as long as
24 hours three days and even up to a
week and the very last feature here the
up application does sync it's data with
other very popular apps like
MyFitnessPal RunKeeper Strava and the
likes so that's it for my review I know
that was a lot of information there and
I can really see where jumbling did
really well in some areas while others
fans were really let down and I believe
a lot of fans were waiting on real-time
HR tracking like those found on the
fitbit products swimming was also taken
away and the band not fitting on some
people as they would have liked so I
believe if you dig much deeper into
jawbone and its app then you really do
start seeing the benefits there but
that's the question though how far is
the average consumer willing to dig and
accept overtime for the band to work for
them that is so let me know your
thoughts in the comment section below if
you can help support what I do here stop
by and take a look at Jim's review room
comm for more content and other reviews
that I actually don't put on YouTube and
add me on to Facebook Twitter Instagram
or Google+ and you get to see behind the
scenes info and you can always stop by
and say hi as well again I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room comm you guys take
care and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
