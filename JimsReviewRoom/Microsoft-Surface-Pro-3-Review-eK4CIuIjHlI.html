review room welcome to another review
now been waiting a while for this it's
the brand new marker soft surface pro 3
the model I personally bought here is
the i5 processor with 128 gigs of hard
drive space prices are on your screen
and are up to date as of this video and
I'll admit it's somewhat on the pricey
side compared to traditional laptops for
fun experience and features unlike a
laptop it might be worth it so without
further adieu we'll get started
when Microsoft released their surface
pro 2 barely any physical changes were
made from its first iteration but for
the surface pro 3 finally we start
seeing some real improvements the screen
gets bigger growing to 12 inches and
overall dimensions of course has
increased as well as noted on your
screen but what's more favorable is the
actual thickness going from a half an
inch 2.36 inches this year it's really a
comfortable thickness when holding and
can be really appreciated after you've
owned the previous generations and it's
not so thin where it gets a bit tough
clamping the device in your hands and in
regards to weight it's bigger but yet
lighter added much more reasonable 1.8
pounds and to put this into perspective
Samsung's biggest tablet the Galaxy Note
12-inch weighs in at 1 point 6 pounds
and that's a tablet not a hybrid like
Microsoft now going over the border of a
surface pro 3 the top left has your
power button then moving to the right
side includes a mini DisplayPort USB 3.0
charging ports in somewhat behind the
built-in stand is a micro SD card slot
which is a huge benefit for expanding
memory and transferring files now
rotating to the left includes simply
your three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone port in volume rocker buttons
and on the bottom is your connection
ports to any accessories that you
purchase such as a docking station or in
my case I'm using the physically
connecting keyboard the connections are
still very clicky and strong attaching
to the base of the surface pro and yes
you can actually use your old keyboard
from the previous generations but not as
a screen cover due to its increased size
and now regarding the kickstand
mentioned earlier it's a bit more
refined compared to last year's ice with
a pull out with now the ability to tilt
the hybrid to a friendly typing angle
and stopping Midway as possible as well
with enough friction and the hinges to
keep the tablet angled and the last item
before going into performance and it's
screen is the integrated front-facing
speakers and they're so discretely
incorporated that they're almost missed
in person and despite Microsoft losing
these speakers having Dolby sound they
still performs like stereo speakers they
do perform good and does differentiate
left and right channels from time to
time but nothing more immersive
is to be expected overall the physical
aspect hasn't been nothing but positive
when compared to the previous
generations and when compared to premium
tablets surprisingly the surface pro is
up there this has a built-in stand and
can fold like the Lenovo yoga tablet it
also has the front-facing speakers which
I do prefer and the build quality is
top-notch it also comes with a stylus
pen which is similar to that of a
Samsung Note product lines so you can
say it has the best of each tablets into
one form factor
but now moving to the screen and
internals this year's model as stated
before goes to a 12 inch display which I
think for productivity works well the
resolution comes in at 21 60 by 1440
which gives a 216 pixel density the more
pixels packed in every inch though
clearer and sharper text and images will
be and at just 8 more negligible pixels
per inch which isn't much compared to
last year's model it's not much of a
difference and considering the new
standard these days for tablets is
getting closer to the 300 pixels per
inch range if not with some already
there this resolution is still better
though however than most laptops on the
market today but numbers of one thing in
real-world experiences or another now
using the screen was still a very
enjoyable experience
despite the PPI is being slightly on the
low end it's still very sharp in my
opinion black levels are very good but
color saturation and contrast is not as
deep to make images and the display
itself really pop the display still
looks much better compared to the
previous generations but wasn't up to
par with some of the other competitors
out there and one note I wanted to make
using Internet Explorer is clear in the
display text versus using Chrome an odd
phenomenon that I couldn't figure out
why even when I zoomed in on the Chrome
web browser still the same results so if
you're a dedicated chrome user like I am
just be aware and the last note I wanted
to mention the aspect ratio has changed
from a 16 by 9 widescreen to a taller
and not as wide 3 to 2 aspect ratio a
screen is a bit more square with this
configuration but again I think it's
better or with more vertical room for
productivity and giving more of that
laptop experience you can say now moving
into its performance the specifications
are listed on screen indicating the
latest fourth generation Intel processor
is being used again I have my hands on
the i5 model which is right in the
middle of the road of the i3 and i7 just
try to give you a gauge of what you
might be looking for for the time being
anything and everything an average
consumer to a Productivity heavy user
ran perfectly fine from web browsing to
multiple applications open at the same
time this thing ran without any
shoes and because this has the benefit
of Windows 8 built-in programs like
Microsoft Word can be installed in games
as well but playing SimCity Lauren the
graphics settings pretty low
only then yielded a smooth experience
however less computer demanding games
like those found in the Windows Store
will run perfectly fine and although my
channel isn't focused too much on the
technicals but more for the average
consumer the benchmarks are now shown on
your screen now when the system is under
load it does still get warm on the rear
and then a fan does kick on which isn't
too loud in my opinion the heat is now
more concentrated on the upper right
side if you're looking at the hybrid
screen now this does run cooler but
again it does get warm back there now
other notable features the surface pro
has is wireless AC which is the latest
and newest standard for Wi-Fi
connections slowly being adopted it also
has bluetooth 4.0 and free online cloud
storage through Microsoft onedrive and
just this week marks off has bumped up
the free storage from 7 gigs to now a
competitive 15 gigs of cloud storage for
your photos documents and PC settings in
regards to better life Microsoft claims
up to nine hours of web browser news and
from my test leaving brightness on at
50% so we can get a standard base to
work off of here performing all those
benchmark tasks played a graphically
intense game SimCity in this case for
about 20 minutes or so watched a movie
on Netflix played several 7 minute long
YouTube videos and the rest was surfing
the internet total time I personally
achieved is 6 hours and 32 minutes into
the unit powered down itself from a full
charge now I wanted to touch base on
this applied stylus pen as an extension
to the user experience with one click on
top of the pen automatically bringing up
the amp OneNote where you can hand write
notes clip images you find on the
internet and save these notes to the
cloud where it's then accessible on the
PC at home at work on your smartphone
and over the Internet of course the
button on the pen offers you to erase
your handwritten notes by holding down
button 1 and then swiping over the
previously written words and holding
down button 2 offers right-clicking like
you would from a normal Mouse and using
this to handwrite notes it doesn't feel
as natural as a Samsung tablets are
view previously but performing my test
the hand recognition and my actual
handwriting on a sheet of paper is
pretty similar which means Microsoft did
very well I think it's just the screen
material or a very minut delay when
writing and seeing my words show on
screen that throws me slightly off and I
know I don't have the best handwriting
in the world but the Penton can being
used to navigate through your desktop
and web pages which is a plus but the
only issue that I found the pen does
require batteries which are supplied but
when they do run out that you have to
run to the store and get them and lastly
there's no place to stow the pen along
with the surface which means you have to
keep it in your pocket or hold it in
your hands if you don't have a bag
something just to be aware about though
but regarding the keyboard which is sold
separately for another hundred and
twenty nine dollars it is a worthy
purchase to really achieve that full
laptop experience to me it is expensive
but the quality is well-built and serves
as a cover or lid as well the top in the
rear doesn't appear to be lined with a
silicon texture anymore but it feels
more like a subtle and sophisticated
felt and not only a full-size keyboard
but a trackpad is also built-in and
works perfectly fine the magnet that
connects this is as strong as the models
beforehand and one of the biggest
benefits that may justify its price
is the backlit keyboard your keys are
not lit up white so it does make it
easier to see in low-light situations
and since the type lid is slightly
bigger and a stain on the back of the
surface is now adjustable typing this on
your lap isn't much of a nuisance as it
once was
it's actually quite doable and for those
who never owned or use a surface pro
before it's very snappy and fast in use
the interface is Windows 8.1 which is
practically identical if you have a
computer or laptop running the ESET
operating system now several shortcuts
you have are swiping from the right
provides some quick fire options and
scrolling from the left in allows you to
switch apps on the fly and toggling
between live tiles and the traditional
Windows desktop can be done on either
the windows key on the keyboard or by
typing the same icon found on the screen
and while in live tiles you can scroll
up and this will reveal every app that
you have which can be dragged into your
main area for easy viewing and again the
allure of the surface pro models from
past to the present model here they're
able to run window
and you can install programs just like
you normally would with any laptop or
desktop so with that being said from my
review and testing I truly believe we
finally hit a surface pro that's founded
the group you can say it does a great
job learn the lines of a high-end tablet
and a laptop and if you have the money
shell outs you want this form factor for
productivity and portability and I think
it's excellent for those office workers
and students and you truly need Windows
and not Android or iOS this is the two
and one bit you may be looking for this
particular model came in a little over
1,200 dollars after taxes with the tight
cover again pretty steep in my opinion
but that's for you to decide I hope this
review helped you in some way please
take your time to like and share this
video if you enjoyed it find me on
Facebook and Google+ and I'll see you on
the next one this is Jimmy with Jim's
