Jimmy with Jim's review room with new
smartphones on the way we're talking
about these Samsung new eighths the
iPhone 8 Google pixel XL to Motorola
gets a jump start by offering their
flagship the z2 force like last year's
model motorola banks on providing a
modular design by offering their lineup
of moto mods they're magnetized
attachments that further extends the
capabilities of your phone we'll see how
they do along with today's Motorola z2
force I received as a loaner from the
lovely folks at AT&amp;amp;T as of this video
motorola has the phone going for seven
hundred and twenty dollars and it comes
with a free projector mod if you're here
in the States
check out a teensy calm or there are
local stores for the latest prices so
without further adieu I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room and I'm here to help
you make that purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review
going over the physical features first
the z2 force is crazy thin from the
factory you get a little bulge from the
camera but it's wide enough to prevent
the phone from rocking on the table just
like the Moto z2 play I reviewed about
two weeks ago the phone is quite
slippery
there's moto mods you can attach that
does completely fix this matter but I'll
show you those later in the review the
phone is splash proof it's not
waterproof though I personally test this
hex identity with air quotes around
accidentally here spelling a cup of
water on it and a z2 force is still
functioning fine now one the biggest
perks about the z2 force is its
shatterproof display drop it and it
should survive now one of the biggest
flaws though that seriously deters me
from possibly buying because of these
super soft plastic like shatterproof
screen which you might be able to tell
on camera here it scratches very easily
when we went out to film the scenes
you've seen so far I left his phone in
my bag along with the moto mods and
after about two hours of walking around
I found the phone scratch no other
review sites are experiencing the same
thing and it's very unfortunate as I've
carried numerous other phones here over
the years in the same bag with charging
cables my mouse other miscellaneous
items and rarely if ever do I get a
scratch now I can run my fingernail
along every other phone and have no
issues I run my nail along the z2 force
and it's intense crazy I know
and sadly the market doesn't go away now
if you're the type of guy that puts the
phone into their bag or maybe the ladies
out there who puts it into their purse
you gotta be careful by going around the
physical features your sim in micro SD
card reader is up top we're chatting to
the right there's a volume rocker
buttons with power below and the all
three buttons work quite small and very
similar to each other it does take a
little bit of time to build up muscle
memory now on the bottom I have no idea
why here but the premium z2 force
removes the three F millimeter input for
headphones and earphones while the mids
here z2 play gets one so in the middle
here is the USB type-c port for charging
better life is below average as well for
a flagship as I'm getting around five
and a half hours or six hours at most
for a screen on time
rotating to the rear this is where
things get really cool and possibly the
biggest reason why you would buy this
phone it's the moto mods you can buy
varies back
plates to attach for different functions
as I mentioned earlier the projector
comes free with your purchase and when I
first put this together I thought it was
small I thought it was gimmicky
I also didn't have the lights off in the
office but as soon as I dimmed
everything down wow this thing really
performed for the average consumer I
thought this had 720p out of the box and
expected the resolution to be more
pixelated or distorted it surely isn't
as sharp as a screen but once on the
wall and sitting back it doesn't look
bad
surprisingly it's only at 480 P now it's
able to play anything that's on your
screen from YouTube to playing games do
simply what you're surfing on their
internet it works now it's able to get
as big as 70 inches and if you're at a
funky angle there is a little kickstand
to prep this up now the few quirks here
the first time we tried using Netflix we
did get an error every time we use the
modem at projector if we took off the
projector it worked perfectly fine on
our phones on the second day of testing
them it works then Netflix had no issues
also if it was just a smidge brighter
this would display slightly better and
like all projectors they do get slightly
hot after using it for some time
also the projector does have its own
battery it doesn't kill your phone
thankfully here but playing a movie on
this during my testing I'm averaging
about 45 minutes to an hour worth of use
not enough for a full-length movie no
other motor BOTS and why the Moto Z line
is really cool here there's a JBL
bluetooth speaker you can't attach this
to to get better audio I set it in the Z
to play it does sound like a $50
Bluetooth speaker so it's nothing
special but it is better then each
speaker phone that you have on the
camera I also have a backplate that
gives you an extra day worth of battery
life also because of the texture it
gives the phone much better grip when
holding again there's more moto mods out
there if I don't have them all of course
but they're good quality in general but
getting back to the phone continue with
what is unique the moto options include
chopping the phone twice here to
activate the flashlights
two more chops to turn it off and
twisting the phones you turn on the
camera even if the phone is light now
both of these actions required a pretty
firm movement most likely to prevent
accidental actions when not intended and
the home button can be used as your
navigate
with swiping rights hit left and go back
on webpages and certain apps left to
right to access the menu features and to
lock the phone you just hold it until
it's slightly vibrates now sounds great
in theory but from my testing it's been
hit or miss there's moments where it
works in some moments where you're
swiping multiple times to execute now
looking at the camera we have a 12
megapixel shooter and the rear with dual
lenses this might be the only other
camera that I personally use that's as
fast or the closest to what these
Samsung cameras can do in regards to
auto focusing it's crazy fast nearly
instant as you can see on your screen
here they're very close going through
some samples everything was on auto mode
as most average consumers would use and
I'm really shocked here time and time
again I noticed more often than not the
Motorola did better than my samsung s A+
well generally Samsung shoot quite sharp
images but once I placed them
side-by-side then differences between a
Motorola and Samsung are noticeable the
z2 force also tends to push color and
saturation even further than the Samsung
S A+ from my comparison here and if I
had to critique the Motorola does tend
to push the blue tint on some areas
making the photo look a bit unnatural
though honestly if I didn't have the
photos side by side I don't think the
average consumer would notice you can
see again with some of these samples
here that I'm showing as for low-light
performance these are not pretty
pictures at all but I had taken photos
and very low light to stretch the
cameras performance now still doesn't
perform as well my samsung s A+ in ultra
low light areas I noticed the Motorola
would decrease sharpness significantly
to compensate for noise also it does
have trouble balancing bright light
sources and the low-light areas with
blowing out the color white in photos
now that's capable and the quality at
times isn't too far off but the Samsung
remain consistent every time in those
dark areas all right so enough about the
camera we've seen the unique features
from Motorola like the flashlight
turning on with a chop to twisting your
wrist or turn on the camera we've seen
the motor mounts which were very unique
but jumping over to phone use I'll place
these specs on your screen for your
convenience please pause the video if
you like the details the displayed comes
in at 5.5 inches with a 2560 by 1440
display the image
scrape the picture quality is sharp and
the colors do pop if you're not
comparing this to any other phone and
you're wanting to get this there's
nothing wrong with the display in my
opinion now for those who are dat picky
or a heavy into specs a side by side
again with my s8 plus this Samsung is
brighter and that helps a good bit and
making the image just pop out at you
also I noticed that there is of more of
an orange tint and warmer tones overall
with easy to force now as for
performance the z2 force has the same
processor that most other flagship
phones have that's a Snapdragon 835
phones these days
honestly performs well with nearly
everything you throw at it some games
may load faster than older processors
and some apps may load faster for you as
well but in general the z2 force
performs with no issues that I've
personally encountered so in the end
here I want you guys to comment down
below tell me what you think about this
film personally there's a lot of pros
but there's also some cons that I think
might deter some people from buying
again I'm Jimmy with Jim's reviewer and
I'm here to help you make that purchase
decision you guys take care and I'll see
you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
