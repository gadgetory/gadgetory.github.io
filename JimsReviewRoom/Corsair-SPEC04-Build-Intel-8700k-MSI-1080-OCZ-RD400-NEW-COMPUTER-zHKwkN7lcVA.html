want to share with you guys the new his
computer bill going over some of the
components and giving you my quick
impressions now I went with a smaller
case this time since all my previous
ones have been quite large
something lighter and more portable was
ideal now as always being transparent of
course here did hook me up with all the
Corsair practice to see in this video
the rest I had purchased personally
myself or was for my previous build that
a case is budget-friendly coming in at
just $60 this is the carbine series spec
0 4 from Corsair with a full paint of
tempered glass on the side and a front
has this uniquely angled design with
tons of air flow coming through it also
works as a dust filter being able to be
pulled off from the bottom now there's
another dust filter on the back at the
power supply unit but if your dust
conscious I notice the tempered glass
aesthetically does stick out a bit which
looks cool but it's not a fully sealed
system you can say so he can get some
dust in pretty easily now on the inside
there was a drive cage but I did remove
that to make way for the h1 10 i cpu
liquid cooler now I don't plan on
connecting multiple hard drives at the
moment since this would be strictly a
rendering machine and maybe we'll do
some light editing on this thing here
but for the time being the only hard
drive that have is the OCZ
Rd 400 and that too at one terabyte I
love this thing this has speeds up to
twenty six hundred megabytes per second
Reed and this one is prices heck coming
at $700 retail but the 512 gig metal
comes around 300 honestly the m-dot two
speeds are worth in my personal opinion
especially for those who are doing
productivity and extensive workloads now
I went with MSI this time never use
their products before so we'll see how
this one holds up but the motherboard is
the new Z 370 time off making these
compatible with the new 8th gen Intel
processors the board was priced around
$140 retail plus there's a rebate that's
going on right now at the moment to
bring it down to about a hundred and ten
now this isn't a flagship or the best of
the best here but the board was surely
enough for what we needed now the main
star of this build has got to go to the
8700 k i7 processor this is my first 6
core 12 thread CPU clocked at 3.2
gigahertz and I'm saying folks on
average getting 4.8 gigahertz
that's overclocked with some as highs
5.2 so we'll see you later this month
once we run this for a bit here and for
me to get a feeling of how the stock
settings perform and the very back I
went with a very practical 16 gigs of
DDR for Corsair Vengeance Ram and on the
bottom using the Corsair TX 650 M power
supply since the case was red and the
motherboard was from MSI as well
I bought the MSI GTX 1088 G now this has
the same red but also has the ability to
change colors to match them on the board
now with the combination of the Intel
8700 K and the 1080 this scrub through
4k videos and edited with zero issues
zero lag this thing was a beast at last
and that only for show these are the new
core sierra ll 120 case fans these are
quieter than my previous generation
model at idle the case is nearly silent
you can't even tell that this thing is
on under load there is a reasonable
amount of air being pushed so you can
hear somebody a wishing going on there
now last but not least I'm using the
case semi luxe RGB keyboard fully
aluminum very fast here at responsive
because of the Cherry MX keys and the
custom letting is one of the best
offering a variety of styles or patterns
to choose from now also I've been using
the M 65 FPS RGB Mouse from Corsair it's
been great but they're new glaive
competitive mouse offers extendable
thumb rest you can keep it flush if you
want then with the medium size you can
add a little bit more grip and make it
slightly more contoured and the last one
which I personally use the extra large
thumb rest gives a bit more confidence
when holding and gripping over the
Corsair M 65 fps and a center scroll
wheel look at this thing guys it looks
and feels like a fat tire right down the
middle sorry folks I just wanted to
share the new system with you real quick
here I want to do a micro ATX case in
the near future so be sure to comment
down below with some recommendations if
you guys have some for me for 2018 I'm
hoping to get the back into PC building
and a share it with you guys you give me
some feedback
that'd be great all right folks I'm
