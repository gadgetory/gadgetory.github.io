Under Armour didn't introduce just an
activity band to the market but a
complete health system the idea of
having an activity tracker a smart scale
and a chest heartrate monitor in one box
creates a truly holistic approach under
armours and it's really a genius idea
that other companies surprisingly
haven't offered in one complete official
package now the entire set cost four
hundred dollars which is up there I'll
admit that but I'll test and see if
there's value that justifies the price
tag you can purchase the UA band
separately for $180 these smart scale
also comes in at a very high price of a
hundred and eighty when you compare this
with other competitors and the chest
strap comes in at $80 which is
equivalent to the h7 chest strap from
polar and ten dollars more than the
Garmin model so without further ado my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
Jim's review room
going over the activity tracker first
the UA band is smooth it's comfortable
to wear and it offers a smaller
additional strap for those with smaller
wrists and although this utilizes snap
buns to hold the band in place while
working outs running and basic home
movements never did the band undo on me
now the only thing and I didn't mind
this at all though I could never get the
exact hose to ensure that it was a firm
fit the band for the most part was
always worn relaxed during over the
physical features there's just one
button on the band with good firm
feedback rotating to the rear there is a
heart rate reader
however it's not on 24/7 and it doesn't
track your heart rate while working out
that's what these supplied chest strap
is for however the band uses the sensor
to read your resting heart rate randomly
at night and you can track the results
in the app which I'll show you later now
during the time of me testing I did
notice a day or two where didn't read my
resting heart rate at all however it did
register my sleep for that particular
night so just being a lookout for that
the other feature the wrist HR sensor
provides is if you need to check your
heartbeat at any given time you can do
so from my testing it's been very
accurate and testing this against
several other products that's proven to
work well so and then despite not being
a risk a charm monitor at least Under
Armour gives you resting heart rate and
a chest strap for more accurate heart
rate readings during your workouts so
really in my opinion it's basically the
best of both worlds but last on the
inside there is a charging port for
Under Armour's proprietary cable and
early on finding the correct orientation
was a slight nuisance and the magnetic
connection itself is not as strong to
keep things staying in place again this
happened for the first time when I first
used the product but over time after a
small learning or habit curve you'll get
it right afterwards regarding better
life UA claims up to five days of life
from my test I achieved four days 22
hours in 34 minutes to be precise
compared to other bands on the market
and for those who are not aware most
activity bands on average lasts anywhere
from 5 to 7 days with a few with 14 days
of life and some even longer but again
the average is typically 5 to 7 days for
most trackers regarding recharging this
is very very impressive here from a dead
battery to 99% foam this had only taken
33 minutes but then it stayed at 99% and
reached a full 100% by a total of 55
minutes and 38 seconds either way the
battery recharging is still very
impressive
and less moving on to the screen and
what this has to offer the display
reminds me of the original garmin
vivosmart white LEDs a present
displaying your time first here swiping
right details your steps and a
percentage of how close you are to your
goal and pressing these small arrow to
the right or left here provides more
information like distance and another
tap details calories burned swiping
right one more time offers the amount of
sleep from the night prior with the
arrow allowing you to manually log in
your sleep
tapping right from the sleep screen
activates the HR reader as we discussed
earlier and then moving right one more
time allows you to track either running
cycling weightlifting or walking now
when you activate let's say running
since it's the most popular activity
here estimated pace is providing
calories burned distance ran and how
long you have been running for now if
you are wearing that chest strap your
beats per minute is displayed and moving
down one more time there's heart rate
zones which you can monitor now one of
the other features while you do have the
chest strap paired there's an additional
colored LED on the side of the band that
glows pretty nicely with different
colors indicating which heart rate zone
you're actually in back on the screen
and still accessible while in an
activity is your willpower Under Armour
gives you an idea of based on your
current performance and heart rate data
to detail how much intensity you're
currently putting into your workout now
backing out one more time you're back at
the main display tapping on the right
arrow once again you have media controls
which I confirmed works for the likes of
pandora iheartradio slacker radio and
other similar apps in pausing playing
and skipping songs still in the
additional options menu there is your
settings that confirms if your band is
paired you can adjust brightness from
settings of low medium to high and
during my testing and bright sunlight
outdoors here I do admit it is somewhat
hard to see even at the brightest
settings now indoors or out of direct
sunlight display isn't very much
readable going back to the additional
options menu airplane mode is available
in the option to turn off the band in
general going back to the main options
area the clock icon offers a calendar
detailing your events for today and
tomorrow and an alarm feature which
provides a silent vibrating alarm and
from my test in this feature here using
this every night this is indeed one of
these stronger vibrations that I've
experienced versus many other bands on
the market now the only caveat I can't
set this up to ring just Monday through
Friday or only certain days of the week
this will vibrate everyday unless you
turn it off moving back there is a
stopwatch
feature on the band which I know many
ask for and there is a countdown timer
included but backing out and finishing
up the display there is a battery
indicator and the last feature before I
forget to mention this is rated at 280 m
for water resistance in turn meaning
this is splash sweat and rain resistant
but actually you can't wear this while
swimming the last feature is the band's
ability to display text messages caller
ID and calendar notifications right on
the wrist the text messages do work but
sadly this doesn't display an entire
message to read like the garmin
vivosmart HR so that's it for the Under
Armour band let's make that transition
over to the Under Armour's smart scale
and see what that has to offer
looking at the scale omit this rumba
looking machine looks very nice
it's a beautiful glossy top a display is
very easy to read with bright LEDs and
from my testing across three other
scales it's as accurate as any other
digital scale with very minor variations
when you do those back-to-back
readings now this uses four triple-a
batteries which are included in the box
and they do go of course on the
underside of the scale now the features
besides reading your weight this can
differentiate up to eight different
people and record their weight into
their own Under Armor app this also has
Wi-Fi built in which works great step on
this and there's no need to pair it with
your phone the data is being directly to
Under Armor and then it comes to your
phone instantly that last is the scales
ability to use bio impedance basically
using a low passing current and this
basically can read your estimated body
fat so that's really it for the scale
here however as convenient and as
streamlined as it is if Under Armour
keeps it at the hundred and eighty
dollar price point this is seriously an
expensive scale considering Withings has
there's retail for $150 and can display
and measure everything mentioned so far
with Under Armour but it also includes
body mass index heart rate readings and
other miscellaneous features like local
weather and somehow it can read the air
quality in the room now granted weddings
doesn't have a strong ecosystem like
Under Armour is presenting in very less
of what comes in the box is the chest
strap chest straps has always been the
most accurate and consistent over time
regardless of what kind of brand that
you choose chart numbers shows my first
run and don't mind a slight dip on the
polar there as I adjusted the band while
running in that first minute but as you
can see with the data collected this
performed like any other chest strap
basically spot-on a second set of charts
the same thing with deviations maybe one
heartbeat from each other very very
close but now what I want to do is show
you the app experience is the data easy
to understand yet is the app exciting
enough to make you look at it and use
we'll find out so you a record is
available for both Apple and Android
devices on the main page you have a
wheel that resembles the smart scale
with steps on the top left and then
there's nutrition at the top right which
pairs and syncs with My Fitness Pal a
highly recommended app that I personally
use to track my food intake but oddly
this did not work on either one of my
Android phones however it was working
for my Apple device so just a heads up
on that
the bottom run is sleep tracking which
again is automated and accurate from the
time I started sleeping to the time that
I woke up and the bottom left is your
fitness goal and any progress that
you've made for that particular day
tapping down steps to show what this has
to offer here total steps is available
and compares into what you did to the
day prior your goal which you can adjust
here and as you can see on the bar graph
below I very much work at my desk most
of the day so there's not too much
activity but swiping down is total
distance and down even further our
trends which I absolutely love when apps
in general offers this kind of data but
not only is there a linear graph but
moving down your steps averages are
provided and you can get a great
baseline when you first start but
backing out nutrition is pretty basic
that's not too much information as most
of your breakdown of sugars fats and
proteins are tracked and even
MyFitnessPal app but at least it's on
here though and you get the basic math
that tells you how much calories you
have left to consume or how much you
went over now going back here bottom
right of the main screen sleep is
recorded with similar information up top
moving down as a bar graph which I was
hoping to be a little bit more detail
considering the job went up three can
provide some really deep analysis at a
similar price point for the band moving
further down and line graph giving you
an overall quick outlook for the week
which I absolutely love here and on the
very bottom is your resting heart rate -
which is very important as you can see
over time if your heart health is
improving with your daytime efforts last
is the fitness portion of the app which
surprisingly breaks down a good bit of
information at the top again very
similar to the other health aspects of
the app like duration a comparison with
the day prior your goal but moving down
further you receive your basics like
distance duration and calories burned
but I wish there was a bit more detail
for runners in general like pace
information and a trend on how we're
comparing today versus maybe a month
later or so unfortunately it's not here
now moving down however provides some
very good information though with heart
rate information from your workout and
seeing this easy-to-read bar chart you
can tell which areas where you were
focusing on either toning or fat burning
to heart health or heart training now
we're turning onto the main screen once
again moving down is the how do you fuel
bar here that you can change daily
but moving down again a nice chart
detailing your week's progress they can
overlay data and see if there's any kind
of correlation and further down on the
main page resting heart rate is shown
here now one thing I do admit with the
UI app despite this is really under
first time getting into an activity band
as you can see on screen the UAF pairs
with a lot of other services with a lot
of other competitor devices so to finish
this video here at first glance the
health box that seemed pretty basic but
after testing other armorer has a very
capable product but I can say for sure
it's nothing revolutionary I know many
will say it's not worth the price and I
agree with you guys from a consumer
standpoint and especially when I throw
up a chart like this on the screen now I
do have to give credit where credit is
due for what it offers it does great and
the app experience surprisingly offers a
lot of good data for a mid-range tracker
but most of the features seen are
offered on many other bands already it's
just under armour was able to put what
they think are the right ones or the
best ones together for the consumer and
truly this might be a perfect
combination of features for someone out
there but the price differences are
pretty staggering
now I'm sure when or if Under Armour
decides to lower its prices down a bit
or if they do somehow make a gps-enabled
band with a package like this I think
we'll have a lot more consumers onboard
