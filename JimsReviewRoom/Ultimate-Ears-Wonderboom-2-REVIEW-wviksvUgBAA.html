hey everyone welcome back to another
beautiful day on YouTube jumping right
into this one this is the Ultimate Ears
Wonder boom to claim to be super rugged
claim to be bigger and bass your audio
will see as always being upfront
Ultimate Ears this sent us in for review
however my assessment was not altered in
any way I'll be going over both pros and
cons this one retails for $99 and comes
with a two-year warranty
be sure to look in that video
description my affiliate links will be
down there for the most updated prices
in real time you never know when these
things can might go on sale
I'm Jimmy with Jim Sriram and I'm here
to help you guys make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
during all the physical features this
thing is indeed small and portable
weighing in at about 420 grams Ultimate
Ears at least in the past from my tests
have proved to be one of the most rugged
and durable speakers out there then one
of room two has that same water dusk and
drop proof claims as the last model a do
dissever quick drop test here and listen
to that impact dam that sounds horrible
but then bringing it back into my
apartment and placing this into water I
did confirm that it floats and shackling
after those tests after those drops
submerging it into water the speaker
barely leaves a scuff if anything that's
very minor indentation from probably
worth at the little pebble hit here
overall this speaker is still working
perfectly fine now check it out the bunt
up top they're simply bluetooth pairing
power and right in the center is pause
play in skipping forward fortunate you
can't go back on a song with this
rotating to the bottom and behind the
water-resistant flap here it's not USB C
but micro USB instead really see how to
see this on both ultimate ears and the
more reason so many speakers I just
reviewed since they're recently released
products this was a perfect time to
future-proof these things we don't get
that chance not a deal-breaker of course
the speakers of functions obviously but
was hoping the industry would have moved
forward together
there's also note 3 1/2 millimeter port
for physical audio connections either
I usually don't need that but maybe you
need it on your end the last button
which is on the underside is the outdoor
button which is unique as the icon of a
forest tree here but Ultimate Ears is
claiming this button does enable louder
and crisper sound it's a pre adjusted
equalizer meant for outdoors which I
would give you my verdict later now a
touching base and the internals I didn't
see a Bluetooth rating on their website
but Ultimate Ears did claim up to a
hundred feet worth of bluetooth
performance which is I mean very
high-end testing this around my
apartment I was able to get a full 100%
coverage no matter what corner I went to
around here I never lost connection the
connection never even stuttered the
signals going through several walls and
my apartment is about 1,100 square feet
for reference now testing this with
video audio played perfectly
fine on both YouTube and Netflix for
some reason on my iPhone YouTube was off
sync quite bad but Netflix on iPhones
works perfectly fine now last and I do
appreciate this you can pair up to two
devices at the same time to one of these
speakers no need to unpair it and then
repair through the new device when you
want to switch sources and last this
does have the ability to double up so
you can play to these speakers at the
same time Ultimate Ears improved on this
but now offering true stereo separation
you can hear left and right audio
channels the previous model only played
audio in sync which is still good but
this is even better of course alright
last but not least here is acclaimed up
to 13 hours of better life which is
improved from last models which is only
10 better than JBL is 12 our claim and
still better than Sony's XP 32 or 22
actually which claims 12 hours without
extra bass I tested this at 50% of I'm
like all my other Bluetooth speakers I
was able to get 14 hours in two minutes
which is really impressive alright folks
please put on your headphones or
earphones for the best audio experience

emoji it up
all right folks here we go alright folks
here goes the very first test
tell me I'll do it cuz I just wanna make
you feel we do about just tell me how do
it
we resume
with me you're the only reason
don't miss they give me no good I just
don't like this sound would you please
make some rope and get out of my face I
can't prove I can lose so get out of my
face Oh will you give me something
you don't know
and there you have folks
audio recorded on my end and then played
through your speakers are not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence my
review here first off you get very even
360 degree audio your places in the
center for entertaining and everyone's
experiencing a very similar level of
audio performance this one of them too
is loud and pressing that outdoor button
under the speaker actually helps
big-time it's not gimmicky with the
outdoor button press in person I can
tell you the vocals are pushed very much
forward without sounding off or weird
that's quite impressive and I'm not sure
if my microphone was really able to pick
that up but if you see this in stores
I'm telling you give it a shot if they
let you demo this especially at a loud
volume level you can hear the difference
let's see if they eventually implement
this into their other boom speakers now
the Wonder broom 2 is comparable in
loudness with other small bluetooth
speakers in that $100 price range
definitely enough for small rooms and
some medium sized rooms as well
the one big critique that I noticed
overall what the speaker is more for
entertaining rather than achieving
ultimate audio immersion here absolutely
this isn't an audiophile speaker at
least sitting too close to it the audio
did sound a little distorted and the
high frequencies but the further that I
slowly walked away from here the better
it sounds it's not bad but if you're
looking for something from very private
listening that JB owns Sony speakers or
two better options that has a bit more
detail more direct audio again it
doesn't have 360 degree sound but if
you're using this mostly outdoors or
bigger open environments that's where
the wonder boom 2 shines going to base
the what a broom 2 does sound to have
improved over the previous model it's a
bit more pleasing it's warmer overall
it's in the right direction the
mid-range is clean and with the outdoor
mode again this is pushed quite forward
which I'm sure many will like the
mid-range is clean from my assessment
with very much identifiable vocals the
overall instrument resolution in detail
is not as full here but as I'm trying to
illustrate the audio characteristics
are designed moreso to cut through the
air for outdoor use versus in-home
private audio listening of course you
can have the latter you can use this at
home but I'm just simply indicating that
it just performs the best when it's
outdoors the high frequencies as
mentioned earlier does sound a little
bit jumbled especially at high volumes
this is quite typical for many small
speakers on the markets where they have
a little trouble differentiating the
instruments s's and hisses in vocals etc
on the very high end so just like the
other boom speakers they have on the
market these things are built like tanks
I do prefer the audio characteristics
and the other competitors but keep in
mind they offer direct audio and that
full 360 degree sound like me wonder
boom - if you're needing a speaker for
outdoor use the one boom - not only
gives you peace of mind there but
honestly outdoor performance this did
perform the best highly recommended in
that aspect that regards so folks be
