room I've been receiving several
comments from you guys on my social
media also right here in the comment
section on YouTube asking me to review
some things from Skullcandy I personally
went out I purchased these myself this
is the Inc Wireless for the retail price
of $49.99 as it also purchased the
method Wireless sport earphones which
I'll review I'm a channel shortly if
that's already uploaded check that out
for sure and as always I'll place my
links in the good description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time so
jumping right into this my channels here
to help you make a purchase decision so
welcome everyone to another
keep in mind these are budget priced or
wallet-friendly
compared to the many other big name
brands out there with that being said
the physical build is very simple with a
thin yet super lightweight plastic neck
band the neck band itself at first does
feel so much cheap but it's designed to
be super flexible bend in different ways
here even Skullcandy is saying you can
fold these and store them in your pocket
and after learning that you do
appreciate its minimalism now on the
other hand the wires are thin though
with not much resistance from bending or
texture to give them that feeling of
toughness or ruggedness I would have
liked it to be a little bit more beefy
now there's also individual sliders on
either side to shorten or lengthen the
cables as well which can be easily
overlooked here and last but your buds
themselves are all smooth plastic now
before discussing the comfort looking at
the controller is simple up-and-down for
volume holding either or for three
seconds skips or goes back on songs and
the middle button is to turn on pair and
also answer phone calls with my test
phone calls are clear here like many air
phones on the market during a phone call
the microphone does pick up wind noises
if you're running or simply out on a
windy day a signal for both
conversations and music listening
surprisingly I was able to walk from one
set of house to the other with my pixel
XL phone stationary on the desk here
most of the time zero issues whatsoever
once in a while though rarely I hear a
slight crack on the signal but overall
these performs great so let's talk about
comfort here there's only two ear tips
included so be sure to take that into
consideration
I have small ear canals personally
myself here and these small ear tips
worked fun they do provide passive noise
isolation which is equivalent in
performance to any other in-ear setup
and during my testing the earphones do
stay in the ear quite well even if I do
decide to take these on a run and with
that being said these are over the neck
and when jogging with these they do
slightly bounce but as I've shown
earlier here these are the thinnest and
lightest pair of the over the next style
if you want this wearing method these
are probably your best bets since
they're so light if you're simply just
walking with these or just sitting
around the office of course these work
perfectly fine now some features that I
did find missing here first is any kind
of water resistance keep in mind I do
have the review of the Skullcandy
methods coming up here
those are sweat resistant and just $10
more than these here so if you want take
a look at those second when I attempt to
connect this to a device there's no
voice prompts that tells me if the
earphones are paired or not
third I wish all earphones would have
these there should be some kind of
battery level indicator the LD only
blinks when you're close to basically
running out so with all that being said
let's start talking about the audio
quality keep in mind my channel is meant
for the average consumer if you do get
these these aren't seriously not bad at
all for casual listening for the price
they offer good quality they're quite
loud and enough for most I believe bass
wise these are someone basically
earphones with a very punchy notes at
times it tries to reach sub-base levels
but it doesn't provide a deep or
resonating note so now for more picky
audio listeners out there there is a
little bit of spillover bass into the
lower mid-range levels where the vocals
reside the rest of the mid-range where
you share most vocal and instruments of
course is clear and present though now
the highs thank goodness doesn't ping or
cause any kind of ear ringing that's
more noticeable and budget price
earphones
however I've noticed for more specific
genres like EDM with higher pitched
beats with a fast tempo the clarity and
definition is somewhat lost there now
regarding to soundstage you can hear
left and right channels and quite well
here however the openness is somewhat
lacking for music so in the end here I
believe if you're looking for some
casual earbuds want Wireless and not in
the budget of $100 or more maybe those
are too expensive for you the incra
wireless model I believe is reasonably
priced for the performance that it does
offer I'd say if you're looking for
something simple no bells no whistles
here you personally lean towards the
Basie side these are worth looking into
now if you can't afford or you would
like to step into these $70 to $100
price range and up out for short look at
the alternatives then so if this review
helped you in some way of course be sure
to LIKE and subscribe and no doubt
follow me on facebook twitter or
instagram again my channels here to help
you make a purchase decision you guys
take care and I will see you on the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
