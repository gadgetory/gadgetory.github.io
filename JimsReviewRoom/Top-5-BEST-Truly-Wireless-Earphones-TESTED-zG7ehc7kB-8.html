a link down in the video description for
more info again thanks to LastPass for
sponsored this portion of the video so
folks let's get into the list number 5
this is for all the people on a budget
the Samsung Galaxy buds I've tested a
few months ago we're very good for the
price especially if you can get these
for about $100 even again I'll leave my
links down in the description for the
most updated prices now these are the
smallest and lightest truly
wireless earphones I've tested the
Galaxy buds have up to six hours of
better life which the industry is
usually averaging around four to four
and a half hours per charge and impaired
in the connection for me Indies have
been one of the fastest now Bluetooth
5.0 technology is offered and this is
the latest version available as of this
video with Bluetooth 5.0 you get
stronger and further wireless signals
with your phone now there's also
wireless charging offered with the case
and on the back of the case it's the
newest and latest USB see connections
basically future proofing yourself is a
huge thing right now now there is some
water protection it is low though I will
omit that it has a IP 2 rating you're
only protected from dripping water and
up to a 15 degree angle from vertical if
you're caught in the rain with these it
might be a little scary but to be fair
if you're not running in the rain with
these it's like no big deal if you were
one thing something more rugged keep
watching this video the next one should
be really good here but although the
galaxy buds have bluetooth 5.0 getting
back here if you're intending on
watching videos with these for the most
part they are in sync but on some few
occasions there's about a millisecond
delay there for those who don't know
with some wireless devices you'll see
the lips move on video but then you hear
the audio later and I'll be mention is
quite a bit in the following models as
well now also as a side note Samsung
does have transparency mode pastor or
some people call it ambient aware the
microphones turns on and lets you hear
your environment so it's not just
passive noise isolation perfect for
safety and awareness around you but the
Auto signature is good it's very much
suitable for the $100 price range you're
not getting sonic fidelity but if you're
looking for a casual yet quality pair
the Samsung Galaxy buds offers tons of
value let's take it up a notch here
let's look at number 4 all right number
4 are the j-bird run XTS I'm really
digging these things j-bert had slightly
redesigned these and they fit in the
ears so much better than before
now there's two flaws that I've seen
here one it has bluetooth 4.1 or 4.2 if
I recall and because so for video the
lips the actors voices again is out of
sync but if you're focused on working
not necessarily watching videos these
things are rugged as heck and it might
suit your needs but before I get to that
the second flaw here is there's no
pass-through so you can't hear your
environment while running for safety and
awareness but the following features
this could basically offset those flaws
there this has an IP seven rating
meaning this can be submerged underwater
not many competitors even offers that
second the audio signature is very loud
and alive here and with the free
downloadable app you get punchy base if
you want to punch up the low frequencies
here if you want Ford highs or bright
mids you can do that as well these are
very responsive to get it the way that
you want now better life on these are
average with four hours per use and an
additional eight hours from the charging
case for a total of twelve hours worth
of performance on the perks that helps
the run XTS get on this list there's
also location assistance if these drop
out of ear let's say while running you
can use their app to find them there are
other brands that offers this feature as
well but it's rare and again the jaybird
provides all those previously ever
mentioned features and that's why I put
them on a list as number four they're
super rugged it stays in your ears very
well that bass boost is sound signature
with that in-your-face audio again folks
I'll leave the links down in that video
description but let's move on to number
three here these are the Jabra elite 65
T's the J birds are indeed nice but the
Jabra does offer slightly better audio
performance
it's airier it's wider it's simply
cleaner there is an app that does allow
Tooting as well it's not as responsive
as Jaybirds but Jarvis starts off with
such a clean foundation any tuning just
tweaks it just build upon it the elite
65 T's is also one of the best fitting
in ear performances here the J birds are
good and do stay in but the elite 65 T's
feels more stable at least with my ears
here there's always trying to recommend
the best for you these are also
Bluetooth 5.0 that means it's a stronger
more stable connection but with this
Bluetooth 5.0 I didn't have any signal
issues with video the better life is
slightly above average with five hours
per use with another 10 hours from the
case for a total of 15 if you use these
four phone calls the audio plays through
both ears and it is
super-clear for the other person
listening but keep in mind it does pick
up a little bit of background noise or
actually picks up a lot of background
noise so just be aware of that now the
elite 65 T's offers an IP 5 rating for
protection again jet sprays which again
I think is enough for most people even
at IP 4 rating is enough that it
protects against water splashes now last
there is here through which does allow
you to pump in your environmental noises
for safety and awareness and for being
number 3 I think this is the best most
well-rounded pair of truly wireless
earphones out there but getting into the
next two here I'll admit they are a
little bit more expensive and honestly
most people watching this video will
probably buy either number five number
four maybe B's right here those are
already great but these next two just
take it up again one more - alright so I
know there are some folks who dislike
Beats products I can see where you're
coming from
in my beats headphone review
specifically the studio threes they
weren't the best performance and they
were charging a good bit as well but I
have to give credit where credit is due
and for the power beats Pro completely
different product right here there's
some features that is outstanding first
and foremost this is the only major
brand of truly wireless earphones that
offers these ear hooks if you have
slippage with other brands these ear
hooks do work now I've noticed time and
time again I've been reaching for the
power beats pros over my other truly
wireless earphones when I go to the gym
specifically for the gym I use a
different pair for everything else but
talk about that pretty shortly here now
when I lay down horizontally to
benchpress who want to get on that
treadmill and run for my life to the
pulled days in the gym what have you the
power beat pros stays on no questions
asked now if you want peace of mind I'm
telling you these or it and I think they
look really darn good two seconds these
have had the most consistent fastest and
easiest pairing that I've experienced
apples aged one ship that's inside
offers that experience not only on Apple
devices but also on Android it's about a
one-second delay or one second slower on
my pixel phone but still that
consistency of taking out your earphones
and then instantly pair into your phone
every time with no issues it's
that was considered the best from my
experience not only that because of this
h1 chip the better life on these it's
possibly the best out there 9 hours will
9 hours of use plus 15 hours from the
case for a total of 24 hours just the
nine hours alone
I wear them to the gym maybe forget that
day to put them back into the case of
recharge and use it the next day or tube
and still have enough battery power to
last I don't even think about it again
intuitive peace of mind and practicality
the numbers speak for themselves
also testing this with video it works
100% fine with zero syncing delays we do
have some water resistance and being
upfront its equivalent to an IP four
rating meaning they can only take on
splashes they don't take on jet sprays
like the IP 5 rating on the previous
models and they can't be submerged like
the IP 7 rating from jaybird but again
ask yourself do you think you'll be
exposed to jet sprays or drop us into
the puddle your call but the one thing
that I know that would impact everyone's
the purchase decision here it's not a
bad thing but some people like this
these are not 100% passive noise
isolating earphones with all the
previous models on the list they go in
your ear canal and creates a seal and
that helps tremendously with audio
immersion and it does black out the
outside world kind of like we're in ear
plugs then with the power beats pros you
can hear your surroundings a bit
somewhat some would like that for safety
but again the other earphones do offer
some sort of pass through or hear
through connection that allows you to
hear your environment as well yet you
can always turn it off it's actually a
feature on there now with that being
said the audio quality is focused on
based focused consumers it's deep it's
rumbling it's gonna be loud and it is
really nice though it is slightly niche
Anish characteristic here that some
would love but honestly and just being
upfront some will actually hate because
it's so bassy I didn't mind it from my
workouts it sounds good to me but surely
not great this is just me I prefer the
refinement of the job rows a bit more
even the Jaybirds punchy bass I did
prefer that better or more so but
everything else about these earphones
they hit it out of the ballpark and
because of its ease of use and
practicality that's why I can see many
average consumers apprec--
the functions over the audio performance
the audio is not bad at all but the
other practicality functions here just
basically supersedes that it just adds
on to the experience so before I go into
the best truly royalty earphones Basel
met number one there are indeed some
honorable mentions these are not bad but
they simply didn't work as well for me I
love these things here the Bose sound
support phrase offers an insane audio
experience somehow bose tuned these
things to offer audio that's interpreted
from coming within your head it sounds
as though the center channel is
originating from inside and not from
left and right audio channels it's
insane and I still highly recommend for
you to try them the only reason why I
didn't place them on its list again this
is just me you have to acknowledge they
are huge also they're heavy and didn't
stay in my ears as well as I wanted them
to and I've seen some six-foot-two dudes
with a bigger head and such and it looks
fine with them but me no I just didn't
look right
also they have barely any passive noise
isolation as well very similar to the
Apple earpods even less noise isolation
than the power beats pros meaning you
can hear everything around you you
should still test them if you can now
since mentioning the air pods I
personally haven't tested the new models
but I am aware they don't offer passive
noise isolation either that's what it
might must have now I'm sure they're
great I know their connection and better
life is very good and for the price
there's a lot of value with those two
but again those just weren't for me now
the bnot 8 version 2 sounds amazing
but not as good as my number one they
look great that she charging is awesome
but for $350 retail you get average
better life that's four hours plus 12
hours with the case in addition you can
only use the right ear but if you take
any one of those earphones off and Ally
this still has bluetooth 4.2 instead of
the newest bluetooth 5.0 and with my
testing I was able to prove it was only
able to cover half of my apartment here
well the all the other earphones on this
list so far was able to cover at least
80% in some a hundred percent of the of
the apartment here without the single
crackling or basically breaking that
with the clips t5 s and the creative
outliers I haven't tested them
just yet if you're watching this in the
future be sure to check back but just
being transparent I haven't had a chance
to squeeze those in before this video
I've been delaying this video like crazy
so with all that being said here who is
the best here goes my number one pick
for this year and it sounds freaking
good it's the Sennheiser momentum truly
Wireless I know it's expensive it
retails for about three hundred and
fifty dollars it is on sale for three
hundred but freak man if you're looking
for the best audio experience from a
pair of truly wireless earphones these
will put you in another dimension these
are impeccable the bass resonates and
it's so clean it immerses you deeper
into the beats the warmth is heard in
the vocals to mid range that's very
clean and clear to the high notes that
really sparkles but what makes this
sound better than any other pair of
truly wireless earphones it's the
soundstage it's super wide there's much
depth in the audio interpretation even
the average listener /na audiophile can
hear the audio separation to a great
degree now there is an app to offer some
tuning of the audio here and it does
help not as robust as Jaybirds but again
the starting foundation and these are
very very strong defined tweaks helps
supplement the experience now when I'm
not at the gym and when I'm not using my
headphones if I want minimalist around
the office around the studio or walking
outside to the grocery store over here
to the bubble tea shops around here and
the most important factor to me is the
audio quality I use these basically this
is what you also get Bluetooth 5.0 and
with my testing both video on both Apple
and Android devices it played perfectly
in sync you have water resistance which
is only at IP four which means it's only
splash proof but again that's all I
personally need you get USB type-c on
the case here to feature proof these
things are about 65 TS and Jabir's
didn't have the latest connection that
power B pros are on lightning and aside
from my number 5 which with the Samsung
Galaxy buds which were my budget models
the B&amp;amp;O were the only other ones on my
list so far that had USB type-c you also
have touch controls transparency mode
and
so you can use either earbud in your ear
now the only thing that I didn't like is
honestly the aren't as stable as the
more dedicated Fitness earphones but
again these like the binos and Eclipse
t5 and such they don't offer ear wings
or ear findt they don't offer the best
stability but again it's fine because of
everything else
folks I love these Sennheiser truly
Momentum's so folks down in that comment
section below let me know what you think
of this list so far I know not ever
gonna agree with it that's perfectly
fine none of these earphones aren't
perfect and of course it still depends
on how much you're willing to spend and
of course what what you're gonna use it
for but folks please comment down below
like fire emojis of course and folks
I'll catch you guys on the next one you
guys take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
