room I usually don't do many of these
comparison videos but a bunch of you
guys did ask me during the garmin
vivoactive review that i just did here
and basically told me to put it against
the fitbit surge so just getting right
into this here and i'm making us a quick
video at a time of this video
both are priced at two hundred and forty
nine dollars retail but I'll place my
links in the video description below
that way you can check for the most
updated prices and see if they've gone
on sale again it's all in the video
description now starting with the
physical features the Fitbit surge
physically it does feel smoother and
just ever so slightly more pliable than
the garments now if you look closely at
the Fitbit a stiffness of the band does
extend further down now when I do
workouts with weights here I do feel the
surge being slightly more clunky or big
now with the vivoactive HR because of
its hinge design being closer to display
this does feel better with risk based
vigorous movements and examples of
course will be weight lifting in my case
or those who do CrossFit either or both
bands are comfortable to wear on a daily
basis but the Garmin Trump's the Fitbit
just by here now moving on to the
display both are touch sensitive and
both are very responsive to use but the
Garmin does have more screen real estate
and does add some colors while these
Serge sticks with more of a black and
white screen it's simple but it still
works perfectly fine now with the
garment when you do use it in dim
lighting the screen is slightly harder
to see over the Serge now in garments
defense the vivoactive HR does offer
bigger fonts to be displayed and in more
ideal lighting conditions like Garmin
does provide better visuals and more
information for you to analyze over
yourself
now here's what each band offers and
doesn't offer right on the wrist stack
from the factory there gummer provides
your basics like time date steps
calories burned estimated distance
in10sity minutes your most recent sport
recording and weather widgets
notifications from text messages emails
some app notifications here and there
and heart rate data now if you look at
the fitbit side you have the same time
it steps calories burning distance but
you also get floors climb being
displayed on the band itself Garmin
doesn't show this now with doing a
head-to-head comparison the Garmin does
provide so much more data I mean a lot
more right on the band itself now this
is just one example here looking at the
HR information itself you have your
current heart rate at the top left your
lows and highest heart rates and the top
right has your resting heart rates
within the last four hours now if you
look at the Fitbit side of things
it offers your current heart rate and
that's pretty much it and fitbit's
defense the search again does offer that
simplicity if this is all the data that
you need
the Fitbit works perfectly fine now
regarding sport profiles this is what
Fitbit offers you can have a variety of
these profiles to save and segment your
workout right on your wrist and you can
save up to seven on the surge now as for
Garmin the vivoactive HR does give you
more in the beginning but if you want to
fully customize this after workout you
can go into the app and customize it in
any way that you want you can just
rename that workout that you just did
the choices are abundant now Garmin does
offer that much more but you get again
you just have to manually go in there
and do it yourself unfortunately it's
not already pre designated but again you
do customize it now one of the last
tidbits here that you guys need to know
you can fully swim the garmin vivoactive
HR while the search it's only splash
proof you can pair an A and T or ANT+
heart rate chest strap with the Garmin
if you decide you don't want to use the
wrist tracker while the Fitbit it's
exclusively risk based the Garmin from
my test lasted five days and a little
over 14 hours while the Fitbit surge
lasted six days and seven hours worth of
battery use now of course everyone's
performs will be slightly different
now both trackers do provide GPS part
garment goes one step further here
offering GLONASS which is Russia's own
geo positioning system that with both
satellites in the sky the Garmin in
theory connects faster and is more
stable to be answered to having both
side by side I really didn't find much
difference to make one truly better than
the other so this leads us to the app
experience from the get-go Fitbit has
been for the longest time here well the
easier apps to read and simply just
flows for a day to day tracking well
comparing with the garment one of the
errors that Fitbit does well is the
daily heart rate tracking both sport
watches attracts basically 24/7 but
Fitbit displays this information in a
well-defined manner that's easy to read
and to interpret now looking at the
Garmin for day-to-day tracking it's
really lackluster here is not much
information for you to go on in regards
to general heart health
another vivoactive does offer more
detailed heart rate zone though for
basically your own analysis after each
workout that is while Fitbit again
which workout it only offers cardio or
fat burn analysis it's really slim but
now in regards to accuracy most wear
space trackers do have some variation
when I test the surge I've found it to
have a lagging indicator it just simply
didn't keep up with my chest strap after
20 to 30 seconds after nearly every
workout then the surge would match what
my chest strap was offering my ass for
Garmin it did perform better for my
experience but still offered a slight
amount of lagging information here after
I performed interval training basically
when the heart rate climbs and drops and
continues this a band flow pattern but
if we flip this around and take a look
at a bigger picture who's buying these
$250 gps-enabled sport watches these are
geared towards a bit more dedicated
active individuals now for example those
were running that needs GPS for accurate
distance speed paced splits etc the
grameen does phenomenal in that aspect
we're looking into details about each
workout here and using running as a
perfect example Fitbit does provide
distance pace average heart rate split
times and a map with an overview of your
route basically a Garmin side not the
prettiest thing to look at but if you're
analytical and looking for ways to see
weak areas or wanting to improve certain
aspects of your run Garmin literally has
all this information just look at that
screen there so to conclude this brief
comparison video the Fitbit surge offers
a lot of simplicity ease of use and for
the average consumer that is something
pleasing to the eyes where it doesn't
overwhelm you the garment on the other
hand provides a lot of data I mean a lot
they basically throw in the kitchen sink
but I do admit though it does take a
slight bit more time to digest and
understand everything with Garmin but
once you do the people active HR will
most likely give you the information
that you need to make improvements on
your performance now as for everyday
general tracking and basic running the
Fitbit wins in that regards so I hope
this video helped you in some way I know
I didn't do anything fancy here or no
fancy editing that is but let's see how
this video does maybe I'll do some work
down the road if you haven't already be
sure to LIKE and subscribe to my channel
here and find me on Facebook Twitter and
or Instagram you guys take care I'll see
you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
