welcome back to another comparison video
now think Sony Bluetooth speakers
recently are killing it they sound great
they look great buy on the channel here
JBL for the last two years or so have
been winning me over it with their sound
and features now what I want to do in
this video is compare the small speaker
category here if the sony xba-4
the JBL flip for now both of these
retail for $100 I did personally pay $70
for the XP 20 just last week so the sale
might still be going on what I'll do is
I'll leave my Amazon affiliate links
down in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time
they never know when these things might
go on sale but jumping right into this
one both speakers are nearly identical
in size and weight now if you value
portability over other features both
speakers are easy to grip with one hand
here throw into your bag with ease and
both are quite durable
now with the flip for it does have these
exposed passive base radiators on the
side I never had them tear a break but I
know for some of you guys out there that
is or maybe a concern now I haven't had
to issue though but the only thing I
would nitpick with the sony xba-4 on the
front but it might show somewhere over
time when rubbing against things yet on
the other hand JBL offers a nylon
ruggedized fabric that absorbs abrasion
a bit better now going over the features
the JBL foot 4 has everything that the
sony does except that the foot floor
features JBL connect plus meaning you
can connect over 100 JBL connect plus
speakers and have them play all at the
same time now i know no one will own a
hundred of these but if your friend may
come by here and he also had the JBL
connect naples speaker you both can pair
with each other and jam out essentially
now sony does have this feature too
but you're only able to pair up to ten
again most people won't have ten of
these speakers but it's a feature
nonetheless now Sony's most visible
feature that makes it stand out is the
LED lights you can have them strobe
pulsate or fade in and out to your music
all control through these Sony app now
keep in mind the SP 20 model are limited
to just one color now this will impede
flashing blues purples red
Cetera's - simply white both figures do
offer some sort of water protection the
Sonia is only splash resistant with an
IP 5 rating while the JBL flip 4 offers
an IP 7 rating allowing the flip forward
to be submerged underwater the one thing
to note though if flip 4 does not float
so make sure you take that into
consideration now regarding better life
there both offers up to 12 hours of use
with real-world testing both speakers at
50% volume the Sony died in 9 hours and
8 minutes while they flip for was going
on 14 hours and still had another 50% of
better life to go the JBL was very
impressive
now both offers good Bluetooth wireless
range both performs equally as well as
walked about 50 linear feet down the
office here and both speakers and the
audio signal had never cut out on me now
both getting function as a speakerphone
as well for your phone calls comparing
both of them head-to-head they look for
picked up my voice louder and more
pronounced across every length I've
tested this at now I tested this at 3
feet 5 feet away and also 10 feet away
with the Sony it performs well but the
voice was not as forward or loud when
compared to the JBL so let's jump into
the audio test there I'll play them back
to back and as a side note
I'll have the extra bass function on
with the Sony for your reference here's
the first track this one is fortress by
a lynnium featuring Johnny fedora
Oh
and there you have it folks audio
recorded on my end and then played
through your speakers are not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence my
review here now both speakers selling
great for the price overall they both
sound a punchy this sounded better than
most other $100 Bluetooth speakers out
there for this head-to-head comparison
video I gotta hand it to JBL for the
bass category during my time testing
both were very close in performance the
almost identical at times but I noticed
more often that a JBL would be the bass
ear speaker of all the songs that I've
tested JBL was more consistent in
offering that bass experience now doing
a complete 180 here on every test the XP
20 had brighter and more for mid ranges
the mid-range frequency is where you
hear most of your singers and voices and
most instruments it's where you hear
most of the details and clarity of any
song and with the sony it stood out
every time compared to JBL foot for my
ads really high notes the higher
frequencies both speakers were nearly
identical in performance with both
speakers not being tinny or you're
ringing the speakers in general not
sharp at all and that's for a spatial
sound the XP 20 does do a slightly
better job here you hear more of an
airiness and directional audio over the
JBL foot 4 so in the end here my
analysis I love my JBL product it's
still some phenomenal and I would buy
the flip floor
if I wanted more bass I wanted a speaker
that I know if my little cousin throws
into the pool that it would still be
okay and the fact that it has and will
most likely withstand more abrasion and
bumps not to mention the same exact
battery test that performs at 50% volume
on both of these speakers that foot 4
went way past at 12 hour mark now on the
other hand if I don't need any of that
ruggedness I'm aware better life is
around 9 hours on this thing at 50%
volume I would hands down go with the
Sony for the audio performance if you
like lights on the XV 20 more power to
you so folks in the comments section
below let me know which ones you would
pick here
Sony has seriously been underrated for
such a long time in regards to Bluetooth
speakers I think it's up to you the
consumer to determine which one will be
the best seriously comment down below
I'm Jimmy with Jim's reviewer and I'm
here to help you make that purchase this
you guys take care I'll see you on the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
