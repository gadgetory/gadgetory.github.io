reviewer welcome to another unboxing and
I just got this in the mail today it's
the brand-new Nvidia shield tablet this
is the technically not the first machine
here you can say with a k1 processor but
it's the first directly from Nvidia so
let's get right into it here from the
box and rotating to the rear here there
you go and let's see if we can zoom in a
little bit for you I'm gonna fast
forward the video for you so that way
you guys can get a really good look at
what's going on and back here now I
didn't get the controller it was not
released the same day as the tablets so
unfortunately don't have the controller
but the tablet is the the bulk of the
the unboxing the review here so we'll
just start with that so let's open this
baby up and I got one tab removed
already I didn't do the other tab yet
and usually try to remove it ahead of
time so that way it makes it a little
bit more of a smoother transition in the
video but here we go there she goes
let's take her out here I said what I'll
do I'll do separate videos I'm gonna do
benchmarks on this of course after this
unboxing video and then of course the
review is to follow shortly after I do
my tests and whatnot and let me see if
there's anything else in the box here
just a double check and nothing else
from Nvidia alright and let's get to the
tablet right away put this to the side
here
and there you go folks very sleek
heavy-duty feeling design actually not
the thinnest tablet in the world of
course but at this size it does feel so
like a slate to be honest with you it
feels still pretty good in the hand like
said compared to other modern-day tablet
I guess you can say and you know when
you say that and you say thin tablets
you think of course Apple and Samsung
this doesn't obviously feel like the
lightest in the world but like I said
it's a gaming device it's a gaming
tablet focused on gaming so it should be
pretty beefy but overall it still feels
very manageable it's almost it has this
very thin bezel on each side here which
isn't too bad at all the bezels on the
top and the bottom although you have
your speakers on the front which is
great I love front-facing speakers
there's a little bit of a black belt
okay I don't know if you can see it in
the actual video here and I'm trying to
see if I can find it in there I don't
think I can you guys can see it but
there's a thin little bezel right here
that actually extends down so the screen
doesn't go all the way up to the
speakers there's a little bit of a black
space right there the sides are really
thin which is cool I like thin bezels
some people are okay with the thicker
ones and whatnot and this little rotate
to the back here for you
with a lot of simplicity with the word
shield I love this backing I always love
the tablets with a little bit of
friction on the back here just to keep
it you know stable in the hand I like
Apple products too you know I don't hate
against you know technology and in
companies and whatnot that are producing
good stuff but I don't like the all
aluminum backing and the on the iPads
there's a little too slick for me but
this has a little bit of texture in
there if it was actually pretty good
again pretty good in the hands and leave
this I got medium size hands this fits
perfectly in my hand when you hold it up
vertically and horizontally landscape
wise that's a nice decent size and let's
go around look at the buttons real quick
here and what I'll do let me zoom in
real quick here and we'll fast forward
the video for you all right loads you
got your power volume micro SD card slot
there's something right here at all it's
probably a it doesn't do anything it's
not a button per se but I'll see in the
Action Man you if there's anything for
that not sure what that is it's not it
doesn't look like a tab to be removed or
so you got your pen that's included in
here stylus pen suite and look at that
it has it like a little a slight little
angled tip to it which is pretty unique
I want to see eventually how this how
this works is it pretty cool has a
little bit of weight to it too pretty
impressive and just stick that back in
there real quick they get in there too
right right whoops so I guess you got to
put it definitely in the right direction
there you go now it snaps in so that
might hopefully that doesn't become a
nuisance and it looks like there's yeah
there's speakers on both sigh it looks
like speakers on either side as well and
let me just refocus the image real quick
here and there yo guys I hope you guys
can see that speaker right there and
there's one exactly on the other side
but Ashley's not exactly it's actually
offset a little bit here it's not
perfectly across from each other this
one's practically right in the middle
this one's a little bit downward on this
side right here as you can see but
looking a continue looking at the port's
here it looks like a input for your
three half millimeter headphone you have
the micro or mini HDMI connection report
and of course a micro SD card slot for
you to charge I'm sure or to connect
your controller as well and on the back
here it has a rear-facing camera let's
let me get that in focus a rear-facing
camera for you guys and on the very
bottom are two more items here like I
said I'm not too familiar with this yet
so I really don't know what these or
some of these items are for but there's
two ports here I'm pretty sure it may
involve clicking this to a cover for the
Nvidia shield but other than that let me
see if there's any juice on this thing
let me turn it on and show you what the
screen may look like let me zoom out all
right and let me see if there's any
juice left in this thing from the
factory and just press the power button
hopefully it turns out nice stiff button
there you can say
there you go I'm gonna get this out of
the picture here and we're just waiting
for it to load and this is the first
boot up you can say hopefully it doesn't
take too long but overall the fit and
feel it feels really good it feels like
a really really solid device it's a
little bit thicker obviously then your
most premium tablets but again I'm
expecting that from a gaming tablet
specifically this is for gaming
obviously from Nvidia
the build quality it feels like is this
glass right up to the edge even around
the beveled edge here it feels like it's
part of the glass as well so it does
feel really good in the hands and feels
like a very premium premium product but
as you can see here goes the screen and
this is just you know of course you got
to sign in and whatnot but I'll of
course you know get into this and start
doing the benchmarks for you I'll upload
that video sometime hopefully in the
near future within the next day or two
maybe even tonight who knows but
definitely like subscribe and just keep
Jim's review room in mind because I'll
be putting this out you know in the next
week or so of testing and getting mine
user experience so hope you guys enjoy
it you guys take care this is Jim from
Jim's Ruby room
