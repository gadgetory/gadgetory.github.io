review room for 2015 we're gonna see
more activity bands becoming
smartwatches and smart watches become
activity bands think the bassist peak
Samsung gear fit garmin vivoactive and
fitbit surge just the name of you now
Microsoft is getting into the game as
well falling into the category of a
smart Fitness band priced at $200 it's
right in the middle of dedicated
high-end activity trackers and cheaper
than dedicated smartwatches offer today
so without further ado welcome to Jim's
review bro
don't roll for the physical aspects
first the band is made of a hard silicon
material not because of the mechanics
inside the screen and sides of the Bands
are very stiff all the way down to the
bottom where the heart rate sensor and
locking mechanism is located now regards
to comforts and being very fair to
Microsoft at first on a normal
day-to-day experience it was just too
stiff it felt like I was wearing a
bracelet or a bangle at the time now
after about a week of really giving it a
chance it really became a lot better but
again that's for day-to-day activities
but as Microsoft explains in their
directions the ban is meant to be worn
not tight but snugged and either with
the screen facing up or down now when I
consulted with an online support rep
with Microsoft they mentioned that this
can be worn either before the wrist bone
or not like a normal watch and it's fine
so aside from normal day-to-day
activities I weight lift and
unfortunately bending the wrist back is
slightly painful it clenches against the
bone now granted I can move it back and
away from our wrist but then it becomes
loose as the forearm is of course bigger
than the wrist now not to mention when
you're focused on a competitive sport
like basketball or tennis at this subtle
nuance where I found myself readjusting
the band subconsciously from time to
time and because it's very wide for any
long sleeve wears office workers it does
no question snag along the cuff line
overall it's still a very solid build
it's held up well for the past month of
owning it and indeed it can be
comfortable but I believe one has to put
in more effort than a lot of the other
competitors on the market and you do
have to give it a chance to get
comfortable not ideal but just trying to
be fair now I asked for the screen it's
a very nice and bright display being
viewable in both low and bright
situations and the main screen itself
appears to be scratch resistant which is
a huge plus while the surrounding bezel
as you can see here is easily scratched
unfortunately now the touch sensitivity
is spot-on and you'll see while I go
through the menu options here first up
is the time with clicking the action
button to the right here to scroll
through your date distance estimated
calories burned heart rate steps taken
so far for that day and then it goes
back to the date now swiping and holding
left it reveals your battery level which
I'll discuss later with icons indicating
you have a charm monitoring and
Bluetooth
actions on now is swiping to the right
are options to view your text and other
messages that came through the day and
the phone icon indicates all of your
missed calls and also incoming calls as
well now the next up is the calendar and
seeing some of the most recent events
you have saved on your phone and now
here the following three tiles are
health related with the first four
running now once tapped on before
starting to run you have the option to
utilize the built in GPS instead of
using your phones and once you're ready
you click on that right action button
again and this will have your band
search for a GPS signal now it usually
finds a signal at about the 1-minute
mark which is reasonable any longer
would of course be an issue
now once everything is connected I press
and go and a timer shows on screen with
calories burned and your current heart
rates being displayed in real time now
after again I contacted Microsoft
support and inquiring about the heart
rate reading the rep informed me the ban
will read my heart rates every second
for two minutes then it will stop for
eight minutes then repeat itself
however when running or in any activity
session you activate it's all in
real-time now finishing up running here
if you do have a GPS locked in here
scrolling down will reveal your pace and
distance traveled once finished you just
end it and a summary on your wrist will
be provided now going back to the main
menu again the weight icon is for other
workouts in general not specific to
weights and the screen looks identical
to running just without that GPS feature
so we'll move on to the next tile here
which is sleep now the American soft
band isn't automated like some on the
market you have to manually tell the
band prior to resting but this is also
the case with very popular bands like
the garmin vivosmart and jump on up to
name a few now the sleep information
displayed is very helpful as every
morning when I tell the band I have
woken up the summary provides the exact
amount of sleep not only that but my
sleep efficiency numerically is provided
which I haven't seen on any other band
offering that kind of data in addition
the basics are still provided like how
many times I've woken up or really
tossed and turned in how many calories I
burned overnight next up on the menu is
your vibrating alarm which you set up
once and it wakes you up the following
day now when compared to Fitbit or
Jawbone's Microsoft as of this video
does not offer scheduled alarms you
cannot set this
to vibrate every morning at 7 a.m. or to
only vibrate on certain days of the week
now after it vibrates the alarm turns
off and you have to reset the alarm once
again now this is a feature I think is a
must
and as the rep I inquired with explained
it's more of a reminder rather than a
waking alarm clock so for those wanting
this feature it's not there but it could
be an option down the road now the
following options are pretty
self-explanatory with weather being
offered in your local area which is very
convenient a UV sensor to determine how
harmful those sun rays are for that day
which I found works but personally not
sure how to apply it I guess if it's
sunny outside I would think the Sun is
bad for you but that's just me being the
average consumer and the last details
here are push notifications you receive
and your phone are now being displayed
on your Microsoft band as well it comes
in handy but at times I do receive too
many notifications and it really kills
the battery that much quicker and
finally here we have the Settings button
to adjust brightness mute the banner or
change the clock etc again which is all
self-explanatory so as you can see that
Microsoft band really blurs the line of
being an activity tracker and a Smart
Watch with a large amount of features
and navigation on the band itself but
let's now take a look at the app and see
if it's feature filled as well looking
at the main screen Microsoft attempts to
keep that tile look that we see on
Windows 8 and Beyond it's a very simple
layout with just five lines at least on
my screen here which includes steps on
top and calories burned for that day now
looking underneath that it shows our
manually entered and recent activities
as you can see I did a quick run on the
14th I weight lifted yesterday which was
the 15th and last night as a tile for my
sleep now going all the way down here to
the bottom there is a add and manage
tile button but once tapped there this
will only change the tile layout and
what information you want to be
displayed and your band not the app
itself now backing out to the main
screen here and then tapping on steps
will go into a day where else a bit more
active now on top you have your bar
graph indicating your steps with this
simple tap now you can toggle to your
heart rate information that's displayed
throughout the day and below that it's a
simple indication of your distance
moments you were active any horizontal
bar indicating
closer work to reaching your goal now
other than that you can't slide the
graph or zoom in and there's no
indication of what exercises you did
perform for that day that information
can be found on a different screen which
I'll show you shortly
now going out and clicking on calories
burn reveals a similar information and
keep in mind I do work in front of a
computer most of the day so my chart
isn't the most stellar here hence why I
try to work out once everyday for about
45 minutes to an hour but again very
simple information in regards to the app
now the next window here was a jog that
I performed at the local park now my
starting point was actually all the way
up here and it was spot-on and accurate
for my test however if there isn't a
registered trail on the map it looks as
though it won't measure it a GPS picked
up my signal when I returned back to the
main trail and fouled me all the way
until the end which is accurate but
looking at the Fitbit app tested at the
same park just on a different day as
long as the trail is there Fitbit was
able to register this now it might not
be the apps fault but an updated map may
be needed for Microsoft and again this
is a very popular park right next to
downtown but moving down below here this
is where you get some more meat you can
say duration calories burned average
pace with heart rate information is
displayed our recovery time is also
provided on the workout you just
performed here and unfortunately
clicking on any of the information
displayed does not break it down any
further specifically the heart rate
information for my run now that's
something I really want to know is my
heart rate zones which is huge
information and helping me better my
cardiovascular health but the odd thing
you go into my weightlifting session
that I've recorded and it's in there
actually for that activity not for
running though which is odd now looking
at my chart provides information during
the 40 minutes I mean lifting with more
similar information down below which is
useful but again besides that chart up
top that much more information is
offered in regards to heart rate when
compared to the competition now the last
set of information is sleep which does
the best not based on my opinion but by
the amount of analytics it provides
again a sharper top which you cannot
zoom in or turn the front sideways to
better see is presented but the
information below helps big time how
much sleep I achieved time I fell asleep
in my efficiency and also importance is
my resting heart rate while sleep
just to make sure I'm not having any
sleeping or heart problems in general
overnight now at least the sleep
information is as robust as jaw bones
zap and very few other bands on the
market right now don't even offer this
kind of detail so a plus here from
Microsoft definitely now let's go back
to the main screen here and finish the
app to the top left our menu options
activity history which I found very
helpful and comparing my information
with previous performance is tucked away
in here now this should be for sure on
the main screen or at least incorporated
into each activity that I perform and I
can compare how well it performs over
the course of time and see if I'm
improving in my overall commitments but
backing out here and to follow is find a
workout with guided fitness instruction
now you can select a variety of
instructional workouts but to be honest
I thought it would have been a little
bit more energetic but assumptions aside
the videos does provide useful
information but as a product for
motivation to get you fit at least in
these videos I really don't feel or say
that motivation now the remaining menu
options are all self-explanatory with
changing your profile including name age
height and weight and then going back
here adjusting your preferences such as
changing your pounds to kilograms
Fahrenheit to Celsius etc and the last
option here is connected which is
basically allowing your app here to work
with poppler apps as well like My
Fitness Pal and RunKeeper
and that's basically it for the app
itself one last gripe here unfortunately
for Microsoft the app does lags at every
menu option that I select some longer
than others it's just basically not a
fluid experience and as a disclaimer I
am using a Samsung Note for my tests
which does have one of the latest
processors as of this video and I have
restarted my phone just to rule out any
hiccups still not again a fluid
experience and to wrap things up
regarding its battery life microsoft
claims 48 hours of normal news without
notifications and gps off i was able to
personally achieve about one day in 20
hours so a couple hours shy of what
marcus office claiming now with having
one jog with gps on notifications and
watch mode on as well i was
able to achieve then a dismal 26 hours
basically one full day in two hours and
being fair again compared to other
Fitness vans I'll be honest Microsoft
band is is quite horrible you have to
constantly charge and at one point when
I arrive at the park and I needed to
recharge the darn thing there is no way
of doing so it was quite frustrating but
again to be fair here for a SmartWatch
though comparing to the likes of the
Moto through 60 or LG G watch one day
battery life is somewhat the norm so the
ban is somewhat of a hybrid and to be
honest with you it's quite subjective
some people are okay with charging it
while they shower or getting ready to go
to bed here while others will find it a
nuisance having to recharge this thing
so frequently and regarding showering
this ban is only splash-resistant you
can't submerge this under water or wear
it while swimming maybe getting caught
in the rain or washing your hands may be
okay though so overall and to make it
short and sweet I really truly believe
there's much better bands out there it's
possible Microsoft tried to be both an
activity band and a SmartWatch and in
the end it was just too much and there's
really no strong attributes that the
Microsoft band brings now lacking some
key features like the vibrating alarm a
more robust history and comparison
charts or down to explaining the
information and gathered would have been
much more helpful the Smart Watch
features are nice like the notifications
calendar messages etc that they are all
great but again there's some bands that
offer this already and more will be
coming in 2015 so hope this video helped
you in some way if you do like my work
and me Jim's review room answer Facebook
Twitter Instagram or Google+ as I
normally post updates on items I'm
currently testing before I put them on
the website again this is Jimmy with
Jim's review room you guys take care and
I'll see you on the next one bye
