room now many of you guys asked me to
compare the j-bird x2s with the new
j-bird freedoms that were just released
no jumping right into this there's no
fancy editing here the freedom at the
time this video retails for 199 dollars
while the x2s
they come in at 149 dollars retail but I
have seen them on sale for as low as
$100 most likely because the x3s might
be around the corner here but this video
is really for those who currently have
the x2 so maybe even the X ones in
deciding if they should upgrade or not
now place my links in the video
description below click on my links and
it'll give you the most updated prices
for today but looking at both here the X
2's are clearly the bigger earphones but
both actually weigh the same now the
biggest difference the weight on the
exterior are mainly housed in the
earphones themselves while the freedom's
wait here majority of that mass is in
the inline controller now the other
aspect the X 2's has pretty big openings
for the drivers while the freedoms are a
bit more manageable for those with
smaller ear canals now both sets do come
with the traditional silicon tips but
they do feature both of them do offers
comply foam ear tips to help with a
better fit and for better noise
isolation more my sound test a little
bit later now regarding comfort the
freedom is from my testing it's been the
better choice I have small ear canals
myself and the freedoms simply stay on
that much better and easier regardless
if I'm using these silicon atif foam
tips on either pair now with both models
you can wear them the traditional method
of having them dangle from your ear and
hang on the upper part of your neck or
you can wear them over your ear and have
the wire a bit more tense and not let
the wires bounce around as much which
works best for me now last and before I
forget here both our sweat and water
resistant and from my testing of both
here in the rain or just spraying water
on them they both have been holding up
perfectly fine that lasts both sets do
use a micro USB port to charge with the
freedoms it's a bit more of a unique
situation here there's a proprietary
attachment that you click on to the back
of the volume controller and charging it
for 20 minutes will give you about an
hour worth of audio per jaybird now what
the freedom's jaybird is a bit unique in
the situation offering a total of eight
hours but it's four hours of use with
the earphones by itself and with a
separate attachment it works just like a
power bank offering an additional four
hours of use and that's where jaybird is
getting up to that eight hours
power claimed you can technically wear
the attachment while working out and
while running just keep in mind this
will cause the wire to bounce around a
little bit more but the attachment is
super lightweight now from my experience
the freedoms lasted me 5 hours and 27
minutes using the attachment I would
roughly get another 5 hours of use once
again now on the X 2's they're offering
up to 8 hours of use from my personal
testing leave the Sun at 50% volume just
like the freedoms I was able to get 7
hours and 15 minutes worth of use
they're not less going into the sound
here which one is truly better how
different are they now both are really
great in my opinion and the differences
aren't too drastic but they are there
nonetheless
testing them back-to-back the freedom
sounds just ever so slightly more
expansive and having just an ever so
slightly deeper bass response
now both earphones offers a great bass
both offers great mids and vocal
performance now the X 2's have very much
higher vibes maybe Mac's here if you can
tolerate that they have a sharper and
higher high note at the top end but
again both are performing very similar
with each other from my experience
now both earphones can get very loud for
most people in the sound stage isn't
much of a difference either with both
offering good performance very good
performance that is for sport Bluetooth
earphones now the only difference and
this is in favor of the newer pair the
freedom's comes with the app my sound
and those who are not too familiar with
equalizers with the app is very
intuitive and the freedom responds very
well to audio tuning and you can have
this more bassy if you want or have the
mids even brighter the equalizer works
very well the X 2's unfortunately
doesn't have this feature just yet
however with the new j-bert X 3s that
should be coming up pretty soon that
should be compatible with this
particular app so in the end here if
you're desiring absolute audio quality
either or is really fine but if you want
comfort just comparing these two sets
here for the obvious choice are the
freedoms if you think that for our
better life isn't enough I don't want to
mess around with that attachment for the
extra 4 hours the x2 are the way to go
if you currently only original X's or
the X 2's and they've been staying on
your head perfectly fine I'd say stay
where you are so that's it for this
versus or comparison video be sure to
like and comment below let me know if
you do own the X series of earphones and
how do you really like them be sure to
subscribe if you haven't done so already

Instagram I'm Jimmy with Jim's Ruby room

decision you guys take care I'll see you
