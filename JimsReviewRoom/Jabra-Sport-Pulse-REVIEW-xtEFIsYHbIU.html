review room as you guys know I love
testing things that are really unique
especially when it revolves around
fitness for the average Joe like myself
now I bought these draw or sport pulse
earbuds for $200 at the time of this
video and these can read your heart rate
in real time and of course the app has
some features to utilize this technology
now granted yes they're very expensive
for some earbuds but what it can do in
theory sounds really promising now I'll
go into of course its sound quality but
more importantly the app's features to
help you make a purchase decision so
without further ado welcome to another
review going over the physical features
first these are wireless Bluetooth
earbuds not to mention they're also
built to withstand military tested
weather in shock standards so if you're
calling to rain running you won't ruin
these earbuds now in the Box they do
come with your assortment of fittings
which are higher in quality than the job
or Sport+
I tested about a month or so back
there's four different sizes of ear tips
in total ranging from extra small to
large and four different ear wings now I
personally wear the small tip with
surprisingly the large wing and this
really stays well in my ear during
workouts and exercises jogging and
vigorously running has never caused the
ear buds to come off the ear and for
those who are wondering the ear tips
even the extra small ones does not sit
in the ear canal and causes that suction
you can say when you pull it back out
but it sits on the opening of the ear
canal and it's seated very well it's a
very nice subtle press against your
opening giving sound isolation and peace
of mind these earbuds are staying in one
place not on the left earbud is the
heart rate monitor itself and I suspect
the HR monitor uses a technology that
we've most likely seen before now
remember those fingertip probes or
earlobe clips used in hospitals this
looks to be a very similar if not the
same technology in Java if you're
watching this let us know this reads the
oxygen levels with each heartbeat using
infrared and red light and as our
heartbeat pumps blood the oxygen levels
fluctuate like a waveform so in turn the
HR monitor reads the peaks and valleys
of the waveform
essentially providing us our heartbeat
on the app but I'll leave some
information on screen and if you need to
pause it please feel free to do so but
getting back on track here the ends of
the air buds are very secure with
reinforced plastics to prevent wires
from disconnecting or fraying over time
and last is what Jabra calls the sport
button that you tap to pause or start a
workout but more on the app shortly
though now going to the right earbud is
simply your micro USB port hidden and
protected by the ear wing and used to
charge the Jabra with the supplied
microUSB cable now moving down features
your inline volume controller with a
pause play button which can also be used
to answer incoming phone calls no
conversations are clear enough with no
complaints on my end or the person on
the other side in the last physical item
although these sound pulse is very
durable from my testing throwing these
into my bag my car and literally bring
these everywhere
Jabra does provide a small protective
case which is very well done in my
opinion it's still pliable but it's firm
to protect the contents inside but for
the moment that you've been waiting for
going over audio quality first then the
app considering that you're paying close
to $200 you hope the sound quality is
great too now the audio is very clear no
Distortion and it's very pleasurable to
listen to now comparing to the jaybird
Bluebird X's I have laying around here
which I believe has exceptional audio
quality for fitness earbuds there's just
enough base on these job boards to say
most people will be satisfied it's only
a slight hear lower compared to DJ birds
but overall the sound quality is very
balanced accurate in my opinion without
a other sound fields droning each other
out in general the audio quality is
great for all genres from let's say pop
and hip-hop to rock and alternative
music and not to mention classical as
well mid-range is good with highs enough
to not be ear ringing you can listen to
these for several hours and you won't
have hearing fatigue the rap will sound
good as well with just enough bass as
stated earlier for most people but if
your focus is on bass though and you
could care less about the heart
monitoring feature for sure try the $200
powerbeats2 i also reviewed on my
channel now let's dominate on bass but
it's perfect for those bass heads out
there
now jumping into the app it is available
for both Apple and Android powered
devices / Jabra you start in the main
page where you pre select what you're
planning on doing for recording and
monitoring every time an attack left
shows your heart rate detected and on
the top right shows your GPS strength on
your device now going down the list here
activity is your first option giving you
a list of common cardio exercises from
cycling to skating and skiing to the
most popular of course running and
walking now you can create your own from
the top right icon and label your own
activity to help keep things organized
now selecting an activity doesn't really
impact how the heart beat or the other
data is recorded now backing out and
moving on to the next setting you select
your type of workout just track me
literally record what you're doing from
distance pace heart rate etc but I'll
show you that screen very soon here but
to challenge yourself you can select a
target that you want to reach whether
you want to run a certain distance and
let Jabra tell you how far you have left
during your jog to when you finally
reach their goal you can tell how much
time you want to spend on your trail -
how many calories you want to burn and
yes when selecting these options in the
next several that I'll go over here a
female voice in the earbud comes out
periodically and tells you that you're
halfway to your goal or that you've
reached your goal etc but remember that
button that I told you about on that
left ear button it's that sport button
well it's actually on the fly
information now during your run instead
of pulling out your phone press that
button and that nice female voice will
come on and read out your current
heartbeat per minutes your distance
what heart rate zone that you're in and
how much time you've been in this
particular workout very convenient now
backing out of this menu you have target
pace which is pretty much
self-explanatory but the next option
zone training is ideal for those who
want to keep their heart within a
certain level to ensure you're either
burning fat or if you're training for a
marathon and want to improve your
cardiovascular fitness staying in cardio
or zone 3 is a must and that's what
makes heart rate monitoring so
beneficial now if I want to burn off
some fat let's say during my exercise
how many times have I slowed down and
taken a breather
well when the heart rate drops to that
level where it's not working as hard as
it should
you're really not being a
with your time and effort and as stated
earlier that female voice will come over
your earbuds lower your background music
and advised you're in a lower heart rate
zone and that you need to pick it up
it's like a coaching your ears
monitoring your internals to keep you
going rather than stopping every so
often to check your pulse
the last option here the last workout
option is interval training to select
which heart rate zone you want to be in
in for how long and just for an example
I warm up for about five minutes get
into that fat-burning zone for ten focus
on my cardio for 15 minutes go all out
for five and then down to a more resting
area where I'm still burning fat but
able to catch my breath in Zone two
again that's just an example of what you
can do and again Jabra over your earbuds
will coach you when to switch to your
different zones and remind you to stay
there now backing out to the main home
page music is the next option which I
felt greatly disappointed it doesn't let
me play Pandora or iHeartRadio which I
listen to all the time at least with my
Apple device I tried playing Pandora
first but as soon as I start a workout
it stops and starts my local music store
that my device now I didn't have a way
to play music from my other desired apps
now there's a fix or if I'm doing
something wrong let me know in the
comments below but I've tried several
variations and had no success and last
is to adjust the view or how the app
looks while you're working out which is
pretty much against self-explanatory but
I'll just go ahead here and show you how
the app functions now as soon as you
press start a countdown begins and soon
you'll find yourself in your workout
with real-time data now starting from
the left is your local music playlist
which you can change songs at will but
scrolling to the next page reveals your
heart rate and distance traveled in big
font now the great option that driver
offers is options to change the display
instead of distance you can easily
change this to any of the following by
just tapping on it the next screen shows
again your heart rate up top with time
distance pace and heart rate zone that
you're currently in again all these
items are customizable to your liking
and the last page here is a map
indicating where you have ran and again
your beats per minutes and I'm aware the
map isn't showing to accurate since the
GPS signal was pretty sparse in this
particular park that I was
now as soon as you click stop here that
Jabra app does provide insight on any
records that you have broken or any
athlete that you may have achieved for
yourself and then the final screen here
provides a summary of your actions and
numbers and clicking on the arrow next
to analysis reveals a line chart of how
your heart rate fluctuated and if I went
a bit faster be sure to go back in this
video and pause to view the screens but
other than that that's basically the app
and its features now some things to tie
up this video the better life with music
playing at 50% volume the entire time to
get a good bounce measurement was five
hours and exactly ten minutes it's a bit
on the low side considering other
premium Bluetooth earbuds can go around
seven to eight hours of news now the
range is very good though I stood on one
side of the house with the earbuds in
and was able to achieve a maximum of 40
linear feet with no loss in signal I
didn't go outside thinking forty feet is
a reasonable area for a person to set
their phone down while working out but
overall I'm always a big fan of heart
rate monitoring and training as it is
effective now what job are providing
these coaching features it's I believe a
great way to keep you going and pushing
you when you need it but regarding its
price is it worth it to you let me know
in the comments below what you think and
just for an alternative check out my
video the pair sports for $100 which has
similar app features but it uses a chest
heartrate monitor instead so I hope this
video helped you in some way if you do
like my work be sure to like subscribe
and follow me on facebook twitter and
google+ as every little bit helps and
bring you more content like this so this
is Jimmy with Jim's review room you guys
take care bye
