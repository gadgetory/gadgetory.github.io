room welcome back to another one of my
videos I've been saying it for the last
several months voice-activated smart
devices are gonna be a really big thing
going into 2018 I can't wait to the days
where we have speakers like built into
the walls and the ceiling and such we
can walk around like Iron Man just
calling up Jarvis or something like that
but anyways in the meantime we've got
this puppy right here this is the Harman
Kardon allure this retails for two
hundred and forty-nine dollars
completely on sale right now for 199 as
always I placed my affiliate links down
in that video description below click on
those links as they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
also as always being transparent with
you guys
Harman Kardon Vista sent us over a
review my assessment was not altered in
any way please watch the entire video
for both pros and cons all right I'm
Jimmy with James review I'm here to help
you make that purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review
all right folks going over the physical
features first this thing looks really
good really sleek really modern maybe
something you'll find in John wicks home
who knows but the reason being is
because it's all black it's aluminum
down here we got this clear looking dome
up top and it is hard plastic it's like
an acrylic material that is and it's
pretty thick I don't foresee a cracking
or breaking or so keep in mind this is
not a portable Bluetooth speaker this is
meant to be stationary there's no
built-in battery so if you guys are
keeping this stationary in one room or
so you don't have a crazy kid like I do
or maybe a pet that's in wild and crazy
I think you should be perfectly fun but
other than that again gorgeous aluminum
feel all the way around there's
perforations or little holes all the way
around here and it's not just for
aesthetics because there's three
individual drivers all the way around
the speaker to give you 360 degree
audio which will demonstrate shortly and
the very bottom there is a system whoops
this blasting audio down here and again
because the speaker is slightly elevated
it's gonna give you that bass response
that's evenly distributed for all sorts
of room types on top we'll go over the
physical buttons I just pressed the mute
button so that way you don't activate
Alexa just in case on the very top here
there's vom control buttons a first one
if when we first got this for a couple
of days it was a little not as intuitive
as we thought it would be eventually
were trying to swipe it over so that's
pretty cool and such once what we did
have a little bit of trouble we got
better at it just took a little bit of
time to get used to you can hold the bun
I found out to basically lower and
increase volume but why are we using
these physical buttons this is a
voice-activated speaker you can see the
command and have it just Alexa von five
and they're going goes to 50% I'm sorry
if I'm activating your speakers at home
is probably the last time hopefully the
last time I mention her name
bother that going over to the side
there's your Bluetooth button here
pretty discreet I'm surprised they put
it back here not on top or so this does
have Wi-Fi this does have bluetooth but
I get more into that pretty shortly here
but other than that there's no other
physical features it's no NFC for easy
pairing with your phone via bluetooth
unfortunately and also there's no
three-and-a-half millimeter ports for
you to physically connect a device to
have this play but again as I stated
earlier that is Wi-Fi you have to have
Wi-Fi for Alexa to work here to use
those voice commands and if you for
Somers they don't want to use Wi-Fi you
don't want to use the online services to
stream like Spotify Pandora iHeartRadio
and such tune in you can use bluetooth
that is available right off of your
phone the business that we got was
perfectly fine we put this at the end of
the office walk to the other side of the
office and it's about 4045 linear feet
to the next wall and no big deals
whatsoever
no the only limitations I guess you can
say although this is Wi-Fi enabled
although the Amazon speakers have multi
room capabilities you don't have that
with this one you can't have multiple
alors or multiple other elect so devices
and have them all play audio at the same
time now the other issue that I found
here was unfortunately if I am on my
phone and you're playing music here
sorry about that
watch beeping but for playing music so
and let's say I decide to make a phone
call or I receive a phone call although
there's built-in mics for the the voice
activation feature it disconnects and my
voice call goes to here basically you
cannot use this for phone calls
now those two limitations Harman Kardon
said that those are limitations for now
there might be a firmware down the road
can see it on their website this and
maybe so we'll see what we'll find out
sooner or later
other than that that's really about it I
do wish that there was a physical
connection Jessica said I want to
physically connect this device and I'm
saying would be nice just to tap my
phone to connect other than that that's
really about it the app itself is just
really straightforward just use that
you basically set up your device and
connect elect so if your Wi-Fi you can't
adjust or customize the LEDs this is
definitely not like a JBL pulse tree
where you get rainbow or crap-ton of
cones we can customize it does glow this
really nice ambient kind of like this
grayish tone white tone which looks
really cool I really like it and that's
really it about the LEDs now regarding
Amazon's performance with voice
activating speakers sometimes it has
trouble picking up your voice not with
us completely off obviously and having
it in the back of the room you can walk
in any distance talking a mostly
relatively normal voice and the allure
is still able to pick up your voice in
your voice commands
now with the even my Amazon echo that's
in the back over there usually at 70
percent volume I usually cannot activate
the voice activation fee I can't say
elec so you know turned down or turn off
or next song and such which is very
unfortunate with this one I've noticed
70 percent volume I'm able to stand
pretty far back about 15 feet 20 feet
back and speaking a slightly elevated
voice to an elevated voice and still
activate with that I'm yelling like
crazy and I can't basically turn it off
or stop the music or sip to the next
track so that's one benefit with the
allured here the voice the before wave
far-field microphones is what they call
it does work really well ii I don't know
if this is a Bluetooth thing or an Alexa
thing here but when I'm playing music
especially via bluetooth on my phone and
I say Alexa skip to the next song it
unfortunately doesn't so that's
something to be aware about as well of
course you can do that over Wi-Fi you
can do that with like Amazon music and
the other programs or services that you
might subscribe to you but over
Bluetooth you do yeah you do encounter
that limitation
it's alright folks let me jump into the
audio test please again put on your
headphones or earphones for the most
accurate representation her demo of this
product here and again if you guys can
please show you support by like and
subscribing and following me I'm my
personal social media account at Jimmy
long official and or Jim's review room
all right folks get ready
alright test test one two
three hopefully this sounds good to you
guys make sure we got your headphones or
earphones on yeah number one
Oh
and there you have folks hopefully you
guys enjoyed that please again please
show your support by liking subscribing
and coming down below throw me some a
fire emojis that always does help as
well so the audio Almont it sounds
pretty darn good
comparing I know there's not apples to
apples but I did have my sony xba-40 i
know got it somewhere around here I
didn't use this to I don't wanna say do
a head-to-head comparison but just more
as reference on seeing word of the
stands and also my JBL extreme Bose
sound both sound like revolt plus this
sounds a little bit better than all
these other Bluetooth speakers it does
offer a little bit more bass or cleaner
basement is even compared to the extreme
or the XP 40 this does get loud at 70%
vomits able to fill up a large room and
we do have a large open area here it
does lose a little bit of detail once it
get up to that maximum level but other
than that most people will most likely
be blasting this probably at 7% but I'm
pretty sure confident about that it also
does sound a little more brighter or
airier a little bit more forward and
open overall very clean sound very
detailed sound highs never ever singing
never ever ear ringing minimal listening
fatigue overall love the audio signature
for the price it is comparable again I'm
just comparing two Bluetooth speakers
again using it as a reference that is
sounded great the only problem the only
only problem here regarding audio that
I've encountered is if you're watching
movies on this for some reason it was
out of sync for me I tested this on my
samsung s A+ and just simply just plain
Netflix really ever have this issue but
the lips were moving and flapping and
then the audio was coming either a head
or beforehand either where it just
wasn't synced so over all right guys
that's the Harman Kardon on lore hope
you guys enjoyed this review hopefully
it helped you in some way I can keep me
in mind
Jin's review room is here to help you
make that purchase decision you guys
take care now catch you guys
