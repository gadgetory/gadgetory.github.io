series you guys know I like fancy stuff
out there a lot of reviews are done or
revolves around expensive items but
there might be times you find some good
products for a hell of a lot cheaper now
some of you guys asked me to review this
so thank you very much this is the
omae's go mini priced at $59 but use my
affiliate links down in that better
description below they're currently
taking $20 off making this speaker only
$39 at the time this video not being
transparent I did reach out to them and
request for review units but you guys
know my assessment was not altered in
any way for those who have been found me
for quite some time you guys know I go
through both pros and cons I don't Jim E
when Jim's review room and I'm here to
help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone
going over the physical features first
if you eventually decide to buy this get
the black model it looks sleek it
complements the LEDs and it's black
black everything right but all
seriousness that's a quality built
speaker when you pick it up there's some
weight to it and a plastics aren't very
tough here it feels durable and a
speaker doesn't feel hollow it's
actually quite dense now the speaker
itself has an ipx7 rating meaning you
can submerge this underwater just like
the main some brands out there like JBL
or Sony now at Esopus and the speaker
still works after dunking this thing if
you have been following me most of the
previous budget speakers at least
recently that I've tested so far they
can only be sprayed on if those fall
into the pool it's basically game over
getting a closer look pause and play is
on your left if you hold this down the
LEDs do turn off volume up and down is
next but if you hold them down for a
couple seconds they do go back and
forward on your music and into the far
right is basically your power button
that turns on and off the speaker and
also when you turn on the speaker it
automatically goes into pairing mode
now keep in mind this figure only pairs
through one device at a time so if
you're switching from your phone and
then to your PC it might be a little bit
of a nuisance since you have the unpair
and then re pair don't last on the front
there is a battery level indicator which
is always a plus and then rotating to
the side there is simply your micro USB
port for charging and a three-and-a-half
millimeter port for inputs for your
physical connections a touching base on
battery life omae's claims up to twelve
hours of battery life which is good for
the small bluetooth category doing my
test a 50 percent bond with the LEDs on
I was able to get 10 hours and 43
minutes worth of use as for wireless
performance the go mini has bluetooth
4.2 and testing this here at the office
I'm able to get about a 78 linear feet
of distance and you're also able to pair
two of these speakers together for
stereo performance and honestly with any
speakers that you can pair together like
this for stereo separation the audio
experience is much more full with my
experience amazing needs a dedicated ad
button or a stereo sync button I have to
disconnect my phone first from this
speaker to get this basically back into
pairing mode let the speaker see each
other and then repair them back to my
phone it's not as intuitive or
streamlined but it does work I tested
this with video with YouTube
specifically it starts off being in sync
with the lips and such and then it goes
unsynched and then it goes back and
forth to a Talos in between same thing
with Netflix this well Netflix is off by
about a millisecond or so it's not that
great with Bluetooth connection or
wireless connections in video now last
but not least are the LEDs this is one
of the biggest reason why you would
choose this speaker over anything else
there's not many mainstream speakers
offering colors and if they do it's much
more expensive omae's gives you the LED
lights that fades to different colors
and then strobe lights that pulsates to
the beat and highlights the speaker's
behind the grille it's flashy to say the
least here and it is bright though it
would have been nice though to have some
some options to maybe change the colors
even a fixed color to accent the room
your favorite color that is etc even
without using an app maybe again another
button up top here so that's it folks
aside from the lights if you're looking
for your speaker's simply for audio and
a peace of mind for it to be waterproof
and the lights is something that you
want this might be for you but let's
listen to the audio test before we
officially make judgement as always
folks follow me on Facebook Twitter and
or Instagram those links are in the
video description find me on social
media and of course fire emojis down
below alright there you go folks
alright folks make sure you have your
headphones or earphones I'm gonna start
really soon here that's how you're gonna
get the best audio test experience here
it goes
Misha's off suit is on point won't cause
a scene
thank you know why I almost forgotten
this review was the carrying handle I
wanted to mention that it is very
convenient here and it doesn't flex
there's no creaking and cracking it's
very very durable very sturdy right here
anyways that's the audio test for you
guys and getting into the audio
assessment the omae's go mini sounds as
loud as my JBL flip four and once again
hands down much cleaner and better than
these sony xba-1
it's able to fill small rooms and enough
for medium sized rooms or fer those
simply looking for some sort of audio in
their garage or just slightly bigger
open areas overall the omae's provides
very good balanced audio in my opinion
it's not base E and that's super-bright
either this provides a more neutral
performance all around and never becomes
distorted droning or raspy that's not to
say the speaker is weak by any means but
the bass is just enough for casual
listening and enjoyment now as for the
mid range although I do personally
prefer a more for mid-range like the JBL
speakers the audio quality is clean and
pronounced with omae's it is neutral
easy to listen to no distortion from
other frequencies and sounded pleasing
the upper mid-range and heading into the
high frequencies in general did well in
my opinion if anything genres are rock
works out great for those guitar riffs
snares and those cymbal crashes up top
and it's just not recessed like many
speakers I've been testing recently it's
quite refreshing to hear that it's not
the best speaker in the world just want
to clarify they don't want to over hide
this but for the price for the audio
that is outputs there's a lot of bang
for the buck if you're on a budget and
just needing confirmed good quality
audio my test proves that if you can get
it on sale right now I highly recommend
this speaker alright folks follow me on
social media all the links are in the
video description below you guys take
care and I'll catch you guys on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
