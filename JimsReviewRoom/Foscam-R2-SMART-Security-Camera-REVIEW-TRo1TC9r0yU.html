Jimmy with Jim's review room it's been a
long time since I reviewed a smart
camera I've done reviews on the nest cam
and largest circle which have been
amazing cameras themselves and a few
cheaper models were some were okay and
some were just duds
now foscam just came up with their
newest model the r2b which I got off of
Amazon for just 129 dollars at the time
this video and comparing to the
competition and what features are
offered that's a pretty good deal but as
always we have to see how it performs as
always I'll place my affiliate links in
the video description below click on
that then it will provide you with
real-time updated prices for today I
also put the links for the nest cam and
a larger circle in there for you too so
without further adieu I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room welcome everyone to
another review going over the physical
features this thing stands almost 5
inches tall and a width of about 3
inches keeping the entire unit compact
with a stealthy matte black look now
it's much smaller than d-link and most
other motorized rotating based cameras
out there including other faust camp
cameras overall build quality it's not
too light to feel cheap or risk of
falling off the table if you ever bump
it but it's definitely not heavy either
in general it's been a quality product
now on the front is your camera lens
offered up to a 1080p resolution which
I'll show soon and then rotating to the
rear here there is a speakerphone and
microphone combination allowing you to
speak into your camera or your phone and
have two-way audio here's a quick sample
phone call and I'm also speaking in a
pretty natural tone not too loud not too
soft either I can hear the audio just
transferring to the speakerphone Ali
foscam itself it's very very clear so
hope you guys enjoyed this and enjoyed
the video
is all either but this should give you
an idea how will Michael for how much
facing really it picks up in about fifty
big wait I get all this audio is on edge
and this is about ten feet away to get
just speaking naturally how loud how
well that micron can pick up my voice
with the camera side again audio moving
on towards the bottom left you have your
wall power adapter in the middle you can
have a LAN cable connect directly to
your router for a more secure and stable
connection and to the right which I'm
never too fond of is an external antenna
looking at the other side we have a
microSD card slot so you can locally
store your videos on the camera itself
here the camera will continuously record
your video and once the card is full
it'll delete your old files and record
the new one causing a continuous loop
now some people will say there's no
point since the camera could get stolen
during a robbery or if there was a fire
on the video would be lost anyways the
foscam does offer cloud recording for a
monthly subscription very similar to
many other brands at the market and I'm
already up in arms with monthly bills
when compared to the competition foscam
is almost 50% cheaper with the lowest
option of four dollars per month and up
to about eleven dollars a month for
their most extensive package and one
last thing here foscam does offer a wall
mount in the package with drywall screws
if you intend I'm mounting this up high
somewhere but let's take a look at the
app now and I'll demonstrate the video
performance as well several things to
get out of the way first foscam like
many other smart cameras offers push
notifications whenever the camera senses
movement you will receive a notification
on your phone indicating so now this can
also send sound if there's a registered
noise again you will be alerted and you
can turn either setting off if you'd
like now looking at the home page here
you can have more than one camera
connected the camera will only display a
preview which sometimes I've noticed it
doesn't change it doesn't update itself
now you have to tap on the play button
to see the live feed on the top right
there's cloud recording if you've paid
for the subscription the alert screen
which gives you all the dates and times
of movements detected which is great but
unfortunately this provides only the 24
hour time stamp so those who are
familiar would have to convert it to get
a sense of when the event happened now I
also notice while on the screen here you
don't automatically get a preview of
what caused the event with nest cam when
there is movement though the nest cam
will send a photo with your
push notification that we don't have to
go through the steps of opening your app
to verify what had happened by the time
you have opened the app your child might
have moved off the screen or the burglar
might have moved on to a different room
however one of the biggest features
though when you are watching your live
feed you can manually take a photo of
the live video or record the video at
will not many other mainstream cameras
offers this feature and less going to
the main page again on the bottom right
is your camera and for personal
interests there's public cameras in
which most of them are from China it
looks like and you can people watch
there so let's take a look at the camera
performance here here's actual video and
it's not edited whatsoever here keep in
mind I'm in the process of painting my
house so things are all over the place
right now the 1080 image for a smart
camera here it looks very good
and considering foscam is claiming to
have 110 degrees of field of vision
that's nearly as wide as the logitech
circle or the nest cam which they claim
to have 130 degrees field of vision and
something modern but it's still a very
positive note here you don't have that
fisheye lens where the edge of the image
is bowed or rounded but overall the
camera has been very smooth and the time
I move my arms and move about to the
time I see it on my cell phone has been
maybe about a three to five-second delay
not too bad the colors look accurate and
amazing for a security camera and more
importantly at least in my house here
the connection has remained very stable
now the other feature that I'm sure
you've been waiting for and why you
would consider the RGB model is the
rotating base now having experience with
the d-link model in the past using the
controls on the phone had a serious
delay and getting the right angle is
just a serious pain with the foscam the
controls are one of the better ones as
it's not overly sensitive there is a
slight delay though but it feels as soon
as you let go the camera almost
instantly stops moving so you won't
overshoot what you're aiming for and
last will be field of vision into
consideration and the amount of rotation
the camera offers you can have full 360
degree of vision or basically rotation
and if you're needing vertical movement
this can look perfectly straight up into
the air here and with pointing it down
it's not a full 45 degrees but the video
I'm showing you should give you an idea
of how much it can pan vertically and
very less is the nighttime performance
which everything about this camera so
far has seemed fine the resolution at
night here as you can see it looks great
pretending to sleep around here you can
get an idea of how visible my face can
be and at the same time here walking
all the way back into the kitchen about
35 linear feet or so away from the
camera right now you can see how less
visible that can be and just for
comparison purposes the logitech circle
here is shown as well now the only other
real issue that I've noticed the camera
had trouble with dim lighting and when
most other cameras will switch from
nighttime to daytime mode when there is
just enough sunlight peeking through
here
the foscam will stay in night vision
mode and so there's pretty ample amount
of lighting coming through the windows
and it doors not a huge issue but it
would have been nice to have the auto
setting feature work a bit better or
work on par as the competitors out there
so overall to conclude here the foscam
are to be a seriously a great camera for
how it performs and what features it
offers when you take price into
consideration including the cheap cloud
services it really makes this one of the
most underrated cameras out there at
this price range so I hope this review
