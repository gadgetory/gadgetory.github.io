room Fitbit is trying to nail that
segment in regards to price point
offering a screen and utilizing the
excellent app that has been with Fitbit
since the beginning now when you look at
the jawbone up - or the Garmin vivofit
competition is tight and not to mention
that V will fit three should be released
about a month from now now I personally
pay for this at the retail price of one
hundred and twenty nine dollars as of
this video but I'll place my affiliate
links in the video description below
you guys can click on those and check
for the most updated prices so without
further ado my channel is here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's reading
go over the physical features first
aesthetically the alter subtle it's very
casual but still very modern the band
uses snap-on buns which are very stiff
to lock into place and I do admit I do
prefer a watch stop buckle that's easier
to use and easy to put on versus the
locking nubs here either way this thing
stays on my wrist very well and the
entire time of testing and wearing this
I never had the band undo on me now one
of the biggest things to point out the
bands are swappable for various colors
or other materials with a very easy to
use release lever on the rear but what
is more important that I noticed here
the brains of the alta is one single
unit and it's not physically fixed to
the band itself over time we have seen a
small handful of fitbit's here where
there's gaps exposed the adhesive
becomes unglued and other quality issues
again it's a very small amount but we
have seen it you can do a google search
yourself
now with the Alta I don't foresee that
happening now same regarding the screen
has been virtually scratch free with no
micro scratches at all so far so good
but let's take a look at the screen here
and see what is offered the first thing
to address unfortunately outdoors on a
sunny day the screen is somewhat tough
to see though but indoors an initiate of
course it looks perfectly fine to turn
on the screen there's a very responsive
Auto sensing feature just basically turn
and twist your wrist here just like
you're looking at a watch and the screen
turns on automatically or you can always
double tap the screen here and it must
say I wish the tapping was more
sensitive though tapping pretty firm -
sometimes even hard was required for me
to flip through the screens as you might
see here in a demonstration but first up
there's five vertical displays that you
see in the video here you can see which
one you prefer and you can change the
orientation through the app and there's
another five options here that you can
choose from pause the video if you guys
need to now first up is your date and
time next is the amount of steps you
have done so far estimated distance
calories burned minutes you were
actually active the battery indicator
and if you have a vibrating alarm this
will show here now regarding the
vibrating alarm I know a lot of people
ask for this it does work but I did feel
it was on a light side compared to other
activity bands in the market here so if
you're a heavy sleeper I wouldn't really
rely on this too much though and last
regarding the physical features this is
sweat rain and splash proof and you
can't wear this well swimming which at
this price point most bands even some of
the more expensive ones not all of them
you can
where them in the water anyways now
charging the band is very easy to do
just use the clamping USB wire here and
Fitbit is claiming up to five days of
use from my experience surprisingly I've
gotten eight days out of one charge here
I thought this was a good anomaly but I
checked the verge wearable comm as well
and several other sites surprisingly
their average around seven days so for
those who are not aware the average for
mainstream activity bands do range
anywhere from five to seven days
so the Alta is doing great being on the
upper end now one of the last physical
features the Alta is able to notify you
of text messages it displays the phone
number of who's calling in or the name
of your saved contact and calendar
events and alerts to keep in mind the
messages shows once and after that it
disappears and you can't pause the
scrolling to catch up and reread it's
more of a light notification system to
be honest with you but that's it for the
physical features here the physical band
is only 50% of the experience compiling
all this data to use and understand is
as important so let's take a look at the
app on the main page it's very simple to
read with a huge list of all of your
metrics you need to review
there's primers shown by numbers with
your goals designated on the right side
and almost all of your metrics has a
color-coded bar here going horizontally
changing color as you progress now steps
are shown beats per minute would be
displayed here but the Alta does not
have a built-in heart rate monitor
comparing again to the other main
competitors the up to and the Garmin
vivofit 3 they both don't have HR
sensors either and next is an indicator
if you have taken at least 250 steps
each hour throughout the day more on
that a little bit later now moving down
distance calories burned active minutes
are displayed here track your exercise
is where you go to initiate either a
walk run or hike and your phone's GPS
will track your distance and pace again
the Alta doesn't have GPS built in now a
supplemental feature is the Alta has
this thing called smart track now this
will automatically record your specific
activity and Auto log it for you now
with smart track you do have to do that
activity for at least 10 minutes before
it's recorded on to the app so just a
heads-up on that if you do a workout for
less it won't record but the activities
that it can detect here or on your
screen right now
now moving back to the main page you can
manually track your weight or use the
Fitbit smart scale like the other fib
activity bands here this also does
automatically detect your sleep and from
my experience it has been very accurate
for normal use now I did go see a movie
this past weekend here and for a brief
moment I did believe it did record me as
sleeping now it's rare that this
happened here and again it's only for
unique situations like so but sitting at
my desk all day it hasn't been any
hasn't shown any problems at all now
moving down to the last few parts here
you can track your food intake very
similar to MyFitnessPal for food logging
and last and this is very much
underrated you can log in your water
intake throughout the day but looking at
all these categories here on an
individual basis let's take a look at
steps for example Fitbit has always
provided here so much data for anyone to
review and very easy to read bar graph
up top to compare your week here and
below are your absolute numbers and
stars on the right here indicating if
you've beaten your goals or not now
going back to the main screen about that
250 steps the alter from time to time
will remind you to get up and move it
will vibrate your wrist as well which is
a fantastic feature similar to garments
but with Fitbit it does go a bit further
insisting that you take at least 250
steps each hour with my chart you can
see how active I was through the main
part of the day and all this can be
adjusted here but it's a nice set of
data to help you see if you should be
more active or basically see how
inactive you are and you can see on this
chart on Thursday or Friday here
basically I'll just working at my office
I didn't get up and move I barely did so
I need to fix that obviously but getting
back onto the main screen here once
again distance calories burned and
active minutes looks practically the
same but I want to touch base on sleep
it's for the most part accurate with
basic sleep analysis detailing how long
you slept for how many times you woke up
in moments you were restless but the
data is good for a generic tracker as
most tracker displays very similar
information but for those who looking
for something much deeper looking
through the jump up 3 that is or the
basis peak now going back again here to
the main page Fitbit does offer a good
variety of extra features and the menu
options that you have challenges you can
try to overcome here and earn badges and
random accolades backing out if you have
friends with fitbit's you can compare
your numbers with theirs and basically
to have a friendly competition and the
only other area that I would really want
to show you guys is the silent vibrating
alarms this work
great and surprisingly some of the other
activity bands don't even offer this
what I'm talking about
you can schedule individual days while
other bands you can only set them for
maybe just weekdays or just weekends
again with Fitbit you do have a little
bit more flexibility so with the Alta
here I believe it's still future packed
some of the main features that I've seen
on the charge and a charge HR that is
missing is basically the count for
floors climbed of course there's no
heart rate monitor there's no GPS and
we're still not waterproof but being
fair here the other bands again the
charge charge HR and the surges well the
blaze all those corresponds with their
price point and offers those features I
just mentioned so for the low $100 range
comparing through the other competitors
I believe it offers very similar
features so in my opinion the Alta does
well I think the consumer just needs to
make the determination
do you like the Fitbit app and the
Fitbit ecosystem of features and the
other factor here is is if you like the
physical style other than that this is
not groundbreaking but a perfect
alternative or option that's available
on the market so that's it for this
