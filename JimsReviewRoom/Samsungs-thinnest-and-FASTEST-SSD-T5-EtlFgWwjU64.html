speed and more importantly efficiency
has been one the biggest things I focus
on behind the scenes you guys seen the
shots that I do the amount of effort and
you can only imagine the amount of time
it takes to push out just one video
speed and efficiency is key to my
channel so today I want to show you a
product that I've been personally using
for the last several weeks on the job
and in the field it's the Samsung t5
portable hard drive as always being
transparent with you guys Samsung
graciously reached out to me to help do
a giveaway sponsoring this video to give
you a chance to win your own 500 gig t5
external SSD the giveaway details later
in this video so why am i big on
external hard drives one my laptops only
have 256 gigs in them - besides cloud
storage I always keep a physical backup
and third there are times when we're on
the go like last week while we're in New
York filming we needed something
portable so the Samsung t5 is crazy
small it fits in the palm of my hands
here ultra lightweight yet durable for
what I do
with its a little bit of casing I also
want to mention because the t5 is a
solid-state drive there's no moving
parts on like a platter or spinning hard
drive because so the t5 is shockproof
from up to 6 and a half feet now two
cables are included one with USB type-c
on both ends and the other cord has
type-c and USB 3.1 now for us with our
huge amounts of footage that we use the
repetitive takes that we record to make
sure we have the perfect scene we're
always backing up periodically
throughout the day on site no no what
about the t5 connect and we're good to
go
they come in 250 and 500 gigs or one and
two terabyte models are also available
there's optional 256-bit hardware
encryption to keep your stuff secure
with no password recovery and last I
wouldn't say this if it wasn't true but
the t5 external hard drive is faster
than the current one that I own in real
world testing I'm getting between 240 to
260 megabytes per second in transfer
speeds and the other hard drive that I
own Sam some what let me say who the
competitors but they're getting around
120 to 140 megabytes per second
practically double shaving our upload
times
in half so in the end with the time that
I save I wait less on file transfers I
shoot more footage and that example of
me in New York
every minute counted as we were only
shooting film for that one day the t5 is
one of the many tools at the studio so
that's it for this video as for the
giveaway go into my video description
there's a link that Samsung has provided
asking you to simply like their Facebook
page for a chance to win a 500 gigabyte
model on this t5 hard drive and while
you're there as always be sure to follow
me as well at gyms review room you guys
take care and I'll see you on the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
