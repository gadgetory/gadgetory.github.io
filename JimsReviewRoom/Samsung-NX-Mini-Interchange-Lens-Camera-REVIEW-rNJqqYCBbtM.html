review room welcome to another review
now it seems like Samsung is everywhere
these days with new products coming out
left and right and today I have the
latest Samsung interchangeable lens
camera this is the Samsung NX mini with
a nine to 27 millimeter lens
it's priced at $4.99 on sale or 549
dollars retail at the time of this video
and it does make it on par you can say
with the other competitors out there so
without further adieu we'll get started
the NX mini in my opinion aims for
consumers not wanting to carry such a
big camera like a Nikon or Canon DSLR
but still take amazing photos over those
regular point shoot cameras the NX mini
is an ultra compact camera and it's only
at twenty two and a half millimeters
thin and it weighs only at 158 grams by
itself now I do admit with the kit lens
that supplied by Samsung it does give it
a bit more weight making it front heavy
and unable to stand upright when you
rest this on a flat surface
overall the camera is beautiful in my
opinion it looks modern yet simple the
entire body is made of this leather
textured like plastic with brushed
aluminum on top and although it looks
top notched I noticed a faint fletcher
squeak on the front bottom though now
the lens on the other hand is very solid
and has an amazing fit and finish all
around the lens and these type of
cameras allows you to manually zoom in
and out and I found in nine to twenty
seven millimeter lens that came with
this camera is possibly the closest to a
point-and-shoot camera where it's the
most universal for most situations
now the NX mini does offer a tilt screen
where you can take selfies and also has
a built-in sensor where if you wink at
the camera it can take a image two
seconds later that way any time you take
a picture of yourself it makes it
convenient to snap now on top here it
does feature your button to snap your
photo of course power on and off and
direct link which opens a menu to select
how you want to share your photos now
because the NX mini does have a built-in
Wi-Fi and near-field communication
features you can send your photos
directly to either your compatible
smartphone or tablet now if you download
the Samsung app you can also use your
smart phone like a remote control to
snap photos from a distance which comes
in
and II now the back here features
similar button layouts as most point and
shoot cameras while to the left here has
a beautiful 3 inch display which is one
of the smoothest screws I've ever seen
colors are rich on the screen and all
interactions and movements happen in
pretty much real-time the only downside
though the screen does get very hard to
see when you're in direct sunlight
now this NX mini does come with a
separate flash adapter that you can
attach on top but it found the built-in
flash was good enough in most cases and
in both cases the attachable flash still
gave that glaring white look though now
moving on to these side internals
there's a mini HDMI for displaying
images onto your TV and a microUSB port
for charging the NX mini with a supplied
wall charger now this camera does come
with a two thousand three hundred and
thirty million battery which is good up
to five hundred and thirty shots per
Samsung and last on the side here is a
micro SD card slot and at first I really
didn't like Samsung going with a micro
SD format since most of my computers and
card readers uses a regular size but
after thinking about it since this
camera has so much Wi-Fi capabilities
transferring files was meant to be
beamed rather than physically carried
over with a card so be aware of that if
this might hinder your desire to
purchase now the first thing I wanted to
run through was some of the menu options
just to show you what is available the
menu can be scrolled through with the
menu buttons on the right or you can use
your fingers on the three inch
touchscreen now you do have basic camera
settings that gets images up to 20
megapixels the touch AF which is the
touch autofocus which works like a
bigger DSLR camera where you can focus
on a subject in the foreground and blur
out the background and vice versa
the anti-shake does help to keep fine
movements and jitters to a minimum and
if you look at the bottom of the screen
right now I try to keep the image as
still as possible while holding both my
hands in front of me
and you can see the system working and
it does help though again to prevent
those shaky hands and for movies you can
record up to 1080p at 30 frames per
second which is today pretty standard
now now going through the personal
settings you can enable NFC which is
near-field communication and as long as
you have a compatible phone with NFC
capabilities you can have this camera
beam your photos right onto your smart
phone instantly now most other menu
items are self-explanatory and/or
standard that you see a most other
camera
now one other thing I want to point out
was the the languages that are available
for the international viewers out there
and there's tons and I mean tons of
languages to choose from and my mother
isn't the best in English but having her
language in here helps tremendously and
lastly here is the mode button where you
can select auto or selecting smart which
provides camera presets to use and this
is ideal as most average consumers and
not so photography inclined may find
this very helpful and there's program
aperture and shutter priority mode which
I detail on the screen and you can pause
the video if you need to to read it and
lastly is manual mode where you can have
full control over every aspect of the
camera like a bigger body DSLR camera a
controlling shutter speeds aperture
controlling the ISO range etc but I'll
leave those settings for the pros to
describe what they are now going into
the quality of the shots and photos and
keep in mind although I do work with a
lot of video and photography on a daily
basis I don't consider myself as a
photography professional and that might
be a good thing since you get a
viewpoint from what the average consumer
would encounter not too technical but
just enough now the following photos
will be all shot in auto mode and the
nikon DSLR that i'll be referring to is
an entry-level camera that cost about
eight hundred and fifty dollars with a
kit lens and we'll use that as a
reference as the expected higher end or
higher performing camera when compared
to the samsung NX mini so here are some
photos I had taken on Mother's Day
weekend my first impressions when I
first saw the photos they were as good
as these slightly more expensive Nikon
all the photos you see here on out are
unedited and not touched up as you can
see in this first photo here the camera
works very fast i capturing very minut
movements of the water and this is
something that Samsung promotes as well
but what's even more intriguing is the
NX mini being able to capture fine
details off in the distance the lower
right you can see here Samsung captures
all the details and also as far back as
the restaurant you can see the
difference in sharpness and detail now
slowly moving my way analyzing the photo
you'll also notice the contrast isn't
overpowering but just the right amount
and for videographers and professional
photographers they usually take photos
in its most unfiltered most plain
image as possible to retain details and
then post-production they would
eventually edit those photos later in
Photoshop or Lightroom etc but most
consumers that are buying the NX I would
assume are not professional
photographers but they want something
that works right out of the box and so
far I see the NX mini doing so the color
saturation and contrast works well right
from the auto settings which means less
retouching of photos that you take now
in the next photo here the NX mini does
very well again and on its auto setting
if you look at the point-and-shoot Canon
camera and also the more expensive of
three the Nikon they're a bit more
washed out so some details appears to be
lost color reproduction is also not
accurate now going to the NX mini you
can see how rich the color is on the
ground and also the tree the green tree
leaves as well and the colors are just
that much more balanced and rich now
here's another quick photo for reference
as both cameras are on it's Auto setting
again the Samsung in my opinion just
slightly looks a little bit better and
again if you're not one of those people
that retouches your photos before
uploading and sharing right out the box
the NX mini does very well now low-light
performance is a very big factor when
buying a camera and with a poor camera
noise is apparent in darker spots you
get this fuzzy pixelated look when you
look closely and I personally don't like
using flash since it does wash out a lot
of the detail and gives this white
glaring light on your subject
now I had taken a photo with some light
coming through the window here but left
again everything on auto with no flash
and from afar the first thing I noticed
the that I can tell the Samsung is rich
in colour and retains a lot of its
shadow details the second thing was in
general all three photos had some noise
which was really interesting was that I
expected and I continued the best but
the Samsung again really did a good job
with retaining sharpness as you can see
when i zoom in
now in regards to video quality no
surprise again the Samsung did very well
in general but there was one thing that
was a slight issue now whenever you have
fine lines whether it be in clothing
random patterns in this case horizontal
lines there's this thing called allicin
that starts to occur this the lines are
basically to fine and starts to flicker
become jagged in most cameras in the 700
several hundred dollar range that is
will most likely do this so it's common
and if you're the average consumer it
really shouldn't matter but if you're
shooting film documentaries or something
you want to look a bit more professional
obviously the Allisyn is not ideal but
overall again right out of the box it
works well though so over on my honest
and humble opinion if you don't want to
lug around a bigger SLR camera like the
Nikon I'm just using here but still want
that same great-looking photos that you
don't need to edit later this is the way
to go and for the average consumers
Samsung really got this niche or market
segment you can say down so I hope you
enjoyed this video of the Samsung NX
mini and if you can please like and
