review room now you can probably tell by
the title of this video I finally hit
10,000 subscribers now I know that
number is not a lot compared to allow
the other reviewers out there but
considering i literally just started
this seven months ago like really
devoted my time to this to where we are
today you can say we're we're already
here which is amazing are mind-blowing
in my mind i estimated that it would
take a full 10 to 12 months is what i
estimated for me to hit 10,000
subscribers so i'm actually ahead of
schedule which is impressive enough and
it's all because of you guys it's
because of those who comments positive
feedback tons of positive feedback that
keeps me going late at night the people
will like the video to help it you know
boost up a search results and especially
especially those who actually share
these videos that helps me up
tremendously so it's because of you guys
who enjoy this content enjoy the hard
work that I put in that makes Jim's
review continuing and going so before I
get too deep into this video here as a
precursor this one let you know that I
am speaking off my mind here you can say
there's no narrative has some notes in
front of me and you probably hear me
have a lot of ohms or maybe stutter here
and there like I said I don't have a
narrative that I typically read in my
reviews and like I said in my facebook
and also google plus social media
channels this video will basically be a
really quick cut and paste videos that
I've made like a collage or so you can
say and it won't be as polished as my
reviews of course so what I'll do is go
over the top five questions that you
guys submit it to me on either facebook
or google+ some of them were pretty
consistent or common so i'll answer
those and it's a way to you know for you
to get to know me a little bit and see
what i do i guess in the background a
little bit there I guess and first up
let's just get this out the way is the
giveaway so a couple of things here I
just want to make sure that you guys do
if you can help me out and of course you
know best of luck to you for winning
this basically as long as you follow
this list i'll randomly select a person
who contributed next week sunday that's
jun 22nd and basically the list in you
have an screen here you have to
subscribe to Jim's review room and you
to add me and either facebook or google+
and starters no twitter and comment
below and which service you used so that
we can contact you next week to get your
address either on facebook google+ and
in the comments below tell me when did
you find my channel how many subscribes
ahead at it at that time or basically
what video you watched you know back in
the day and then you decided to
subscribe and also what country or state
that you're in they'll be really
interesting to know since I do have a
pretty big international audience out
there so that'd be pretty cool to see
and if there's any other anything else
you want to put in the comments please
do so like I said I still at this point
and still small enough i guess you can
say to really read majority of the
comments if not all of them so now
getting into the top five questions that
I've received so you can get to know me
a little bit better first up is actually
from persona so he asked how did I get
started and I'll try to make this
shortly and maybe one day i'll do a draw
my life video if you're interested but
before youtube I majored in
communication and was focused on
marketing and advertising and after
college I worked for corporate america
in the job that was not what I majored
in I sucked it up work to save my money
thinking that I'll do something I love
one day and I've done real estate
investments which I totally love but
obviously I had to stop that after two
thousand eight I was a full-time day
trader in the stock market after the
crash again very good but no stability
but while I was at home day trading and
this was back in 2012 I made several
videos on YouTube about 15 in total or
so in just a over a 12 month span it's
not a it's not a lot four years worth of
work I guess you can say but they were
just for fun and for the hell of it and
they're still on youtube today and if
you actually go back you can see how
horrible they are it was just me sitting
in front of a camera talking with bad
lighting shaky camera or shaky hands and
no video editing etc I eventually went
back to corporate America worked in
mortgages a bit till the summer of two
thousand thirteen which is about almost
last year now that's when home interest
rates slightly went up last year so with
the rates up interest rates up and
mortgages basically dwindling I guess
you can say not many people or
refinancing and I guess you can say the
kind of me still trying to get back up
to purchasing homes so America has
already low interest rates so it's not
lucrative to refinance so basically my
page dropped a bit there and I said you
know what for the amount of time I spent
working for somebody for making a
company more you know rich basically I
said you know what I rather take a pay
cut and rather work for myself and again
that's what I did and those youtube
videos I've made at that time had a very
decent amount of views considering I was
purely an amateur it blew my mind but
the comments surprisingly the comments
were mainly positive and a lot said that
I had helped them make a purchase
decision so I surveyed other reviewers
at the time soldierknowsbest was huge
and several other guys now big today
were coming up akh friends which
eventually left the YouTube to work for
engadget I believe unbox therapy etc but
most reviewers to me felt you know
catered to the very knowledgeable almost
niche group of people that knew about
technology and I was just the average
guy that worked a lot so I couldn't keep
up with the jargon or understood what
the latest technology had to offer so I
thought to myself let me develop a plan
by helping people who i think are
similar in my shoes become more
comfortable with a purchase decision or
gaining knowledge of a product you at
the same time making the video easily
digestible and almost as a form of
entertainment and pleasure through the
camerawork and visuals so i left my
corporate job cold turkey two weeks
later I paycheck stopped rolling in you
can say and I just basically started
doing YouTube full time since mid of
october2013 and you can say the rest is
history but if you're still hanging with
me here in the next question is from
Victorio and the mirror now this is a
very common question I get how do i get
my products well simply i pay for them
ninety-nine percent of the items that
you see I do pay for but before you
think I'm some rich guy or something
like that I do sell back majority of my
products and getting most of my money
back of course and I do calculate how
much I of a hit i can take at each item
ensuring it's a worthwhile review so
this kind of rolls into question number
three here why don't I review phones
I'll tell you what I would love to do
phones and I'm personally waiting for
the note 4 from Samsung myself as
upcoming
number but after my calculations the
loss that I would take doing phone
reviews is just too much right now and
you might ask why don't I get sponsors
or join up with a loaner program from
companies while heavy hitting items for
example from Samsung there's only so
many loners a company can send out at
one time and in my humble opinion I'm
certain the bigger reviewers more
specifically review companies gets first
dibs like TechCrunch and gadgets cnet
etc now even in an interview with mkbhd
some time ago that I watched he mentions
companies don't provide loners that
coincides with your desired date to
release a video so if let's say I
personally ever reach a hundred thousand
subscribers and start to afford these
phones I rather not wait to get a loner
or sample from a company if I'm not in
your top priority and I don't blame them
either but I would rather get the phone
that day of the release personally
myself and to be honest I prefer this
method as I personally don't feel
pressure for too much of a positive
review when it doesn't warrant one I
think a lot of reviews you may run
across that from time to time as well
especially those big clients that
obviously you want more business from
and whatnot so moving on to the next
question here the next question is from
Fidel he asks what is my equipment now
if you look at my very first videos to
the most recent ones i knews basically
the same camera it's the nikon d50 100
and then use the kit lens that was
supplied now the reason why i want to
mention my camera where it stands and
icons lineup which is basically the
second from the bottom is to emphasize
learning how to use even a cheaper
camera and yield some pretty darn good
results now I do have some cheap tripod
as well for easy movement but i just
recently bought a manfrotto i believe
it's the 546 with a 502 HD head and it's
a gigantic size but it basically will
support a slider from Kessler crane that
I'm planning on purchasing soon and any
other camera equipment that i may add a
little bit later now it's a fluid head
with super smooth panning shots with
virtually no shakes or stutters but to
be honest i use the cheap one more often
in a manfrotto just because it's lighter
and easier to use now I also use a
slider from glide year that gives me
these zooming in and out
side to side shots as well the glider
for close-up shots you can see some of
the jitters and stutters though when i
manually operate this so i personally
don't like it since it's friction based
and so I'm getting the the one from
Kessler instead the lighting is pretty
standard with softboxes bought from
amazon a mic that I just used ones here
is the zoom h4n which is a phenomenal
Mike despite its big as a brick here to
be honest with you and the other
software that I use is Adobe Premiere
Pro 5.5 edition and photoshop cs5 now
once in a while I use after effects but
I'll be honest with you my head is
totally fried with learning these
programs and they all have pretty much a
steep learning curve just to make
something look really good but it does
give me the most flexibility and editing
at the moment and it's what professional
uses too so it's worthwhile to learn it
over time and here is the last question
from Dion l and the unasked here how's
the family well some of you may or may
not know I'm a new father I have a baby
girl that's just three months old now
and is my first kid and were you can say
at the house here learning along the way
still she's just eating pooping and
sleeping and the sleep hasn't been too
bad at least for myself she's been
surprisingly sleeping the entire night
of most at a time not every night though
and just fusses when she's hungry sleepy
or just pooped and from what I can tell
my parents are telling me you know this
is the easy stage now you know it only
gets a more crazy I guess he and say
when she hits the terrible twos which is
what I'm really looking forward to so
we'll see what happens so it's been real
interesting it's been you know I gotta
admit it's been really exhausting but I
have a very supportive fiance that's
helping me tremendously she's back at
work now and we're just been trying to
juggle you know having a baby running a
business
you know ever it's going to work
obviously and try to make ends meet so
it's been a journey so far but there's a
lot of smiles I'll be I'll be honest
with you that to be had when she's
around and you know it's really nice
just to get up from this room walk over
to the next room you know maybe 10 feet
away or so and she's right there and for
the most part she smiles when I want to
see here so that's a good thing so
that's it I know this has been somewhat
of a long video but like I said I kind
of made it more of an interview style
it's a little bit more detailed I guess
you can say for those who are really
interested hopefully this video wasn't
too bad but it's the thought that counts
once say thanks to some that no question
that has helped me along the way by
sharing my video and putting a good word
out there big shout-out to mike new
field and google+ damier frank from
android effect com prasanna John Kevlar
just to name a few off the top my head
here and there's a lot more out there
that I see periodically as well and I
haven't forgotten about you thanks to
everyone for their support and because
of you it makes it possible for
basically Jim's review room to continue
going out and helping tons of people out
there i'll have the samsung galaxy tab s
coming soon to the studio here hopefully
i'll get it a week before the actual
release that's a hopeful wishing there
and the Microsoft Surface three should
be coming out soon the ACC 200 which I
am behind I do have that here and still
testing and of course there'll be some
others as well coming out this month so
that's it this is Jim with Jim's review
