room I know the iPhone 8 &amp;amp; A plus might
look identical to last year's maybe the
year before but if you're in need of a
new phone maybe your contract is up
maybe you don't want to pay the thousand
dollars for the iPhone 10 this video is
for you being completely unbiased
throughout this video here I will be
comparing the iPhone 8 plus with this
biggest competitor
the Samsung S 8 plus and one I mean I'm
biased I'm showing you a real-world test
documenting my experiences and showing
you what I encounter I personally paid
for this at the retail price of seven
hundred and $99 all iPhone eights now
come with at least 64 gigs of internal
storage double over last year's and
matching the Android competitors as
always I'll place my affiliate links in
the video description below click on
those links and they'll give you the
most updated prices in real time now I'm
Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
going over the physical features let's
put up the comparison screen and see how
this look the iPhone 8 plus are one of
the few flagships may be the only
flagship with those big bezels and the
smallest screen not sure how the new
pixel XL 2 is gonna look but for now for
$800 we do have this disadvantage now
looking at last year's iPhone 7 plus
they are nearly identical a difference
of a fraction but why is there a slight
increase in size and mass it's because
iPhones now come with an all-glass back
instead of aluminum to make way for the
new wireless charging feature but more
my battery test a little bit later
now with the new glass back like the
Samsung phones see if you drop the phone
not only can the screen break but also
the rear can get shattered as well my
go-to brand of bumper cases have been
rhino shield this case can withstand not
up to but at least 11 foot drops
with today's video is sponsored Rhino
shield want to give you an introduction
to their new case the mod same
protection as shown on your screen here
with their bumper case but if you want
to add a customized back plate for full
protection you can do so don't like the
stock buttons swap them out modification
is the key word and with this you can
make your iPhone eight eight plus and
ten into a camera powerhouse screw
around different camera lenses and you
get wide shots like this or macro shots
like this check them out as a product I
use and I stand by personally I've
placed the Rhenish shield links in the
description for your convenience now
getting back to the phone one thing I
wanted to mention and this is me coming
from a samsung I say Plus and Note 8
which I recently reviewed the iPhone 8
plus is quite wide and the height to
width ratio and Samsung phones do you
feel more ergonomic I personally have
medium-sized hands and although the
iPhone is perfectly usable the other
options out there feels easier to manage
now the iPhone 8 series returns with the
IP X 67 rating the 7 designates the
iPhone is able to be submerged
underwater up to one meter or 3.3 feet
for up to 30 minutes
now I'd dunk this underwater in our test
bucket here and the iPhone still works
perfectly fine now although the iPhone 8
plus looks pretty much identical
aesthetically it's what's underneath
that matters this time around indeed
their speakers on the bottom which do
get black when holding the phone
horizontally like any other phone out
there but your earpiece for phone calls
also emits audio this time around with
the iPhone 8 plus volume has increased
by 25% in a world test it sounded loud
enough it wasn't anything stellar to be
honest with you but not having to cut my
hand on the bottom when watching videos
do help tremendously I did love this
feature moving on the display is
identical to last years as well same
specs which I'll have on the screen for
you
and I know it doesn't sound exciting at
all but when viewing images on the
iPhone I feel as though the iPhone 8
plus gives off a more natural and more
realistic look on the contrary I very
much appreciate the Samsung phone even
though they might not be 100% accurate
in my opinion for example at times it
can be too saturated and with skin tones
some people look more tan than
they really are but when you're not
comparing side-by-side the Samsung does
make every scene pop with vibrancy you
could be a judge in which one you would
prefer some like color accuracy some
like that wow factor basically the proof
is in the video let me know in the
comment section below which one do you
personally like the biggest difference
between the iPhone A+ and the iPhone 7
plus display is support for the Dolby
vision and HDR 10 which the likes of
Netflix and Hulu are introducing into
their streaming services now with my
experience on the iPhone 8 plus and
watching verified HD are 10 or Adobe
Vision content and Netflix the
differences don't seem to be drastic at
times the Samsung appear to show more
detail at times the HDR content looked
richer in content and then comparing to
my iPhone 7 from last year and as you
can see on the screen here the color
temperatures are slightly different but
nothing really pops or shines to make
the newest phone on the market stand out
and granted it has the HDR technology
built in looking at screen brightness
iPhone 8 plus has 625 nits while Samsung
has around a thousand nits
the higher the number the easier it is
to see in direct sunlight and in bright
situations in person there is a
difference but a difference that's not
as significant as I would have thought
as seen on screamed this shot has taken
outdoors in direct sunlight and although
Apple has the lower number on paper it's
still very much readable in person also
factory defaults from Apple do typically
offer bigger text over the Samsung S A+
now as a side note true tone was off
dirty shots now looking at the phone
indoors that's a bit more noticeable
that the Samsung is the brighter option
but either phone especially the iPhone
here was still very much usable last but
not least true tone is new on the iPhone
8 series the screen temperature changes
to warm if you're in a warmer lit room
and goes cooler and more fluorescent or
daytime environments touching base on
camera performance Newark dual lenses on
the rear you have your normal wide shots
like this now by tapping on one X and
going in two times you get shots like
this without the need of using digital
zoom which degrades your photos with the
right lighting any camera looks great
the iPhone looks phenomenal but what's
different about my reviews my tests I
take a mix of photos that keeps in mind
the average consumer it's about snapping
the moments that are important to you
and many moments where there's not
perfect lighting or composition with
that being said Apple like at screen
display provides a more
neutral and more natural tone it gets
the job done and if you're looking for
an even or balanced tone this is for you
but I have to coming from these Samsung
phones I get much more appetizing shots
you can say much more vibrant images
sharper details and images that most
average consumers say Wow
at first glance I also notice in
low-light performance there was more
fiddling around to get the right balance
from Bright to dark situations with the
iPhone a plus with these Samsung si+ on
that particular night with my family I
would whip out the Samsung point it
shoot it and just simply be done with
the iPhone I can blow out and on a
second trial would then have to tap the
screen to select the light source to
compensate then the images will come out
looking equivalent now one thing I must
hand to the iPhone 8 plus the
front-facing camera looks a hell of a
lot better here much more natural better
light balancing I don't get that weird
big body and little head syndrome that I
do with some of the other competitors
out there specifically Samsung now also
the auto focusing system is one of the
best it's not as fast as Samsung but
fast enough for folks to enjoy using the
camera now jumping over to battery
performance wireless charging is now
available using qi chargers what i can
confirm is the wireless charging is
powered by up to 5 watts at the moment
and with a software update down the road
you're going to get 7.5 watts
that should help speed up the process
looking at the traditional way of
recharging that's through a physical
wire here apples fast charging is crazy
fast at least on paper
oddly Apple does not supply a fast
charger on any one of their new iPhones
and this includes their $1000 iPhone 10
you would have to purchase this separate
wall adapter and the wire the chart is
on your screen here with the prices and
with the 87 watt model can get 50% a
better life back in 30 minutes which is
very very impressive with my testing
with the wall adapter included in the
retail package the same adapter you'll
receive as well around 20 minutes in I
was able to get 14% on the iPhone and
22% on the Samsung at the hour mark 39%
on the iPhone 60% on Samsung and last
after about an hour and 40 minutes the
Samsung finished charging while Apple
had roughly 73 percent completed
going all the way here the iPhone 8 plus
didn't finish recharging in two three
hours in last but not least is
performance there's no question that the
ADEs and a pluses are fast I'll place
these specs on your screen for reference
but with the new processor dubbed the a
11 Bionic chip it's going to perform
it's the same processor that they're
using in their iPhone 10 so you're not
missing out features new with iOS 11 in
general is the use of a are gaming with
the camera on the rear you can place
objects and games in the real world and
play around them now with our
interactive movements and environments
here I kind of say the more mundane
games are a bit more entertaining and
fun but the more interactive games the
offer an additional level of immersion
it's really cool to check out but for
the average consumer in rural use I've
never seen a hiccup and performance apps
are always super smooth to load web
browsing doesn't shutter and one of the
biggest reasons why folks go to Apple is
it's super lean highly efficient
operating system and features now doing
some basic tasks you can see on your
screen here the difference in speed but
at the end of the day if you don't have
two phones side by side like what I'm
doing here either one of these phones
feels quick so in the end being 100%
unbiased and proving showing you as much
of the testing as I did what do you guys
think
when taking everything into account and
comparing my experiences to help you
make that purchase decision the proof is
in the pudding you can say I want to be
sure that that's clear there's no biases
in this review please share this video
to a friend if you want to show the pros
and cons of the iPhone 8 plus you might
be able to convince them if Apple or
Samsung is the way to go and if you
haven't already be sure to LIKE and
subscribe you guys take care and I'll
see you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
