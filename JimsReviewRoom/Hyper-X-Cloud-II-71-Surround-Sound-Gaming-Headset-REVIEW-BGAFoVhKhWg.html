with Jim's review room Jim just tested
the very popular headset the HyperX
cloud alphas if you haven't seen that
video yet go check it out in the video
description because in this video I'll
be going over the 7.1 surround sound
cloud twos now I've been a gamer for a
long time since racking up thousands of
hours in the early days of Halo 2
multiplayer also using the HyperX
revolvers for some time I'm interested
to see just what kind of experience this
new headset provides you can find the
cloud twos through hyper X's website for
$99 as always I'll place my affiliate
links in the video description below
click on those links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
now join me and share my experience with
the HyperX cloud to
as always I'm a big fan of hyper axis
design and build quality from the
gunmetal gray frame and matching stitch
work to the embossed logo across the top
they are fantastic looking and feeling
the headband is made of memory foam and
artificial leather I felt it was
comfortable across the crown of my head
and spread the overall weight of the
headset evenly one criticism I could
levy was that for me the pair was
somewhat small I was blessed with a
rather large head and there was some
slight noticeable pressure near the base
of my ears even when fully extended
though if you're not six foot seven like
I am you should be fine
for the ear cups HyperX went with a
matte black housing and a satin brushed
aluminum backing on the driver's the
finish also extends to the headsets
frame I think out of all HyperX color
schemes the gunmetal gray and black
would have to be my favorite though if
you prefer the classic red and black
look that's also available leather
earpads are the standard on the cloud
twos though an extremely soft set of
velour ear cushions are included as well
I thought they've both felt great the
leather was cooling on the ears and the
velour was very breathable after about
four hours of marathoning the new call
of duty on hardened not veteran I know I
never had any nasty ear sweat with
either material they did wore my ears up
a bit over time but it was never
excessive I did want to note changing
them out was quite difficult and could
be a pain if he switched them often
passive noise isolation is decent I felt
it was slightly better with the leather
earpads though if you prefer the velour
feeling your experience won't noticeably
decrease salmiak is minimal at 50%
volume and at 75% which is quite loud a
small amount of noise can be heard now
I'm a night gamer myself so I really
appreciated just how well the headset
performed in this regard the noise
cancelling mic is detachable so if I
wanted I could wear the car to out as
regular headphones
all right folks testing the microphone
and the HyperX cloud Suze I have the
Amazon echo playing some talk radio in
the background when I step fingers in
front of you guys as well and this is
just a very quick simple test and see if
you guys hear and it kind of background
noise also my voice does sound a little
bit nasally that's always inherent with
these microphones but this does not
sound bad at all if anything this is
very very good for a gaming headset
alright talk to you guys later
back to the review the analog audio cord
is not removable so if you do experience
any scratchiness or left
right channel issues later on you won't
be able to switch it out I never had any
problems with the connection and it is
very snug in the headset but it's
something to be aware of one of the
biggest selling points of the cloud twos
is its USB audio controller it has a
built-in sound card with DSP or digital
signal processing which allows for the
virtual surround sound I'm a big fan of
these controllers for several reasons I
found USB connectors to always be more
practical than two 3.5 millimeter jacks
I also like being able to control both
the volume of my microphone as well as
the game audio without having to go into
my system settings and finally it
enables me to have the virtual 7.1
surround sound but we'll get into that
in a moment
finally included in the box is an
airplane adapter as well as a cushion
mesh carrying bag though it's not the
most premium looking material it is very
springy and gives a surprising amount of
protection to your headset when I
carried these around last weekend I
never had to worry about dings or
scratches
when shoving the headset in my bag or
throwing it into the backseat the audio
drivers are huge at 53 millimeters
making them the largest drivers in hyper
X's headset line and larger than most
competitors to test how they sounded I
was burdened with playing a lot of video
games I played a mix of new and old Call
of Duty World War 2 overwatch rocket
League cuphead and several others just
to get a feel for their sound profile
when I pressed the 7.1 button on the
controller the soundscape significantly
widened in call of duty when I stormed
the beaches of Normandy bullets flew by
and explosions burst at varying
distances and I was able to feel how
airy and how spacious the battlefield
was in rocket League I could hear
engines closing in behind me and car
demolitions across the arena improving
my awareness and gameplay even an
overwatch which has a very animated
artificial sound profile the virtual
surround sound made it intensely
immersive the announcers voice totally
encapsulated me as far as specific audio
ranges go with the Cloud twos bass was
present but was not overbearing
the sound was punchy and didn't
noticeably distort other frequencies in
games with more bassy sound signatures
like battlefield 1 or Call of Duty Base
was used more as a sharp initial
characteristic two sound effects rather
than the thunderous rolling of bass
heavy headsets I did notice the mids are
pushed forward especially with these 7.1
engaged in gaming headsets I'd generally
like this sound signature because it
creates a sense of excitement but there
were times when so many different audio
sources were occurring
I felt the range became slightly
cluttered the vocals did stand out more
prominently in the mix I usually have to
play with subtitles on yet with declaw
twos I found myself not needing them in
the treble frequencies there was a good
amount of detail
I was sure to watch out for any ear
ringing or metallic sharpness which can
sometimes happen with gaming headsets I
didn't experience this problem with the
cloud to's although at higher volumes
there was some minor edginess in the
range with the 7.1 engaged due to the
simulated directional placement of audio
I felt there was a slightly lower
fidelity in the sound I was able to hear
where sounds were coming from but lost a
small amount of clarity due to their
distance I'm not knocking the cloud to s
overall quality at this price point it's
just a give and take between resolution
and spatial sound all-in-all I really
enjoyed my time with the cloud to's the
virtual surround sound was a fantastic
addition to their line of gaming
headsets the greatest effect I noticed
was the accurate sound placement and its
improvement on my gameplay with the
virtual 7.1 I had improved awareness to
what was going on around me and I felt
increased in skill as a gamer and
personally I'll take any edge I can get
I know the market is flooded with gaming
headset options but with everything
HyperX packed into the cloud twos at $99
I felt they were very much worth the
price so that's it for this review again
I'm Ian with jims review room you guys
be good I'll see you on the next video
