review room welcome to another review
today we're looking at another unique
gadget segment and I always like ear
buds just for the fact that they fit
right in your ear canal for direct sound
and they also block out sound to you
from the outside world and of course the
ease of portability now these in-ear
monitors are from jaybird and this is
their flagship model the Blu buds X
which focuses on these sports oriented
person now these in-ear monitors are
connected wirelessly using bluetooth
technology and what's unique is these
blue buds are sweat proof and comes with
a lifetime warranty against sweat
related damages now it currently retails
for one hundred and seventy dollars
which is on the expensive side but
Amazon at the time of this video has
them for a more reasonable price of one
hundred and thirty so let's see if these
premium earbuds are really worth this
amount of money so without further ado
get started
Jay Blue provides all the accessories
that you'll need including this
beautiful case for the company's logo on
it it's also felt line comes with dark
chrome accents and it's magnetically
closing as well the case does well in
all aspects of holding your earbuds
together now it also comes with three
sets of silicon tips to fit your ear
canal and also three silicone wings that
fits into the ball of your ear having
the right fitment and size is imperative
for having the best sound audio and
sound isolation so I nuta lies the
smallest tip and they fitted pretty well
initially and they were indeed snug and
comfortable the ear canal now as for the
wings they're there to help stabilize
and prevent it ear buds from falling out
but for my personal news and testing the
ear buds by themselves works better in
my opinion and I did that will check and
ensure accurate installations and try it
on different sizes but the wings were
just not working for me though now upon
looking at the blue buds itself they
look amazing and they're very
lightweight at the same time despite
having the battery pack right inside the
earbud itself it doesn't weigh you down
but to keep it lightweight the black
exterior is all plastic even the chrome
accents is painted on they don't feel
super high-end you can say to reflect
the price but I believe the trade-off is
for how light they are not playing
around with these throwing
in my pocket working out with these at
the gym they still held up pretty well
no flaking or chipping of the paint and
even though plastic there's still a very
good quality build though the blue bus
does come with a tangle free cord which
are becoming more popular these days
with an inline controller for valium up
and down with a built-in mic the metal
button turns on and off the unit and
while holding it down this pairs your
earbuds to your audio source now moving
on to the earpieces performance nearly
all fields are very balanced and clear
overall balance is the key word with
blue buds now bass response is punchy
and deep at all times for pop hip-hop
and rap genres it's a very satisfying
response and not dominant like what you
would find in beats by dre products not
really well executed and doesn't drone
out the mid-range vocals now vocals are
distinct enough to appreciate yet
they're not overly sharp which is a good
thing even on high volume levels they
simply did not cause the ear drum inside
to be agitated now playing classical
music from Yiruma
river flows in you was very pleasant in
every piano note again with high notes
not producing an ear ringing sensation
now listening to a remastered track of
the Eagles Hotel California made every
instrument distinct I can hear the
cymbals - the snares being hit -
something my nuke as a cabassa being
turned the clarity and range on these
are well executed EDM trance techno
house music in the likes of my favorite
try out cascade or black mill still
sounded very good but for some reason I
noticed my valium had to be turned up to
about 65% to about 70% to really be
enjoyed it's not an issue but something
that I just noticed that's all
but once the valium is up my god cascade
and especially black Ville is immersive
and speaking of valium these things can
get very loud and usually found myself
just at 50% volume throughout the day
and that was enough to have a very
enjoyable experience all while still
droning out all the noise around me
sound isolation is amazing when there's
nothing in your ear now going on to this
topic here I was very shocked though I
had trouble keeping the earbuds in place
initially they stayed in but after a
while using the smallest tips and
changing to position
the size of the wings provided did not
help in the end not using the wings
worked out better for my news as stated
earlier but just lifting weights with
these things on occasionally they would
pop out of the ear canal or at least
become loose and losing some of that
amazing sound quality now I did some
research and to my surprise this does
occur to a good handful of people
testimonials from consumers on CNET and
Amazon says the same thing unfortunately
I'm a victim of this issue as well where
the silicone tips really don't provide
that suction you can say in that ear now
one remedy proposed that seemed to work
for most people
we're buying new foam tips from comple
foam calm now they're kind of expensive
for some foam that is but reading
people's comments they really do work
now behind the logo on the right earbud
is a microUSB charging port like I said
this is where the batteries housed now a
jaybird does provide the cable so you
can charge this through your computer's
USB port or what I did I'd use my phone
charger to juice this thing up and Jay
Berg claims eight hours of battery and
through my testing keeping the volume at
50% again which was not low but still an
enjoyable level I yielded seven hours of
music continuously and that's what the
earbuds basically around my neck the
entire day or in the entire time so
overall amazing sound but considering
it's evidence fitment might be an issue
for some consumers it might be a slight
drawback so just be a little bit
cautious about that but nonetheless very
good earbuds so this concludes the
