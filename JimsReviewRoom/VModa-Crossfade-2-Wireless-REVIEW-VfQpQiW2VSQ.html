headphones in the past
super lightweight rugged and featuring
some of the most original design
elements on a pair of headphones now
these are the new v-moda crossfades two
wireless that v-moda sent over for
testing my assess motion that altered in
any way please watch the entire video
for both pros and cons now prices are on
your screen but as always I'll place my
affiliate links in the video description
below click on those links and they'll
give you the most updated prices as of
today so folks sit back and relax as I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
the v-moda headphones have always been
unique
the biggest difference right off the bat
they're built like tanks still frame
military certified and if that wasn't
enough the motor offers a 50 percent
lifetime warranty you destroy these and
in their user manual it says if you
abuse these headphones that dub immortal
life warranty will give you 50% back
towards a new pair it's not a hundred
percent but it's better than no warranty
at all with my stress test as you guys
can see these things are holding up
blessing this on my head this is one of
the biggest reasons why I love the
previous generation there's no gap
whatsoever they don't look hurt can't
ruin on me and they conform to my head
and I wished other head phones weren't
able to do this here's me where these
sony 1000 x 2 for reference these
headphones are coming soon to the
channel the one area that i had to
retake the clamping force is firmer than
most other headphones i've tested after
a while i do feel that pressure along
the jaw line however it didn't bother me
but for those who are sensitive here
they will notice also for those who are
sensing about the crown of the head
you might feel some weight as well i
check these on my skin they didn't come
in very close to 300 grams as with all
my head from reviews anything around 300
grams is on the heavier side for
headphones if you're planning on
purchasing keep the comfort in weight as
a purchasing factor thankfully here's
the controls on the right ear cup for
convenience if I'm up and down pause and
play skipping going back on songs are
all there the buttons Alamut are
somewhat hard to find at first but
muscle memory does help after a couple
days more importantly everything is made
with great craftsmanship but the buttons
don't have this firm confident click
when pressed when the headphones are on
your head pressing on them you can hear
a slight squeak with the plastics now
moving on the ear pads do feel great in
was a much needed upgrade
they're now very soft and supple however
they do warm up my ears a bit but wasn't
an issue to break the deal because of
its closed back design and Morphy plush
from cushion passive noise isolation and
sound leaking are very very good on
these another feature that makes the
v-moda stand out they're customizable
not only in color but metal materials as
well use the supplied hex screw driver
and remove the screws and slap on a new
backplate and so far you've seen the
matte black which is my favorites but
v-moda didn't send me the brushed metal
to show you and then add lee to send me
this blue one which looks good but
doesn't match the rose gold
pi√±on now besides these metal back
plates if you go to their websites you
have 3d printed back plates to choose
and your choice of engraving giving tons
of personality to your headphones now
the best part
since the crossfades were released and
up to the release with my review here
today that service is free of course
there's limitations you can't get the 14
karat gold version but there's options
out there finishing up the physical
features although these are Wireless
which I got a crazy 94 linear feet of
range with my samsung si plus you can
use the supplied 3.5 millimeter quart
USB 2.0 makes it come back and oddly no
USB type-c once again regarding battery
life v motor says you can get up to 14
hours of use on their retail box with my
test leaving these on at 50% volume
playing from full to dead I was able to
get 13 hours and 20 minutes of playback
to be exact
last but not least before talking about
audio quality the crossfades 2 wireless
do graciously fold in but they don't
fold flat either or this is one of the
most compact pair of headphones that
I've experienced and I love this feature
also the included case is built like a
tank here it's a hard shell with axis of
my rolls gold and the materials it looks
like Batman's rubberized suit now
opening this up on the inside it's felt
lined with elastic bands to hold in your
cables and it's one of the smallest and
best headphone cases that have tested on
the channel so alright let's go into the
audio performance for the first time on
Jim's review I'm going to give you a
real-life experience of how these
headphones sound please put on your own
earphones or headphones to get the best
audio experience I'm using professional
microphones to capture the performance
as accurately as possible so be sure to
LIKE and subscribe
so let's talk about the audio test here
the v-moda crossfades to wireless are
some very good headphones audibly
they're loud enough for most I found
myself listening at around 70% volume
and it was comfortable and enjoyable for
those who are familiar with the boast QC
35 s bass performs very similar and at
times the V motors will offer a smidge
more bass response but with that being
said and compared to all other
headphones on the markets in general the
car fades provide a sophisticated
balance with slight punchiness character
that most average consumers will enjoy
the mids are very articulate clean clear
very good resolution and vocal work two
strings being plucked here not too
bright but forward and in front of the
lower bassy frequencies but a sound
stage is airy and open with very much
apparent left and right audio channels
that's a huge plus right there the sound
stage isn't the best that I've heard but
for the $300 price range it's up there
in my top five as for high frequencies
I've been reviewing speakers and
headphones with not so sharp highs and
it's pin underwhelming unfortunately
with the V motors they do push the high
notes and pulls back right before it
gets too sharp and becomes it's hanging
in raspy now although you don't get
those sharp screeches which is great the
clarity on the top end though would have
been slightly better now it does perform
better than most other headphones but
with Bose it was slightly clearer and
separated instruments and beats with
more distinction the V motors just
sounded just ever so slightly jumbled
with these headphones oh it's a pop EDM
rock classical and anything strong and
vocal and instrumental work will do
great the bass is good and I do like
this audio signature but those who do
like bass your sounding headphones might
prefer something a bit more bumi and
deep so guys in the comment section
below let me know what you guys think
especially the style let me know if it
looks good to you or not I'll be curious
to know your thoughts on the v-moda
crossfade to wireless and don't forget
follow my channel and social media you
guys take care I'll talk to you guys on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
