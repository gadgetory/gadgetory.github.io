room trying to bring you guys the newest
stuff in the market Bose just released
their sound sport wireless earphones
geared towards Fitness fans out there
now they come in two colors aqua which I
have here and then there's that stuff
all black model I did personally pay for
this at the retail price of one hundred
and fifty dollars making these slightly
cheaper than some of the premium models
out there but we'll see how these go
though as always I'll place my links in
the video description below click on my
links and they will give you the most
updated prices in real time and if you
decide to buy of course this will help
support my channel so without further
ado Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
going over the physical features first I
do admit these are a bit bigger than
what I anticipated but of course looks
are subjective now although there's
audio ports exposed Bose claims these
are to be water in sweat resistant and
for my testing spring water all over
these the Bose sound sports still works
perfectly fine now looking at the right
earphone there's your power button up
top LEDs to indicate when this is fully
charged or almost dead in regards to
battery life and a Bluetooth connection
indicator on the bottom there is a
microUSB port for charging the sound
sports and Bose is claiming up to six
hours of use which is somewhat in the
mid-range when you're comparing with
other sport your phones on the market at
50% vibe I was able to get seven hours
and four minutes worth of use now moving
on with the physical bill the left ear
but doesn't have any physical buttons or
features but moving down the cord here
it's thick and feels very durable while
still being very flexible tossing these
into my bag without the included case
they never tangled or under abuse they
held up really well now there is an
inline controller with volume up and
down with a pause play and song skipping
feature and this does work for both
Apple and Android devices the only thing
though the buttons are very firm
compared to any other earphones I've
tested also when pressing the buttons
you do feel the buttons slide from side
to side from time to time which was a
bit unusual at first it's not a
deal-breaker but I do admit you do get
used to it after your first use or two
but something I wanted to point out now
last the inline controller does come
with NFC or near field communication
built-in which is very handy
tap your NFC compatible phone and the
earphones pairs with your device
automatically last you can use this as a
headset for phone calls and testing this
with several friends my voice is very
clear it does pick up some background
noise though but at least my voice
didn't sound far away or distorted it
performs very well though now going into
comfort both features they're super soft
ear tips called stay here plus three ear
tips are included from small medium to
large and of course the fit will be
subjective as everyone's ears are a
little bit different here but for the
most part they stayed in my ears very
well here but not the perfect skier hold
that I was looking for the stay here ear
tips are not in your earphones
they're not snug inside that ear canal
but it rests on the opening you can
still hear your environments which is
ideal for cyclists or runners to ensure
that you may hear someone coming up
on you or maybe here traffic around you
they are very comfortable however during
vigorous activities at least for my ears
again the top ear wing would pop out
sometimes and the earphones would not
fall out though but I would periodically
have to push that top ear wing back in
from my channel and reviewing previous
Bose products most people do find their
general ear tips to work really well
though so I would still give them a shot
regarding wire noise when you are
running the wires can bounce around or
rub against ur shirts but these sound
sports does very well not carrying any
noise into the earphones when music is
going you don't hear the wires bouncing
around at all something to look into
when you are looking for earphones in
general and last regarding sound quality
in BOCES fashion here they still provide
a very nice clean audio signature it's
not loud or brash but a sound signature
that is very easy to listen to
even at loud violence you won't have
hearing fatigue after you're done using
them now Bose is claiming to have a
dynamic volume optimized equalizer so
the sound characteristics would change
as you adjust vine up and down
I didn't notice really much of a change
but it all happens behind the scenes but
in general here base is punchy fast and
accurate it's not a deep sub bass it
doesn't Rumble like the powerbeats2 or
have a bass booster signature like the
j-bird products if you prefer that more
accurate and clean audio signature the
bose performs good in that aspect
regarding the mids it's clear accurate
once again it isn't bright at all nor is
it recessed or boxy it really performs
right in the middle of the audio
spectrum feeling unaltered but the highs
are distortion free and turn this up at
much higher violence there's no ting or
ear ringing I do admit though the
top-end doesn't sound as detailed though
as I would have hoped top hats cymbal
crashes and the likes we're not as acute
at louder vibes sensing there some
roll-off from Bose to keep the audio
signature safe from going overboard now
regarding soundstage there isn't much
there but I have noticed though most
sport earphones I've reviewed so far
they don't provide much of a soundstage
anyways the only brand that does provide
a very expansive experience has been
j-bird and les regarding wireless range
these work perfectly
walked from one side of the house to the
other and downstairs as well the signal
never broke or degraded when going
through several walls and the first
floor ceiling last both introduced their
own app when they released the bose qc25
headphones
and a sound sport here works with the
same app just like the QC 35s experience
there isn't much there there's a battery
level indicator volume adjustment if you
go into settings you can adjust the
power down time period when the
earphones are not in use turn on or off
the voice prompts and manage your parrot
devices other than that there's no audio
profiles there's no app equalizer or a
music player built-in so that's
everything on the new bose sound support
wireless here I really do like them and
the audio signature is very clean the
fit was good but not the greatest to me
however they were very comfortable again
