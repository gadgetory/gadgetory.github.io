review room I can't release one of the
most insane built in zooming cameras for
the average consumer
the Coolpix p900 feature is the ability
to zoom in 83 times it makes it
equivalent to a 24 to 2,000 millimeter
telephoto lens and it's only priced at
599 dollars as of this video so what
I'll do is we'll take a look at the
exterior and also some photos I've taken
around town as well and I'll give you my
insight along the way so let's get
started here without further ado I'm
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to jim's
reviewer now this review is for the
average consumer looking for a good
camera to take on their family trips or
vacations so I won't be going too deep
into the jargon but letting me the
viewer see how this works and in the end
how the photo should look as well but
starting with the physical build it
weighs in at about 2 pounds which went
held it does have some weight to it but
comparing to the Canon t5i or a Nikon
d3100 this coolpix is just slightly
heavier due to the huge lens inside it's
really not too bad but grabbing this has
been great though as it does offer a
very deep and contoured grip not to
mention very sticky contact surfaces now
on top you have of course your a trigger
button with zooming in and out slotting
either way now slightly below that is
your mode selection like auto aperture
and shutter priority now to the right is
your scroll wheel for going through your
menu options and use to adjust your
settings now going to the back of the
camera you have your LCD display to turn
on and off display options and the video
record button now below that are your
very standard features that you
basically see on most cameras today now
one thing I wanted to talk about is the
electronic viewfinder when the camera is
on and you have your LCDs foothold out
and facing you now if it's too bright
outside or if you want to see where
you're aiming at a little bit better you
look into the viewfinder and it turns
the external LCD off automatically and
basically the viewfinder on but looking
through the electronic viewfinder it's
not optical the real-time image in the
viewfinder is lacking because it's
digitally processed now some details of
the image is lost and the colors are a
bit washed out it's not a
deal-breaker but I felt somewhat of a
downgrade going from looking at the LCD
and then into the viewfinder itself but
moving on here indeed the LCD can swivel
out it's perfect for aligning the camera
for a group photo or getting in frame
basically and having the camera timer
essentially go off I know with my other
cameras I use this feature a lot
actually the LCD is not a touchscreen
and it does offer a plastic-like feel
that flexes ever so slightly nonetheless
the screen still performs as it should
and serves its purpose now going to the
right side here you have not a many but
a micro HDMI port for connecting this to
your TV and above that is a micro USB
port for exchanging data and files but
even better it's also used for charging
your camera's battery no special
proprietary cords or charging docks
needed but still on the right side here
is a NFC sensor it's abbreviated for
near-field communication now if you have
a smart phone with NFC capabilities you
basically just download the app and then
afterwards you just tap on this side of
the camera and this will create a
wireless link between the two devices
basically creates the ability for you to
beam your selected photos from the
camera and set it directly to your smart
phone and it's ideal for those who wants
to basically upload their photos to
Twitter Instagram or Facebook etc and
it's ideal for those who basically don't
have a good camera on their smart phones
themselves but the connection is fast
since it's over Wi-Fi and I didn't
encounter any issues with syncing data
as long as both devices are in the same
house obviously or in the same area and
on the same network now looking at the
very bottom very underrated here but
very important is a tripod mount and
then to the right hold your battery and
full-size SD card slot but now talking
about the lens here on the line of
Quebec's cameras there is not a manual
or focus ring on the barrel of the lens
to zoom in there's a lever on the side
though or you can use the one near the
trigger button as mentioned earlier and
although again there's no focus ring you
still do have manual focus though but
it's basically inside the menu options
at the guitar go through the settings
now you have to be in another mode
besides auto and then when you press
down on the directional button you
select MF instead of AF basically for
manual focus and autofocus respectively
and there you can spin the dial and
basically change the depth of where you
want to focus but I'll mitt this method
is
cumbersome and it's there if you need it
but I think this camera is really geared
towards the average consumer who won't
be using manual focus for these kind of
shots and if you aren't looking for this
specific control another DSLR would be a
little bit more ideal for you
but overall the Coolpix p900 feels well
put together and durable
despite some areas where you can tell
Nikon went with a lower-cost material
but more importantly here how are the
photos now we'll start with the main
selling feature the ability to basically
zoom in here's an overall picture
looking at a construction site there's
two guys here that I'll eventually zoom
upon again at yellow construction vest
and the other is on the roof in a orange
vest now here's the first photo and it's
crazy how close this thing gets and keep
in mind this is all optical not digital
zoom which would have degraded the
picture a bit here now here's the second
photo and this time on to the
construction worker on the roof now this
is pretty impressive again for a six
hundred dollar camera now keep in mind
if you're thinking of buying this be
sure to have a tripod now if you're
zoomed in this close and then holding it
with just your bare hands its ultra
sensitive and the image will basically
shake everywhere you'll need something
to keep this camera stable and now just
for giggles here here's a digitally
zoomed image which I never liked on any
camera anyways but you can see it's even
closer yes but it does introduce some
distortion to the image and now here one
last shot of zooming in an overall
Street View and I'll be zooming right
into that traffic light in the sensor
now the image for a $600 camera is good
in my opinion but the ability to zoom in
like this is pretty impressive you can
see the texture of the cable a nice soft
Sheen to the rubber jacket as well but
let's now look at regular everyday
photos now keep in mind my videos are
edited but the photos on screen I'm
showing has been not edited at all now
this is what it looks like straight from
the coolpix 900 itself very clean images
a little more ray on the vertical rails
though but it's to be expected on
smaller sensor cameras like this one
now I had taken a picture of this stop
sign here as well to see how accurate it
is in regards to color reproduction and
it's pretty much spot-on
the stop sign indeed is faded a bit in
person and the camera didn't over
compensate or under saturate the image
it looks accurate from this sample here
but
now in regards to you low-light
performance overall if you're not
zooming so much on the image it looks
fine but if you do look at the finer
details I personally did notice there's
slightly more noise in the dark areas
compared to my crop sensor nikon d50 100
now the coolpix does have a smaller
sensor and I expected it to underperform
a bit in low-light but overall I believe
this image is still usable if you're the
average consumer and last is a macro
test basically seeing how closest they
can get to a subject and this thing does
ridiculously well now it is springtime
and this bum will be here on the ground
was right there in front of me and it is
dusted in pollen here and aiming right
at his head it looks crazy in detail a
bit freaky but it's illustration on
macros or just playing close-up shots
it's quite impressive
so overall with photo quality contrary
to what the LCD screen or viewfinder
shows once you bring home the photos and
put them on your computer they come out
really nice
and for the most part performed as good
as my more expensive Nikon d50 100 now
the only downfalls are it's limited and
not as good low-light performance and
the low megapixel count but for the
price and the smaller sensor built into
the camera it is you can say to be
expected it's not really a downfall but
it's reasonable for its price the colors
more importantly do come out accurate
and granted most of my photos were shot
over several days and each day was just
cloudy basically the picture still came
out pretty well and one thing I haven't
mentioned yet is the image stabilization
now for non super zoomed in photos if
you do have somewhat shaky hands the
image stabilization helps tremendously
and keeping the image where you want it
to basically snap your photo but at the
end of the day you are paying a bit more
in the coolpix line for that zooming
feature and as you've seen in the photos
and the samples you can see it does very
well it's the main selling feature of
the P 900 so hope this review helped you
in some way if you like my work add me
on to your social media right now on
either Facebook Twitter or Instagram
using my name here jim's review room so
that's it for this video feel free to
take a look at my other work here and
I'll see you guys on the next one you
