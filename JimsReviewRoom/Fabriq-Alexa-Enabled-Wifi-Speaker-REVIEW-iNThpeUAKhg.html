room once in a while do these
budget-friendly reviews I got to do some
budget reviews and headphones to I know
you guys have been asking for that so
who just be on the lookout those are
coming soon but in the meantime have
these tiny little speakers that's Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth enabled they have some
LEDs on here too and you guys know LEDs
are all the rage at the moment but what
is also unique and the name of the
product insists they are covered in
fabric to match or add to your style now
this is the fabric speaker retailing for
$49 they're sold on Amazon but always
being transparent with you guys February
did sponsor this video and sent these
over from Target my review and
assessment was not altered in any way
now be sure to watch the entire video
for both pros and cons as always uh
place my affiliate links in the video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
these things might go on sale so without
further adieu be sure to follow me on
facebook twitter or instagram again I'm
Jimmy with jims review room and I'm here
to help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
going over the physical features this is
seriously compact if it's right in the
palm of my hand which I don't see every
day
there's a variety of styles to are shown
on the camera for you but there's others
with the link in my video description
because of the fabric it gives off this
soft look the helps break up the hard
and solid surfaces around my work area I
know it seems really far out there but
seriously it gives off a more calming
feel to my environment but the fabric
seriously though it looks good and the
quality behind it is nice and moreover
the buttons you have here are on the
rear because the speaker is Wi-Fi
enabled it's connected to your home's
internet connection allowing you to have
access to Amazon alexis features now the
same features that's on Amazon echo and
Amazon dot price on my button and
request for the weather what's on your
calendar some generic updates but to
further show you here's a few examples
in real time nothing is sped up to show
you its performance what's the weather
in Charlotte it's 74 degrees with
showers today you can look for lots of
clouds and thunderstorms with a high of
79 degrees and a low of 69 degrees turn
on black cable oh okay also if you have
accounts with Spotify our heart radio
and such you can use them with the
speaker through Alexa I continue with
the buttons holding volume up or down
for two seconds skips and goes back on
solves pause and play is straightforward
but lifting up the flap here you have
access to Wi-Fi and bluetooth pairing
last is a button to toggle through the
LED lights another display on the bottom
is simple with some colors rotating
around the ring here well--there's party
mode as well that blinks to your audio
and the other is basically a solid white
light that I particularly like and of
course you can always turn this all off
regarding Bluetooth signal fabric is
using Bluetooth 2.1 which is somewhat
old these days but I tested the signal
just to be safe here with my test on my
current daily phone they sent some si
plus and my office test phone the pixel
XL I got a total range of 40 to 44
linear feet until the signal started to
crackle regarding battery life a fabric
is climbing up to 5 hours of use which
is very low doing a quick Amazon search
all the budget speakers are getting 12
to 15 hours of use and have the same 5
watt power output as well with my
testing at 50% but from a full battery
today I was able to get 4 hours and 17
minutes to be exact
now if you're not intending to use this
so much for travel and will be leaving
this mainly at your desk you can leave
the speaker plugged in with a USB cord
again this depends on your situation and
how you intend on using it with the USB
cord inserted keep in mind the flap is
raised the buns are still usable but
will require you to pinch the buttons
with your thumb and finger versus a
press one feature that is surely missing
here if there was a button I can press
that would indicate battery life that
would have helped tremendously the LED
light only shows one it's low but never
indicating if I'm at 50 or 80% etc
better remaining the fabric app doesn't
have any indication either so - the
moment you've been waiting for here the
audio test I'll play several samples for
you guys and then I'll give you my
verdict afterward
[Laughter]
and there you have it folks audio
recorded on my end and then play through
your speakers are not the best depiction
of audio quality but it's my review here
the audio is actually pushed up from the
top audio is not coming out from the
sides keep in mind this is also a little
5 watt speaker and priced at just 50
dollars and with that being said it is
perfect for very casual very personal
listening leave at the desk on the
nightstand at the end of the couch and
playing it at low to medium volume
levels may be playing Amazon music or
tune in radio in the background while
working or relaxing it's great now for
those who are intending on pushing the
speaker hard because of the size of the
fabric it's going to be limiting now
once you push this to 75 to 80% balm you
start to hear very slight droning in the
base push the speaker above 80% you're
going to get distorted bass where it
flutters and flaps on bass heavy songs
it can get loud but the audio quality at
loud levels again around 75 to 80
percent isn't clear or distinct and does
get slightly recessed the very high
frequencies aren't sharp and tingey
which is good for a budgets figure but
because there's so much roll-off you do
lose again those details the resolution
and the sharpness on the top end now the
other feature I want to mention since
we're in this sound test within the
fabric app you can pair the speakers to
either offer left and right audio
separation which tremendously helps with
the experience but you can pair multiple
speakers and have them all play at the
same time throughout your home just make
sure that you tap both speakers into
wireless mode or Wi-Fi mode that is it's
going to show a white ring on the bottom
of speaker
for me I wasn't aware one the speakers
actually within Bluetooth mode as
indicated by a blue ring instead but
other than that my personal opinion here
this speaker is Alexa enabled I
generally do like a fabric build a lot
and this price point it's not
bad for really generic audio at work to
have white noise when you go to sleep in
two places next to my laptop while
working but if you're planning on moving
this around a bit the better life is not
great at all and if you're intending on
having this speaker to be loud and get
you jammin yes it can get loud but the
audio quality wasn't as good as other
budgets Bluetooth speakers I've tested
on the channel so hope this review
helped you in some way be sure to LIKE
and subscribe if you haven't already you
guys take care and I will see you on the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
