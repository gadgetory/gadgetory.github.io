review by Jim's review room I know it's
been forever since I did a review but
had a change in jobs and you know some
personal things happen in my personal
life here but in the end some tough
times but it is for the better though so
let's get started here today we'll be
looking at the samsung series 5 13.3
Ultrabook model np5 3-0 u3c that's a
long title and we'll look into the
ultrabooks construction style
specifications and features and lastly
my pros and cons and its performance and
usage so let's get started here I
purchased this ultra book from Amazon
for $749 On January 1st 2013 this unit
comes with the third generation 1.7
gigahertz I 5 processor 4 gigs of ram
and 500 gigabytes of the standard
platter harddrive now it comes with a 24
gigabyte flash memory hard drive
separate from the main 500 gig hard
drive which is just reserved for the
operating system just a speed up system
booting the exterior is gray but Samsung
calls it light Titan construction looks
like brushed aluminum but in reality
it's a plastic body more information
will be in the description below but
I'll just go over the basics for now so
this particular model comes with a built
in webcam intel HD graphics 4000
built-in wireless and internet and
networking Windows 7 home premium and
the unit itself weighs in at about three
point four pounds the exterior features
include one super speed USB 3.0 inputs
and your standard two USB 2.0 inputs
full size HDMI connections microphone
headphone inputs and a four in one SD
card reader on the side well I'll start
with the pros this computer for the
price is a hybrid or it is a cross
between a real ultrabook and a
traditional laptop now it does have a
very decent slim profile coming in at a
little over a half an inch thick as you
can see the side angles it looks really
slim this laptop is on point for
travelers and those on the go when I
shop for other laptops in this category
and price range
such as the acer timeline series and
some of the ThinkPad lenovo show most of
the laptops came in a little bit heavier
just by several ounces and actually a
slightly taller as well or thicker and
this has to be one of the sleek is
looking hybrid ultrabooks I can find at
the time the third-generation i5
although at 1.7 gigahertz is to me
pretty much fast for average or daily
news emails webpages office productivity
applications etc four gigs of ram was
just barely enough boot up from the
samsung built-in flash hard drive was
also fast enough but to be honest with
you after I installed my own Samsung SSD
in there this thing is now a beast you
can definitely tell the hard job is
bottlenecking the performance altogether
it's definitely nice to have a full HDMI
cable connection so you can connect it
to a TV or monitor on the fly internet
connection is pretty fast the screen
itself is bright enough of course don't
expect a Retina display but as you can
see in the video the video quality from
the recording device is not up to par
but again it's your standard screen or
monitor that you can see now as I've
said before this is what I personally
call a hybrid and you can tell samsung
head to cut some corners just to keep
the price down a quote unquote real
ultrabook in my opinion comes with a SSD
hard drive standard better life is a
little bit better than this laptop here
this one does come with a massive 500
gig platter hard drive and as I
mentioned though does severely
bottleneck the performance on this
machine the processor is great but again
you really don't realize how great it is
until you actually install the SSD just
to remove that bottleneck altogether
there's also one more slot to expand the
ramp up to eight gigabytes which I have
done in this video the laptop now just
screams and the upgrades did cost me an
Edition $134 and I did install it myself
but yet again it's cheaper than going
all out with an ultrabook
in just in my opinion a MacBook Air if
you ever own one or held one at the
match store actually has an aluminium
body and when holding it it feels sleek
in the
you'll sell machine this plastic body
and the Samsung although not detrimental
but because of his slimness and when
opening a laptop it feels a little
finicky in my opinion as in feeling a
bit of flex in the body itself the
better life is not up to par in my
opinion for being a hybrid considering
this is the third generation i5 and
considering that I have installed the
SSD these two items would reduce or
lessen the power consumption the battery
under normal use of office productivity
and average website usage leaving away
from my desk and coming back from time
to time gave me about four and a half
hours to five hours of usage at one full
charge I was honestly hoping to achieve
at least 6 hours with the upgrades and
now to me this really huge flaw in my
opinion again is whenever I type I rest
my palms on the laptop and it also bumps
the finger pad the trackpad and move the
cursor while typing hugely annoying and
happens surprisingly frequent attempting
to read just my palms left me awkwardly
uncomfortable so again just a huge flaw
unfortunately overall at this standard
laptop with a really nice looking body
you honestly get what you pay for
due to its construction in the
components such as that platter hard
drive and a 4 gigs of RAM however you
would only benefit and I can say
somewhat beats a real ultrabook that
will be well over $1000 if only you
upgrade the items that I did again the
hard drive in the RAM if you can do the
upgrades yourself and get over the
plastic construction this laptop is
great for your basic news and demanding
office productivity requirements so to
conclude this for the price it is very
fitting in its category with the
upgrades it's definitely worth it if you
are only in the market looking for a
slim laptop or something close enough to
an authentic ultra book as long as you
can get over the palm touching the
finger pad or trackpad and the battery
life this laptop might be worth it for
you so I hope you enjoyed this review of
the samsung series 5 ultra book as it's
an unbiased review and just my personal
opinions on the product and personal
usage if you have not please take your
