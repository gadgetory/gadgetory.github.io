review room welcome to another review
today we'll be looking at one of Sony's
new lineup of Bluetooth speakers the one
I have here is the $200 SRS x5 with the
X 7 and X 9 being $300 and Halabi
$700 respectively we'll see if the
cheapest out of the three is still good
enough to war a purchase so without
further ado we'll get started
although its objective the first time I
saw the speak on rats I was quite
impressed the sides feature brushed
aluminum the very top is a beautiful
gloss black finish
despite being fingerprint from and both
the front and back is an aluminum mesh
grille the unit is a bit thick though
assuming that these speakers are more
for moving around the house rather than
bring it to the park when compared to
other Bluetooth speakers measurements
come in at eight point eight inches wide
four point eight inches high and exactly
two inches thick and sony claims this
weighs in about two and a half pounds
but when I hold my sound link to from
Bose which claims to weigh more Sony
actually feels a little bit heavier
though I don't have a micro scale so I
couldn't test but in general I don't
foresee myself bringing this to the
beach or my family trips now for a
200-dollar speaker the x5 comes in with
some very good features that you don't
see on some other speakers available at
the very top you have sophisticated
touch sensitive buttons with classy
glowing white LEDs the power and
speakerphone but on the far right are
the only two that are physical volume
buttons are standard with no skip
reverse or pause buttons unfortunately
audio n is used when you want to
physically connect your speaker with
your audio source pairing is used for
wireless Bluetooth connections and to
the left of that is a sound button for
clear Audio plus now more than that
sound quality a bit later
and of course a charge indicator but no
light to indicate how much battery is
remaining until the very far left here
you'll see a Near Field Communication
logo which means any phone or tablet you
have with NFC capabilities you can pair
a device with a speaker just by tapping
your device there there's no need of
going through your Bluetooth settings
now rotating to the rear another feature
that started to show and the latest
speakers is a charge out port you can
connect your USB phone or tablet charger
here and the x5 will charge your device
next as stated earlier is a
three-and-a-half millimeter input for
your physical audio in and lastly
support for the supplied wall charger
and speaking of power and batteries sony
claims up to eight hours of news and
I've personally tested this and left it
at fifty percent value from a full
charge and the unit dot F there seven
hours and 57 minutes not bad at all
so with premium build qualities and
materials and some features that are not
available at some other speakers how
does it sound
what I'll do to critique and demo the
unit I'll play several songs and give
you my verdict afterwards it's all my
baby we don't mind
all the watching cuz it deciding close
windows they might learn something
nothing but a little to do it he does it
York so far
I'm a living oh yeah and I'm a sick of
being a good night while I'm on my
giggling while I'm drinking Bud Light
huh can you get it when you miss me like
I'm with whiskey drink Jim Beam hey baby
do you do we do it that way but you do
that did you take a break you noted on
the beach when I kill it on the beach
like a six on the beach like it's Malibu
chase you see the California way to go
with their babies even californica like
we all man I stir
and there you have it folks
all the artist information is found in
the video description below now sound of
course is best heard in person and we're
playing through your speakers it's not
the best depiction of audio quality
now hence my review here listening to
John Rose like hip-hop rap and pop all
did very well there's enough balanced
bass to have the sound experience
enjoyable and of all Bluetooth speakers
I've reviewed so far the bass response
of this x5 is on par with the Bose
Soundlink a very balanced approach where
it doesn't drone out other audio
frequencies and for this price range of
$200 it's very good bass the mid-range
across the audio spectrum focuses on
vocals and areas where the average ear
determines if it's good audio or not
there's no droning and the clarity is
there for singers and string instruments
like guitar and violin because of F
there's a decent amount of fidelity and
immersion into your music and the same
can be said for the highs
listening to EDM house techno all did
very well considering with electronic
music there's many variables playing at
the same time in which the sound can be
a little bit muddled
however the highs stay strong and acute
without droning or ear ring tennis
throughout and as I mentioned earlier
about the clear Audio plus my tests
found that the mids and highs are pushed
a little bit more forward and sounded
clearer than having the option off so
for $200 I think it's appropriately well
priced with its quality in both audio
and in its physical build plus having
some features that are not seen on some
other Bluetooth devices and if you're at
this price range the x5 after doing so
many reviews here is a really good buy
so be sure to comment below and tell me
what you think about this speaker and
for those who are considering of
purchasing this I hope that helped you
in some way and as always be sure to
