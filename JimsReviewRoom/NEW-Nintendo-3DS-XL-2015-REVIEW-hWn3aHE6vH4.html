review room antenna released there 3dsxl
back in August of 2012 here in the
states and a little over two years later
Nintendo has made some improvements and
refinements to their system now the big
question what are they since this new
device looks practically the same and
not a total redesign so let's take a
look at what Nintendo dubs as they quote
new 3ds XL priced at $199 as of this
video i'm your source for making a
purchase decision
welcome to jim's review room going over
the physical features first they do
indeed look practically identical in
both size and thickness even when
weighing them the old 3ds versus the new
one they are identical or at least very
close to being so now the main
difference from just a glance is the new
paint scheme it's visually more
appealing with now a very glossy paint
with an underlying diagonal pattern now
granted it looks nice when new but after
a few minutes of playing this thing is
for sure a fingerprint magnet now this
is both on the lid and on the bottom of
the device as well but let's go over the
physical connections on the front the
new 3ds moves the cartridge insert here
instead of having it down the back now
three and a half millimeter headphone
port is in the sensor now with the
stylus pen and power buttons slightly
moved to its new location it's not a bad
position for the pen that is but it
doesn't feel as natural to get as with
the old 3ds which had it on the side now
rotating to the right the 3d button
remains on the screen for adjusting your
three-dimensional depth and the Wi-Fi
on/off button is now completely removed
now one thing I wanted to mention
antenna remove this slot to access and
remove your full-size SD card unlike the
old model this same 4 gigabyte size has
changed to a micro SD card form factor
but it's actually behind the cover which
you have to basically unscrew now
swinging all the way over here the
volume slider is on the left side of the
screen and not on the main body anymore
and basically the left side is pretty
simple but now rotating to the rear the
back has your standard left and right
shoulder buttons
the new zr and ZL buttons similar to
what we've seen at the circle pad pro
specifically for previous gaming titles
like Resident Evil Revelations and
Kingdom Hearts 3 d8 now you will also
notice that the charging port has moved
to the middle and one thing for folks
who are not aware the new 3ds XL does
not come with a charging adapter that's
right you can't charge your portable
device unless one you've owned a
previous 3ds or 2d s and still have the
adapter or two you buy a new one
altogether which isn't too bad it's
about 10 or 11 dollars but still it's an
add-on which I'm sure will catch some
people by surprise but opening up the
device here it looks just cleaner with
small changes to the layout just one
home button to the bottom of the screen
here with your start and select buttons
move to the far right the nice addition
of colors to the a B X&amp;amp;Y buttons adds a
nice touch but more importantly let's
look at the screen now I know it's hard
to tell but in person the new 3ds looks
to be slightly brighter and the colors
looks more accurate on the old model
there appears to be like a slight pink
or red tint on the screen that I noticed
now both still feature the same screen
size measuring 4.1 8 inches for the
touch screen on the bottom which is
still very responsive not like a glass
ring tablet but for this it still works
fine any 3d screen is still the 4.8 8
inch LCD now granted both screens
doesn't have much to talk about in
regards to resolution or pixels but
having this new 3ds being backwards
compatible is a huge plus
now most older games from the old 3ds
2ds and even some nintendo dsi games
still works on this new portable device
and I think adjusting the resolution
would be Nintendo having to upscale or
rerender some of its games so they
clearly played it safe here but I have
to say it actually works basically
keeping majority of their Nintendo
gaming ecosystem compatible by going
back to the screen here although
everything discussed so far is really
just relocating parts to streamlining
their design the first biggest update is
the new face tracking feature for its 3d
performance now on the old 3ds a slight
nudge would cause the screen to show
jagged or double images where the 3d
would basically be off you had a sit at
the right position and not real
move to get the optimum viewing angle I
guess you can say and if you're on
public transportation where you know
bumping around a little bit you can
almost forget about having that 3d
experience and with the new super scale
3d is what Nintendo dubs it you can jolt
in jostle or lean to the right or left
and for the most part the image stays
together still producing that 3d image
perfectly it's actually a huge
improvement in this case for the end
user experience
now as for those who never owned a 3ds
before a 3d feature is shockingly well
done without the need of glasses there's
a decent amount of depth perception that
does not make you dizzy and I personally
get motion sickness in the car or
airplane pretty easily and never once
did the new or old 3ds affect me and
it's really intriguing playing games
with a bit more immersion because of
this technology and by any chance you
don't want 3d you can always use the
slider to tone it down a bit or off
altogether but going down the list here
additional new features include a faster
processor and increase of RAM from 128
to 256 megabytes now from real-world
testing it's not as noticeable when
playing current games since they're
mostly optimized to work on older
systems
now when newer games are released I'm
sure the extra power will then be better
utilized but as for opening apps the new
system does on average open an app like
Netflix slightly faster by a second or
so again not much of a huge improvement
realized in the real world at this time
but it is technically faster now one big
improvement that was noticed was the
camera holding them side-by-side and
turning the new system just works that
much more fluid and just looks cleaner
now the last update Nintendo provided is
offering up meebo and NFC supports to be
built in this newly introduced feature
allows you to collect and add characters
to your game level up or customise them
in addition obtain bonuses and special
items now the great thing about these is
you buy one and it's good for multiple
games coming out now and into the future
all you have to do is tap your chosen
character and to the new 3ds screen and
your character will be uploaded into
games like Super Smash Brothers
currently now other minor tests and user
experience that I performed was battery
life and I was able to get 6 hours of
straight gaming and playing around with
the operating system and what
which is normal for Nintendo you can say
now for those who intend on using this
for Netflix both loaded movies at
practically the same time there wasn't
much performance difference that I
noticed for the screen and the new 3ds
does look much more natural and more
accurate than that red tint and the old
model and for the speakers it sound
practically sounded identical either
model didn't show or seem louder or
better from my experience and to answer
your curiosity videos are not shown in
3d on Netflix or YouTube
unfortunately so I know some people were
questioning or skeptical considering
this isn't a total redesign and I think
Nintendo was intending this to be an
upgrade for most people especially for
those who are coming from that small
screen of the 2d s and not to mention
this doesn't even come with a power
adapter and I think Nintendo is
expecting you to use the old systems
adapter and just bring it over here
but anyways for those who are on the
older 3ds systems the refinements on the
new system does improve the experience
especially these super stable 3d
performance but for the most part
battery life performance physical build
it's practically the same now don't get
me wrong it does add up to make this a
more streamlined handheld but I'll be
honest again it's really up to you if
you see value in upgrading let me know
in the comments below but my opinion for
those deciding to upgrade are not from
the old 3ds I really don't think you can
go wrong either way so hope this video
helped you in some way if you like my
work add me gems reviewer onto Facebook
Twitter and I'm on Instagram now or
Google+ as I normally post updates on
items I'm currently testing before I put
them on the website again this is Jimmy
wood Jim's review room you guys take
care and I'll see you on the next one
