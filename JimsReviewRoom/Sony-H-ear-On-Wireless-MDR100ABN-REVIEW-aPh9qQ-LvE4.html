room the summer fans here told me Sony
was releasing an update through their
MDR 100 line with their MDR 180 ends now
they're wireless which a lot of
consumers are demanding for these days
in addition they're also featuring noise
canceling capabilities I personally paid
for this at the retail price of three
hundred and fifty dollars which when
compared to the competition it is
somewhat expensive but for updated
prices I'll place several links in the
video description below click on those
and you can see what the updated prices
are today so without further ado my
channels here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
Jen's
go over the physical features the one
thing that surprised me as soon as I
open the package was the coloring in
pictures on the website I was expecting
a flat color scheme but in person it
looks like an anodized look that is that
reflects light at different angles it's
giving a lot of personality to these
pair of headphones now up top the
headband uses a familiar ratchet system
that's more sensitive than other
headphones I've used however during
testing here the headphones do not
extend accidentally when bumped or when
you're in movement now moving down to
other side the ear cups do swivel just
enough to fit most heads here but I'll
detail more information and my comfort
test shortly I want the biggest things
though
although the ear cups don't feel
completely flat here that your cups do
fold in force knowing which is a huge
plus now there is a carrying case
provided which doesn't come with the
wired pair of Hurons
so it's a nice plus here if you need
that extra protection however from my
use of throwing these in my bag without
the case of course and bumping into
other headphones and other products in
my bag here no scratches were evidence
and the finish held up really well and
since we're on the topic of durability
doing my stress tests and I'm aware this
doesn't happen in real life but hey it's
nice to know how well these can last the
180 ends did perfect with no creeks or
squeaks here and the metal band keeps
its original form without deforming the
headphones themselves now finishing up
the features here on the left ear cup
there's the noise cancelling on an off
button with the power button down below
a microUSB port to charge the headphones
and regarding better life since we're
here sony claims up to 20 hours of use
in with my testing here of leaving this
on at 50% volume and noise cancelling on
the entire day i was able to achieve
over 24 hours of use which is in the top
tier of wireless performance while the
xik 2.0 is here lasts only six hours or
so and these Sennheiser Momentum's
lasting around 20 hours as well but
getting back to the ear cups you have a
physical three half millimeter port and
last is the microphone for either noise
canceling performance and/or to use
these headphones with phone calls now on
the right ear cup pause play and skip
with the vine record buttons below the
only thing that was a slight nuisance
though there's a bump with volume up but
when feeling for volume down the button
feels almost flush with the air cup not
a big deal but something I did notice
it's kind of hard to find basically I
leave very less features that you cannot
see this has NFC for easy pair just tap
your NFC device and this will pair your
headphones pretty easily via bluetooth
el deck which is Sony's own technology
just like App X which ensures the
wireless transmission of audio keeps its
quality but el deck does go one step
further in supporting high resolution
audio files and very less the noise
cancelling on these are very very well
done here at testing these in the city
on the streets it blocks out nearly
everything and in the office here the
hum of my computer is completely silent
and most other noises around me are
basically virtually gone now the noise
canceling performed as well as the
parrot zieks in my opinion very close to
the bose qc25 s but not just there
though but very good though for Sony's
the only error that I didn't notice
where it was still having sound coming
basically was when I was at Starbucks on
a busy day and people around me were
speaking for some reason I could hear
that while most other environments were
mostly quiet unless regarding comfort
these do weigh in just under 300 grams
anything under 300 I usually find
comfortable they're not the lightest but
over time wearing these the 180 ends
worked for the most part well as much as
I love my Sennheiser wireless Momentum's
I noticed the sony 100 ABN snugged
around my ear better than the
Sennheiser's but I did notice slight
wearing fatigue or pressure at the crown
of the head after wearing these for
about an hour but there's no jawline
discomfort here and my ears never did
sweat which is great in general I really
believe that they're good but again not
perfect that is for my head here maybe
because of the weight but other than
that regarding the audio quality when
comparing to the previous noise
cancelling headphones the 100 a B ends
are flatter in the bass Department it's
very tight and considered really
conservative through these Sennheiser
momentum Wireless if you're familiar
with the bose qc25
the bass levels on those the sony's
provide just a bit more than that and
it's not bass boosted sounding it's not
deep as these settings prepare at Zeke's
or the JBL's if you do like that flatter
sound signature definitely consider the
again the 180 ends now regarding the
mid-range it is very clear here because
sitting the bass doesn't come over to
the vocals here thank goodness to effect
the audio characteristics but it's not
bright it's just really a clean and
crisp sound signature regarding highs
though the Sony's overall fuel is very
well balanced in general and then the
highs were just kept in tact or the
great quality of minimal
- no roll-off on the top in yet not
letting it get too loose basically at
having that ear ringing or ear piercing
screeches that regarding soundstage it's
surprisingly pretty open with hearing
directions from the left and right of
course but forward and back as well the
Sennheiser still held out a little bit
better in regards to depth but these
sony's are one of the best compared to
the competition
now as for loudness these do get loud
enough for me and I don't think most
will have problems with this in that
department but as for sound leaking
though this does leak a moderate amount
at higher volumes but on the plus side
here as most good pair of headphones
wireless headphones that is a signal was
never lost and walked through the other
side of the house and even downstairs so
in the end here I think the new Sony 180
ends are great as an overall pair of
headphones there's definitely some
strong suits while the sound signature
might be a bit more niche for some folks
though now I would say if you're into
the sound characteristics go for it as
almost every other area the headphones
does well in so that's it for this
