diehard Sony fan and I guess it was
ingrained by my dad loving everything
Sony at the time but I couldn't say my
dad was right or wrong they've made the
Walkman the discman and when I was about
13 the first PlayStation that came out
changing the gaming industry
not to mention at the time Sony's line
of XP our TVs were possibly the most
amazing displays that you can see when
you walk through Best Buy or Circuit
City I was a fanboy at an early age and
at that time Samsung to me was almost
non-existent
as I went off to college in 2000 brand
loyalty kind of died and I guess because
of growing up and maturing
I just wanted what worked well even till
today I don't consider myself as a brand
fanatic of either Sony or Samsung
neither Toyota or Honda in the car world
you can say I just know they make good
stuff in their own way but what
intrigued me the most as I finished
reviewing a Samsung tablet the other
week I went down to my fridge to get
some you know some food or a quick snack
and BAM Samsung the logo was right in my
face I walked upstairs back to my
computer and noticed the monitors I
bought years ago before I became a
youtuber were pasal Samsung I recently
upgraded my hard drives with a samsung
solid-state and I bought them based on
industry reviews and performance and
lastly the holy grail is my TV it's a
super slim 8000 series led by Samsung
there's no pun intended but you kind of
get the picture here so here's my look
into Samsung where they came from what
they've done and where they may be
heading here's Samsung taking over
Samsung located in our south of amazing
Seoul South Korea an amazing place where
new trends are created a leader in
consumer electronics in home to hardcore
gamers of StarCraft now Samsung like
South Korea and anyone alike had humble
beginnings Samsung early on was an
insurance company and food exporter to
nearby country of China but by the 60s
Samsung developed Samsung Electronics in
start of producing TVs washers and
dryers with microwaves shortly in the
70s in 1987 Samsung's founding chairman
William chhole Lee passed away after
almost 50 years of running and
transforming this company his son
kun-hee Lee has taken over and ordered a
restructure of the business demanding a
stronger focus on consumer electronics
and to rid the stigma of being that
budget brain of things now by the mid
90s Samsung was almost everywhere but
really wasn't known as the go-to product
although the South Korean giant made
some impressive innovations they were
more behind the scenes you can say
Samsung was the first to develop 64 and
256 megabytes DRAM they also were the
first to produce 1 gigabyte of RAM as
well beating the likes of micron
technologies and all other Ram
manufacturers at the time by now Samsung
were in computers computer monitors cell
phones air conditioning units fridges
TVs you name it now with a new direction
in quality and innovation samson
eventually had won the best partnerships
at the time and still possibly today in
2005 samsung agreed to manufacture
memory chips for Apple in nearly ten
years later they're still doing it today
matter of fact Samsung is still a major
supplier and manufacturer of the a7
processor currently available in the
latest iPhone the 5s also in 2005 brand
consulting company Interbrand from New
York's Fifth Avenue measured and
declared Samsung
have surpassed the Sony and it became
the twelfth largest and most popular
consumer brand in the world and from
there it starts to snowball to what we
have here today Samsung unveiled their
first ever Galaxy S phone in 2010 for me
personally I didn't hear much about it
since Apple was all over the media with
their iPhone and soon to be released
their first ever iPad now by the first
quarter of 2012 Samsung became the
best-selling mobile phone company
overtaking global giant Nokia with their
Galaxy S line and Galaxy Note phones
today with the galaxy s5 you have some
very innovative features that I wish
were seen on some of the competitors
phones as well
now the multi-window is available for
multitasking apps at the same time the
phone although we still expected a
higher resolution is the best screen
quality / display mate comm which does
vigorous testing and provides lab
results for display quality the s5
features the latest processor from
Qualcomm and additional features like a
fast performance camera and although
some say it's gimmicky a built-in heart
rate monitor now / Gartner research firm
which does market analysis on consumer
electronics Samsung sold a little under
three hundred million smartphones in
2013 making Samsung having thirty-one
percent market share it's not bad at all
but to put this in perspective Apple's
sold nearly 50 percent less at a hundred
and fifty-one million units while in
third place of smartphone sales was
Huawei which sold forty six point six
million units samsung no question is in
a distant lead now regarding tablets
shifting from sales I want to talk about
Samsung diversification Samsung isn't
the number one leader in tablet sales
unless it keeps moving inventory like
they are currently the Samsung is
clearly trying to diversify their
product line
the beginning of 2014 Samsung released
their Galaxy Tab and note pro series
designating the pro for productivity it
features the best the best
specifications that Samsung has to offer
at the moment the Tab pro 8.4 inch
features the highest pixels per inch on
the market currently available all while
the Tab pro series is possibly the
thinnest tablet on the market today
being actually thinner than the popular
iPad air albeit just by 1/100 of an inch
now same or similar features from their
Galaxy smartphones and make their way
here with the multi window for running
apps simultaneously in Samsung is also
the first to bring out the controversial
12 point 2 inch models as some have
praised or dislike the unit for its size
while a good handful disliked it for its
high price now about the time of the
release of this video you might start
seeing the galaxy tab for Samsung's
follow up to the popular selling and now
more budget-friendly segment of tablets
what you'll see hits store shelves
pretty soon now they do offer lower
resolution slower processors and less
RAM however Samsung is well aware the
industry is changing as an analogy if
you look at BMW recently they have
saturated every number in their lineup
now offering the budget-friendly one
series 2 3 and so forth all the way up
to the $80,000 7 Series and Mercedes is
doing the same thing with making smaller
cars that are more affordable but still
bearing the Mercedes brand in point in
case HTC made an amazing phone last year
and it's still an amazing phone this
year with its latest model the m8 the
HTC as a company has taken a severe hit
in profit earnings just recently
announced us last month it's largely due
to loss of market share in the
smartphone industry there's no other
phones HTC has that isn't high-end at
the same time you can say that's doing
well by getting back to tablets here /
Gartner research firm again Apple's
market share of sales in 2012 was a
little over 52% for 2013 now it has
dropped to 36% and as were Samsung it
was in second place for 2012 with 7.4
percent market share of sales with 2013
more than
doubling to 19% with practically every
other tablet manufacturer remain largely
the same Samsung is no question going in
the right direction the third quality I
wanted to speak about was its innovation
in my eyes as the average consumer sony
was making some amazing TVs but when LED
TVs came around after plasma Samsung
came up with some amazing quality fast
forward a bit to about 2009 or 2010 and
Samsung began making some of the
slimmest TVs and not to mention thin
bezels on their flagship models now
Samsung was one of the first to push for
Smart TVs which we see in more TVs today
allowing an user to watch Netflix or
Hulu right on their set along with some
other internet features now last year's
model the f8000 series featured their
first ever quad-core processor built-in
and also offered hand gestures to
navigate again might be gimmicky or my
may be useful for some people there it's
this type of innovation that at least
people are hearing and seeing that makes
consumers wanting to purchase a Samsung
in general
albeit a more budget-friendly model
without those features now justice may
the 2014 models of LED TVs are just
hitting store shelves they might not be
the first ones and of course not the
only ones producing 4k TVs but they are
one of the few producing a curved screen
which I personally don't want but again
in my opinion it helps with Samsung's
marketing but Samsung has been working
on flexible displays for several years
now the TV panels are still glass but
what I'm speaking of is the new flexible
plastic it's thinner and lighter than
glass and possibly shatterproof and
Samsung for sure is working vigorously
on this as OLED infocomm mentioned
Samsung is currently bottlenecked with
its development process the production
is too hot for the plastic substrate and
causing it to melt a process is not as
efficient as the multi-layer sealing
process is very slow
now each panel takes six times in the
evaporation chamber to seal the layers
together now this is different from the
TVs now offer this year but for phones I
think this is a huge plus I don't care
too much for curved phones as I really
don't see
much of a purpose and I don't think it's
that much economic we better but just
for the fact that the phone will be
lighter thinner and shatterproof is
enough to get me excited and imagine
that technology soon on tablets then
monitors and just imagine the
possibilities so whichever way you put
it
Samsung is an 80-ton wrecking ball
coming her way and it may be too soon to
tell or maybe not if Samsung will
surpass other companies whereas Samsung
is doing well in so far it sounds so
rosy and Samsung seems like the to be
admired company but reading forums and
people's responses Samsung also has its
fair share of not so responsive customer
service and bad press now although
Samsung's flagship devices are very
impressive in their own way but some
have questioned their pricing in the
tablet industry as being too high more
expensive than the premium tablet the
iPad and the fact that Samsung's latest
phone remains plastic not curved not
high of a resolution as expected some
people not everybody we're somewhat
disappointed and this is not my opinion
but these are actual testimonials people
feel about Samsung and it was just
enough at least to be heard now is it
possible for Samsung to become too big
where customer service falls to the
wayside like Time Warner Cable or will
subpar products be put in to save a buck
here or there like General Motors did
back in the day because they can and
because they're just making too much
money at the time in the end we can't
ignore Samsung has product lines across
the board in almost every consumer
electronic category and appliance it
seems like there may be better products
out there maybe cheaper ones but
Samsung's dominance marketing
involvement and innovation makes it
almost hard to not have Samsung takeover
so there you have it folks my industry
review and Samsung for 2014 I hope you
guys enjoyed it I try to be unbiased
although I claimed all these Samsung
products I owned in the house but I
truly never put much effort into buying
a quote-unquote Samsung product but I do
my research and trying to find the best
product for me that is and either
fortunately or unfortunately whichever
it may be it's always been Samsung and
the information this video has been
through research and it did take some
time to do to put this all together all
I can ask if you can please help share
