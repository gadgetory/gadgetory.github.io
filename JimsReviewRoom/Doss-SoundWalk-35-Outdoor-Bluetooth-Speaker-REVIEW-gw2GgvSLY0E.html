room a few months ago I tested a very
budget-friendly Bluetooth speaker the
daus sound box and it was seriously a
great speaker for just thirty dollars
trying to test out more budget-friendly
items for you guys
daus this time set me over there and
just released rugged outdoor model the
daus sound walks
it's priced at $35 at the time of this
video maybe this again one of the
cheapest Bluetooth speakers I've tested
on the channel I'll leave my links in
the video description below click on
that it'll give you the most updated
prices so without further ado welcome
everyone to Jim's review room the
speakers are pretty straightforward and
simple no different here there's five
colors to choose from with black and
surprisingly this tool color or blue is
what they actually call it being my
favorite the white silicone or rubber
has some transparency though so it's not
an absolute true white so just a heads
up on that now this is considered as a
small speaker with a weight of less than
a pound making this easy to carry in
your bag here and the rubber casing does
help make this shockproof dustproof and
waterproof but only from splashes during
my testing sadly the drop test did fail
those the same drop tests that are doing
all my speakers from waist height now
you can hear this rattling and a speaker
not working any longer as for water
there's no damages to the speaker as
I've sprayed this down here but the
audio is muffled when the speaker does
get wet you have to wait until it dries
until it sounds normal again unlike the
more expensive mainstream brands like
the UE roll - or JBL clip - I can fully
submerge them in water pull them back
out and the audio still retains its
quality but under that the speaker
didn't have any other physical or other
quality issues now going over the
buttons they're very clicky with volume
up and down on the Left
mode selection to toggle between
Bluetooth wired and micro SD card for
your sources of music which I've showed
surely here and in the middle oddly not
a physical button at all but the LED
below it doesn't
which mode you're in a blue light shines
for a Bluetooth connection or if you're
using a physical court the light which
shine red now moving on pause and play
and answer phone calls is here and less
to the right is skipping or going back
on your music now going back to the
phone call parts the speakerphone does
work but with mine testing it's
seriously not usable thankfully does
provided more than one here and testing
this on several other of their speakers
the other person on the other line was
unable to hear me at less than a foot
away and holding the speaker to my mouth
my voice was somewhat audible but still
not of good quality but getting back to
the physical layout here on the right
side there's a power button on the
bottom and behind this flap here there's
an F three-and-a-half millimeter port
the micro SD card slot for music
listening that way and last is needing
microUSB port for charging the speaker
bosses claim up to eight hours of use
and I was able to get eight hours and 15
minutes with the speaker roughly at 50%
volume somewhat on the low end as most
people are expecting 9 to 10 hours from
the competition but eight hours is not
dismal at all now last but not least
here I did this on all my Bluetooth
speakers I walk down stairs and on to
the other side of the house and the
signal never dropped in total this was
about 40 linear feet through two walls
now to the moment you've been waiting
for hear the sound test I'll play
several songs and then I'll give you my
verdict afterwards
it was shadows
Oh
and there you have it folks now sound
recorded on my end and then play through
your speakers are not the best depiction
of audio quality button hence my review
here the sound is only pumped out
through the front
despite the rear having an open grille
now compared to the non splash proof
model that dos offers the sound box this
sound walk has a slight bass emphasis
offering a slightly deeper sound it's
present but it isn't much though
now bass is still lacking but for the
price range it is somewhat to be
expected at low to medium volume the
speaker does fine for casual and
personal listening and if you're just
needing audio that's a very capable of
speaker if you do turn this up to about
80% volume or higher for music while
working around the house or across the
room it does get slightly muffled and
you do lose that clarity that you hear
on beat non splash proof model now the
highs are also a bit sharp at higher
volumes introducing a little of
listening fatigue and droning through
the sound signature again at higher
volume with basic tracks the speaker
does vibrate and move around the table
as well just a little bit so just a
heads up on that no spatial sound just
like most Bluetooth speakers even the
100 150 dollar models there isn't much
audio separation at the end of the day
this is good for a very casual listening
podcast maybe some casual Netflix
watching the main selling feature on
this is it is splash proof for just $35
and you still get a loud enough speaker
it cool into the more expensive speakers
but if you're looking for audio
immersion or a focus on better audio
quality characteristics you gotta look
elsewhere as a quick reminder here the
physical quality of being
shock-resistant didn't stand up as well
to other speakers that I've tested but
you can beat a judge if this is worth
$35 to you or not so be sure to LIKE and
subscribe if you haven't already

Twitter and or Instagram you guys take
care and I'll see you in the next one
bye
