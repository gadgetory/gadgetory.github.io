room Bost returns with a new sound link
color to falling in the small bluetooth
category and price as the most
budget-friendly option in their lineup
I personally pay for this at the retail
price of $130 but I'll leave my links in
the video description below click on my
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time as always my
channels here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's reviewers
at first glance this looks very similar
to the older model but physically it's
improved quite a bit this smooth yet
hard plastic feeling is gone and we now
have a rubberized coating giving a
premium feel and improved grip the
buttons up top have improved as well to
give it a more very click you feel
they're not 100% tactile as I've
experienced other speakers here but for
the average consumer they're still
perfectly fine the front door was used
to flex or bow in on the old model it's
now rock-solid
giving a bit more confidence but besides
the build quality being up to par with
other speakers on the market here we
also get water resistance it's only ipx4
rated meaning it's only splash proof at
IPX 5 speakers can take water sprays IPX
6 can take pressurized water sprays and
only at ipx7 and higher that's when
speakers can be submerged now splash
proof on the boats is enough for most
people but if you're looking for
something more rugged something you want
to bring onto the boat or have peace of
mind with your kids playing around the
pool here JBL Yui and fugu are just some
of the other brands out there that you
can completely submerge underwater now
moving on there's simply a
three-and-a-half millimeter input and a
side here for physical connections and a
microUSB port for charging the speaker
that's basically it now regarding
battery life Bose is climbing up to
eight hours of use which isn't too bad
but if you're intending I'm playing this
all day some of the other competitors
offers slightly more with 10 or 12 hours
worth of life now you can be the judge
and how much you really need now last
boats from my experience normally are
not known to be the Swiss Army knife of
speakers offering an abundant of
features for example some features not
included are a charge out ports you also
can't pair two of these speakers and
have to play at the same time like some
of the other competitors out there and
NFC is also missing now if you're
looking for something very simple here a
simple speaker and you don't need all
those bells and whistles both still
makes a very well made product but let's
get into the audio test and see if this
speaker can seal the deal for you
you
and there you have it folks of course
already recorded on my end and then
played through your speakers are not the
best depiction of audio quality but it's
my review here now the only performance
is good for small to medium sized rooms
the loudness is enough for personal
enjoyments and maybe entertaining a few
others but don't expect it to be so loud
for throwing a party
the bass is subtle and goes for a more
natural response with a non bass boosted
signature now even with basic songs of
genres like pop and hip-hop it might not
be enough for some but for genres of
rock instrumental and mostly vocal work
here the Soundlink color too does well
for a small size now the mid-range
frequencies here and vocal clarity is
done very well here even at maximum
volume the audio is still clear and
clean offering an easy listening
experience not even the highs at maximum
bottom again remains intact and doesn't
distort now the one thing that I did
find a little missing here and it's
common on Bluetooth speakers in general
is the lack of a open soundstage now
granted it's more expensive but the
Soundlink mini 2
does a great job with audio separation
and giving the feeling that audio is
spread out for again that mid sized
speaker size now other competitors like
the JBL flip 3 maybe the JBL charge 3
creative role models and sony srs series
does sound more expansive now with that
particular bose model here it sounds
like a model speaker here on the
Soundlink color now overall from my
personal assessment i enjoy the speaker
though it's great for personal enjoyment
the audio is clean and not distorted the
styling is very simple but for those who
want something other more rugged comes
with more features or someone who
prefers a bit more bass there's several
other alternatives out there so hope
