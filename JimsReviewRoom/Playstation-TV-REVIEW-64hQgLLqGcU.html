review room so I just got my hands on
the Sony PlayStation TV now what this
device Sony aims to let gamers have
access to a good handful of PlayStation
1 classics PSP games and PlayStation
Vita games that are all downloadable
from the PlayStation Store closing that
gap you can say that prevents the
PlayStation 4 from being backwards
compatible
not to mention this also allows for
remote play in turn allowing you to play
PlayStation 4 in another room
although the PlayStation 4 may be
downstairs or in another area
so it's priced at $99 at the time this
video and we'll see if it's worth a
purchase so without further ado we get
stuck
so the unit itself is very tiny and like
similar Sony products it comes only in
black and very minimalistic to keep it
looking sleek now on the back features
the power button on the far left with a
memory card slot that's only limited to
Vita memory cards microSD cards
unfortunately do not work here a USB
port is to follow with an HDMI out a LAN
cable connection and last is the power
port for the supplied wall adapter now
once you turn this thing on and go
through the setup menu you land on the
home page now in general like most media
streaming devices like chromecast Roku
or Apple TV etc they normally don't have
the prettiest menus and a 1080 display
letters are slightly still blocky or
jagged in a sense but what's also
important to note the PlayStation TV
only outputs to a maximum of 1080i and
that 1080p which is currently the best
option in both PlayStation 3 and
PlayStation 4 if you have a supporting
television
however using either the DualShock 3 or
DualShock 4 controller really showed
navigating the menus to be very fluid
and fast though but as stated earlier
one of the features and the reason for
buying the PlayStation TV is being able
to play PlayStation Vita games that you
can buy at your local brick-and-mortar
stores or digitally through the
PlayStation Store and PlayStation
Portable and PlayStation 1 games are of
course only digital as well and
PlayStation TV also supports PlayStation
now allowing PlayStation 3 games to be
played via streaming over an internet
connection and Sony does confirm you can
do local couch co-op and online
multiplayer as well but the lineup is on
your screen looks pretty good and if
you're considering a purchasing and
seriously using these features check
with Sony first for their latest lineup
and I'll put the link in the video
description for you to conveniently
check now what's creating a bigger buzz
and what I believe is the allure of this
device is being able to play playstation
4 remotely in a different room now
granted it can only be played on the
same home network so you can't take the
PlayStation TV to your friend's house
and play off of your PlayStation 4 from
miles away no gaming system can do that
clean and clear you can say at this
moment but this really eliminates having
to disconnect and reconnect the entire
PlayStation 4 system if you want to play
in again other rooms in your house and
this can be done either wired with a LAN
cable of course or
actually uses through your Wi-Fi system
as well now to add on to that cross-play
will work for supporting titles allowing
one person to be on PlayStation 4 and
the other and playstation TV and you
both are able to play the same game via
online multiplayer
not to mention party chat as well we'll
work with each other but how does this
all work out and is there any lag and
that's the biggest concern the biggest
question here
well testing the system for remote play
it's good in a sense but not the best
the delay is about a half a second or
less which you really can't notice when
playing single-player games and
especially if you don't have two scenes
to compare like what I'm doing here now
my button mashing four attacks two
movements in games yielded fine again
the moves are executed within a
reasonable tolerance but what
unfortunately sticks out is the
framerate looks to be less than 30
frames per second the characters for
sure are not as smooth and I try this
over a wireless AC router and with a
hard-line physical connection which
should provide the best results still
both instances seemed identical in a
lower frame rate now both monitors on
your screen they are identical but the
left monitor is older and I've tried
these same exact settings on both but
the newer monitor on the right always
showed better colors and I wouldn't
suspect the PlayStation TV would
manipulate the colors they should pretty
much be the same though so it's a
monitors fault it's not the PlayStation
TV I'm suspect here but what is off
though a bit is the stream content from
the PlayStation TV plays less crisp and
less defined in detail it is noticeable
in looking side by side of the original
and extreme content you can see the
difference pretty well but if you're
intending on playing PlayStation 1 games
or other classic yet more pixelated
games I would suspect it shouldn't be a
noticeable issue but besides gaming
popular movie apps like Netflix Hulu
Downton YouTube are not available at
this time
now when addressed Sony did respond that
they are working on implementing those
very popular apps but there's no set
time frame it's a major letdown
considering that I would have loved
Netflix being available on another one
of my TV's here at the house now playing
Netflix on the PlayStation 3 or
PlayStation Vita and then trying to
stream it it still doesn't work at the
time this video but as long as it's I
guess Sony is working on this and it's
going to be down the road
I think at that time it would entice me
a little bit more so in the end I really
think if you're really wanting to play
your video games on your TV really want
to play some old-school classics like
Final Fantasy 7 Syphon Filter the Street
Fighter Alpha just the name of you then
it justifies the price of admission to
gain access to this video game library
now if you're more likely relying this
on for the the Remote Play feature just
be aware this isn't ideal for online
multiplayer now if you're pretty
competitive 1/2 a second delay in
battlefield or Call of Duty could
jeopardize your playing experience also
the frame rate does drop and it is
noticeable at least for me even when
connected with a cat 6 cable directly
through the router you could experience
something different but again that's
just my personal setup and last keep in
mind at the moment it's very video game
focused and the major apps and apps like
Netflix or Hulu are missing so down
below in the comment section tell me
what you think about this item even if
you're not intending on buying this for
yourself do you think this would do
pretty much well in the market today so
I'll just leave it as that if you do
like my work if you can please show your
support by liking and subscribing and
then following me on Facebook Twitter or
Google+ as it does help in bringing you
more content like this so this is Jimmy
with Jim's review room you guys take
care out there I'll see you in the next
one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
