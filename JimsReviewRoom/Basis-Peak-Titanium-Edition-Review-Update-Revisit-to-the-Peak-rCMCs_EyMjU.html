room had reviewed the vases peak when it
was first released nearly a year ago and
today I'm giving this one more try last
year when I had my hands on this vases
didn't have all the updates or features
that was promised on day one and with
today's revisions we should have a more
complete experience on what faces has to
offer keep in mind many new bans have
been released so let's see if they have
been staying relevant and to be
transparent and honest with you guys the
model I have here has been supplied by
bases and this is their newest model the
peak titanium it's priced at $300 retail
so without further ado my channel is
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to chips
review
going over the physical features the
titanium addition is essentially the
basis peak but it houses the brains of
the device in pure titanium and comes
with this beautiful lovely leather strap
of course the only caveat is the leather
isn't recommended to get wet so working
out what this is out of the question and
to address this issue despite the high
price tag of $300 basis that including
their package a sport vent strap that is
very easily swappable only needing your
fingers to really have done both bands
have been very easy to wear very
comfortable and as important breathable
overall the build quality as you can
imagine has been great and a screen
holds up very well with no scratches
during my testing the display is very
much visible and in darker situations
you can always swap the right side up
for an illuminated backlit display but
now going over what this can display
here and don't try to remember what I'm
going to show you but this should give
you an overall feel or an idea of how
this works the time is showing 24/7
swiping right offers your basic settings
to get that out of the way but swiping
down from that main screen you can set
up an alarm to wake you up and sweating
down one more time offers you a
stopwatch feature for timing your
activities from here swiping right from
any screen will show you your heart rate
and swiping down we'll review today's
total performance so far including total
steps taken and how many calories were
burned swiping right you have your most
recent activity and pulling down will
review your previous active moments
recorded now one unique feature that
more bands today are slowly
incorporating is Auto sensing what
activities you're doing for the basis
this would record moments of walking
running and cycling and it does a pretty
good job at recognizing when you do
start and stop you just literally just
wear it and go about your day it's the
same thing with sleep as well this does
sense when you're going to hit the hay
with no need to manually inform the band
but before going into the app other
features the basis pic includes are of
course the heart rate sensor on the back
with a skin temperature reader and
galvanic skin response sensors and new
to me as I was not able to test this in
my previous review there are now smart
notifications and did great as you'll
get a summary of messages including
Google Hangouts but it is roughly
limited to about 210 characters I can't
open or expand the message to see what
else is written now if multiple messages
come in I can see an indication
of how many there were but I can't tap
or look at each message individually
same concept with email you can see who
sent the email to you and the subject
line but I can't open the email itself
and see what is written on the plus side
you do have incoming phone callers so
you can see who's calling you before
you've been without your phone and the
basis peak has beta features that is
currently under testing that it shows
all smart notifications from most of
your apps installed currently on your
phone but in the end those looking for
more of a SmartWatch concepts this is
really it's just notifications it's not
actual messages that you can really read
in addition this would have been more of
a SmartWatch if media controls and
weather information were displayed
unfortunately they are not here and one
last physical test was the heart rate
tracking graciously the basis pick
significantly improves from a year ago
at least from my test and for the most
part does a fairly good job now faces
comes off as being one of the more
accurate ones out there I want to
compare this with my chest strap but
with all this data how is interpreted
into the app the overall experience
remains relatively the same the basis
app focus is a lot on habits and this is
one of the biggest highlights that they
have to offer as an example on the top
of the main page here I have where it's
which encourages me to wear the band for
a certain amount of hours each day so
more data is of course collected moveth
is next reminding me to just actively
move for 30 minutes or more each day and
after completing each one of these
habits again and would then unlock new
habits that maybe include longer
durations or other new habits in general
as you can see on your screen these are
my next ones coming up that can strive
to conquer essentially raising the bar
for a healthier lifestyle now out of
every app and physical band that I've
used this has to be the best coaching
tool for a consumer but going back to
the main dashboard I'll be honest there
really isn't much here there's of course
total steps and the calories burned so
far and the most recent activity down
below but that's basically about it but
jumping into sleep tracking this appears
to do great with an abundance of
information to differentiate lights and
deep sleep with REM sleep versus tossing
and turning the sleep score is always a
nice plus but the only issue that I
really have here is just reading the
basis charts they're highly segmented
and not one continuous flow now I'm not
sure if the ban isn't read
my arm or if the band thinks I'm awake
but there are gaps in between my data
and the rest assured I have worn the
basses snug not loose or too tight
either this is also evidence on my
regular charts on my activity charts
during the daytime as well I just can't
see my overall entire day and I would
have to tap left or right and basically
move on to the next screen overall the
app looks great it looks modern it looks
sleek but the experience isn't a homerun
compared to many other bands that I've
tested over the past two years the basis
app isn't streamlined and the data
collected provides a sense of really
more of today and now with no real
historical data to compare now we're in
the app is the weekly monthly and yearly
comparisons to ensure my performance is
getting better for activity and fitness
participants where are the long-term
trends to compare especially my resting
heart rate as with the activity side
where are my heart rate zones overall as
an update I still feel like the
essentials haven't been updated for a
better experience granted there's always
the basis website where you can log into
viewer data which does better than the
app but the website isn't as robust as
say the Fitbit or Garmin Connect
equivalent the app isn't as streamlined
as majority the other apps currently on
the market as I stated earlier and
despite looking more like a SmartWatch
than an activity ban or an activity
watch the SmartWatch like features are
limited for $250 in the competition you
can get bands and watches with GPS that
can detail pace speed and distance with
other select few bands that can go more
in depth and in detail regarding heart
rate tracking the few items that I did
love on the basis is the habits feature
as it is one of the best out there and I
did personally lovely leather wrist
strap for fashionable purposes but in
the end I think it's best to wait for
the next generation basis to be released
or hopefully a totally revamped app so
hope this review helped you in some way
