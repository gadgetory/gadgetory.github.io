review room welcome back to another
review now I finally ordered a pair of
m1 hundreds from v-moda as recommended
by one of my viewers personna now he
swore by these and after reading up on
the top of the line the best of the best
that be mowed had to offer the articles
and testimonies from audio professionals
and review sites were all astounding so
how to get a pair for myself just to see
how I personally like them now they're
priced at $310 on V motors website as of
this video but I personally bought them
for two hundred and ninety nine dollars
on Amazon so without further adieu we'll
get stuff
looking at the design I didn't realize
how simple they are but because it's
simple it actually works they weigh in
at 280 grams while the Beats studios
weighs in a little bit less at 260 grams
and the recent Sennheiser HD 8 DJ
headsets that I reviewed recently weighs
in at 284 grams making this within the
realm you can say of other over-the-ear
high-end headsets now the headband
themselves are made of steel flex with
v-moda claiming they're nearly
indestructible and when torture testing
you can see I can lay these almost
practically flat here the top portion of
the headband is an imitation suede
material with red stitching on the model
I have here which are the shadows now
the padding isn't as plush on the
headband as some of the other brands
that I've recently tested but because
it's a simple design on the headband
with minimal material and weight it
actually worked out fine but more my
comfort test a little bit later now the
entire frame is made of steel with the
earcup shields made of aircraft-grade
aluminum helping to keep this
lightweight while having very good
durability and when ordering on v-moda
you can order custom shields of various
colors and even custom laser engravings
which isn't limited to words but you can
actually laser engrave your particular
logo or an image that you submit into
their website but even more crazy and
unheard of you can say v-moda tested
these beyond military level laboratory
tests now to be fair with the brief
research I conducted this specific
military standard has a long list of
tests that can be performed at the
companies choosing though however V
Motors website didn't state which tests
were conducted and which passed now when
I emailed v-moda and asked them
specifically what was tested they
provided a link and suggested B motive
which speaking of their quote unquote
environmental tests the one test
included rain on this military list
which I see nowhere on their website and
V Motors website as indicating that
these headsets are water-resistant but
knowing the efforts behind making these
is already impressive enough to be
honest with you and no question the
quality of these stand up more than the
competition but getting back on topic
here the metal hinges just feels very
rugged and that clicking sound that you
hear there is satisfying to the ears
indicating a strong lock in place let
your pads features memory foam which are
indeed soft and supple and
enough though for comfortable wearing
they're not too plush as well now
changing them out is easy enough by
pulling the pad towards you and snapping
the new ones in the ear shields on the
other hand when you do purchase a new
shield they do provide an allen key that
is for you to remove all the screws it's
easy enough but not as easy as just
snapping them in and out though and the
last physical item is the Kevlar
reinforced cable which on V motors
website claims to have bent over 1
million times with no damage to the
audio quality and if the climate I guess
I'll give it a try as well now the wire
with the inline mic is four feet and
four inches long and the shearing cable
which basically is a splitter for a
friend to listen on the same line is
measured at 7 feet long the minor issue
possibly not an issue to be honest with
you though I saw with this cable there's
no locking mechanism when entering into
the headset like the other brands I've
reviewed in the past now if I
accidentally tugged on this the wire
will disconnect however it does take a
decent of force to do so though and
before going into its fitment the case
supplied is surprisingly but for a good
cause small the outside looks and feels
like Batman's rubber suit with that
matte black color but feeling that
rugged rubber at the same time the
inside is lined with a nice felt and
with my particular model not sure about
the others here it's lined with red felt
with elastic bands to hold all of your
wires in and surprisingly again the
folding and stowing of the m1 hundreds
is amazing everything is very compact
with a case that's actually very usable
now going into its fitment these have
been very interesting to wear the ear
cups do tilt very well but they don't
swivel at all yet when they're on my
head though they fit perfectly fine
again very interesting in that aspect
there's no issues with the jawline as
some headsets do clamp the head a little
too much causing a little bit too much
pressure I do have to admit there is a
little bit of wearing fatigue after two
and half hours of wearing this straight
right on top of the crown of your head
but it never got to the point where it
does hurt though wearing these for four
hours straight
I could still continue while other
headsets I would probably would have
taken them off by now and to be honest
they're not as plush as some other
brands at this price point but again its
simplicity still works and it's not a
negative at all there's still very
comfortable to wear though
now what you see on screen is the sound
leak test with audio playing on maximum
and after placing these over your ears
it just measures or shows if people
around you can hear what you're
listening to and indeed there is still
some sound leakage as you can hear an
overall regarding sound isolation v-moda
includes passive noise isolation through
its physical build there's no noise
canceling technology or frequencies
being played to drone out outside noises
the sound isolation was okay in my
opinion and this is considering I've
just used a pair of professional DJ
headsets in my last review which also
featured passive noise isolation as well
now it does block out some noises but it
does take slightly higher volume to
drown out any conversations around you
though now the moment that you've been
waiting for the actual sound test here
then I listen to some classics from Fat
Joe and 2 Chainz and starting with the
bass levels they're punchy and strong
but sub bass though is just a tad below
the more basic headsets on the market
which is perfectly fine for me though as
I do like a more balanced approach than
bass being too dominant I still have my
sennheiser HD 8 deejays and surprisingly
the bass on those were slightly deeper
than the em 100's so if you're a bass
head you might look elsewhere but
everyone else you'll find the bass
levels here very balanced allowing
mid-range levels to still be pronounced
now listening to vocals around the
mid-range levels the motive really
really excels here with just crisp
vocals voices from rap to pop music
stands out very very well now if you're
into some old-school R&amp;amp;B just go back
and listen to some of those songs again
and just listen to the warmth and even
sometime the breaths that the artist
takes listen to some neo or Alicia Keys
and you'll be immersed into the words of
a songs again again exceptional and very
well done now listening to my favorite
genre of music EDM house trance techno
etc give a try to these artists that I
listed above you might not be
disappointed they're really really good
especially if you're having one of those
bad days I'm telling you this music is
out of this world it's not your
traditional techno but regarding the mid
and high ranges notes here listening to
intro the sound of the claps are much
more forward and a sound overall did
sound very open and spacial now
deepen base again but actually clean in
base trying the Great Divide if you
listen at the two-minute in 30-second
mark the highs really kick in and the
highs are pretty sharp and high-pitched
not ringing though but these headsets
are really high focused and the m1
hundreds did get louder than most of the
headsets and earbuds that I've reviewed
so far I actually had to consider
turning down the value by one click and
some other random songs depending on the
production and genre some high notes
might be a little too high or you can
tell it stands more forward than the
mids it's not a bad thing but in my
opinion when you have higher highs it's
more focused towards certain type of
genres making only that certain genre
sound really good so again you can say
almost the headset is a little bit
limiting and the type of genre that you
can listen to so in general these
headsets have been great in their own
way for $300 they sound as good as the
$400 HD 8 DJ's I just tested but with a
different note though again more focus
on the mids and highs but still good and
the bass then to be fair to HD 8 DJ's
are more of a professional use and has
better sound isolation and less sound
leaking with some other professional
features in general but for $100 less I
really feel the m1 hundreds are priced
appropriately the sound is impeccable
for high-end consumer grade headsets and
the construction almost seems
indestructible indeed so with all the
awards and reviews out there I say it
holds true some were a little
exaggerated but these are for sure one
of my favorites overall now we'll see
how these hold up until I get a pair of
the beat studios and hopefully I can get
a chance to buy the high-end Samsung
level headsets that were just released
so like comment and share as every
little bit helps in bringing you more
content find me on Facebook Twitter and
Google+ all with the Jim's review room
address so I'll see you on the next one
you guys take care bye
