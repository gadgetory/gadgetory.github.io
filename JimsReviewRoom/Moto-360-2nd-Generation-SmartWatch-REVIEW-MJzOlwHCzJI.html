I'm pleased to show you guys the new
moto 360 second generation SmartWatch
and for your reference I ordered the 42
millimeter size which you'll see in this
video those with larger wrists or want
the bigger screen for an additional 50
dollars the 46 millimeter is available
then one the biggest perk to the Moto
360 if you're buying direct from
Motorola you have the option to
customize your watch pretty extensively
but the prices does add up pretty quick
I personally paid for the base model at
299 dollars which isn't too bad when you
compare it to other base model
smartwatches but before getting ahead of
ourselves let's take a look at my test
and my experiences and see how this
model fared so without further adieu my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room
going over the physical features first
the watch has been very comfortable
despite the stiffer leather strap but
I'll get into more of that a little bit
later although I may look large the
watch is surprisingly light the
stainless steel housing hasn't scratched
which is a great plus in the chrome
bezel which any watch would receive
scratches over time has shown to hold up
very well with only a very few very
minor amounts of scratches from the time
of me owning this and all the one photos
and the reason why did not get into
smart watches in 2014 was because they
did look gargantuan just huge in photos
but actually having one in person and
wearing the 42 millimeter sized watch
it's been fine
not to mention most new smart watches
going into 2016 does look more like
timepieces or actual watches rather than
a niche toy for tech enthusiasts now
going around the 360 you have the
multi-purpose button at the 2 o'clock
position which feels natural this
enables the screen to turn on or go into
ambient mode but holding this down will
offer your settings and all of your apps
for quick access
one tap on that same button again allows
you to move back into the menus or
brings you back to your main display and
the opposite end there's a little
microphone for voice recognition which
I'll get into detail shortly and
rotating to the back more smartwatches
are now including a heart rate sensor
which I'll test and demonstrate later in
the fitness portion of this video but
while on the back here the Moto 360
features these quick-release pins
allowing you to use other third-party
bands that are 20 millimeters wide or
for those buying the 46 millimeter 360s
you can fit a twenty two millimeter band
very convenient and easy to do if you'd
like to switch up on colors or more
importantly using a strap that's a bit
more water resistant if you're intending
on running in sweating with this watch
on and before I forget the watch does
offer ip67 water resistance and for
those who don't know that means this can
sit in one meter or three point three
feet of water up to at half an hour
I wouldn't swim with this but washing
hands and sharing with us odd is fine
but regarding that leather strap that
came with the 360 the leather band
doesn't appear to hold up as well
although most leather bands will show
signs of wear the 360 uses stiffer
leather than the competition from my
experience resulting in more wear to be
visible and they've an two
go faster now if you're watching other
YouTube reviews on this particular
SmartWatch pay close attention to those
leather bands in that video that leather
straps looks more beat-up in mind here
so far I personally noticed some of the
leather fraying on the edges on where
the buckle locks on my wrist here and
comparing to the Huawei SmartWatch that
I'm also testing which I've worn for the
same amount of time the Huawei so far
looks to hold up a bit better not a
deal-breaker but something I wanted to
point out since others are not
mentioning and less rotating to the
front the display on the 42 millimeter
size I have here is a 1.4 inch screen
featuring a resolution of 360 by 325
resulting in a 263 pixel density indeed
there's other competitors with higher
resolution the differences are there but
they are very minut for example putting
this against the Huawei SmartWatch that
I'm reviewing which features a 400 by
400 display with a 286 pixel density the
differences in sharpness isn't drastic
enough for the average consumer to take
notice now one thing that I wanted to
point out though Motorola went with
Gorilla Glass 3 which is holding up fine
with no scratches so far but it features
an LCD display not OLED like the LG
urbane samsung gear s2 or the again the
Huawei SmartWatch and indeed old ads are
known for providing deeper blacks and
more contrasting colors which is
accurate the 360 isn't as dark as
vibrance but the Moto 360 LCD display is
still a pleasure to look at
despite being LCD I notice the Motorola
provided a brighter screen better whites
and it wasn't as yellow as the Huawei's
that I'm trying to show here in the
video and bring this outdoors in bright
sunlight and I know my camera isn't
doing justice here but the screen is
still visible in person using this in
the office at the grocery store etc it's
perfectly viewable one last item that I
know folks have talked to death about is
what folks are calling the flat tire
Motorola's stated to reduce the size of
the surrounding bezel they had to place
the light sensor on the bottom of the
screen personally using other
smartwatches and then jumping into the
Moto 360 the black bar that cuts off
part of the display surprisingly didn't
impact my enjoy ability and it really
didn't bother me of course everyone's
experience may be different and I know a
good handful of viewers really dislike
this now moving on to the user
experience starting with the main screen
you've seen
the SmartWatch dolls already but holding
the screen down offers 19 dolls from the
factory in total with some that you can
customize right on the watch there's a
good variety from the sleek and modern
to more unique designs with both light
and dark backgrounds available new to
the Moto 360 and more smart watches are
now offering isn't always on display
when the SmartWatch is tilted away from
the face or the watch hasn't been in use
the 360 displays a black and white toned
down version of the clock to conserve
battery gently moving the wrist as if
you're intending on looking down at your
watch does automatically turn the
display on and from my testing this
works almost flawlessly and very rarely
I needed to flick my wrist twice to have
a display show but one of the biggest
reasons why anyone would consider
getting a SmartWatch is the convenience
of getting smart notifications text
messages and a slew of other Handy
features right on the wrist whenever a
notification comes in a small bar on the
bottom of the screen will stay there and
swiping up allows you to read the entire
message
this goes for Google Hangouts Gmail text
messages calendar reminders incoming
phone calls all this shows up here
without the need of taking out your
phone then you can choose to ignore a
phone call from your watch
you can delete emails they come in on
your wrist which is a time saver when
you return back to your computer or a
neat feature on smart watches you can
respond to text and those Google hangout
messages via your watch there's no
on-screen keyboard like these Samsung
gear s2 it that I reviewed a few months
back however there's pre-made responses
which are okay in my opinion but that
little microphone on the side that I
showed you earlier you can speak into
the watch and this will type out your
messages
I noticed responding to text messages
went mostly without a hitch and the
watch did fine with understanding me for
the most part oddly enough though the
only issue with voice recognition I
really had was saying okay Google to
initiate the voice recognition from the
home screen or the main display now I
would have to repeat ok Google several
times before I caught on but after that
asking for directions my watch we're
asking the watch to perform a command
worked for the most part going back to
the main screen here swiping right just
like holding down the side button your
most recent apps are up top and
scrolling down reveals all the apps that
you have installed and concerning this
is using Android wear there's I would
say a decent
good amount of apps available in the
Google Play Store the Google basics are
mainly there like Google fits hangouts
Gmail and Google Maps but if there isn't
a stock app from Android wear or
Motorola that suits your needs
there's always third-party apps like
RunKeeper Shazam calendars Strava the
weather of course and a very good amount
of watch dials all free if you're using
apps like I Heart Radio or Pandora you
also have music controls that shows up
in your watch to pause play and skip
your music there's also four gigs of
internal storage to sync some of your
music from your phone to your watch here
and if you have Bluetooth earphones you
can listen to your music right from the
Moto 360 going back to the apps screen
swiping right one more time allows you
to select your most recent contacts to
send a text or initiate a phone call
right from your phone so I've been right
one last time you can use okay Google
manually without speaking into the watch
but moving down you can check your steps
from google fit to your last seven days
of steps check your heart rate right at
that moment and last is to start an
activity and since we're here let's talk
about the fitness side of things with
this watch here with the google fit as
being one of the main options when you
do start an activity they can be
categorized by either walking running
cycling and there's three other
challenges one for push-ups another for
situps and the last are for squats but
initiating your run here the watch will
acquire your GPS signal and your phone
so it may track your distance and pace
much more accurately the watch itself
doesn't have GPS and the display only
three pieces of information can be
displayed at a time such as pace
distance duration steps and time of day
unfortunately testing this with Google
fit RunKeeper and Strava none offered
real time heart rate data or heart rate
zone training even running with
RunKeeper on the phone here the phone
doesn't register the Moto 360 as being a
heart rate tracking device that was very
much hoping since more smart watches are
now coming with heart rate sensors that
the fitness apps could utilize the
technology in this case here the heart
rate sensor appears to only be used when
you manually tell it to read your pulse
if you're watching and know of an app
that I might have missed please write in
the comments below but onto better news
I performed several tests here with my
pulse oximeter and a heart rate chest
strap just to compare the data here the
moto 360 was found to be very accurate
from my assessment so start coming from
the factory this would work finance and
all the activity tracker counting your
steps there's also a stopwatch if you
need that but features we see on
dedicated activity bands like flights of
stairs climbed again the heart rate
tracking in real time sleeping analysis
they're just not here at the end of the
day it's still predominantly a
SmartWatch and the fitness side of
things still has a ways to go if you're
more fitness focused and this is came to
mind since I just mentioned sleep
analysis here there is a silent
vibrating alarm on the 360 that you can
set up to vibrate your wrist when you
wake up in the morning if you decide to
wear this overnight but the vibrations
from my test are very light in my
opinion especially after testing so many
fitness bands with a vibrating alarm
feature that lasts regarding battery
life take this off the charger a little
after 7:30 in the morning wearing this
all day and receiving messages
notifications and keep in mind the
always-on display that I left running
I ended the day a little after 10:30 at
night basically 15 hours and three
minutes in total to be precise I still
had 37% battery remaining leaving the
watch bedside the following morning at
7:53 a.m. the battery levels had dropped
to 12% from my experience the Moto 360
does lasts about a day and a half about
36 hours in total and the worst
performance that I personally had is
just a little over 24 hours which i
think is still suitable for today's
smartwatches
recharging the device motorola does
offer a wireless charging cradle which I
really liked to slide it in doesn't
matter which side you put it in here and
a watch it goes into landscape mode
displaying the time on your nightstand
recharging for me had taken about 2
hours to complete from a 1% battery
remaining so offer our regarding the
Moto 360 second generation I only had a
few minor issues in regards to using the
interface only once I had bluetooth
connection being lost with my nexus 6p
phone and I had to restart the watch for
the connection to reestablish then using
the watch itself there's very minor
stutters here and there noticeable when
scrolling through the apps section but
not bad to the point where it was an
issue it's not perfect and a 2nd gen
still has its own little downsides but
once I compiled my entire experience
it's still a good SmartWatch and i did
enjoy using it on a daily basis for the
average consumer I think they'll
very much enjoy the watching find it
useful if you're looking for smart
notifications and messages to pop up on
your wrist the issues that I did mention
so far are minor
enough to be overshadowed by the rest of
the watch's performance regarding the
looks let me know what you think down
below in the comment section obviously
it is subjective but do you like this
rounded design or would you prefer say
the Samsung gear s2 with a more sporty
look or would you prefer huawei's
recessed and watchface so that's it
