out there most with a pretty large piece
of plastic resting over your collarbone
or at least on your lower neck with
Sennheiser's newest HD one freeze all
that bulk is removed and you're left
with only wires I'm personally excited
to give this one a try as these look to
be the lightest pair of wireless
earphones that I've tested on the
channel as always remaining transparent
with my fans
Sennheiser did send these over for
review for us to test our assessments
was not altered in any way please watch
the entire video for both pros and cons
now they retail for $200 but as always
I'll place my affiliate links in the
video description below click on those
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
so without further adieu I'm Jimmy with
jims review room and I'm here to help
you make that purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review
first up there's no denying these are
super lightweight I don't feel them
tugging at my ears and I don't feel any
nuance around my neck or shoulders now
I've been using these second smallest
ear tips and they do stay in the ear
while walking around moving about the
office and of course sitting stationary
at my desk now although the hd1 fries
are not classified as running earphones
as they don't have any kind of sweat or
water resistance but they surprisingly
make up for that by having minimal wire
chatter don't bounce around with more
vigorous movements and I don't hear the
wires whispering in the ear when there's
a light breeze for a non sport use the
HD one free feels great and from my
testing performance while moving for
your commute or daily activities I do
highly recommend them taking a look at
the earphone so the outer part is made
of plastic to save on weight but the
ends are metal making these feel a bit
premium one feature Sennheiser offers
our magnetic ends four times they're not
in use you can snap them together to
keep the earphones from falling off of
your neck now I do wish the magnets were
a bit stronger though as it like tug or
sway of the court here does it disengage
them going down the wires there lay flat
tangle free cords and doing my cheap but
effective
rubbing tests here after releasing the
earphones from a ball they do bounce
back to its natural form moving on the
inline controller offers three tactile
buttons but I'm up and down with the
ability to skip and go back in songs the
multifunction button powers up your
earphones with options to pause employee
with a single press to accessing Siri
and Google assistance with 3 presses
instead now with the inline controller
you can pull up better information but
the HD one frees only discloses an
estimated time or window basically of
how much playback you have for example
instead of saying 80% battery left the
earphones would say a person like
something a bit more precise now since
we're touching based on battery these
are charged with a micro USB port on the
side audio manufacturers are moving
towards USB type-c for some odd reason
here but better life is claimed to be
six hours with our test that 50% vibe
from full to dead I was able to get 5
hours and 35 minutes now recharging wise
this takes an hour and a half from 0 to
100 now one feature I did find oddly
missing there's no NFC or near field
communication for easy pairing not
necessarily a deal-breaker but I did
confirm Bluetooth 4.0 works flawlessly
now we don't have Bluetooth 5.0 offered
under HD one freeze for some reason here
but for my in testing the range is still
very reasonable for most average
consumers not average I'm confirming 80
linear feet of signal strength last bit
about that inline controller you can use
this for phone calls I did test this
with my reviewer Ian at the office and
with my voice it did come across clear
but with Ian outside I can hear a lot of
his environments around him I can hear
the leaves that he's stepping on also
the cars that were driving by now
quickly touching base on some random
tests here the HD one free do provide
very good passive noise isolation and
bumping this up to medium and high
volumes very minimal sound leakage was
noticed the included case from
Sennheiser is lovely a two-tone looked
great and a soft and cool to the touch
leather makes the carrying case feel
ultra premium and quickly looking inside
it's a faux suede or felt lining now all
right touching based on audio
performance from the factory the HD one
freeze he gave me more of a u-shaped
audio spectrum
punchy bass very fast here opposite of
deep
long resonating bass the absence of the
spectrum is surprisingly sharp at times
and the audio was a bit jumbled and
lacked detail again this was directly
from the factory but after using
Sennheiser's cap to nap these improved a
bit this app is available for both Apple
and Android featuring several sound
profiles and he built-in equalizer
now I turned down the highs a slight bit
here will help bring up most of my mids
in the end this helped create a bit more
of a balance the mid-range sounded a bit
more forward while the highs were
tolerable but the details were still
missing up top sound stage these were
good by offering distinct left and right
audio but the wideness or openness felt
good but not strong as I was hoping for
at the end of the day they're not bad
but they could have been cleaner more
balanced earphones from the factory here
and then from there you can EQ them and
see how they perform a slightly deeper
bass level would have helped as well
quite a bit here actually with the high
frequencies focused on more detail and
fidelity than simply just being loud so
