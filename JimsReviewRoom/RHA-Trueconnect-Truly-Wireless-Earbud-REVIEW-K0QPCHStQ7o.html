connects I personally owned the RH 80 20
wired earphones and I loved those things
and if I ever were to do a what
headphones or earphones I personally use
kind of video the T 20s would be on that
list we'll see if it's the same audio
signature that comes through with these
the true connects retails for $169 with
a generous three-year warranty at the
time of this review Raj did send this
out but my assessment was not altered in
any way as always I'll be going over
both pros and cons I'll also leave my
affiliate links down in that video
description below
click on my links for the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
these things might go on sale I'm Jimmy
with Jim's room and I'm here to help you
guys make that purchase decision welcome
everyone
alright don't over the physical features
first the ear phones themselves feels
great with a nice subtle coating over
its entire body given this somewhat of a
premium feel there is also a huge amount
of ear tips provided by RHA including
some comply foam noise isolating ear
tips and the noise isolation does work
but I did prefer the traditional
silicone ear tips as those felt less
likely to fall out of my ears when I'm
wearing these truly wireless earphones
now jumping into comfort these are in
ear earphones meaning you have to jam
these somewhat into your ears or ear
canal like pejorative other truly
wireless earphones on the market that's
your call if you're okay with in-ear
earphones or not but for me they are
comfortable
the bigger question though are they
stable so I have worked out with these
and also gone jogging with them as well
they do stay in the ear quite well
especially if you have a good seal on
them if you can't find the right match
as a word of caution they feel as though
they're going to fall out but let me
give you a quick demonstration as proof
how well this they is the contact areas
of support to keep them from wobbling
around is the back side it's somewhat
rests on your ear lobes right here and
the stem that goes slightly down below
your ear it's rare but it did happen
though I would find myself once in a
while having to press these back into my
ear during vigorous movements but never
once did they fall out of my ear now
taking a closer look you also have the
ability to activate Google assistant and
Siri also with Amazon's voice assistant
as well by holding on the bun for about
a second and a half for the instructions
now the one feature that I saw missing
and I know some would be upset about
this it doesn't have like ambient to
wear or basically the microphones don't
turn on to let in your external
environment you'll always have excellent
passive noise isolation these earphones
are great for that unlike many other
truly wireless earphones they have the
ability to again pump in your
environmental noises so I can hear
what's going around you you don't get
that with Raj now with my testing you
are able to take off either one of these
earbuds and be able to listen to
the other one here the audio simply
doesn't cut out now when you're making
phone calls as well the true connect do
play through both your phones as well
now speaking of phone calls here goes a
quick audio test alright folks here is
the Abeka phone test and the new rhh
root connects this is without any kind
of background noise I'm gonna play some
background music for you guys and see
how it performs I just switched it on if
price should hear a little bit of noise
in the background but let's see if these
microphones fight to basically separate
my voice from the background audio or
not let me know down at that comment
section below alright folks let's get
back to the review alright welcome back
now jumping into bluetooth performance
the true connects have Bluetooth 5.0
that's awesome Bluetooth range itself
reached about 95% of my apartment and
that's really good as a signal does go
through several walls here but compared
to my let's say the recent review the
power beats pro that was able to reach
every corner of my about 1100 square
foot apartment right here so with that
being said when it is working it's great
but there are times though when you do
have connection issues at times my phone
can't finally true connects to a pair
and this was evident on both my brand
new pixel and also tested on my iPhone
as well and I've very few occasions the
left ear phone is not connected and only
the right one would play after about a
week I've noticed that happening a
little bit less which is kind of out
here but the fact that it does happen
makes me throw some caution in the air
so just be careful about that the
earphones doesn't seem to be able to be
paired with two devices as well at the
same time which was a total letdown but
testing this with video YouTube and
Netflix did play excellent it was in
sync on both Android and Apple as well
that's when Bluetooth is actually
working now last but not least here
these are IP x5 rated mini that they can
take on sweat and/or Rayna these cannot
be submerged though the protection is
adequate and to be fair there are a good
amount of other competitors with
something something similar like a happy
x4 IPX maybe IP x 5 rated as well but
Jabra and jab
comes to mind if you want that full
submersion certification or peace of
mind basically either or I did spray the
crap out of these things and they're
still working today then the case
provided feels very premium some might
say that it's big but I'm perfectly fine
with this however when you first get
this you need to build up this muscle
memory sometimes when you open it you
forget which one is for the right year
but it's stuff you can't remember is it
this one or is it this one sometimes
when I jumble it up and open it and it's
is it on this side or this side I don't
know if they were to make this red dot
which indicates the right earphone I
wish they made that a little bit bigger
I understand they're going with this
minimalist look trying to look a little
bit more sophisticated you guys know how
I love you know sophisticated looking
stuff but the fact that when you first
get this it's not as intuitive same
thing with the earbud itself there's a
little tiny red dot but considering
that's kind of hidden I wish they made
this just a little bit bigger maybe
include the little letter R on there for
us to visibly see it on that again the
case very premium there's actually metal
along here and you guys know I love
aluminum it feels cold to the touch and
it feels very very good in the hands all
right
well let's jump into battery life these
are rated at up to five hours of use per
rhj you do get an additional 20 hours
with this case and this also includes
fast charging as well but testing this
at 50% volume I was able to indeed
achieve five hours in three minutes to
be precise which is pretty good alright
folks so again for the first time with
technically the second time on my
channel here I have binaural audio test
for you guys please put on your own
headphones or earphones for the best 3d
audio experience that's the only way
that you're gonna hear it please help
support my work by it liking and
throwing down some of those mo G's down
below there if you haven't already
follow my personal Instagram at Jimmy
little official as well I'll leave the
links in the video description
alright folks here we go
can out the way that I'm feeling when
I'm with you down
you know the brittle
and there you have folks as a disclaimer
audio recorded on my end and then play
through your speakers are not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence
might review here the RHA true connect
truly wireless earphones play sound at
about 65 or 75 percent vine for them to
be loud that's usually my average so
that's good the bass levels aren't
natural from my experience bass your
songs will have a bit more emphasis but
the RHA s will never have that level
where it's bass boosted or bass heavy
it's a pleasant tone if you're looking
for something more neutral you can say
now because bass is played safe this
leaves the mid-range untouched unaltered
for a very much clean mid-range vocals
performed quite neutral and natural as
well without being forward or recessed
it doesn't sound boxy at all and this is
just my personal assessments I wish
there was a bit more emphasis in the
mid-range though it sounds to be lacking
some detailed fidelity as well also
there's some serious lack of a
soundstage
it sounds more just like left and right
or just basically stereo channels the
high frequencies do have some roll-off
as well preventing the very top end the
higher pitched instruments female vocals
snares and cymbal crashes they just
don't have that sparkle up top either
but in turn these earphones never
screech it was never ear tinging you
have basically minimal to no listening
fatigue whatsoever now the audio
experience altogether wasn't bad it's
clean and for some people they may
prefer they might like that flatter
sound signature but I think most average
consumers would prefer a more alive
sound this is down to a matter of
preference but I think though besides
the audio signature the audio
characteristics the biggest hurdles
you as a consumer needs to weigh on is
the Bluetooth connection maybe it's
better by the time you're watching this
comment down below if you do own these
folks let me know in the comment section
down below what you guys think of these
if these are not hot on your list while
other brands do you think is better out
there alright folks I'll catch you guys
on the next one you guys take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
