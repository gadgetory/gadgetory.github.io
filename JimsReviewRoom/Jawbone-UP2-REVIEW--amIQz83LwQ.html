now as of this video I'm still winning
on the job on up three to hit local
stores but in the meantime I do have the
up to here now on this surface it
honestly doesn't look like much but I
can rest assure you going through the
band and the app especially you'll see
some really useful features but I can
also say this though the band is not
perfect so we'll take a look at the up
to here that I personally bought for $99
at the time of this video and we'll see
if this is a worthy successor to the up
24 I'm here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to jim's
review room the up to makes a departure
of what we've seen before instead of a
stiffer bracelet like band we've seen on
the up 24 the up to now favors a much
softer and more flexible feel it's made
predominantly of comfortable medical
grade TPU rubber with all the electronic
components located right on top now the
band is very narrow and thin making this
very comfortable to wear with long
sleeve shirts it doesn't snag along the
cuff line there but fashionably it's
minimalistic to wear with any other
piece of clothing of your choice not to
mention for females watching this as you
can see it's not huge on the wrist at
all now one the biggest changes is
jawbone now goes with a very unique
locking mechanism now it slides through
a loop on the bottom and here you have
an adjustable locking clip at the other
end of that strap slides into place and
it's actually held by tension it's not a
watch buckle like the Fitbit product's
polar and I recently reviewed Withings
bands no indeed it still works though
but as advised by jawbone and also
confirmed by my testing here you do have
to wear it pretty snug down the wrist
not necessarily tight though if you
don't wear it snug and accidentally
brush your hand against a shirt or any
other surface the band is very much
prone to coming off it has happened
several times to me but again wearing
this as advised by jawbone and wearing
it somewhat snugged does address the
issue for the most part and last year is
the touch sensitive computer up top you
tap twice to reveal what mode you're in
either awake or in sleep mode and this
also preps the band right before you
make any changes in this instance when
I'm ready to go to sleep at night here I
tap twice and once
orange person glows I hold the next tap
and it switches to track my nightly
snooze and this works the same way when
you want to wake up essentially now I
wish the job on can Auto sense sleep
instead of me manually every night and
every morning remembering to turn it on
and off now it sounds very simple but on
weekends when I'm out and about and
return home to take a nap here sometimes
it's not at the forefront to remember
and today more bands are offering Auto
sleep and does it accurately from my
experience not a deal-breaker but
something to keep in mind now a second
before reading the instructions here I
was tapping like crazy trying to get
this to switch modes but now knowing
even delicately tapping this it is very
responsive but wearing this in the
shower has shown the Banat tends to
switch modes from water hitting the
surface and just to be clear jaw bone
has stated this band is rain sweat and
shower proof
you just can't submerge this under water
but now rotating to the back here real
quick there is simply a charging port
for the supplied USB dongle a better
life is claimed to be seven days in
which I was hoping for 14 days as the
up24 claims as much but from my testing
and wearing this 24/7 I was able to
achieve a full seven days eight hours
and 52 minutes to be precise there now
which is a good number considering most
mainstream bands today on average lasts
about five to seven days anyways now
recharging from a dead battery takes
about an hour and 20 minutes but overall
before showing you the awesome app here
that's still a quality build and looking
carefully at the seams there seems to be
enough support for the band to last and
keep in mind this band is only $99
there's no built-in heart rate monitor
and if you don't need that the price
point on this at least seems very
promising but let's take a moment here
to switch over and look at one of my
favorite apps on the market from Joe
bone
now before getting started just letting
you guys know I'm putting up bits of
information to answer some very good
common questions I get from viewers that
way it doesn't show up for I don't have
to put it up in the video so just be on
the lookout now starting on the main
page two predominant tabs up top purple
indicating sleep and the orange for
steps it was showing what sleeps look
like opening the tab reveals a very
simple but a good bit of information to
read about your night's slumber now more
so than some other bands on the market
sliding your finger across here you can
see exactly moment that you're in deep
sleep and basically when you're awake
and granted I've slept a lot that night
I have been recently ill with a cold
here so although I slept a lot you can
see that my sound sleep or deep sleep in
this case was very minimal now overall
they logging appears to be very accurate
for my testing as well and the one thing
that I really like about Java although
it's very colorful and easy to look at
there's a lot of data that is recorded
and shown on the app as seen below now
scrolling down reveals your last seven
days of sleeping basically your habits
in general now one last small icon
either the up to band or the app itself
is using my smartphone something is able
to read when the Sun starts shining
through my windows it's then indicated
here on the graph and I go to start
waking up all right as the Sun peeks in
the horizon but backing out here and
looking at this steps now a bar graph is
shown above and below that is your
estimated distance percentage of
reaching your goal for that day and
total steps taken so far and your goal
is easily changeable by tapping right in
the middle and adjust the numbers you
feel fit for your lifestyle but going
down here active minutes spent running
or doing vigorous activities the longest
active session you've had that day with
the longest amount of time just being
idle so you can compare and contrast the
right column is total calories burned
with a breakdown of how many calories
were burned specifically during those
active moments versus just your body
naturally burning calories throughout
the day now scrolling down again just
your last seven days of performance now
backing out one more time here back to
the main page it's really a timeline of
all your activities from steps sleep
food intake etc with information on any
online or real
my friends you've added through the
jawbone app most people do stop here in
regards to functionality and features
but jawbone does go even further and
offers you more options than what's seen
on the surface and by showing you here
by tapping on this plus sign on the
bottom right it offers you to manually
enter in your information the one piece
of information that we haven't talked
about is food intake now granted you can
sync this with the very popular app
MyFitnessPal but job 1 offers a built in
food logger
now whatever you're eating you can
manually search and add it into the app
you can even scan the UPC code on the
back of the box or package and as a last
resort if you don't have either one of
those here you can find the food you can
take a picture of the item and manually
enter in the nutritional value yourself
and the food locker is very robust
offering items and full meals that you
find at popular restaurants and some
casual fast-food restaurants and whatnot
and the UPC scanning tool does work on
every item that I've randomly tested at
home from Uncle Ben's rice to a jar of
peanut butter let's say but with all
this food here and all this information
how does it help you now back on the
main page after inputting food a green
tab is now available providing a food
score but more importantly clicking on
the tab breaks down your intake and
important things that I personally look
out for like sugar protein and sodium
intake but now going back to the main
page err I'm going to show you what
workout activities the up two can
segment then the top right is the
stopwatch option now it's not literally
a stopwatch but the option starts your
activity let me explain no matter what
exercise you do the band will start
tracking your general movements when
you're done and you stop the stopwatch
here and the main page will indicate you
just had an active moment now in here
you then click on edit and distinguish
what kind of exercise it may be whether
it be weights or running to basketball
or tennis and I'm not sure why swimming
is on here since you can't swim with
this band or the up three anyways but to
finish up the workout segments you
basically just click the check mark up
top and you basically logged in your
first workout by going back to the band
icon there's other useful features on
here like a smart alarm which vibrates
your wrist at your scheduled time to
wake you up and not the person next to
you and you can have this go off any day
or any sequence of the week as well and
it's in
settar a smart alarm because it wakes
you up at the most optimal time up to 30
minutes before your scheduled alarm to
go off and I admit the vibration is good
for light sleepers
but for deep sleepers it's somewhat tame
and offers a very fine and gentle
vibration at best on the wrist I'll
continue with the features here idle
earth is a huge plus offering the band
to vibrate when you've been basically
sitting for too long you'll also receive
a notification on your phone as well and
basically an indication or an alert and
what that vibration on the wrist was for
now moving down the list here is
activity alert the band can vibrate to
remind you of every milestone such as
every 1,000 or 2,000 steps and so on and
last year is a reminder feature that you
basically put in a time and a note and
when the vibration goes off your phone
will also show you the note that you
basically put in earlier and last year
as a feature filled app tapping the menu
button on the Left
offers you to change your goals as shown
earlier but very important here is the
trends it's a key metric to visually
view your performance over time
now of course daily bar graphs are shown
as well as weekly and monthly to see
that basically if you're improving over
time or not but more importantly look at
the comparison by tapping this top right
bar icon now over time once you have
enough data here once you get a lot of
information you can compare say the
amount of sleep that you've been getting
versus the amount of steps you've taken
and just see if there is any correlation
maybe more sleep makes you more active
you know vice-versa etc but just looking
on the screen here you can see just how
much data there is you can compare that
would basically suit your interest and
needs but going back to the menu
selecting team is a great option to add
random people onto your app so that way
you can see what other active people are
doing too but to be honest from my
experience adding a bunch of random
people here only one person has added me
back so far in a very last feature which
most people have questions from time to
time does job on sync with other apps
and I have to tell you it sure does
popular apps like My Fitness Pal Strava
RunKeeper
are on here with several others that are
listed on your screen so I know this was
a long review but it really shows why
jawbone has for a long time I've been
one of my favorite apps to use but the
product really
review is technically the up to now this
is subjective having a band without a
clock or something to tell time might be
a deal-breaker for some or with really
no notifications might be perfectly fine
for you while some others may turn away
but with the pros and cons being said in
this review $100.00 tracker with one of
the best apps in regards to simplicity
and features on the market it's really
hard to beat so hope this review helped
you in some way be sure to add me gems
review room to Facebook Twitter
Instagram or Google+ and that way you
can see behind the scenes on what we
test here and be sure to stop by and say
hi I do try to read every comment that
comes in again this is Jimmy with Jim's
review room you guys take care and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
