room
I reviewed tons of Bluetooth speakers on
my channel and one downfall you can't
connect multiple speakers and have them
play from the same source
JBL ue and maybe a few select others you
can pair up to two speakers at the same
time but with sonís you can connect up
to 32 you can also group them and have
one song play on a set while downstairs
maybe heavy totally different playlists
going on sonís does have a home theater
system and other modules to enhance your
wireless connectivity but we're just
focusing on music listening for the time
being there's three different models
dedicated to providing audio through
your home for you to mix and match
prices are on your screen for your
convenience but as always I'll place my
links in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices for today so
without further adieu my channel is here
to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's review
you
go over the physical features first this
is considered the smaller one out the
bunch but it's still a decent size with
slightly being over six inches tall and
a width of a little over four and a half
inches wide they're surprisingly a still
good bit of weight here coming in at
four pounds and with this weight it
feels beefy it's not easy to rack or tip
over and the aluminum grill helps by
making this product feel really premium
and the very time there's simply your
pause and play volume up and down and
directly in the middle is an LED status
light rotating to back this is a
wireless system but in Ethernet cable is
provided if you want to physically
connect the SONA speaker directly to
your router now quarter-inch thread is
available if you want to wall mount this
and that's basically it with the
physical aspects it's very
straightforward
the speaker unfortunately does not put
out full 360-degree sound
despite the speaker being wrapped in
aluminum here now sound is directional
and is only pushed out in the very front
but more my sound test a little bit
later now there's no water resistance
however the play one has been designed
to withstand high humidity so taking hot
showers with the speaker in the bathroom
was no issue at all with my testing
physically the only flaw that I've
really seen here that it does get
slightly warm on the rear here of the
unit over time but nothing seems really
detrimental and this seems more
practical though there's only pause and
play but no skipping or going back on
songs on these speaker itself now that
would have been very helpful when you
don't have your phone nearby but overall
a very well built quality product but
have confidence for long lasting
durability now regarding connectivity as
stated earlier this is wireless and it
uses the Wi-Fi at home to have the audio
play you have to have a wireless
connection and use these Sony's app
found in the App Store or Google's Play
Store to work of course connection
quality will be largely dependent on
your connection or your router that is
but for my testing here I did have the
router on one side of the house and they
play one upstairs on the opposite side
most of my Bluetooth speakers works with
this test there and so this oness now
because it's on Wi-Fi more than likely
again depending on your router this can
go a bit further than what bluetooth can
offer but regarding that app before
jumping into audio performance it's
really straightforward once again
because this is on Wi-Fi you can utilize
the services that you see on your screen
you just need to sign into your
while in these sona's app to have both
apps sync with each other
now once synced the play one will obtain
music over Wi-Fi again instead of
getting music directly off of your phone
you can leave your house or turn off
your phone completely and music will
continue to stream from your router
direct to your speaker they can answer
phone calls on your phone with music
uninterrupted but sadly you can't have
your speaker's or multiple speakers in
each room function as a speakerphone now
that would be really cool but back to
the app here besides the online
streaming services you can play music
that's stored on your phone as an option
as well and as a side note here and why
some would like to consider sonís down
the road if you were to buy more
speakers you can mix and match to play
one with let's say they play five if
you'd like you're not stuck with having
to purchase the same play one model once
again so not looking to the audio
performance here here's a few quick
samples and then I'll give you my
verdict afterwards
and does search but you say
we are
your eyes dreams on my future that's
what I some Drowning of a vote and there
you have it folks now sound recorded on
my end and then play through your
speakers or not the best depiction of
audio quality but hence my review here
the play one surprisingly gets really
loud this can easily fill up a small to
medium-sized room even large open rooms
can very much still be enjoyed for
entertaining but I can rest assure you
if you get two of these that would be
insane now I haven't used the mid-sized
play three or the larger play five to be
fair but the smaller speaker already is
as loud as my large JBL extreme starting
with bass this does provide a very
decent amount that will sound much
deeper than most Bluetooth speakers on
the market currently it's very punchy
from my experience and for the average
consumer they will very much enjoy the
sound signature as a speaker still
provides clean and clear bass and vocals
but for those who are more analytical
though you'll hear some bass that does
spill over into the mid-range for some
genres have any vocals or the mid-range
frequencies not be as in the forefront
as some may like now regarding the
higher frequencies there is roll-off at
the very top end so claps or cymbal
crashes won't hit as sharp and that's
something that I'm sure that the average
consumer will hear as well there's no
special sound and there's no left and
right audio channels just like any other
Bluetooth speaker or other Bluetooth
speakers on the market that is but that
can be fixed again if you do purchase a
second play one and then pairing them
afterwards
and they do offer a nice discount if you
do bundle so again check out my links in
the description below
now despite not having audio perfection
you can say there is an equalizer in
this oness app and increasing treble
does help a pretty good bit here but
regardless the play one is still one of
the best single speaker performances
that a consumer can buy right now for
$199 this thing performs an added level
of large $300 Bluetooth speakers and
besides performance the second biggest
reason for a purchase is the expansion
of featured speakers to play along with
your current setup so that's it for the
