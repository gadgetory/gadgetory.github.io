room the MX lineup has always at least
for me than the premium fully featured
devices that comes from Logitech they
have their MX master - they have a new
MX keyboard being released but today I'm
testing their new MX Sam a 2.0 desktop
speaker set with a focus on design and
audio performance as always being
transparent Logitech did send me these
for review and I of course put it
through its paces and see if they're any
good they retail for 99 dollars at the
time this video as always I placed my
affiliate links in the video description
below click on those links and they'll
give you the most updated prices in real
time you never know when these things
might go on sale so without further
adieu I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room
and I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another video
going over the physical features
logitech said that they focused on their
looks so the MX sound was designed to
complement the other MX products in my
case I have the master 2's you can be to
judge for yourself let me know in the
comment section below what do you guys
think of their design now for those who
are wondering the two smaller round
circles are not only for aesthetics but
their bass ports aimed out at the rear
but more my sound test later the front
has a nice premium fabric a bit
different from the usual black fabric
grills the right speaker has a motion
sensor that detects you when your hand
is nearby when close enough the MX sound
illuminates allowing you to pair and
adjust volume up or down now we normally
don't see this on desktop speakers but I
think having buns the skip pause and
play would have been great maybe some
LEDs to indicate how loud or how low the
speaker is would have been helpful too
and having actual hand gestures like a
flick of the wrist the skip songs would
have been really cool now for what you
have and what is provided though the
features available works well and they
are super responsive now rotating to the
rear the right speaker has two three and
a half millimeter audio inputs while
there's an audio output for a headphone
listening the MX sound also incorporates
bluetooth 4.1 you can connect up to two
devices at the same time as well and I
eventually stumbled across this here the
switching off devices is nearly seamless
as long as both phones are paired at the
same time just pause the first phone
press play on the other and the audio
sources switches no need to go into your
Bluetooth settings
and last year testing the Bluetooth
range I did confirm up to 80 linear feet
was possible before the signals start to
crackle or fade out alright folks at the
moment you've been waiting for the audio
test for the first time ever on Jim's
Ruby room we're using by neural
microphones be sure to put on either
headphones or earphones to get the full
surround sound audio experience first up
is fortress violin iam
and there you have it folks
for $99 the MX sound has amazing detail
soundstage and audio quality all around
the reason why I included my audio
engine HD 3 desktop speakers in the
audio test is because the MX sound
provides a similar experience but much
cheaper the audio engines are $400
retail and have been my main computer
speakers for quite some time alleged I
provided very good bass levels for a 2.0
system you're not going to feel the bass
per se because there's a lack of a
subwoofer like any other 2.0 setup but
there's enough here to make personal
listening very much enjoyable pop and
idiom absolutely sounded fine hip-hop
and bass heavy songs do decent but needs
a bit more deep resonating bass to have
those genres stand out now similar to my
HD threes what really shines across all
genres is the mid-range it's bright
clean articulate detailed and offers
tons of audio separation the vocals and
instruments are for the spatial
separation from left to right are very
much distinguishable Audio can be heard
in the forefront of the singers while
there's instruments being played behind
them it also performs as good again as
my HD 3s that I love the high notes
don't get ting your recipe the highs do
miss out on that sparkle up top for rock
music a bit their snare drums and cymbal
crashes could have been a bit sharper to
make them shine at those high
frequencies but overall I'm very
impressed by the auto quality and just
the $100 price range now I do wish there
were other lifestyle or convenience
features like hand gestures to control
music specifically pause and play or NFC
would have been nice but overall if
you're in the $100 price range you're
fine with a 2.0 desktop setup there's no
sub woofer and you can forego those
extra features that you might find on
other more expensive speakers the MX
sound is seriously worth a look at so
that's it folks be sure to LIKE and

Jim's review room and I'm here to help
you make that purchase decision you guys
take care and I'll see you on the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
