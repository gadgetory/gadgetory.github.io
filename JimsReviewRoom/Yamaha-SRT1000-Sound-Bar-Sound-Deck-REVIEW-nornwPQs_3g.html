review room now with today's form of
home entertainment a lot of people are
straying away from tower speakers now it
could be that they are big and bulky or
the hassle of just running so many wires
that makes them a nuisance
now did you provide great audio though
but for some people they want something
simpler today I have one of Yamahas
sound decks it's the SRT 1000 priced at
499 dollars retail as of this video and
we'll see how it sounds so I'm here to
help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's review room
starting with its physical build this
fits up to most 55 inch TVs the width of
this spans 30 and 3/4 inches wide in 14
and 5/8 from the back to front and it's
able to withstand up to 88 pounds of
weight now the construction material is
dominantly MDF with a beautiful almost
brushed aluminum like veneer on top of
the front panel includes all of your
options the far left glows green
indicating what devices are in use but
I'll show you all the connections when I
rotate to the back very soon now moving
to the far right our manual buttons to
change your inputs adjust volume and
power up and down your unit now moving
to the top here Yamaha offers a very
convenient cover that eventually exposes
the ports from above they're slightly
angled upwards for easier connections
and better visibility which I rarely
ever see on other sound bars or decks or
basically in general any other devices
I found myself barely moving the TV or
the TV stand if I ever need to make
changes or add-on connections always
underrated and always an afterthought
but looking at the connections here
themselves this sound deck offers two
optical ins four losses audio using a
speed of cable one coaxial for digital
audio as well and then down to your very
traditional here left and right RCA
cables in total providing four physical
ways of connecting your devices and the
last connection is highly beneficial
offering a connection to an external
subwoofers LFE connection now if you
want louder bass or have a subwoofer
laying around you can use it here to
supplement your experience which I
highly
and but with all these physical
connections mentioned the last one here
is bluetooth being built-in now we're
starting to see more sound bars and
soundex offering bluetooth that way you
can play your music with your phone or
tablet and able to switch things up when
away from your sound bar in general now
like all my Bluetooth speakers I left
the Yamaha on the first floor and I
walked upstairs to the other side of the
house here going through several walls
in the first floor ceiling of course
with my samsung note 4 phone I had zero
drops in signal and the music played
perfectly fine more on my audio test a
little bit later but the one last
feature I wanted to discuss in Yamaha
offering digital sound projecting now
some bars in general struggled to offer
that surround sound experience this is
how Yamaha simulated surround sound all
from this one centralized location now
on the front are two woofers and either
side directed right at you while on the
bottom are two down firing subwoofers
for bass and last and this is the
projection technology are a total of 8
beam drivers aimed at directing sound to
bounce off the wall from different
angles in turn simulating that surround
sound experience and this segment really
leads me into these sound performance
and I'll be honest if you were to buy
this and very similar to other sound
bars when you first plug this in and
fire it up at about 50% volume it may
sound a bit underwhelming you expected
something better considering how much
you've recently paid for this thing
again like many sound bars after
performing my standard test here I
increased the volume to about 80 to 90%
and that's when the sound deck really
shines on the remote control I also
bumped this subwoofer or bass here to
near maximum and I was in shock
typically with sound bars or sound decks
you don't get that Rumble due to these
small speakers you can say any speaker
would achieve this with volumes and
you're max however Yamaha does it with
clean and deep enough bass and clarity
on all other audio frequencies as well
now watching movies offers up front and
clear center channels for voice
depictions while the bass adds to the
immersion of something simple as boxes
moving around to explosions occurring
now for those using this for music again
via bluetooth the sound deck is enough
to fill up a large room for entertaining
and for gamers out there this is a
serious boost to your standard built in
speakers on the TV but what I want to
discuss more in detail is this sound
projection now in my testing room
measuring sixteen by fourteen feet with
one half wall and save moderate open
space depending on where you live New
York versus let's say Texas or so but
this speaker is dependent on the walls
to have that surround sound work the
yamaha manual states to have this six
and a half feet from where sitting the
srt can also sit closer to a wall on the
right or left side of the room and it
doesn't need to be dead smack in the
center there are settings actually to
accommodate the different positions
however the unit would not work if the
TV is in the corner of the room per the
user manual so just a heads up on that
before buying now testing this with
movies avatar inception and the
incredibles it wasn't as immersive as I
would have hoped even manually adjusting
these surround right and left channels
to be more apparent didn't really do
much to encase myself you can say what
sound and to be fair I had taken
everything apart and brought this
upstairs to my studio which measures
about eleven by twelve feet with four
full walls that sound emotion did
improve though not drastically but
slightly noticeable nonetheless
my tail
again for a centralized sound source for
those who can't or don't want to go with
a traditional receiver or separate
speaker setups this is possibly the best
centralized sound setup I prefer to date
and granted the surround sound isn't as
great as I hope it still performs better
than other sound bars that I've
personally tested though and last to run
up the very last few features that you
may have questions about there is a
Yamaha home theater app that offers an
alternative to using the physical
controller but more importantly in this
app there is a custom room size setting
that adjusts on-the-fly now per the
manual you can program your TV's remote
for the basic like volume up and down
empowering often on the unit as well you
don't have to use the Yamaha controller
exclusively and last if you do utilize
an external subwoofer this subwoofer and
the SRT 1000 will go off as well so both
your personal subwoofer and the Yamaha
will both run simultaneously so that's
it for my review I hope they helped you
in some way if you like my work be sure
to add me gyms review room onto Facebook
Twitter or Instagram for behind the
scenes of work that I do and stop by to
say hi as well again I'm Jimmy with
James review room you guys take care and
I'll see you in the next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
