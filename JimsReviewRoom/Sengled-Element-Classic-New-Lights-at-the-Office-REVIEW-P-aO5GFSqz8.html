room hope you guys are doing good out
there welcome back to another video if
you have been watching my work I have
been big on voice-activated devices
recently reviewing the Google home many
they have their Google assistant and
Amazon has their latest echo products
with Alexa because I do work at a studio
environment I'm trying to find some new
smart bulbs to work with them and not
flicker at my camera so saying that
reached out and helped sponsor this
video saying they they have a solution
for me this is their starter kit for $49
coming in with two bulbs and their Wi-Fi
hub I'll place our links in the video
description below click on those links
and you'll get some more information
from them jumping right into this one
I've been using smart bulbs for the past
year and seriously they are very very
convenient when I walk into my filming
area I simply say turn on lights and I'm
done so certain black table light on and
then when I'm filming I need to turn
down the brightness so my video isn't
overblown I give the command take a look
at the sample exit some black table
lights to 10% what the Sangh LEDs
elements classic I have been using them
in the past
several videos so these aren't tested
and used by me each bulb is powered at
800 lumens but in person they're
seriously bright here they're rated at
25,000 hours of use and burns about 9
watts of power because their LED and
highly efficient they run super cool
even after several hours of filming I
can go in and grab these lights with my
bare hands for absolutely no reason I
was just testing out the bulbs now one
of the biggest issues with LED bulbs
especially the ones where you can't
adjust the color temperature they give
off this nasty yellowish / white tint
and although their color temperature
suggests otherwise
now with the element classic it is very
natural-looking
none of that artificial look and if you
have watched my last several videos I
have been using these bulbs in my shots
but besides what we've mentioned so far
these bulbs are pretty high-tech now
with installation it's very
straightforward connect the included
Wi-Fi hub to your router download the
app for either Apple or Android scan the
light bulbs and rename it to whatever
you want to call it now if you are using
Amazon echo you have to set up through
there as well now am it it was a bit
tricky finding the settings to have the
blink but a quick Google search did help
this wasn't the massive hurdle now once
added in your
instantly begin controlling your
lighting through the app each light can
be individually adjusted including the
brightness from zero to 100% and more
than one phone can control the lighting
at the same time with each hub you're
able to control up to 64 bulbs now to
keep everything organized you're able to
group lights by room and give them
specific names as to where they are in
your home or office for instance you can
have several bulbs in your living room
and group them by what part of the room
that they'll illuminate setting on
bookshelf accent lights or chair lamp
can provide someone with the exact level
of light that they need now here at the
office as I demonstrated I turn them on
in the morning when I'm walk-in and then
through voice I tell them the intensity
level rather than going through my phone
whooping it now going through settings
etc etc so last but not least here I
think one of the greatest things about
this kit there's comprehensive usage
statistics in the app it tracks each
bulbs power consumption in kilowatt
hours by day as well as money saved over
using traditional incandescent bulbs my
screen doesn't show much but I'm sure
over the long run or whenever I get a
bigger studio with Windows this time I
can save up some money over the years
now especially if you have a bunch of
these lights going on every day the app
also tracks how much co2 your element
bulbs have produced and since sang lab
plans one tree for every bulb sold there
the first carbon-neutral
LED light bulb out there pretty cool now
some things to keep in mind these
element bulbs are not waterproof or can
malfunction or break in high humidity so
I would avoid using these outdoors or in
bathrooms and also my final notes here
the pricing on these are better than the
competition out there we're not talking
about color changing bulbs but strictly
white light bulbs like the sunlit here
each one of these bulbs retails for nine
dollars is a low 20 on amazon and
philips hue white bulbs those are going
for $30 for a 2-pack essentially $15 for
each bulb so all right folks that's it

guys take care and I'll see you on the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
