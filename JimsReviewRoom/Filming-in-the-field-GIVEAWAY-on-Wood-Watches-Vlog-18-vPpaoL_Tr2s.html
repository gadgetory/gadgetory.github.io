all right folks 10 guys do one of my
secret spot on my favorite spot that
sometimes you guys need me filming in
but I'll just in the area that's needed
a quiet space to basically make some
phone calls but this is one of the
staircase in stairwells that I've film
rag up against this window right here
usually during rush hour there's a lot
more cars a lot more movement in the
background make some pretty good shots
but what do you want to show you guys
again this is my secret spot right here
no one knows about this that's just
basically a parking deck but no one
comes up here always tranquil and some
time to test the range of my bluetooth
speakers you know right here basically
walking all the way to the other side to
see how that sound but the city skyline
is over there right behind that elevator
but as gorgeous at night too but um
that's about it let me set this camera
up right here like I just gotta make a
couple business phone calls and
hopefully they go good all right catch
you guys later all right folks two out
of the three phone calls went good that
last one wasn't good and Jesus but hey
that's business for you not everyone's a
winner but hey two out of three does not
bad for today all right guys off to
filming take you guys into the city all
right folks so I've got about two hours
to get this done basically in the city
so the parking meter runs out
I'm trying to find the train station
right now that's what I'm going to
report and sell the headphones and
Tessa's noise-cancelling capabilities
also it's mostly going to be the intro
of this upcoming review so check that
out so people ask me from time to time
to ever get embarrassed when i'm out
filming so I ever get nervous tell you
what this is my job this puts a roof
over my head this is helping me pursue
my dreams of my passions so it doesn't
even matter second to be honest with you
I'm doing what in love and that's not
gonna stop me that's not even close to
stop and what I'm gonna do what I've
been doing what I'm going to continue to
do so to answer that question at all I
like that a lot of people ask you that
you know do I get him beer still I get
nervous know when you're out trying to
pursue your dreams nothing nothing to
stop you but anyway there goes the train
station right there that's what I'm
trying to get to hopefully i'm sure the
trains are running today we'll see you
there all right I'm get going
alright so another successful trip I
didn't get robbed mugged my camera
didn't get stolen that's always good so
let's see how much time I got left on
the meter here but uh we're still going
let's see let's see nice with that four
minutes to spare all right so got a good
bit done um so now gonna be heading off
but unload all this gear here ah Jesus
tripod got my camera I got the monitor
headphones the headphones are in there
as well off to the next spot alright
folks so it's actually day to right now
yesterday after the city I just went to
other parts of town and finish the
recording I went back home finish that
narrative finished editing the video to
allow the behind-the-scenes stuff at
that point was just really boring but
that's just a glimpse of basically what
i do in a daily basis hope you guys
enjoy that but real quick here let me
show you guys my computer give you guys
a little bit of an update the only thing
I've done with it so far to be honest
with you is just move the LED strips to
give it more of a glow rather than just
straight on glaring and it just wasn't
giving that diffused look but anyways
nice little glow here I mean getting
close for you guys hope you guys like
that and I moved one of the LED strips
up into the events up here so at night
it glows I know it's showing like maybe
a glaring strip right there and as I
move the camera here but night it
doesn't give a nice little yellow orange
glow um I am not too big on the LEDs in
general but with this case here with
this huge window if I didn't have the
LEDs at night it just looks like one big
black box I kind of defeats the purpose
of having this window here so anyways
there she goes still haven't decided a
name on her just yet I know you guys
have been putting tons of suggestions in
but does happen just haven't thought
about it but regarding the channel here
I know a lot of you guys also have been
asked me for the JBL charged three that
should be coming early June I just have
to wait until it's released here in
America to order so it does take some
time so I know you guys have been
requesting that a lot of you guys have
been requesting that but again at least
I just have to wait until it gets here
in America and speaking on JBL this got
the
stream right here I was using it last
night to just watch stuff on my on my
phone watching Netflix basically but
anyways that's it i'm going to conclude
this video right here visit the sponsor
of course again that does help my
channel to give you guys more content
but anyways I'm Jimmy with Jim's review
room you guys take care and I'll see you
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
