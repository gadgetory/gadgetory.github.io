review room activity bands are
everywhere especially after last year's
Christmas of 2014 now for some people a
chest heart rate monitor may be
uncomfortable and the company mio global
like many other companies as well fitbit
Marcus off and hopefully jawbone soon
recently offered heart rate tracking
right on the wrist instead now mio was
nice enough to reach out and lo mate one
of their newer bands the fuse here which
does heart rate tracking but for the
company it is the first daily activity
tracker being offered so I'll go over
its features and see how the fuse
performs without further ado welcome to
Jim's review room
go over the visible features first what
I have in the video is a size large the
band is made entirely of silicon with a
flexible and very breathable strap the
fuse does come with a locking mechanism
similar to leather straps found in some
watches with the end utilizing these
snap-on buttons now overall the band has
been very comfortable to wear during
runs and also during my weightlifting
sessions the only issue that I found so
far with the band is these snap on
buttons at times isn't as secure as I'd
hope as with a light bump or pull
especially in moderate contact
situations either in sports or even at
home playing with your kid it does
become undone now the entire band itself
has never fallen off my wrist though
because of the locking mechanism but
having to reset those buns again is
quite a nuisance now you can see in the
video here this may bother some it does
collect quite a bit of dust or lint when
worn with long-sleeve shirts however a
very quick rinse under the water will
always do the trick to get it back to
look new now one of the biggest benefits
this band has been rated at 380 M now
after consulting with me oh that they
confirm you can go swimming with this
now wearing this in the shower and
submerging this underwater has posed no
issues or problems whatsoever now moving
on to the display the fuse utilizes red
LED lights pretty simplistic and they
work very well though in both low-light
and as well when you're running outdoors
in bright light situations now first up
is the time being displayed with
calories burn next your steps taken is
shown with estimated distance to follow
now the last item here is a goal meter
as it fills up this illustrates how
close you are to meeting and beating
your daily steps configured in the app
but before going into the app here as
you see in the review tapping left or
right is very fluid eaving very gentle
tap allows you to scroll through your
information the last button or feature
here right on the band itself is a very
discreet button on top sometimes hard to
find though when you are ready for your
run or workout session you can gently
press and hold this area for me it was
not specifically in the three dimple
dots nor on the screen but it was above
it now this enabled the band to start
finding your heart rates immediately now
to the average consumers and the folks
more familiar with activity bands with
most if not all
rate trackers on the wrist the
manufacturer does advise to wear the
band above the wrist bone approximately
one to three inches up now it's an area
with better blood flow readings versus
having it down below and of course
through my entire test I did ensure that
I had worn this correctly now the band
finds my heart rate very quick usually
within 15 seconds and the lungs ever
have to in about less than a minute now
once the band has found your heart rate
and you're ready for that run press that
third button once again and everything
starts tracking for that session now
your heart rate will display the time of
day pace distance calories burned and
last is a timer of how long you have
been in that session for now last year
during your run as you go up or down
through your heart rate zones which I'll
show you more in detail the app the
bands LED lights does blink indicating
which zone basically you're in in
addition the band also vibrates once to
physically alert you when you are
changing heart rate zones and although
it's a very minor detail but if you're
trying to stay within a certain
heartbeat
have that physical vibration Clues me in
to look down at my wrists real quick and
see if I need to get my heart rate up or
not now once you're done just click and
hold that third button once again and it
will end your session now let's take a
look at the app and see what's offered
in there and towards the end of the
video I'll discuss and show you my heart
rate tracking results and accuracy
regarding the app this works on both
Apple and Android powered devices at the
time of this video it seems Apple has
slightly more to offer as the Android
version is missing some information that
Apple displays but we'll of course
receive updates down the road for the
Android platform now on the main page
here it's pretty straightforward the
upper part of the screen features your
current weeks total workouts performed
you can toggle between last week's and
this week on the main page and sadly
there isn't a history feature detailing
your month-over-month performance just
to see if you're improving over the year
or not now as you see here the app
indicates as well the most frequent
heart rate zone I was most in in my
average heart rate during this
particular week now more information is
displayed by swiping to the right
showing time distance and calories
burned
now one last wipe here shows numerically
how long I was in my most frequent heart
rate zone now moving to the lower half
of the app here the daily activities are
from the fuse and by clicking at any one
of these activities shown it will reveal
a big circle indicating how close you
were to achieving your set goal now
below are your information numerically
which is self-explanatory now going back
to the main page here and looking at an
actual workout session I've recorded the
same as up top but now at the bottom a
chart information is displayed speed and
also pace now with a very nice graph
shown on the bottom here and just the
heads-up as of this video Android users
do not have this graph shown on the
bottom but other than that that's
practically it and I'll meant when
comparing to mainstream bands like
Fitbit jawbone or even the garment app
is not detailed or robust as I'd like
it's really minimal that I would have
very much liked a history or timeline of
my overall performance on a daily basis
weekly or even monthly basis just to see
if I'm improving or not over time which
i think is very reasonable now when I
dress this with me oh they did advise
they will have an expanded activity
dashboard and we'll also have
integration with health kit for iOS
devices and Google fits for Android now
a specific date was not provided at a
time but once that feature is up we may
have a better opportunity to compare and
contrast now after testing this further
and learning more about the products
Bill mix up
or what it lacks in its own app by
offering a robust lineup of compatible
third-party apps now like the very
popular RunKeeper which I personally
news map my run runtastic and even for
cyclists like map my right and Strava
now you can see on their website for a
full list which is quite extensive and
you can see those who already use those
affirmation apps will find the fuse a
great supplement now for those who
haven't tried those apps they're very
good and considering they're free it's
beneficial to look into them but to be
fair for those who don't want another
app to use that wants a more holistic
approach which is very reasonable
indeed the meal app by itself is very
lacking when compared to other activity
trackers on the market now for the heart
rate data and its accuracy that I news
Polar's tried-and-true chest heart rate
monitor the h6 for comparative purposes
now if you look closely at my charts the
first run was a straight ten minute no
resting and when at scale the deviation
is just at three heartbeats on average
now for the most part both the mio fuse
and the chest heart rate monitor did
very well and stayed very close together
now on another run I attempted to
simulate sports situations like in
baseball when you run to the base and
then you basically start resting and
just standing there or when you're
playing tennis after you score you
basically return back to your side and
just rest for those few moments before
you serve again your heart rate
basically slows down a bit and then
you're back into the game now both
started again very well together
and when I rested it looked nearly
identical which is very impressive but
continuing on you can see now with the
chest strap from polar running a bit
higher at times a little over 10
heartbeats in separation the next run
was more in stride and more calming and
both the chest strap and a fuse acted
within reason and then last year the
last run I performed exerting as much
energy as I could and again you can see
that deviation once again so indeed for
my quick test it shows during vigorous
climbs of heart rates the fuse appears
to be behind a bit when I make my heart
rate climb a little too fast but overall
for gradual movements runners in this
case this thing appears to be highly
accurate more so than other bands that
I've tested so far on my channel and be
sure to subscribe
as well or find me on my social media as
I've been doing more of these charts for
future activity bands I'm doing down the
road so overall with the meal views on
the surface it appears to lack very much
the basics from what the mainstream
activity bands offers which is sleep
tracking vibrating alarms food logging
to name a few it also lacks heart rate
coaching and heart rate training yet
it's fair to say those wanting a
bare-bones tracker no fancy displays or
features this is it now granted meal for
the time being suggesting using
third-party apps and if you want to use
those aforementioned features that's the
way to go again that history maybe the
food logging with MyFitnessPal but where
the meal really shines though is what it
can do it's the accuracy and its heart
rate tracking the sessions recording
where some other bands don't even offer
and last the variety of exercises it can
track or they be cycling swimming or
your most popular of course running now
the all-day tracking of course provides
value but appears to be supplemental as
you can see in the app and if you
personally value all-day tracking with
features to improve your overall daily
life other bands again more mainstream
activity bands will offer so much more
for a similar price so to be fair the
fuse would be a great band for you it
just depends on what your goals are and
where you are already in your fitness
lifestyle if you already sleep well know
to drink lots of water and already watch
your diet that fuses no gimmicks
standpoint with a great heart rate
accuracy is a winner to be honest with
you so hope this video helped you in
some way if you like my work add me
gyms review room and to Facebook Twitter
Instagram or Google+ as I normally post
updates and items I'm currently testing
before I put them on the website again
this is Jimmy with Jim's review room you
guys take care and I'll see you on the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
