room Jarboe now has a full lineup of
sport earbuds that are water and dust
resistant I review their job or sport
pulse which measures your heart rate
while working out they drop our sport
pace which is the budget-friendly
version of their sport lineup and in
this video we're looking at the
mid-range sport coach model
it's priced at 149 dollars retail as of
this video this is the second half of a
two-part video upload part one goes over
in detail the sport pace model that
jarrah supplied me which could be a
better alternative as it is cheaper and
offers a different design that you might
prefer I'll put the link in the video
description below so you can watch that
if you're interested so without further
ado I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review don't over the physical
features first these are built well
despite being mostly hard plastic they
don't feel cheap or poorly made looking
at the right earphone and under the
silicone ear wings is a microUSB port
for charging the device Jabra claims up
to five and a half hours of use in from
my testing of leaving this on from a
full battery to dead at 50% vine with
two 15-minute runs in between just like
I did with the Jabra Sport pace I was
able to achieve 4 hours and 52 minutes
of use when comparing to other Wireless
sport Bluetooth earphones the up to five
and a half hours claims or my actual
results I got emit are a bit on the low
side staying on the right side moving
down there's your volume controls and
pairing button offering nice feedback
and clicking buttons testing this on
apple and android devices worked fine
with offering pause and play volume up
and down and confirming phone calls do
work as well moving on to the left ear
button like all these sport models
features the sports button used to
answer phone calls and when pressed
during your workouts gives you
information on your current performance
but more on that a little bit later
regarding overall durability and simply
using these from day to day they're not
the lay flat tangle free cords that you
see on the sport paced model but if they
do tangle just a little bit here it's
not a pain to quickly unravel them in
addition when comparing through these
sport pastes the wires on these are much
more flexible so I didn't notice the
wire on the back
my neck as much as I did with the spork
pace which is a little bit stiffer but
both models were still fine to wear now
last as I stated earlier these are water
and dust resistant dropper States this
is
ip55 certified with the first number
number five here out of six indicating
this is of course dust resistant and the
second number number five out of nine
indicating this can resist a sustained
low pressure water jet spray the Jabra
sport pace model is just a hair lower
rated at ip54 essentially with both
models you can sweat with this on or
basically be caught in the rain from a
run and have no problems after my
testing spraying water my earbuds
they're still working fine and right
before getting into comfort drama does
provide a nice compact carrying case
that'll help keep all your ear tips ear
wings and of course your ear buds
protected while traveling regarding
those ear tips there's four in total the
very soft and comfortable in my ear easy
to fit from my personal experience and
more importantly provides a secure hold
one thing to be aware about though these
are in ear ear buds the sport pace model
sets somewhat in the ear canal but these
four coach model that I'm reviewing here
are four short considered as in-ear I
like in ears because they do provide a
more immersive sound presence but for
some runners and especially cyclists
because the outside world is a bit
muffled down a bit it may be dangerous
when you're say running by yourself or
cycling on the side of the road to just
take that into consideration testing
this while running statum out your
perfectly fine something a little bit
more vigorous here like jumping jacks
push-ups and also running up this oddly
shaped tail the earbuds never fell out
on my ear nor that lose audio isolation
but before getting to the sound test
drawbar in their sport lineup of
earphone differentiates from other sport
earphones that just plays audio but
offering a very comprehensive app to
help supplement your workouts if you
have watched part one this will look
very similar but there are some minor
differences that makes this sport coach
definitely different on the main page
any of the metrics you see on screen you
can customize and haven't showed
different bits of information on the
first page first thing I did notice that
is different is cadence is an available
real-time metric that you can monitor
this was not available on the sport pace
but tapping on this you can select
either split speed pace average speed
duration distance calories burned
average pace speed pace splits and less
is better information which comes in
very helpful moving down you can segment
your workouts and label it as any of
that you see on screen here if you need
to feel free to rewind or pause the
video if I'm going a little too fast you
can choose free mode which you will
measure mostly your basic for you when
you do any kind of workout or you can
set your goals before you start any
activity there's two additional goals
that you don't get with the support pace
model and that's cross-training and
cadence opening up cross-training real
quick since this is one of the coaches
selling points there are three to five
or three to six minute workouts each
with a list of exercises to perform as
you can see on your screen now when you
start the circuit and there are some
exercises that are based on time and
others that are based really on reps
after you personally finish each rep set
you tap that checkmark to the right and
move on to the next exercise most
exercises are bodyweight exercises like
push-ups burpees lunges squats and the
very few involves using these suggested
kettlebell now for my assessment the
coaching is there with audio cues
indicating how much time is left and
what the next exercise is coming up but
I was under the impression the earphones
would also count these movements
unfortunately the coach doesn't count
these movements at all as stated earlier
you would have to manually tap that
checkmark to move on but getting back to
what other goals you can attempt to
achieve there's distance time calories
cadence target pace which is my personal
favourites and last is interval training
now backing out here last you can select
your music source either locally stored
on your phone or stream music from the
likes of Pandora Slacker Radio I Heart
Radio etc but let's start a running
segment here and just show you what
everything looks like when you initiate
a run your phone's GPS will kick in and
track your distance and help with
calculating your pace speed and other
various data
not to mention DARPA has their track fit
motion sensor technology built into this
that does offer a bit more detail over
the Jabra pace starting a run you have
cadence and duration that displays on
default but keep in mind we can tap this
to customize the display with everything
that I disclosed earlier if you want
more information on one screen the next
page is where it's at the very last page
will be a map of your run that tracks
where you are in real time and once you
stop the workout session a summary is
provided detailing some of your metrics
the map once again and last our linear
line graphs which works great here as
you can visually see and compare how
changing one area of performance like
for example cadence may have improved or
decreased your speed in turn affecting
your pace now for those who are ready
apps like endomondo RunKeeper Strava
MyFitnessPal &amp;amp; runtastic this app does
feed data to those apps for you but
before going to the audio next let me
show you real quick here what other
features are on here in the menu icon
you have history to see of your runs but
better achievements are viewable to see
and compare your best week best month
and you can even compare what your best
record was for the year there's also a
fitness test which you can perform and
for those who will be at the gym some
folks leave their phone down while we're
racking or leaving the phone out of
their pocket while doing squats and leg
presses the farthest distance I've
walked away from the phone in my field
test was between 30 to 35 linear feet
until the audio started cracking a bit
just a few feet shorter than these sport
pays now let's finally talk about the
Jarvis sound signature and my sound test
of course although this model does offer
Dolby audio I'm going to discuss what
this sounds like from the factory first
starting with bass these are slightly
lower in bass for some songs here than
the Jabra sport pace it hits but it's
not overdone and it's definitely not
underpowered either if you're not a bass
lover and desire something more balanced
this is the way to go for the rest the
sound signature is very similar to the
pace with an accompanying mid-range
that's not boxy it's not recessed yet
not bright either the high notes are
kept in check without being tinny or ear
ringing heavily use these earphones in
general for 2 hours straight with no
listening fatigue there's a little bit
more auto separation compared to the
pace and just an ever so slightly bigger
soundstage from the factory but it's not
dramatic or as open as say DJ Byrd blue
bud X 2 s or the power beats 2 as well
now going back to Dolby audio when you
do buy these for coach or these for
pulse models you do get a Dolby audio
code in the retail box to install and
use this app things to know about Dolby
audio this only works for locally stored
music jarba does confirm this does not
work for online music streaming services
but if you are listening locally the
Dolby does provide a noticeable
difference not drastic but the AutoCAD
touristic and sound stage is improved
there's also an equalizer built into the
app to supplement the Dolby audio
processing in which you can increase the
bass to your liking here or maybe make
the mid-range stand up a bit more
overall with Dolby the audio works well
and if you won't be using this feature
downloading your own third-party
equalizer helps a very good sounding
pair of sport earphones sound even
better in more immersive from my
experience so that's it for this review
remember to check out the links in the
video description below if you want to
check for updated prices or to watch
part one and compare this with a more
budget-friendly model than Jabra sport
pace remember to show you support by
liking and subscribing and if you can't
do that make sure you head beyond to
Facebook Twitter and or Instagram again
