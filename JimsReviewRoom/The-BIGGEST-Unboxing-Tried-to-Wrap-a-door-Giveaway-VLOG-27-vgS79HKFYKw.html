another video today is packing day today
I want to document the very last Probab
walkthrough of what the studio looks
like this is probably most likely 95%
sir that's the last time you're ever
going to see this studio on Jim's review
room ever again so let's want to
document it one more time here say
goodbye and off to bigger and better
things

help you with getting this new office up
and running everyone trying to give you
guys an update on the office here so
everything earlier from today has been
moved to the end of the office right
there you can see some of the speakers
that TVs on the ground over there as
well not much has been updated in the
room I'm still accumulating furniture
cabinetry which I have right here that's
what these two big boxes were the other
box there goes the other one and on this
side as well two more huge Kavitha unbox
for you guys on the channel and get you
guys some updates basically I got some
tables down here which I need to
assemble as well today and I have a one
chair assembled the thing is crazy
comfortable and I bought it for I think
just 120 dollars from BJ's Wholesale
here in America I got two other chairs
right there waiting to be opened as well
and I got that door to freakin wrap with
my automotive wrap my vinyl wrap and so
there's a lot of stuff going on today
but a lot of updates and
want to give you guys you know a
behind-the-scenes look and follow my
journey and basically having this review
room turn into something hopefully great
alright let's get started
you think you can compare
all right so I never worked with this
product before I knew screw up you're
probably not going to see this in the
video so just heads up on that or we'll
see what how this goes it's good here
all right I was standing far away as
heck from the damn door because I did
screw the crap out of it I did F it up
basically the top forcing came out very
smooth you guys have seen but the bottom
portion I was like playing around the
materials what they got down to that
doorknob it was really hard when go
stretch that material or early play with
it it's completely user error it's
definitely not the material in
experience but hope you guys do like it
here and it is my first time playing
around with material first time ever
wrapping anything and what I learn how I
learned how to do is I didn't learn it
from anywhere I just watched a couple of
Jenna mind's videos I was like man maybe
I could do that maybe I could do that
maybe go wrap my car one day especially
that's how I felt when I first did the
top portion and I'm just show you the
top a little quick here look how smooth
that looks not bad at all right okay I'm
going to give you a glimpse of the
bottom please please don't judge me
first time doing it but oh man I hope
you guys can see that but look pretty
bad so I'm going to wrap up this video I
know it's long enough already I have to
take this entire pile of boxes and
cardboard out of here and basically
finish up that last door up here which
is yellow skull yellow and maybe just
working till tonight and try to get that
home entertainment system hooked up
prizes postpone that till tomorrow so
for you guys who do follow me here
probably no reviews this week but I am
going to probably do another vlog update
for you guys and it's gonna be a lot of
things coming down sorry about that some
call me but more stuff coming down the
road more stuff of course in the office
here I'm still debating on which colors
to choose I not have mentioned that a
couple times
but I want to basically emphasize that I
know a lot of things are black and white
right now and I'm just trying to get the
big heavy things in first and then
decide what kind of colors I want to get
a gyms review room vibe back eventually
so hang on tight but please subscribe if
you haven't already and follow me on
social media follow my journey found
enduring of this office and see what the
eventually the evolving process would
look like alright I'm Jim doing Jim's
review you guys take care I'll see you
in the next one bye
and second thought I just finished that
second door right here and it looks heck
of a lot better so much smoother I found
a little trick I guess you can say again
this just me because I'm novice I'm
brand new to this working with it cool
before applying any cheat gives you such
a smoother finish and most likely I'm
going to read you that that second door
the first door that I did technically
I'm not going to redo it I am OCD about
that bottom half alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
