review room it's been almost a year
since I've reviewed the polar loop and
at that time polar was one of the few
known to the average consumer to offer
heart rate monitoring with 2015 upon us
companies and I think consumers are
really seeing the benefits of heart rate
tracking through the biggest brands
Fitbit and eventually jawbone offers
readings right on the wrist while Garmin
sells a separate chest strap a polar was
nice enough to offer me a unit to test
so today we'll see how the polar m400
performs and go over some of its
features I'm helping the average
consumer make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's
review /
starting with the physical features the
m400 comes in black or white the black
version does give a look of being more
Fitness focused while the white looks a
bit more fashion-forward but you can
decide on what looks good on you
regarding the aesthetics the been barely
attracts any dust which is always a plus
for me now the band itself is moderately
stiff compared to other bands in the
market but wearing this is comfortable
at first the band was a bit stiff to
slide through that locking buckle but
after a week or so either I became more
accustomed to this and/or the materials
used are more pliable in general it's
easier to put on and take off now
and the reason why I bring this up
though although it's water resistant up
to 30 meters allowing you to bathe and
swim with this some people do take it
off daily every morning or nights when
they do shower now working out with
weights bending and flexing my wrist
back and forth here or running showed no
signs of discomfort for me now looking
at the back of the band there's a
stainless steel plate with your charging
port located up top polar does include a
wire to charge the m400 but one great
thing that I've noticed that not many
other bands have at the moment is a
micro USB connection for charging and
syncing now most bands comes with its
own proprietary connection and if you
lose that supplied wire you're basically
done but speaking of batteries the m400
claims up to 30 days battery life if
you're just using the watch and daily
activity tracking features now this does
have GPS built-in which I'll discuss
further shortly but if you have or are
using the GPS and a compatible heart
rate sensor polar claims up to eight
continuous hours of use now from my
personal testing and using a seven day
time frame just to give you an idea I
ran four out of those seven days a mile
in each run and each run with rest at
the end here lasts about 15 or 10 or 15
minutes or so now on day seven my
battery level indicator had shown 50% of
the battery had been drained so from
this experience here the m400 should
last about 14 days for me specifically I
compared to many other mainstream bands
on the market even those without
built-in GPS the m400 is still very
impressive as the average for other
bands is still around five to seven days
now let's move on here looking at this
from the front the buns on each side are
nice metal stainless steel buttons what
soft and feedback when pressing in but
works every time nonetheless the tapleft
toggles the backlit screen offering
visibility in low-light situations but
in direct sunlight the screen polar
utilizes still works very well
now the bottom-left button is your back
button and once you hold it down
does initiate your watch to sync with
your device's via bluetooth and speaking
of compatibility this works on iOS 7 and
Android 4.3 and higher now I did confirm
this worked on my iPad air 2 with iOS 8
on the other hand though my Samsung Note
4 smart phone refused to show some data
for certain days which was a little bit
odd though now as of this video I'm
currently on Android 4.4 which I'm not
sure if it's Android or the phone itself
that's giving me this issue and
hopefully it's just a one-off matter but
back to the buttons here top rights and
lower rights are really your navigation
with the center button as your action or
Enter key and to quickly demonstrate
here's how to start a workout you press
enter and while I'm setting up or
selecting my workout you notice the band
will start looking for that GPS signal
and if you already have that chest heart
rate monitor strapped on to you the
beats per minute will start to show
shortly now running cycling other
outdoor and indoor activities are preset
in here with mountain biking last and
also like to running as it seems to be
the most popular exercise and once that
GPS signal reaches 100% you basically
start the recording now on screen here
you have real-time pace with your
average pace next with the bottom
showing your distance traveled now
moving on to the next screen the time
you've started and how long you are on
your current lap now if you want to
count your lap times or do splits press
the Enter button once and lap number 2
basically starts now pressing down the
navigation button one more time here and
you'll see elevation changes which is
great and then the following screen here
details how long you were in each heart
rate zone now you can see if during your
particular run if you've been really
hitting it hitting that fat-burning zone
you can say or as high as hitting your
cardiovascular goals you can definitely
see on the screen and basically compare
and contrast now pressing one more time
shows real-time HR information then one
less press here will show your distance
pace lap time and again real-time HR now
if you need to pause a workout press
back quickly and to
zooom press enter.now the last one here
and not least of course to finish your
workout hold the back button for three
seconds and the one of the reasons why
there is some overlapping data on some
of these screens it's because the screen
stays on the entire time while you're
working out you just need to find which
information is the most vital to be
displayed now going through the menu and
showcasing its features and your main
screen by default you have the time
that's again shown 24/7 with a progress
bar shown below now pressing down once
on the navigation shows a slightly more
detail about your daily activity next up
here is your diary once clicked reveals
linear dates in small squares indicating
a workout registered in this case here
the top shows how much activity I cheat
for that day with a recorded run below
now clicking on them brings you even
more information on the particular run
time and distance due how long you were
in each heart rate zone calories burned
a percentage of which calories were
actually fat burning and your average
and Mac space on the filing screen is an
indication of your speed zones which
monitors your speed or pace during a
recorded workout with the GPS
functionality if you're specifically
targeting a pace to either keep your
heart rate up at a certain level or if
you're training let's say for a 5k the
watch will tell you where you need to be
again in regards to speed the office can
be manually changed to suit your needs
through the watch settings now the last
one here in the list are your lap times
that you can compare if you do toggle a
lap during your workout and that's
basically it for the diary section as
you can tell this band shows much more
data right on the wrist than most other
bands offers but backing out here before
discussing the polar flow app you have
settings where you can customize your
sport profiles the two most important
settings are to your HR zones for each
activity you perform as it doesn't have
to be the same across the board and
changes to your speed zone settings
which again is great if you're training
to run a race now the other settings you
can adjust is the watch face itself and
this is the one that I want to discuss
you have the option of changing the main
screen with any one of the three that I
have shown here the fourth is the
default one that you've already seen so
far but through the watch settings you
can set up an alarm to go off once or
basically Monday through Friday or go
off
every day though there was not an option
just to have certain days to go off and
although it's great to have an alarm or
the alarm feature it's actually a small
audio beep that goes off it's not a
vibrating alarm that we've seen on so
many other bands in the past so just a
heads-up on that I know some do value a
vibrating alarm very much the audio
outlets sometimes doesn't wake me up but
getting out of these settings menu the
next item here is a fitness test which i
think is great to include this will
measure your cardiovascular fitness at
rest Poehler measures everything you've
entered into the system age height
weight plus your heart rate variability
and with this test it measures how well
your body works at transporting oxygen
through the body now in turn it gives
you that vo2 max level with indications
if it's low moderate very good or even
at an elite level but besides all that
jargon here it's a great way to see on a
monthly basis how your internal health
is doing of course you can do a Google
search on what vo2 levels are for more
information nonetheless time I want to
discuss our timers now this is really
unique as this does really help anyone
training for a race or just trying to
beat their own pace with this watch
being like a coach selecting an interval
timer you can set up two countdowns
either both being the time or one time
and the other distance basically once
you've completed a duration of your
first timer you'll hear an audio beep
from your watch and the second timer
starts to countdown which you can use as
your recovery time to start walking or
you can basically do the opposite and in
the beginning of the run or basically a
jog or an exercise you can basically use
it as a warm-up period and after that
beep goes off then you can initiate and
start your actual workout so I know
that's a lot of information right there
but you can see the m400 is really
Fitness focused with very good tools to
help train you not only in distance and
pace but a great emphasis on heart rate
zone training as well which I do
recommend everyone to do a google search
if you're unfamiliar with HR training in
general now let's get into the app and
let's see if it's any good
from the get-go you have this huge
activity wheel which records and
illustrates a 24-hour day from midnight
to midnight below the wheel are
indications and how much you've laid
down or slept sat stood locked or ran
for and if you look at the corresponding
colors below you can see that throughout
your day and the wheel but with that
being said one of the perks of polar in
general this and summer of their other
bands offers automatic logging this will
automatically sense those aforementioned
actions most bands even if they do offer
it just automatically knows when you're
awake when you're asleep and maybe just
moments when you work one quote active
now this will no different intensity
levels on a finer scale as shown on the
screen now from my testing for the most
part it's very accurate it's rare though
but on one or two days it shows a few
minutes of me resting or sleeping and
again it's a very small portion of my
day out of an entire day where I'm
probably sitting at my desk editing
video recording my voice typing away
doing you know what I do on YouTube and
on the website and again it's a very
small portion of my day and I'm pretty
sure it might be a small hiccup it
doesn't impact my overall health logging
but I do admit and we have to
acknowledge it's not a hundred percent
there now as for everything else even
when I didn't manually record a run and
just let the band sense my workout it
does pick up my runs pretty well with
about a minute or two and deviation most
likely four times I'm done running or
standing still getting a drink now the
orange triangles are times when I'm not
active or basically inactive for too
long and the band popped up a reminder
on my wrist for me to get up and move
and anytime you see this heart symbol on
the wheel here that's a workout that I
manually recorded using the watch
recording feature tapping on that breaks
down even more information about that
specific activity with a lot more HR
information being provided
now as for HR tracking the chest HR
strap are usually very accurate even
nonpolar branded ones but testing the h7
here comparing this with my mio alpha 2
optical sensor which I proved in that
review to be my best and most accurate
wrist HR tracker the h7 did very well
you can see on the chart here the
deviation is very minimal on average
being about one or two heartbeats in
difference
maybe just one little hiccup towards the
end here but overall very very
consistent in a very smooth band even
can compared to the best wrist tracker
that I have now going back and moving
down below your daily progress bar is
shown again with information you can tap
to reveal what you need to do to reach
your goal for that day very good
information providing considering it
gives you physical workouts that you can
perform or even as something simple as
an hour of cleaning then below that is
self-explanatory with calories steps
active minutes and a total sleep
obtained click on information with read
labels allows you to toggle different
information such as distance shown here
or basically the rest feature despite
lacking a graph you can see your sleep
quality now moving down once more are in
activity indicators that we've seen on
the activity wheel earlier up top in the
last here is your weight that you can
manually enter on a daily basis the last
bit of information is your calendar up
top which gives you weekly and monthly
charts that way you can compare and
contrast if you're improving or not over
time and that's basically everything I
think for the m400 that I think are
essential I know this is a very long
review but honestly the m400 does a lot
of very useful features that I wanted to
show that's there are some slight misses
though or here and there that I do admit
like the lack of the vibrating alarm is
sleep being shown during the day again
it's very minimal but it is there
nonetheless and for some reason some
syncing issues with my personal
smartphone but I'll be honest there's
more many more positives that I see of
this thing that the negatives are
basically overshadowed so I hope this
review helped you in some way again be
sure to add make gyms reviewer on to
Facebook Twitter or Instagram to see
behind the scenes content or even
information that I can get before it
reaches mainstream media again this is
Jimmy with Jim's review room you guys
take care and I see you the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
