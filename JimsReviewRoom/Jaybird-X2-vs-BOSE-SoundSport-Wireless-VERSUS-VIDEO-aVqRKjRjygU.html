room several guys in the very few
females I have on my channel here
requested that I compare these two sport
earphones they both sound sport Wireless
that I just reviewed at 150 dollars and
the j-bird x2s which retails for 150 as
well however I have seen the much
cheaper recently on Amazon as always
I'll place my links in the video
description below click on those links
there and it will give you the most
updated prices for today if you do
decide to purchase that will of course
support the channel so without further
ado guys welcome to my vs. video
looks are subjective so I'll let you
guys be the judge on this but I do admit
though the boast does stick out the ears
a bit here as they are slightly bigger
in size now both sport earphones are
water and sweat resistant and with my
testing on both they work perfectly fine
after wearing them in the rain and
spraying water on them back at the
studio now j-bird offers a huge
assortment of accessories both the
traditional silicone type and the memory
foam ear tips the x2s comes with
individual wingtips as well that goes
into the bowl of the ear while looking
at bows here they went with a simple
one-piece design in small medium and
large
now with these sound sports you do wear
it dangling on the back of your neck
with a small clip on the bottom to
prevent the wire from bouncing and with
jaybird the same position is possible
but you can also wear this over the ears
with the supplied cable tension clips
now regarding comfort and which
earphones provides the best in ear
stability the Jaybirds and Bose honestly
gave the same performance not perfect
but the sound sports ear tips would sit
in ear very well but the ear wings would
pop out over time with the Jaybirds
wearing them over ear provided similar
performance the best performance
compared to the over the next situation
there but the over ear method was the
best and the ear tip did stay in ear
very well but over time during vigorous
movements and workouts I can feel the
ear tips start to loosen a bit and you'd
have to kind of push it back in again
everyone's ears are subjective but both
of your phones are still very much worth
a try now as for everyday use Jaybirds
supplied case was not easy as the
traditional zipper case that Bose
provides but Bose on the other hand and
it's inline bottom controller didn't
feel as easy to use as the Jaipur x2s
the buttons on these sounds fourth were
extra firm and would Wiggles from side
to side at times as I stayed in the
review it's not a deal-breaker but for
comparison purposes that Jaybirds inline
controller was much easier to use both
provided a tangle free experience and
both felt to be built with quality in
mind
now as for features the sound sports do
have the upper hand here as it does
offer NFC for easy pairing just tap your
NFC enabled phone with the inline
controller and it pairs right away also
both does include an app to help manage
paired devices and check battery levels
but being upfront here the app is really
sparse with no equalizer or any kind of
sound profiles that you can adjust to
change the sound characteristics
now answer to Jaybirds the x2s doesn't
come with any app at all for four
customization and this is something
that's totally separate here but once
the X 3s are released pretty soon here
they'll utilize the same app we've seen
Annie j-bird freedom review that'd be
very interesting
now as for a better life the X 2's are
claiming up to eight hours of use and
with my testing I personally achieved 7
hours and 15 minutes as really sounds
sports they're claiming up to 6 hours
but real-world use I got 7 hours and 4
minutes out of them and both earphones
were tested around 50% volume so with
everything sent so far being as fair as
possible here
there's indeed pros and cons of each but
what about the sound characteristics
these two are very different Jay
provides that bass boosting signature
very immersive for those who are into
EDM hip-hop and select pop music that's
heavily beat focused the bass on the X
2's does slightly creep into the
mid-range and comparing to the vocals on
these sound sports bose sounds slightly
clearer and more natural as for based on
the both earphones it's a nice clean
fast and punchy sound signature and it
works great for all genres but it won't
be satisfying for those who are bass
heads the Bose shines in rock classical
genres and still performs very well in
pop music where instruments and vocals
are more dominant the Bose does provide
a more accurate sound signature and
that's very common among BOCES audio
products that I've tested and on the
other hand Jaber to me has provided a
characteristic that's more immersive for
today's modern synthesized and digital
music the biggest difference that I've
noticed between the two though j-bert
does provide a very open soundstage
compared to the sound sports in my
opinion offering very distinct left and
right audio channels but also sound
that's coming from above and below you
and in front to behind you the
soundstage is quite impeccable
since many support earphones don't have
a easy time giving you that kind of an
experience that lasts the Jaybirds do
sound louder but if you do listen to the
X 2's at higher volume listening fatigue
kicks in much earlier then they both
sound sports so in the end here it's
really a matter of preference regarding
sound signature but if I really had to
compare it's more on the physical side
of things and how they fit and feel to
you so I hope this comparison or vs.
