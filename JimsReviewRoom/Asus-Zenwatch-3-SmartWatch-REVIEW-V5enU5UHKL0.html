hey everyone Jimmy would James review
room it's been a while since I reviewed
a SmartWatch and huawei motorola and a
few others didn't bring anything to the
markets for 2016 for 2017 many of these
companies are headed again and for me
I'm hoping they bring some excitement
back to the SmartWatch category today
we're looking at the ACN watch 3 I
personally pay for this at the retail
price of two hundred and twenty nine
dollars it's a bit cheaper than these
flagship today like the Apple watch
series too and Samsung gear s three and
compared to Amazon prices in gen was
cheaper to me Huawei and B Motorola 360
second generation as of this video as
always I'll place my links in the
description below click on my links and
they'll give you the most updated prices
in real time so without further ado my
channels here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review
going on with business teachers starting
with its constructed and build it does
looks like exquisite the version
half-year is gunmetal yet two other
versions rose gold and silver are
available in my experience it's been a
very comfortable watch and surprisingly
the buns on the side you do not dig into
your skin and haven't had it get caught
on anything any kind of fabric or
clothing as well does then watch thanks
we have no scratches whatsoever during
my time of testing more importantly no
scratches coming metal buckle after
numerous days of having my arms rest and
slide on the table at the office here
being out at lunch simply normal
everyday use keep in mind most watches
usually same stainless steel the ACS is
using here that's 316l and if you've
owned a watch before you know it's
stainless feel usually will have some
kind of wear over time the factory
leather strap provided as genuine
leather but doesn't feel quite as
premium supple or provided any kind of
texture when you rub it in between your
fingers it is better quality though than
the Moto 360 2nd gen but doesn't feel as
good as the options provided by Samsung
Apple and again Huawei now after the
video finishes here in the comment
section below let me know what you guys
think of the look and if this is
something you might get for yourself I'm
really curious to know but when you're
not comparing your leather strap to the
competition it still functions perfectly
fine looks good on the wrist and has the
much-praised coolest removal option for
swapping up bands in the future now the
watch itself is ip67 certified meaning
it can be submerged for up to one liter
of water here for up to 30 minutes at a
time of course I don't recommend you
wearing this to swim but during my test
of dropping this in water a SmartWatch
has no issues whatsoever compared to the
competition this is comparable with the
other smartwatches on the market now
moving to the button some might like
this look some may not here the crown
doesn't rotate or pull out for any
various functions but in general on the
buns are very tacked up and doesn't feel
loose or cheap despite the buns
sticking out quite a bit what I'm trying
to say you don't feel it that little
wiggle when you press the buttons down
that's one of my concerns there from the
factory the top button opens up in Zen
fit which is the ACS fitness app which
I'll show later the bottom activates eco
mode perfect for extending battery life
and it turns off all your notifications
and
intent on using this literally as just a
plain old watch the middle button works
as the back button holding it down
brings up all your apps please scroll
through now take a look at the rear
there's surprisingly no optical heart
rate sensor considering a heart rate
tracking has been a pretty big selling
point of most wearables these days
however you'll see the contact points
for the supplied wall charger now I
didn't see the claimed better life on
ACS as a website nerds that I find it
and then user manual but I'm GSM arenas
website they suggest it's up these two
days worth of use for the time I've had
these n watch you're taking your watch
off the charger here at seven o'clock in
the morning to get my day started here
by 10:30 at night about 50 and a half 16
hours of use later I still have about
thirty five percent better like on
average remaining by the next morning
it's definitely immediately recharged in
conclusion at least from my experience
I'm getting a day's worth of life with
that being said but then watch three
does have quick charging 15 minutes I'm
a charger I have confirmed gives you
about sixty percent battery life back
immediately so that does help
tremendously so right before I get into
my experience with the operating
software and features the only two areas
maybe three here that I've noticed AC
doesn't have is again the heart rate
tracking which I mentioned earlier but
as important though GPS is also missing
now granted the Moto 360 and Huawei
doesn't have GPS either and I've fit it
in the video earlier the price where
these then watch start it is indeed a
bit lower than the competitors it does
somewhat justify the matter you can be
the judge on that the other issue is the
vibrations for alerts is quite pain now
I hear this thing is buzzing at my wrist
several times when alert comes through
but I've noticed I don't notice the
vibration at all especially when I'm not
paying attention of course but let's
take a look at how this functions and
what features is heads that might or
might not feel the feel for you though
the screen is possibly one of the best
on the market being super bright
outdoors even in direct sunlight and I
know my camera's not doing enough
justice right now but guys get the idea
those good has long that's highest pixel
densities on a SmartWatch currently at
287 pixels per inch and it is noticeable
and don't see jagged lines or pixelated
text now regarding how fluid the watches
I do admit during the first three days
or so there has been times
if the watch would stutter essentially
not smooth in menu scrolling and
displayed changes but after that third
day and even after a week of use a
heaven notice any issues any further
there on out and it's been fluid enough
for an Android wear device like
apparently Tizen which is Samsung's
operating system or Apple SmartWatch
though to other in-house experiences are
smoother and at least feels faster now
regarding watch faces after I downloaded
the a season watch app I found there
were 62 different cells with some you
can customize the colors and some or you
can add battery life information or even
a step counter I'll continue to show
more watch faces in the video for your
convenience nothing more unique features
in today's smart watches with these n
watch you can take phone calls and with
this and oddly asus didn't seem to
promote this at all but if you go into
the app make sure you turn the remote
call control to on and via bluetooth you
can use your watch as a speakerphone and
like most other smartwatches that does
offer this feature as well this speaker
is great in quiet environment but for
busier areas the tiny speaker is
somewhat hard to hear so if we're having
a speakerphone I'm the watcher it is
perfect when I'm working and have my
hands tied up and my phone is in my
pocket the x microphone is simply in the
room next to me here and I can just
literally pick up right then and there
not meeting to walk into the other room
and basically grab my phone again this
is completely subjective you guys can be
the judge that this feature is unique or
not I personally like it the other
feature is the SOS function in an event
of an emergency you can activate this
and your preferred contact will receive
a text message immediately indicating
you're in need of help and a second text
message actually provides a link to
google maps showing where you are with
latitude and longitude coordinates as a
backup now moving on to Fitness this
works with several third-party apps like
Strava RunKeeper math my run of course
you go v but Asus does providing one
themselves which monitors all day
tracking okay come on the walkie doesn't
have GPS nor heart rate tracking so it's
not too serious for fitness enthusiasts
there were some watch faces you can see
your steps count for that day and from
the watch you can open up then fit of
course and start a walk run have a watch
count and keep a log of push-up and also
fit up as well the app does great at
keeping track and explain your
data and a very easy to read manners but
again it is not a jack-of-all-trades
multi featured apps as data it's great
for general all-day tracking and record
tasting for exercising to perform and if
that's all that you need it works fine
another feature again not sure why
eight-six is not from coding this year
really play music apps on the watch
sheet sync music and songs on the phone
will copy itself and to the design watch
where some Bluetooth earphones for your
run or at the gym and you can leave your
phone behind in the car or in the locker
it's four gigs of internal memory
storage leave the phone at home so at
the end of the day here ACS provides a
good set of features and features that I
wish ACS did a better job promoting the
reason why I say that any first of the
days of usage if let me spell generic I
really had a dig and try to find out
what features this thing has since I did
try to highlight in this video and
that's the end of the week it was
actually quite robust and also with the
emphasis on its low retail price as well
the physical issues such as my desire of
a more supple and more luxury feeling
another band that of course can be
swapped up and again the price does
someone justify that lack of GPS and
heart rate tracking I also want to say
not everyone's a runner net was a really
big fitness nut or so without those
features why pay for it if you're not
going to use it it's simply a watch that
intended for fitness enthusiasts so just
keep that in mind
a lot of software issues I do
acknowledge I wish the frame rate was a
bit better but again this is really
inherent on Android wear the operating
system basically and with Android wear
2.0 right around the corner the update
will hopefully fix that and also we're
also getting a revamp look as well that
will make reading the screen easier and
soon typing and writing on the
SmartWatch on the screen SmartWatch 8
possibilities and does like tides and
for Samsung and of course the Apple
watch now keep in mind the quality of
the display specifically the resolution
is one of the best that's something that
want to highlight and something to keep
in mind if you are intending on
purchasing any other SmartWatch on the
market is it screen resolution and how
bright it is outdoors so that's it for
