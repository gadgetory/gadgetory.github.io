room 10 months of waiting after I
personally pre-ordered this from Atlas I
finally got it what's unique about this
and why it's creating so much buzz Atlas
claims this can read and differentiate
your motions to determine what
weightlifting exercise that you're doing
of course test is for accuracy but more
importantly I'll discuss the user
experience is it easy to use
is it streamlined does this provide
useful data again I personally pay for
this at the current price of two hundred
and fifty dollars but you can click on
the link in the video description below
for the most updated prices so without
further ado my channel is here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's review room
going over the physical parts this is
truly a unique design the band is
actually two pieces the band or strap
and the Atlas itself
there's no electronics in the physical
band but only a magnetized area to snap
and hold into place the Atlas
surprisingly after my testing and I'm a
relief to know now for light activities
to more vigorous ones when weightlifting
here the brains of the device stays
attached also keep in mind it's not a
deal breaker but because the design and
the technology built-in here this can
only go any left wrist at least for now
before this was released one of the
biggest areas of skepticism was how
comfortable the Atlas would be unlike
activity trackers from Fitbit Garmin or
jawbone the Atlas watch style strap
feels much more rugged and it's wider
than most mainstream bands not a big
deal since these sides and stiffer
materials do provide better stability
and when doing push-ups pull-ups
military presses and similar exercises
where my hands are bent slightly
backwards
the Atlas would sit flush against my arm
and never got in the way despite what it
looks like this might be protruding
piece the Atlas was always comfortable
and I've seen the comments from fans
here on my channel no this cannot call
my Megazord Pope regarding the brains of
the device there's one physical button
here on the side to activate the screen
and to execute other actions on the back
is the optical heart rate sensor which
I'll test soon and last on the right is
what every fitness band needs it's a
micro USB port for charging regarding
better life Atlas claims this should
last up to a week if you're working out
every day for an hour but for my
personal test of leaving this on at a
full battery letting it drain while it's
in workout mode at lasted six hours in
theory working out an hour each day that
should have lasted of course six days
and I would have to put a disclaimer on
this being open and honest with my
viewers here if you do leave the screen
on when not working out without the
heart rate sensor even on as well the
Atlas does drain battery very fast
the Atlas just simply isn't meant to be
an all-day activity tracker there's also
no sleep tracking there's no distance
measured and there's no sleep monitoring
as well the Atlas is just really meant
to be worn only when you do workout but
going back to that USB ports although
exposed Atlas believes the tracker is
capable of up to thirty meters of water
resistance and with my test although
exposed the Ben has been working fine
after being submerged under water taking
a look at the touch screen it's not the
tie
touch screen where you can swipe and
slide your fingers across to move around
instead it's broken down into three
areas to tap which has been very
responsive also note this is using a dot
matrix display which is a bit
traditional it's not a fancy or colorful
screen like smartwatches or the more
advanced activity bands out there but I
personally did it mine and regarding any
flick when you see in this video here in
person you do not see this at all this
is only because the different frame
rates cameras uses in recording that
causes this effect not on the front you
have your date and time which is pretty
straightforward tapping right lets you
go into your plan to coach the workouts
if you look to the right of the screen
in the app which I'll go over soon
each workout has several sets of
exercises you can perform you can select
in the app which plan workouts you want
synched to the band
now once synced and looking at the Atlas
you then follow and perform the workouts
as provided on the display you also have
the ability to create your own custom
workouts as well which provides you with
more unlimited sessions to perform or a
plan that you can set up before going
into the gym but backing out here and
going into the next section which is
freestyle this is where most folks have
been intrigued tap freestyle and the
band will start reading your movements
automatically as of this video the band
can only read 50 movements for the time
being of course Atlas will be adding
more throughout the year so for early
adopters like myself here this might not
have everything that you need but
currently out of those fifty eleven are
TRX Suspension Training movements while
the remaining thirty nine either our
bodyweight exercises or workouts with
weights
now one of the things that I needed to
mention before each workout I would
highly recommend going through the list
on the app and selecting which workouts
you intend and performing the reason
being Atlas only remembers 15 movements
at a time if it's bicep tricep day and
obviously in that leg day you want to
ensure that you have all your arm
workouts you need synched it to the band
what I'm trying to explain there's a
little preparation required by the user
prior to each workout now when I
pre-order the Atlas I thought I would
just wear this into the gym or whether
since ooh my room and start working out
and it wouldn't require my intervention
but once it's synced though those 15
workouts can be viewed on the band
itself to remind what it can track now
during my time using the band the
tracking and rep counting was impressive
to witness and experience but getting
over the amazement phase early on
eventually start to shape might user
experience now as you see in this video
here each set I did were
ten reps unless I indicate otherwise
just to keep things simple for me and
for you to follow along and some
occasions did the Atlas mr. rapper too
and on rare occasions with proper form
and movement did the band register only
two or three reps out of those ten now
Atlas does compensate for those rare
occasions where it doesn't miss a rep or
two as after each set is completed you
need to confirm which exercise you
performed how many reps and it will ask
you to enter in the weight you use again
this is after every set in the end by
the time you do sync the Atlas to your
phone the rep counts should be accurate
for sure I also randomly tested for
false positives especially for those
lifting heavier for those trying to
squeeze in that last rep and it might
not make it does the Atlas count though
I did two pumps first which looked
somewhat legit put the third through
fifth pull-ups you can see I'm not even
getting over hitting my head on the bar
here and just wobbling everywhere
the Atlas no once the camera focuses
here did register a total of four
pull-ups now this also occurred with
other exercises I performed as well
confirming false positives can be
evidence in your case as well again
before save me I could always edit the
amount of reps just to make sure
everything is clean cut before it goes
to the app and the last only other issue
that I've experienced and another fan of
my Instagram experience this too in
between sets picking up dumbbells and
rear racking or moving your arms around
to stretch in between sets the Atlas may
register that as some form of random
exercise movement and when you do look
down there's a rep count of one or two
sadly you cannot delete it from the
physical band right then and there but
you're forced to save it I usually save
it as other with a rep in weight count
of zero and once I get back to my phone
I bent delete a pair again for the user
experience I would have to manage my
tracking once I get back to the app to
ensure it's accurate
so overall from my user experience it
works great and it does what it claims
to do for majority of the time and
looking at the big picture compared to
anything else on the market this is for
sure the best weight lifting recognition
and rep counting band available despite
more user input and management than I
first initially thought now all I want
to do was provide a realistic
illustration and how the Atlas performed
and let you know what you may encounter
hopefully after my video here there's no
false expectations if you decide to
purchase but now there's one more
component that is equally benef
official to the physical ban itself it's
the app I'm the main page here at the
very top features two options your
workouts performed and the planned
workouts selecting the right side this
is where you go to sync coach mode
select the 15 exercises for freestyle
mode which we went over and to create a
custom workouts really straightforward
here now by heading back to my workouts
the day you worked out is on the very
top I noticed there wasn't a weekly or
monthly calendar with all the data
combined which would be really cool
absolutely great considering those using
the pen and paper method a traditional
method doesn't really have the ability
to do that moving down and the left
indicates how many calories you've
burned during this workout average heart
beat per minute and how long you worked
out for to the right is a heat map
indicating which muscle groups you've
worked and sliding down there's your
entire list of workouts actually
performed during that workout session
the exercise name reps and how many
pounds are all indicated here if you
click on cardio and getting into the HR
data you can see how your heart rate
function over time and want to compare
this to my polar h7 chest strap the band
works out well and is accurate enough
from my testing now less than the app is
velocity which reveals a little yellow
dot after each workout whether that
eventually sits indicates if your toning
your body or bulking up in muscle for me
after seeing the simple diagram I
personally want to go a little bit
slower during my reps I personally
really like this understated feature but
that's really it for the Atlas band
again despite the shortcomings for the
user experience for the time being and
compared to the rest of the bands on the
market today again this is hands-down
the best form recognition and rep
counting band on the market currently I
know a lot of you have been waiting for
this band let me know what you think
below what a pen and paper still be more
convenient for you considering not all
the workouts are available just yet or
the Atlas and it's app would be more
beneficial for you write your comments
