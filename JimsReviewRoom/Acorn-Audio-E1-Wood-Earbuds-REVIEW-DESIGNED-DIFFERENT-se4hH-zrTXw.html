review room welcome to another design
different episode the today we got a
pair of unique ear buds from acorn audio
over the UK now what's so different
they're made with real wood giving a
difference wood grain pattern on each
set sold but beyond aesthetics using
real would supposedly enhances sound
quality
now speakers produce sound not only from
the front but also from behind having a
high density material such as real wood
separates these two sounds preventing
them from canceling each other out in
their for giving richer sounds now what
provides exceptional acoustics by
containing more of the sound waves
within the concealed cavity which is why
you hear such clear audio or at least
that's what's claimed on acorns websites
so the idea sounds impressive but let's
see how they perform the first thing
you'll notice when you pick these up is
how lightweight they are its small and
how acorn keeps it simple let the
earbuds are hard plastic with the
previously mentioned wood and the wood
is very durable and only when I firmly
press my nail into the wood did it leave
a mark which was still barely noticeable
now the wire itself is approximately 1.2
meters long and unfortunately it's not a
tangle free cord now having this bundle
together and thrown into your bag or
pocket does cause it to tangle somewhat
so just be aware of that no testing this
in my pocket and also my gym bag has
showed no signs of damage or wear
especially where the joints are located
considering the wires of very
lightweight and keep in mind acorn does
provide a 12 month warranty as well
overall the design works well and seems
to hold up now a current also provides
in the box three sets of ear tips from
small medium to large now everyone's
ears are different in a mid I personally
have a tough time with ear buds in
general although I like them very much
for their sound isolation and uninvaded
designs for working out and moving
around and if you watched my review on
the j-bird blue buds X which were $170
u.s. I loved their sound but they kept
falling out of my ear I personally wear
these small ones here and they fit well
with
Ewan's no although those small tips
might be very thin once they're in your
ears they do hold and hold comfortably -
so with all that being said how does it
sound
well to be honest considered I just
reviewed the bluebloods X and the Jabra
rocks
I wasn't expecting much but I got a met
I was somewhat taken by surprise these
ones are very clear on the high notes
without being tingey
an ear numbing after several hours of
news they are as loud as the affer
mansion and I mainly kept it at about
fifty to sixty percent volume for
listening which is plenty loud for me
now listening to songs from Lady Gaga
beyonc√© and Justin Timberlake all were
satisfying with very good highs and
treble levels the mids you where you'll
hear most vocal notes are good but at
times I do wish there's a little bit
more warmth or a full-bodied miss if I
can explain it or illustrate it to you
they're still good nonetheless and for
the price of these earbuds it's not bad
at all now if you're a classical or
strings kind of a person definitely
check out the quartet the piano guys on
YouTube as unused them for my tests I
also tested the e ones with Lindsey
Stirling and her electric violin and
it's just amazingly sharp and again
without ting eNOS on those high notes
now in regards to bass I believe it's
always so subjective as people prefer
different levels of bass in general
listening to pop hip-hop possibly
rocking some rap the e ones does good
it's not bad at all for the casual
middle ground listener now if you're
favoring more sub bass that deep bass
that you'd normally see in the beats
brand of audio products or even the most
recent review the chopper rocks you're
not going to get it here but as stated
if you're not as bass heavy like me
these earbuds will do justice the bass
in general is more on the conservative
side but it still has enough for a
well-balanced experience but overall
it's a complete package the sound
quality is good the fitment works for me
and it's a good balance with minimal
distortion and listening to these for
several hours as I wrote this review
never did my ears fatigue or start
ringing afterwards
the only thing missing I would think of
is an inline mic and volume controls and
maybe a small case to help reduce that
tangling of the wires but if you're
shopping in this price range this is one
set that you might have to look into so
hope these would earbuds intrigued you
in some way
