review room welcome to another design
different episode the today we got a
pair of unique earbuds from a cord audio
over the UK now what's so different
they're made with real wood giving a
difference woodgrain pattern on each set
sold but beyond aesthetics using real
wood supposedly enhances sound quality
now speakers produce sound not only from
the front but also from behind having a
high density material such as real wood
separates these two sounds preventing
them from canceling each other out in
their forgiving richer sounds now what
provides exceptional acoustics by
containing more of the sound waves
within the concealed cavity which is why
you hear such clear audio or at least
that's what's claimed on acorns websites
so the idea sounds impressive but let's
see how they perform the first thing
you'll notice when you pick these up is
how lightweight they are it's small and
how a corn keeps it simple let the
earbuds are hard plastic with the
previously mentioned wood and the wood
is very durable and only when I firmly
press my nail into the wood did it leave
a mark which was still barely noticeable
the wire itself is approximately 1.2
meters long and unfortunately it's not a
tangle free cord now having this bundle
together and thrown into your bag or
pocket does cause a detangle somewhat so
just be aware of that now testing this
in my pocket and also my gym bag has
showed no signs of damage or wear
especially where the joints are located
considering the wires of very
lightweight and keep in mind acorn does
provide a 12 month warranty as well
overall the design works well and seems
to hold up now a current also provides
in the box three sets of ear tips from
small medium to large now everyone's
ears are different in Al mid I
personally have a tough time with
earbuds in general although I like them
very much for their sound isolation and
uninvited designs for working out and
moving around and if you watch my review
on the jaybird bluebuds x which were 170
dollars u.s. I loved their sound but I
kept falling out of my ear I personally
where the small ones here and they fit
well with the e
ones now although those small tips might
be very thin once they're in your ears
they do hold it hold comfortably too so
with all that being said how does it
sound well to be honest considering I
just reviewed the bluebloods X and the
Java rocks I wasn't expecting much but I
got a med I was somewhat taken by
surprise these e ones are very clear on
the high notes without being ting e
in-ear numbing after several hours of
news they are as loud as the affirmation
and I mainly kept it at about fifty to
sixty percent volume for listening which
is plenty loud for me now listening to
songs from Lady Gaga Beyonce and Justin
Timberlake all were satisfying with very
good highs and trouble levels the mids
you where you'll hear most vocal notes
are good but at times I do wish there
was a little bit more warmth or
full-bodied miss if I can explain it or
illustrate it to you they're still good
nonetheless and for the price of these
earbuds it's not bad at all now if
you're a classical or strings kind of a
person definitely check out the quartet
the piano guys on YouTube as I'm use
them for my tests I also tested the e
ones with lindsey stirling and her
electric violin and it's just amazingly
sharp and again without tininess on
those high notes now in regards to base
i believe it's always so subjective as
people prefer different levels of base
in general listening to pop hip hop
possibly rocking some rap the e ones
does good it's not bad at all for the
casual middle ground listener now if
you're favoring more sub base that deep
bass that you normally see in the beats
brand of audio products or even the most
recent review the Java rocks you're not
going to get it here but as stated if
you're not as bass heavy like me these
earbuds will do justice the base in
general is more on the conservative side
but it still has enough for a
well-balanced experience but overall a
complete package the sound quality is
good the fitment works for me and it's a
good balance with minimal distortion now
listening to these for several hours as
I wrote this review never did my ears
fatigue or start ringing afterwards the
only thing missing I would think of is
an inline mic and volume controls and
maybe a small case to help reduce that
tangling of the wires but if you're
shopping this price range this is one
set that you might have to look into so
hope these wood ear buds intrigued do in
some way be sure
