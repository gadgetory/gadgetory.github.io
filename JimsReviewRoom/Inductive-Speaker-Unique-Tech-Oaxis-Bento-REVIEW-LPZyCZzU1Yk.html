room try to bring you guys some unique
tech to the channel here
Oasis or o axis how are we pronounced
it's sent me the bento speaker and it
isn't like any other speaker that I
reviewed on the channel this thing
requires no connection at all no
Bluetooth no NFC no Wi-Fi and
technically no physical court is
required the bento uses induction
technology and I'll demonstrate this
later in the review this thing costs
fifty dollars at the time this video
click on my links in the video
description below to see the most
updated prices of course any purchases
through my amazon links and does help
support the channel now jumping straight
into this this speaker is bigger than
first thought here but it needs to fit
both 5-inch to 5.7 inch phones down here
there's simply an induction plate up top
with a line to help give you an idea
where the phone needs to rest and below
the platform is the speaker itself no
audio is pumped up 360 degrees and
during my testing Auto does come out
evenly from all angles
now looking below there's a blue LED
light to signal when the unit is turned
on and rotating to the rear is a
microUSB port to charge the bento a
three-and-a-half millimeter port for
physical connections you would prefer
and to the far right is the power on and
off switch the bento speaker can last up
to six hours from a full battery now the
entire unit is plastic and do admit the
top plate is oily fingerprint prone but
it's simple what doesn't get it clean
and last before jumping into the audio
performance it says it does work with
many smartphones as long as it has a
speakerphone
but they didn't list what smart phones
didn't work I tried this on my LG v10
Nexus 6p Samsung s7 and note 5 plus my
sixth generation iPod Touch and all of
them worked perfectly fine now all you
have to do while music is going place
your bottom half of the phone along the
line here and move it around slightly to
find your sweet spot where audio is at
full volume and that's basically it
here's a quick sample
I haven't seen much marketing for it now
you're watching the NBA Finals that they
show in commercials for it during the
NBA that's kind of when they would show
those commercials right I'm trying to
remember what about microtransactions
we've got a lot of wanna watch LeBron
dunk and throw $2 now so after my
testing the audio performance for music
is really satisfactory you're not
getting audio quality like a dedicated
Bluetooth speaker however if you need
this general audio for a room just have
some background noise or so this thing
works perfectly fine the quality is good
enough where it's not highly distorted
or jumbled but you're just not getting
that spatial sound or bass boost
signature or any kind of emphasised mid
ranges and the likes but the loudness is
fitting for small areas it's not too
loud to film medium to large-sized rooms
however if you're using this for more
personal purposes or somewhat medium to
close proximity it's fine then now
they're Amazon page does say this is
geared towards those using it for
podcast audiobooks teleconferences or a
speakerphone for the family I think then
it works great in those areas as
absolute audio quality isn't required
but voices for the information
activities that works perfectly fine now
again if you're looking for audio
quality to have better immersion for
music and movies I'd say look elsewhere
but if you're just needing audio in
general a quick and intuitive method
here I'm just setting your phone down
and having audio amplified this is a
nifty little gadget to have so guys let
me know if you're interested in more
truly unique gadgets like this here on
the channel I'll try to find some more
for you guys if you are interested if
not just let me know down below as
always like and subscribe and follow me
on social media you guys take care and
you'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
