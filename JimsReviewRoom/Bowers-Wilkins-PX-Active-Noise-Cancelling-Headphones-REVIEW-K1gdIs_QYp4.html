active noise-cancelling headphone video
and then you guys been blowing at my
comment session asked me to test these
these are the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins P X's
it's their first ever active
noise-cancelling headphones now as
always being transparent with you guys
bars and workings did send these over
for me to review however my assessment
was not altered in any way please watch
the entire video for both pros and cons
now they're priced at $400 at the time
of this video and it's up there with
these set hazard PXE 550's and more
expensive than the Bose and so many
headphones but we'll see if the
performance justifies the premium price
tag as always I'll place my affiliate
links down in that video description
below click on those links and it will
give you the most updated prices in real
time you never know when these things
might go on sale so without further
adieu my channel is here to help you
make that purchase decision
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room welcome
everyone to another review going over
the physical features I love the weave
pattern on the headband and the best
part it's not just aesthetics but it's
practical this material is called
ballistic nylon and it's one of the most
durable and abrasion resistant fabrics
that you can get right now going down
the sides are adjustable arms all metal
construction and a gracefully slide in
and out instead of that ratty clicky
feel and with my testing yes they do
stay in place and they don't adjust
while walking along those metal arms the
wire is braided and recessed in their
extending down to the ballistic nylon
covered ear cups but a closed back
headphones as the metal backing with the
Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins logo being reflective
because it's made of metal now over all
these things look classy gorgeous and
props to them for being original in
their own way
now overall party looks and feels super
premium doing my stress test and I'm
aware this is overkill right here I know
you won't be doing this yourself on your
own headphones but let me do it so that
way you guys don't have to now I'm not
trying to break them or anything like
that I just want to see or hear in the
microphones right in front of you if
there's any kind of creaks or cracks or
spot any kind of weak areas no
thankfully I didn't notice any of that
on the P X's if anything is headphone
stretched
bit because of being reinforced by metal
now before talking about comfort take a
look at these ear cups these are
completely different from anything else
that I've tested they're completely held
out my ears do stick out a bit here when
I wear these my ear lobes see the outer
rim barely touches the inside and you'll
also notice the ear pads are very thin
as well it's a unique feeling because it
doesn't give you a cushiony pillow like
feeling and I'm where there's no such
word as cushiony but it feels like I'm
wearing a glass cup that's wrapped in
supple leather right over my ears now
does this cause ear sweats it doesn't
for me but my ears did warm up a bit
while wearing these for an hour and odd
also while we're minimal sound leakage
was present as well during my testing
the last but at least the ear cups are
magnetized which was awesome and they're
strong to just pull them off and slide
them back on piece of cake now as for
comfort the headband album it doesn't
feel plush and because they weigh in at
335 grams which is on the heavier side
of a fancy headphones there's slight
pressure right at the crown of the head
I do feel slight soreness right at bits
ha now what there are some caution in
this area especially for those who are
again long commuters or intend on
wearing these at the desk for extended
hours in general now take it it closer
and look at the controls they are for
the most part easy to find giving a good
amount of feedback here to ensure I
confident press
baris and Wilkins does include a button
called an environmental filter that
adjusts the active noise-cancelling
performance or to turn it off off
together at the perfect sample and I'm
going to briefly show you the Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins app in City mode when you're
walking around some might prefer to hear
cars or maybe people around them just
for safety you want anyone sneaking up
behind you or probably accidentally
getting hit by a bus and by pressing the
button on the P axis you can switch the
city mode which turns on the microphones
and pumps your environmental noises
right into the headphones if you want
the opposite sensors just shut help the
world here you can switch it over to
flight mode which attempts to block out
as much as ANSI headphones can but more
my performance a little bit later now
getting back to the physical headphones
pausing or going back on songs we're
straightforward with double to triple
clicks on the multifunction button Syria
Google assistant
works by holding down that same
multifunction button for several seconds
that is now a three and a half
millimeter port is offered for wired
connections and last I'm happy to say
these are my first ever headphones that
I've tested that comes with USB type-c
finally I've been waiting for this and
mentioning this for quite some time and
all my other reviews and I've only
Bluetooth speakers can have this as well
no Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins claims up to three
hours to recharge from a dead battery to
full I was able to do it in an hour and
25 minutes now as for a battery life
they're claiming up to 22 hours of use
which is very good here with my testing
at 50% of em when I do this on all my
headphones and speakers I was able to
get 25 hours and 27 minutes to be
precise not the only issue that I've
encountered though and worse they
included a better battery level
indicator the lights on the right side
earcup ear is very small and the
color-coded lights gives an
approximation having voice prompts with
any headphones what happen great but
again we don't get that the best thing
you can do and the most precise I guess
you can say you get a whip out your
phone and look at their sparse Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins app now such an based on one of
Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins high-tech features here
the PX is have a proximity sensor when
you lift up one ear cup or take the
headphones completely off your music
automatically pauses when you put them
back on the music resumes basically now
lifting one ear cut works each and every
time here but taking them off and
placing them around my neck was a bit
finicky sometimes it works sometimes it
didn't know either or it's a neat
feature when it does work though and
similar to these Sennheiser px c5 50s or
the Sony 1000 X's hand over your cup
method it's a really unique feature and
I do appreciate it now finishing up the
minor details I did test these with
phone call my voice comes across pretty
clear here pretty clean that out a
percent but surely reasonable like most
other headphones or headsets they still
pick up background in environmental
noises now I tested blew through the
range and although this has Bluetooth
4.1 it's still very very good with a
straight line of sight here I was able
to get 240 linear feet with my iPhone 10
that I'm currently testing I know it
sounds crazy so I did another test but
inside the office building here and was
able to achieve 110 feet with the same
phone
with my pixel Excel it's a second phone
just to verify here I managed to get a
hundred feet and that's with the signal
going through several walls I believe
three here before the audio started to
crackle now because Bluetooth headsets
I've tested to date here none of them
have performed anywhere close to them
now also as a sign up you can have up to
eight devices paired with the P X's
though there's no voice prompts to tell
you which device it's connected to to
something that was really missing on the
P X's now last but not least before I
had Emily active noise-cancelling
performance I got to talk about their
carrying case though this thing looked
fancy as hell here there's no structural
support for protection but this does
protect from scuffs and such with style
I'm not sure what the materials are I
couldn't find it with their brief or
with a brief search that is but it feels
like Alcantara inside there's a little
pouch to hold your wires and last the
cover is magnetized to stay close now
this is much better than any other
neoprene or silk like bag with
drawstrings that i've had tested here on
many headphones in the past the only
true could take here the bag does
collect some dust over time so all right
folks let's do a quick active
noise-cancelling demonstration please be
sure to plan your own headphones or
earphones to get the best audio
experience i'm using professional binder
on microphones and this will give you
the most accurate test here on youtube
all I ask please be sure to LIKE and
subscribe if you haven't already and
comment down below on what you think
about these headphones at the end of
this video
any support will be greatly appreciated
and there you have it folks with my
experience in person they did a very
darn good job I've barely experienced
any kind of air cabin pressure with the
P X's I know some may encounter that
with other headphones and there's very
minor white noise heard when a and C is
on but with music going I can barely
hear it at all and with ANC turned on to
maximum much of that ambient air to
ambient noises that are around me were
able to be muted or muffled and
background music maybe in the store so I
may be at the coffee shop
those were suppressed by a good bit now
like most anti headphones they don't
block on everything but while walking
outdoors does sitting in my studio with
others working around me here I barely
hear their the keys on the keyboard of
my co-workers clicking along most of
their and movements of them rustling
around are also gone as well the voices
in the food court or the studio were
also reduced but with most active
noise-cancelling headphones they can
only do so much overall from my
experience these perform very well I can
hear the noise canceling working and
this might be a shocker they did perform
slightly better
they boast QC 35 twos now if you guys
want that comparison heads head video
add me on Facebook Instagram or Twitter
and let me know personally send me a
message so that way I could know alright
folks
now next up are two audio samples to
hear the audio signature be sure to use
your headphones or earphones once again
I'm making this part really simple no
fancy editing here we go
we
there you have it folks
now the first thing you'll notice when
you first fire these things up is the
spatial audio sound they're amazing in
that regards left and right audio
channels - vocals being heard in the
forefront - hearing instruments off in
the distance you also are able to hear
the live crowd around you when you're
listening to live concerts now the
headphones were really able to
accentuate the direction depth that is
and width of music again it does really
amazing in that aspect now they're all
so loud in with Jordan time I'm
listening to these around 60 to 65%
volume while my boys QC 35 to s which I
do love here I'm playing those around 75
to 80% for these same exact experience
now as for bass Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins went
with very balanced audio signatures from
my experience here when I constantly
took these off and on and swapped them
with my boys few c35 twos they sounded
very close with each other they're not
bassy but gives off a much more natural
and neutral tone now bass is not
overpowering but enough for listening
across me most John Rose now I can see
those who focus on accuracy and in
natural sounding audio signature
appreciating the PXE p axis that is very
much now these will shine for classical
rock music music that's strong and
vocals as well
and depending on your preference the
genres of pop and EDM will surely be
enjoyed while those listening to hip-hop
and valuing bass those folks might have
to look elsewhere
watch my sony WH 1000 text review for
the alternative now focusing on the
mid-range the consistency with being
clear detailed and full of resolution
are some of the characteristics that I
can give you guys the reproduction of
instruments was accurate and very
detailed vocal performance wasn't
recessed but wasn't very forward either
if you're listening to quality audio
files apdex HD is also supported and a
detail does come through the undie tap
em the PX is finished out the spectrum
with precision and nuance here was such
a focus on the other two ranges when
listening to a busy sounding song with a
lot of synthesizers harmonics and cymbal
crashes let's say there was never any
tinging or ear ringing that would lead
to listening fatigue this was the
easy to listen to now overall the Bowers
and Wilkins P X's are a high-end option
for Wireless antsy Headroom this sounded
amazing and look amazing as well in my
personal opinion the NC perform great
and I admit the app experience was very
sparse that is and indeed they're not as
high-tech as the Sennheiser PXE 550's or
these Sony WH 1000 X's they really focus
on good ANC and good audio kind of how
or why unlikely boast QC 35 s and I've
do value those equivalent to my Sony
1000 X's although this Sony's are you
know has a lot more features same thing
with these here
not much features but they perform very
well in certain aspect they're the only
big downfalls that I would consider and
I wish they did better on Bowers and
welcomes that is I needed voice prompts
for better life and which devices I'm
paired to and last is the comfort for
long term wearing they did not hold up
well for long term wears out there so
folks if you've been watching this far
please please help support my channel
here if I liking and commenting down
below send me some fire mode use as well
and again I'm Jimmy with Jim's Rovira
and I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision you guys take care
I'll catch you guys on the next one bye
