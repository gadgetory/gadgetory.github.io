review by James review room today we'll
be looking at the JBL charge a wireless
Bluetooth speaker that has its own
battery pack inside so you can bring the
speaker anywhere that you want without
any of the wires the charges the bigger
brother retailing at 150 dollars while
these smaller JBL flip retails for only
a hundred and regarding pricing JBL
charge is very competitively priced
compared to the competition such as the
pill from beats by dre both the sound
link and the Soundlink mini from boats
and not to mention both the big and mini
Jawbone Jambox
so with its low price we'll look at its
styling features and lastly its
performance so without further ado we'll
get started the charge itself is made
entirely out of hard plastic with the
exception of the front facing metal mesh
grille where the front facing speakers
housed and on the other side where the
bass port is also located now all
aspects of the product is very durable
for my news and review including the
metal parts which doesn't dent when
pressure is applied now the unit is also
smaller than the big speakers on the
market today which is a huge plus for
traveling and also for stowing your bag
now the charge really shows off with big
sound with a small form-factor now on
top you have your charge light
indicators glowing blue with the power
button right next to that and value
rocker buttons to follow now all buttons
are very clicky and also very responsive
the only thing I wish was more readily
available
matter of fact actually on all devices
is a better battery indicator
most of these Bluetooth speakers they
don't have do so well with indicating
how much battery or how much life you
have left in the device not only three
lights are present to indicate your
remaining charge now rotating to the
back here there is no rear-facing
speaker or ports and it's covered by
this large gray plastic that is not
detachable now on the bottom shows very
simple connections including a microUSB
port to charge the unit with the
supplied USB wall charger now in regards
to battery this is where the charge
lives up to its name
not only does the JBL charge lasts up to
an amazing 12 hours of news which is on
the high spectrum of Bluetooth speakers
but the charge also features a USB out
port for charging your iPhone or iPad
now if your device is about to die the
JBL charge can bring your device back to
full battery status and still have
several
of remaining battery life to play music
now you do have to leave the speaker on
though to charge but it's great for
emergencies or on-the-go now lastly
although this device is designed to play
audio wirelessly through bluetooth there
is a three-and-a-half millimeter port
for manually connecting your device to
play audio so all these features inspect
so far listed off really puts the JBL
charge as being possibly the best
bluetooth speaker being built now it
would be a shame if the sound was awful
though but we'll see though so what I'll
do is I'll pair up my charge here with
my iPad basically I go to the bluetooth
settings on my device then turn on the
JBL charge by clicking on that power
button earlier in several seconds it
shows up on the device and I basically
click connect and that's basically it so
what I'll do to critique and demo the
unit I'll play several songs and give
you my verdict afterwards so here goes G
cuz I got it like a flow so smooth like
I got it on tap yeah and I'ma shake it
be a good night while I'm on my game
land while I'm drinking Bud Light can
you get it when you miss me like I'm wit
whiskey drinking champagne yeah baby do
you do it do it that way do you do that
did you take a break you got to let me
show you
I press stop like you why and I'm
dressing my dress you happy love is
swinging in the air tonight let me show
you
and there you have it folks I hope you
enjoyed the sample there from these
great artists now please visit their
YouTube channels to show your support as
they do rely heavily on YouTube to gain
awareness and if you have music that you
would like featured on my channel please
contact me at the email on your screen
or visit facebook.com slash Jim's review
room now getting back on topic here the
JBL charge had excellent range
I left the charge on one side of the
house upstairs and walk to the complete
other side of the house downstairs and
still no loss in connection and that's
going through several walls and also the
first floor ceiling now besides that of
course music heard in person is much
more clear in definition so for me
recording the sample from the speaker
and now you're playing the sample and
your speaker's it's probably not the
best conditions now hence my review here
and hopefully it helps you out the audio
quality is surprising coming from such a
small speaker it definitely does justice
and it's great for casual listening when
valium is around 50 to 75 percent now if
you're just listening casual in your
room or let's say if you're a student
and you're in your dorm room or if you
have a small office it works perfectly
fine and it sounds pretty good
now when I played a maximum value though
overall there isn't much loss in clarity
however there's minor hints of
distortion on the very high notes now at
times with high notes being too high you
do have very slight tinging its minor
and not evident right away but over
long-term listening you'll start to
notice it a little bit especially with
the snares or the cymbals hitting and
allow the esses that are pronounced in
vocals now although having a bass port
it didn't yield too much depth in the
sound as well and although the sound at
maximum is not the best it's far from
being bad though so as it's summery and
going into my pros and cons if you're
not an audio file or scrutinizing as I
am and intend on using this for casual
listening yourself the sound quality is
good and for the price you really can't
beat anything else on the market
if planning on leaving this in the
living room and then having it play at
maximum for company to be over standing
too close to the speaker will eventually
become a little bit droning and that's
the only downfall as a whole out of this
entire unit but everything else on the
speaker from the battery life to the
size to its features of charging your
device and
mention it again the price compared to
the competitors it's really hard to miss
out on what JBL has to offer so hope
with this review it helped you out in
some way please take your time to
subscribe to my channel and visit my
Facebook or Google+ pages and of course
all support is greatly appreciated this
