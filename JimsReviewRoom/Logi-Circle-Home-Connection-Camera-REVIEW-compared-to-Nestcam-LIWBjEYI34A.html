I've been using my nest cam since it was
released and prior to that I've been
using the Dropcam for a good bit
both fabless cameras in their own way
but Logitech the Masters of webcams is
out to make a competitor the largest
circle is what they call it and it
retails for two hundred dollars as of
this video and it's identical in price
to the nest cam and instead of marking
this as a home security camera Logitech
labels this as a home connection camera
this features on here dedicated to
families those with pets and experience
for the busy working household at least
that's what they claim but I'll go over
my tests and tell you what works and
what doesn't so without further ado my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review going over the physical
features first this is very much smaller
than what I thought from looking at the
photos online it's actually and I don't
think ever said this on my channel
before but it's actually adorable it's a
nice compact size that fits in the palm
of your hand I of course have the white
model here but for the stealth look they
do make it in black overall build
quality feels top-notch with a strong
outer case not feeling too hollow inside
and on the front is a 720p wide-angle
camera which I'll demonstrate shortly on
top is a LED light to indicate when this
is on but you can always turn off this
light to be completely stealth within
the app the front silver ring houses a
speakerphone and microphone so within
the app you can initiate a two-way
conversation now voices do come across
clear enough for an at-home wireless
camera but it's not as loud as the nest
cam regardless the largest hurdle still
perform great if you need to tell your
kids to stab something or even check up
on the elderly rotating to the back
there's a slit that reveals options to
pivot this camera up and down moving on
and looking at the base this is really
an original idea the base features these
silver rings that makes a connection
with the underside of the camera one for
allowing you to rotate is completely 360
degrees and still have power and second
it's a charging dock the larger circle
has a built in battery lasting up to 12
hours per logitech a
to move the camera without moving the
power cord for my testing this only
lasted four hours and 20 minutes into
the unit died and sadly I found this
quite common from others who have
purchased this as well so this doesn't
seem to be an isolated matter yet
despite being terrible and it's claimed
battery life I can still appreciate the
feature in four hours or even at two
hours is enough to have a second eye on
things in another area of course being
much closer to 12 would have been more
ideal regarding the electrical cord to
give you an idea of what you're working
with
it's 10 feet long and it connected via
USB to a supplied wall adapter very last
included in the box is a wall mount with
a super strong magnetic plate for wall
mounting here and graciously Logitech
does include drywall anchors to help
with a more secure hold
so overall on the outside it's really
simple I know some would have lighted
motorized rotating base by considering
how small this is and how big the ones
with rotating bases are I honestly
didn't mind that missing feature the
other thing that I wish was available is
the micro SD card slot for local
recording nest cam them sell don't offer
this option but many other lower price
cameras does provide it but I believe
Logitech alleviates this problem or this
issue within an app but before I show
you that I want to show you what a video
call it looks like and then I'll show
you what else they have up your sleeves
all new video samples that you'll see
from here on out will be unedited the
largest circle features a 720p
resolution which to be honest is not as
clear as the nest cam which features
1080p but the differences are not
drastic or a deal-breaker but some
things that you will notice regardless
the Logitech video has some slight blown
out light sources for example the Sun
coming into the windows or when you do
have your lightbulbs on the image color
is slightly washed out while the nest
cam providing a more natural yet more
accurate look of the home and lasting
nest cam does provide a ever so slightly
wider camera angle although Logitech on
their retail box claims 135 degrees
field of view while nest cam is listed
at a smaller 130 degrees in width but
enough about nest cam the logitech
circle still does better than most
others out there and as you can see the
image quality is still very much usable
switching over to night vision the room
is completely dark and I'm wearing a
black jacket with a black hat try my
best to imitate someone snooping around
here but from my testing I'm thoroughly
impressed with Logitech offering the
same visibility in the dark seeing as
much of the cabinet's as the nest cam
now from the distance of the camera to
the wall over there I measured roughly
38 linear feet but there's one more
thing that I have to point out since
this is a comparison the nest cam has
had stuttering problems at night in
night vision mode since my initial
review and still today a small handful
people are experiencing the same thing
with the Logitech majority of the time
maybe 99% of the time I've always had
consistent smooth video in the end
comparing to other mainstream cameras on
the markets Logitech is in the very good
category beating many out there and on
par with the best cameras now moving on
to the F experience which is as critical
as the video performance this works for
Apple and Android devices I've tested
this on my B 10 smartphone from LG the
Nexus 6p and my iPad air 2 all
downloaded and works flawlessly
right now I'm in live view seeing
everything in real time but if I tap
that screen on your right we'll review
these little time stamps each time stamp
is an event that has been recorded and
event is essentially any movement at the
camera recognized now the reason why
Logitech implemented this is to prevent
you from scrubbing through an entire
day's worth of video to see let's say
when your kids come home or when god
forbid a burglar enters into your
household it's
highly convenient and has saved so much
time but do you recall when I said
earlier I was bumped out for not having
that micro SD card slot for local
recording
well cloud recording is offered on many
other cameras but this is the first
camera to offer this service without any
sort of monthly subscription it's free I
do admit that it is limited to the last
24 hours
and it then would delete old videos and
record the new ones but 24 hours for me
seems suitable for most situations
offering 48 hours would have been better
and it does give you an extra day or two
to notice any issues in your household
but considering this again is free this
is in the right direction that I haven't
seen others do in addition if you want
to download that clip to your phone here
it's literally tap or two away with this
icon on the bottom save it to your phone
and then share to yourself via email or
send it to all the popular social media
channels out there including YouTube and
from my analysis this camera so far has
done a great job at not reporting
changes in lighting conditions or clouds
rolling through sometimes you see that
issue and other cameras the circle
camera here has done a great job at just
recording what's really a movement
second another awesome feature swiping
all the way down is a 30-second
hyperlapse video of all those recorded
moments that I've shown you above
condense for you to basically see what
has happened in the entire day again all
within this little 30-second clip
perfect for busy working professionals
where time is the utmost importance so
I've been the screen from the left
reviews your settings to mute your
microphone possibly and to turn off your
LED as I mentioned earlier maybe adding
another camera to this app or turning
the camera off altogether all this is
revealed here you can also turn on push
notification so when there is movements
your phone will be alerted which is
pretty standard nearly all security
cameras but it's always a huge plus just
in case you weren't aware and last is of
course your account information now the
only thing that I honestly and truly
disliked about the app logitech has
limited the continuous live streaming to
three minutes meaning I can't use this
as a monitor I can only watch my child
on my smart phone for again those three
minutes and even some may consider using
this as a baby monitor they wouldn't be
able to do so they can't leave this on
all night if you want to keep an eye on
something you just simply can't now I
just this with Logitech and they said
it's a feature they are for sure working
on so hopefully by the time you see this
video maybe
there's an update so in my opinion here
the app alone feels like a game-changer
it really truly does it's super smooth
the playback of the events I shown
earlier are not locally stored on your
phone but it works nearly instantly from
the cloud which is simply amazing
overall the reliability the fluidness
the 24-hour recording the cloud
recording that is in the automatic
filtering which means you don't have to
scrub through videos that have no
content at all I highly recommend this
as an alternative to the nest cam the
only downside if you are intending on
using this as more of a monitor you
gotta wait for that update and as a side
note I have seen this on Amazon for 160
dollars and if you can get it on sale
this does become a sweeter deal again
I'll put the link in the video
description below for the updated
pricing so I hope this review helped you
