review room welcome back to another
unboxing well actually this is my first
gaming unboxing as I'm trying to hit a
new audience a new demographic here on
Jim's review room so if I can ask you
guys after watching this entire video
let me know if it's either too long or
too short it's a too detailed or not as
detailed but as you guys know with my
unboxing videos I do go in a little bit
more detail than some other people and
of course the next video wouldn't have
this long introduction so just keep that
in mind and hope you guys enjoy this at
least I with all my unboxings they're
unmerited unscripted so you probably
hear me say a lot and maybe some
stutters here and there so so without
further ado let's get started
so right here I have brand new it's
alien isolation the Nostromo edition for
the PlayStation 4 and this is available
across all platforms from the Xbox 360
ps3 ps4 of course and the Xbox one and
also on the PC as well so we're gonna
unwrap this bad boy real quick here and
we're gonna go over the box look at the
details and see what's inside as well so
it's give me a second here
and there you go folks and let's flip
over to the back and it's give me a
second I'll zoom in for you guys and
here goes the back for you guys and you
guys can look this over while I discuss
some things here
I just wish games really went back to
what they used to do was basically give
a description about the game just give
kind of a backdrop of what the story's
about at least and not so much about
their awards and nominations and that's
great you know but like I said we really
don't know what's going on here so with
a little bit of research regarding this
game here it is a survival horror game
it's not you're running gun action type
of game you play as Amanda which is
actually Alan Ripley's daughter from the
first Alien movie and where the time
frame set with this game here is Amanda
is looking for her mom after the first
incident after the first Alien movie and
then this game sets about 45 years or so
prior to the second aliens movie called
literally aliens directed by James
Cameron so I get to survive a horror
video game and you basically have to
survive against this one alien that is
in the station and you really have to
use a lot of stealth tactics the AI
supposedly for the alien is very
intelligent you have to be conscious of
what noise you make any kind of lights
that you may display the alien can find
you miscellaneous ly anywhere and
everywhere you can say so that's what's
your really unique and what's scary
about that this game as well it is a
nonlinear game as well so there's
multiple entry points to any particular
area or room and there's multiple exit
points in different areas and rooms as
well so that really creates this you can
say replayable value but also that
suspenseful miss I guess you can say and
that works really well again for a
sci-fi horror game whereas I guess that
is not linear so let's go into the box
here enough of me talking here and let's
see what's inside and what kind of art
we can look at here
all right so here goes the disk here for
you guys and let me just pop this up
here for you guys take a look at there
and put this to the side for you it
looks like on the back cover here is the
instructions or basically the control
scheme for your controller and up see
this for the PlayStation 4 you guys can
take a look at that and let's see what
we got here we got alien I'm sorry with
the that's no stromal Edition they do
give you a code basically to play as any
one of these characters again Dallas
Parker or Ripley herself originally from
the aliens movie all the alien movies to
be honest with you so that's in there as
well and let's see what's here basically
just advertising the alien movies are
available on the PlayStation Store
pretty self-explanatory and it's aliens
35th anniversary edition available here
so pretty cool and other than that
that's about it
so pretty straightforward there I hope
you guys enjoyed it let me know if it
was too detailed to not like I said I'd
rather give a little bit of meat I guess
you can say to an unboxing and at least
give you some kind of a story or
backdrop for this game and future games
of course as well
so it kind of entices you if you want to
buy the game or not since there's
literally no information on the back
here button that helped the channel out
here subscribe of course like and more
importantly if you can share this video
it does help me and bring you more
content like this as the word spread so
again this is Jimmy with Jim's review
room hope you guys appreciate this you
guys take care out there more to come
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
