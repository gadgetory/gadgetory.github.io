room welcome back to another buyer's
guide video this will be from $100 to
$200 and showing you the best value in
tech that I've personally tested on this
channel as always I place my affiliate
links down in the description below
click on those links for the most
up-to-date prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
the very first item provides you tons of
value when you compare it to the
competition I love my boys QC 35 and I
love my Sony 1000 X's both of those are
around $350 but if you're on a budget
this has the most value of any active
noise-cancelling headphones out there if
the Sennheiser 450 BT 10 C's they're
Wireless they have great audio for its
price range and they offer active
noise-cancelling fun nearly half the
cost the headphones are quality built
and offer someone Sennheiser's premium
feel as they're more expensive products
out there that when I weighed them they
are more than the lightest pair of ANSI
headphones that I have ever tested about
the same weight as a bose qc25 and these
Sennheiser PXE 550's now they are
foldable for stone and transport the
better life is up to 19 hours with anc
on or up to 25 hours with anc off the
sound signature is very balanced while
providing a good amount of detail and
resolution again the values in its price
they're going for $200 right now at the
time this video and they are the perfect
alternative to the other flagships on
the market check out my links in the
video description for the most
up-to-date prices now for the active
consumer or just someone wanting quality
wireless earphones in general with water
resistance get the chamber extras that I
have right around my neck here they
retail for 130 dollars but their
performance
sounds like a pair of $200 earphones
with my testing I'm getting about eight
and a half hours of better life
Bluetooth of range was confirmed great
and possibly the biggest reason why I
would buy these or get these the audio
performance jaybird includes their own
app that allows you to tune their audio
signature to your liking and from my
experience compared to boasts an JBL etc
Jaybirds have been the easiest to adjust
and offers the least amount of
distortion a loss in audio quality
compared to the others when you do tune
them that they're very loud having very
bright mid ranges a lovely bass boosted
sound signature and with the ability to
go deeper with the app and the
soundstage on these for support wireless
earphones it's
one of the best tonnes of value on this
one I wouldn't be surprised if it did
drop he's down to $100 and some of those
holidays coming up here or any kind of
special sales even at $130 there's a lot
of value in these now next up I'm
someone cheating on this one but I had
to tell you guys both of these first up
is the JBL charge 3 is super rugged it
can handle the outdoors when spring and
summer is here the charge store is also
waterproof stain proof and offers up to
22 hours of better life and it's still
one of the best sounding models out
there the audio is direct it's bright
it's loud and for its size speaker has a
good amount of bass as well also it's
normally $150 the other day I saw it for
less than 100 here's a screen shot as
proof again I'll leave my affiliate
links in the video description hopefully
there's still on sale now looking at the
apps and the spectrum here tossing this
to the side B pulse 3 it's hands-down
the best looking LED lit speaker out
there now I'll admit it's not as rugged
because of its glass or plastic housing
but the trade-off you get to control
your lights a hundred percent of it you
can get into the app and make your own
animations or use the presets available
having this in your dorm room personal
bedroom even at your end table and have
friends over they're gonna talk about
this this thing is seriously cool now
the other benefits the policy offers 360
degrees sound and battery life on this
thing is rated at 12 hours substantially
lower but if you're planning to leave
this plugged in and indoors I think
you'll be fine now for those not knowing
what to get someone that Fitbit products
are always a good way or a good option
or alternative in my personal opinion
with the Fitbit Alta HR retailing for
$150 this counter steps records your
active moments and activities and new to
the Alta this year was the added feature
of having heart rate tracking I
personally love the Alta HR because it's
compact and a bit more discreet as you
can see here compared to the other
activity trackers on the market now its
water resistance both splash and sweat
proof that is sorry about that and
battery life is superb capable of
moderate use for a little over a week
without needing to be recharged able to
see your steps heart rate calories
active minutes and resting heart rate
throughout your day which wirelessly
backs up to your smart phone now my
biggest use is recording how much sleep
that I'd get every night or barely any
sleep and the quality of sleep as well
people don't often realize how useful
these features are
now last but not least these ten hazards
were more of a balanced audio sound
signature but if you're looking for more
bass
either one of these are great but when I
tested these Sony's 650 BTS they sounded
nearly as good as my beats solo threes
and I'm saying
it's really really darn close retailing
for $130 but I did see them on sale the
other day for less than a hundred it's a
pair of headphones I would not pass up
on great value perform close to the
expensive stuff out there and head from
themselves are well built so if you can
spend a little bit more there are also
the xB 950 B ones with even more bass
they retail for a hundred and
ninety-eight dollars but click on my
link in the video description hopefully
there's still on sale I saw them a few
days ago for a hundred and thirty
dollars here's a screenshot again as
proof here the biggest difference
between these and the 650s the
nineteen-fifties allows you to control
more bass and I do have the 950 and ones
which includes active noise-cancelling
but when I tested those it didn't
perform as well as not even close to be
honest with you
so save your money and get the B ones
instead both headphones or Wireless both
offers great - decent better life at
650s I believe they have up to 30 hours
of use while the 1950s have up to 18
hours of use either or I tested both of
these and if your bass heads these are
the way to go
so that's it folks for this price list
let me know in the comment section down
below what other items you think I
should have added on here I can only
test so many products in a week so I
know I'm missing something out there
either or at this list does have tons of
value and all these items are parts i've
personally tested again I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room and I'm here to help
you make that purchase decision you guys
take care and I'll see you on the next
one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
