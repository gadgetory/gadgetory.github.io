you guys doing you guys doing well just
got a new package here all right there
we go
that looks better all right so package
water from Amazon don't recall what I
got here but let's see do an unofficial
unboxing for you guys but don't try try
to I'm not no promises one of these
vlogs
again it's I call it the road to 100 so
hopefully hitting a hundred thousand
subscribers by the early of 2016 January
February so we'll see and let's see what
I got in here yeah look what I got
saw that they came out with one and try
to reach out to them and um kept saying
that they would send me one but they
never did so let me just jump jump on
this and give it a shot myself it
doesn't matter but I still got the h7
chest strap which I'll be using with
this and also still have my polar m400
sport watch as well fitness tracker
nothing's been badass I really love it
polar really makes them do a really darn
good stuff but I'll give this shot but
what I need to do I actually got to pick
up the baby pretty soon here it's almost
5:00 and I'd do a little bit of filming
again that's why I got the tripod and
the camera here and it lets it go and
I'll show you what I what I'll try to do
we'll see if it works
all right folks so the idea behind the
scenes here I am running to Starbucks
and I'm trying to film this review in
part by the time you see this vlog here
the review is gonna be already out it's
the noise hush earphones that I had for
like the last two years or so so August
is somewhat of a slow month
unfortunately next month September
should be pretty badass tons of stuff
coming out a lot of people ask me about
the specific Bluetooth speaker of course
the Samsung Tab s2 Apple's coming out
with stuff so again besides uh talking
about that what I'm trying to do is in
some of my videos you see me film you
know in public locations and not every
time it goes so smoothly you know
sometimes people don't appreciate not
people but the businesses I've
unfortunately come up to me and say hey
this is private property you can't film
here and tell me to stand at a distance
or go somewhere else and it's really
unfortunate but right now I'm actually
going to Starbucks and I'm gonna try to
get a really quick shot of me I'm
pretending to be on the laptop with my
earphones on and that's gonna be of
course in a video it's gonna probably be
like a five second clip but I'm driving
out there right now it's it's literally
across the street from me I can see it
and that's just one of the Starbucks
maybe out of two that I'll be stopping
by today still won't see like it's gonna
be like a quick five second clip and
let's see if that we get that shot I'll
take you guys inside once I get there
all right so Starbucks number one didn't
work out they were absolutely no seats
whatsoever so that means I need to go to
Starbucks number two and Starbucks
number two is
towards the city inside the city and I
was hoping to get some luck on this one
this one is right next to University
it's actually across the street univer
two universities right there and you
know there's a lot of more college
students I think they'd be more
accepting of me bringing a camera in
there usually with the adults I notice
that they let's not give me the you know
the mean mug okay so we're at Starbucks
number two here I'm going through the
back entrance let's see if this works
out
hey guys so this is just a really video
of me kind of behind the scenes I guess
you can say I'm just trying to get a
shot hopefully I'm not disturbing anyone
and of course the business as well I do
respect them I do understand that it is
private property or commercial property
yes
but overall I'm really good I took some
shots up here as well if you did see the
review you see me sitting out there and
the the lawn chairs or the wicker chairs
and tables and whatnot but guys this is
really one of my very first vlog so I
don't do this it's not easy for me I
suck horribly at public speaking that's
why I for the most part you don't hear
me freestyling or talking directly into
the camera when I do my reviews it's
just not as polished I guess you could
say but I'm given a shot and hope you
guys do like it in the meantime if you
can't in the comments below write down
questions what just any questions ask me
anything those AMAs whatever you call it
- and of course look over the questions
and in the next vlog which I'll try to
do next week I'll try to answer as many
as I can so feel free to drop a comment
down below and we'll just wrap this one
up
I can appreciate everything you guys do
currently at about 75,000 subscribers
again on the road to 100 you guys take
care all right and that's a wrap folks
that's it for today got the footage that
I needed just putting everything into
the car right now I've got to go pick up
a little girl bought up that wasn't too
bad at all that was kind of packing this
one - a pretty good amount of people but
got me a nice seat in the corner and
excuse me here oh no there's two
gentleman next to me and they're really
chill about it really cool they didn't
say anything but obviously I was right
there with the camera the tripod and
whatnot so man it is hot out there think
it says it's 95 degrees right now so
alright but anyways I got to go pick up
my little girl it's 6:30 which is right
on the dot I might be about five minutes
late she should be around
corner from here and that's about it you
