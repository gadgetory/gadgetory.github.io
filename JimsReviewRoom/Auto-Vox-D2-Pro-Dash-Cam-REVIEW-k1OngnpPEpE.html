newest gadgets we've been looking at
here in the studio has been dash cams
and today I want to show you the auto
box d2 pros this one retails for $80 but
Jimmy purchases off Amazon for $60 at
the time of this video as always I'll
place all of our affiliate links in the
video description down below click on
those links and they'll give you the
most updated prices in real time I'm
Jake this is James review room and we're
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
what comes in the box is the camera
itself an 11 foot power adapter and the
user manual the build quality from the
camera is when it's as expected it's
lightweight but it still doesn't feel
cheap on the back of the camera there's
a 480 by 270 resolution screen and it
does have a matte finish so you won't
have to worry about any Clair or
reflections coming off the screen the
cable included is a cigarette lighter
cable but it has a 350 milliamp hour
battery inside and that's four times you
need to disconnect the camera and plug
in a phone charger or any other device
instead around the outside of the
dashcam you see you'll offer cable
inputs and the micro SD card slot you
have a mini USB to charge the unit a GPS
out for connecting to a compatible
module and a V out to connect to the
cars built-in display and a mini HDMI so
you can view recordings on a TV the d2
Pro doesn't come with a GPS AP or HDMI
cables so you will have to provide those
yourself and the camera doesn't have an
internal memory or a supplied micro SD
card so you will have to purchase that
on your own
and it is important to note that the d2
pro manual states that it can't use a
micro SD exceeding 32 gigabytes but in
my testing I found this true except for
with Kingston micro SD S or I had a 64
gigabyte card work thus and this one
that I originally tried did not the
camera chords in to three or five minute
segments and will overwrite the oldest
footage once it fills up the auto box d2
Pro has plenty of buttons they include
the power menu up and down to navigate a
mode selector an OK button and finally a
small reset button for rebooting the
system to keep the camera mounted there
is a locking suction cup after giving
the camera a couple tugs it does feel
pretty sturdy you should know that cars
with heavily sloped windshields like the
one I was using the top mounted mini USB
did have quite a bit of bend to it but
it never became a problem for me the
ball joint that's used to attach the
mount does seem like the weakest point
so if you plan on continuously
remounting this you may want to be
cautious the camera is easy to attach
though and it didn't come loose during
any normal driving I'm not sure how to
do with off-roading but I can't imagine
any problems diving into the menu it is
easily navigated it's simple to get into
and change simple settings like time and
date this is also where you access all
the cameras main features you can turn
on g-sensor which automatically saves
and locks footage if it ever sensors
impact another it's guarded parking
which will automatically turn on and
start recording if the camera recognizes
any shock or impact while the car is
parked
other features include the manual
exposure settings wide dynamic range and
the screen saver daytime footage from
the d2 pro is impressive especially when
you consider the price it produces a
sharp vibrant image it's 1080p footage
which is great and they can all be
easily viewed on the little display or
on your computer
license plates can be read and road
signs are hard to distinguish either on
the other hand while recording at night
you get results like what you see on
your screen now headlights can easily
blow out an entire image license plates
aren't readable and everything is
generally pretty noisy it is possible to
identify the make and model of a car and
the video is still usable but better
low-light performance would be ideal the
lens on the d2 has a 135 degree field of
view which is more than enough to see an
entire intersection or even just cars
right beyond you're a pillar it has a
wide aperture of f-18 I originally
thought it would affect the depth of
field but it doesn't affect it at all
especially not during the day everything
in the frame stays and focused pretty
easily the camera's auto exposure
settings were also really good never
letting a bright sky or a white car blow
up the entire image white balance was
the same the colors were always accurate
in all of our samples the camera does
come with a photo mode and this is meant
for taking photos after an accident
simple shots of license plates and
vehicle damage it was more than capable
the camera has a built-in microphone for
recording audio and you can turn this
feature off in the menu but the audio
coming from the camera is clear there's
no hissed at ik in the background you
can hear others honking and your own
turn signal but most the audio will be
drowned out if you have music playing in
review the auto box d2 Pro is a good
choice of dashcam the features that come
built-in and clarity you get out of the
d2 Pro is impressive it has great color
and the definition is good considering
the price keep in mind that the night
time recording isn't the greatest but if
you're only spending 60 bucks on a
dashcam these results should be expected
and I can recommend this unit for that
reason let me know what you guys think
about this dashcam is the quality good
enough for you
