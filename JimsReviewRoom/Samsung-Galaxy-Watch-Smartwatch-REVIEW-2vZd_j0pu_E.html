postpone this review by an extra week
mainly because the battery lasted much
longer than any other SmartWatch I
reviewed on this channel I tested this
three times just to be sure but I'd go
over my results a little bit later so
hang in there but the bigger question is
is the Samsung Galaxy watch in general
better than the gear s3 friends here and
is it better than any other SmartWatch
out there we'll find out now for
disclosure I personally bought the 46
millimeter size for $349 there's also a
42 millimeter size for those wanting
something a little bit smaller for 329
click on my affiliate links down in that
video description to purchase or to

time you never know where these things
Michael on sale having Jimmy with Jim's
review room and I'm here to help you
make that purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review now the new
galaxy watches once again large many had
loved look at the watch but many said
the casing the watch face etc was simply
too big for me I have small wrists but I
personally think if you're wear this
thing with confidence it's one
sexy-looking Smart Watch you can fit a
judge if you feel different and I don't
blame you guys either there's no denying
it it is huge
all I'm saying doesn't give it a chance
now Samsung might have addressed that
issue though by offering that
alternative 42 millimeter option that
might be the best call for most folks on
the fence but just keep in mind the
smaller watch has a shorter battery life
but the only issue that I really had
though on both watches it's practically
identical is how thick it was if you're
new to smartwatches
most aren't going to have the situation
where it does snag along the cuff when
wearing with long sleeve shirts so
office workers take that into
consideration but if that doesn't bother
you the look style craftsmanship it's
really top notch little watch strap is
waterproof so for a run or swim this is
the best bet I never had any skin
irritation or rashes breaking on me
and while I've worn this for the
Passover week straight prior to
uploading this video if you need or want
to replace the straps it's ridiculously
easy as it is tooless so jumping to
leather or switching colors is a cinch
during my time testing I've probably
smacked this watch accidentally against
the table at least five times or more
each time having me say oh damn
but despite those bumps I expected a
case even show more dings and such
there's only one micro scuff on the top
left of my smart watch here but
considering how bad I've slammed this
and how exposed the casing is it's been
very durable fine scratches are
practically non-existent even that
stainless steel buckle that rubs against
the table is intact from everyday wear
of course time will tell but this
already looks quite promising and what
makes a return is the rotating bezel I
love this on the last two generations
it's such a satisfying feel and sound
and when you use to navigate the menus
and screen it's such it makes it so much
easier I'll get into that a little bit
later then the only gripe and damn
there's really a gripe here being a huge
fan of the s3 frontier the bezel was
slightly better on the last generation
it's very minimal in my new year but the
teeth or the ridges along the edge are
not as pronounced so rotating the bezel
very casually sometimes when the finger
just glides across here but the bezel
doesn't rotate I have to take that a
little extra effort or consciousness to
push it over but listen all it takes is
a little adjustment in muscle memory and
give it about two days or so and you
should be fine it's not a flaw but
something you might take notice when you
first get this home now finish up on
durability the Galaxy watch offers
military-grade certification meaning
this can withstand drops from 4.9 feet
extreme temperatures dust shock and
vibration also water resistance takes a
huge substantial leap here by going as
deep as 50 meters or 165 feet and either
fresh or saltwater last year's model
could only go to one meter essentially
good for this safe end of the pool that
my end of the pool the buttons look good
and feels good the top right is the back
button here and mainly used to
navigating the screen when held down it
initiates Samsung pay store your credit
card on the watch and anywhere you see
this logo simply hold down that back
button select which credit card you want
to pay with and
tap your wrist when front during testing
it works great and fast cumbersome free
here and pretty cool to use once you get
used to basically paying with your wrist
my only issue though there are still
some places that doesn't offer the
feature for example at the gas station
there isn't her reader out there but
there's one inside the gas station kind
of defeats the purpose here so out of
the maybe 10 times or so I did happen to
use this the Samsung pay feature only
once did it network although the workers
said it should and directed me and where
to tap on the terminal it just wasn't
going through no idea why but I want to
be upfront about that now footage up the
buttons the bottom is the home button a
double tap brings up voice assistant
called Bixby similar to these Samsung
Galaxy phones well this is where I had
issues in the first several days to
first week of owning this Bixby was
absolutely slow and stuttering the voice
recognition was fine for short phrases
like what's the weather or open up my
calendar or I'll put up my settings with
longer sentences like a text message it
didn't register as fluid as I would have
hoped even with the watch up to my mouth
and speaking quite clear
sometimes text translated we're not
accurate after owning this for a little
over four weeks time to do a thorough
test here I don't know if they watch
needs to build up a cachet or learn from
my voice or not but Bixby does work much
faster and much more accurate now no is
it a how to present today not
necessarily but it's enough to get by
for most people I recommend giving it
close to two weeks to use to see if
there's any improvement and your end if
you have the same issues as I do please
comment down below
not only me but let the viewers know if
you had a similar issue or nuts maybe
hopefully I'm just the only one the last
button pressing that home button three
times here will enable SOS so whoever
your emergency contact information you
have entered in here they will contact
them your watch will also send out
whoops here your watch will also send
out your GPS signal and your location
now since we're on the topic of voice
recognition the Galaxy watch is still
one the best speaker film and microphone
combinations for taking phone calls if
you don't own a smart watch this is one
very handy feature when
my hands are tied up or I use it when
I'm driving cause comes in clear and
pronounced without sending echoey or
crackling voices across the the feed
there here's a quick sample as proof and
just like curiosity how does my voice
sound nice
so let me extend my arm as far as I can
away from my mouth and let me know how I
sound out the same volume
do I sound further away to us on raspy
it sound worse basically awesome already
that's all I needed thanks all right bye
now Samsung specs states there's a 472
ml and battery the average consumer
might not be aware of what that means
gsm arena another website here reports
there's 72 hours of mixed use with my
personal testing first go around for
more average use of checking email
deleting them every time they come in
here phone calls on my wrist and simply
using this to check time whether in
random notifications I surprisingly got
six days in eight hours that is
phenomenal for a SmartWatch here I had
to test this again just to be sure my
second go-around and being a little bit
more aggressive now I got four days four
hours and 13 minutes to be exact from a
full better until it officially
completely died I did her third test and
got five days in two hours at the end of
the day this is hands-down one of the
best if not the best battery life in a
SmartWatch and beating my favourites of
like the Huawei SmartWatch to beating
the Apple watch series 3 or technically
the series 4 in the issues Zen watch
three now finishing up before we get
into the watching thousand more unique
features Bluetooth 4.0 is offered on the
Galaxy watch with four gigs up onboard
storage you can transfer your music and
keep it right here on your SmartWatch
and you can pair this to a Bluetooth
pair of headphones or earphones and this
is perfect when you're going out on runs
or walks when you don't want to carry
your smartphone I've never had an issue
with it and it works great sorry folks
let's get into the actual use please
pause the screen if you need to hear
something watched dials available and
good news most of these free over time
and over several years they wash faces
quality and quantity have grown quite a
bit and there's a good variety the
screen itself is thankfully bright
enough to be seen outdoors on a sunny
day and a sensitivity is perfectly fine
same with the wakeup gesture the screen
stays dark until you flick your wrist
here and raise it and be display shows a
touch sensitivity has been spot-on and
feels as good as any other SmartWatch
out there with responsive commands if
you decide not to use bixby to respond
to text messages you can always scribble
text here on your screen and that
registers quite well for my tests other
voice recognition might not be 100% it's
still faster and the most efficient way
writing this out is simply an
alternative next up let's talk about the
user experience specs are on your screen
with improvements of the processor and a
bit more RAM only on the LTE model Tizen
4.0 comes pre-installed and I would
think the Samsung gear s 3 will
eventually get that update too but wait
and see now the following this is why I
love smartwatches I thought these things
were gimmick until I use one of them for
the first time and it's highly
convenient without needing to pull out
your phone these are some of the things
that you can do any notification any
that is that you normally get on your
smartphone you can see right on your
watch the app does not have to be a
Tizen compatible app now scrolling with
a slick and smooth bezel to your left
are all of your notifications I love the
fact that as soon as email comes in you
can delete them keeping your inbox clean
throughout the day if you have a logic
ham or a nest cam the home security
camera a little image of your home shows
up instantly when there's movement again
right on your wrist pretty convenient
rotating that bezel to the right here is
your weather with a swipe you can get
your hourly weather tomorrow's forecast
and what the next several days are going
to look like next screen is your most
recent apps to reopen moving forward is
Samsung health with your basics
displayed calories burned floors climbs
heart rate and steps taken the Galaxy
watch does track
sleeeeep although it might be a bit
clunky to wear throughout the night but
it is doable though moving on and your
quick contacts create a reminder and
browse your calendar now tapping on the
calendar everything is synced with
Google Calendar which is essentially
sitting to your Samsung accounts you can
view add edit and delete your events
next screen is your stress meter which I
honestly don't think it works so there's
times the measurements are different
from my Samsung phone measurements here
so one of the two could be off and
second there's times I am stressed them
out and it says I'm fine so who really
knows the next year in focuses on health
by sitting for long periods of time very
similar to activity bands the Galaxy
watch will vibrate and suggest to you to
perform some sort of movement to remain
active if you're finally doing something
through torso twist or leg lifts in the
office this might be a good reminder for
you
in addition Tizen now features many more
workout profiles that it can keep track
of and count for you but focusing on the
most popular activity that gasps your
watch is the perfect running companion
there's built-in gps and glonass and
from my testing in my area it's been
highly accurate compared to my phone's
GPS and actual distance rim you can see
your speed distance
heart rates pace which is critical and
of course your elapsed time and as a
side note the central health app is
highly underrated it's one of the most
feature filled fitness apps available I
personally would rank it second best
with Fitbit currently being first but
one last health bit heart rate tracking
it doesn't matter if I use polar or the
Under Armor chest straps they have
always been consistent with each other
inconsistent in accuracy over the years
and steady and consistent paced runs for
a rest-based heart rate tracker the
Samsung Galaxy watch does a great job
and stays very accurate to the chest
strap the deviations are usually within
two to three heartbeats and that's
pretty typical over in my years of
testing fit bits and Garmin's and other
various activity trackers on the wrist
now when I attempted to do more interval
runs of occasional running than slowing
down and then running again that's where
I see the watch slowing down a bit and
not being a
to keep up usually a minute in delay
with heart rate readings now getting
back to the watch the next screen are
your media controls as I mentioned
earlier you can sync your music on here
and play your tunes via Bluetooth
leaving your phone behind in the last
two on my particular watch is simply a
news feed to see my headlines while
sitting in the bathroom and the alarm to
wake me up in the morning or for any
critical events I need reminding of the
buzz Elm it is a bit faint it does wake
me up as I am a light sleeper but deep
sleepers who intend on wearing this to
bed might not be able to wake up there
is an audible beep though that does help
but it kind of defeats the purpose of
being a silent vibrating alarm last up
is add a widget which I'll skim over on
the screen for you most are dedicated
Samsung health displays if you're
focused on fitness this greatly helps as
it's a shortcut instead of opening up
the ass health of widget earlier on the
watch I think going through the settings
of course all these screens and prior
can't be moved around to your liking now
the last screen which is activated while
on your watch face with the home button
opens up all of your apps and using the
dial or your finger to swipe reveals
everything that you currently have on
the SmartWatch I play this a little bit
here while I discuss the next section so
what I didn't like so much about the
watch and I don't mean to beat a dead
horse but Bixby was the biggest nuisance
granted ever after several weeks this
seems to be working quite fine now but
Samson should consider continued
improvements in speed and accuracy
immediately to help stand out from
Google assistance in Syria number two
years later the app experience is
definitely growing though your face is
like hailing an uber managing your nest
thermostat from your watch on select and
newer BMW is owners having the ability
to see it how much fuel is left in their
tank to rolling down their windows from
their watch that's cool it's only cool
if I actually own a BMW but I believe
for the average consumer or those who
are into the Samsung ecosystem what is
what it does offer though it definitely
is enough if you want to go one step
further if this than that's abbreviated
for ifttt.com is a great place to
connect your smart devices with your
Samsung Tizen
look it up that's quite handy the only
quote flaw and I placed air quotes
around that is because common apps that
we are familiar with might not be here
one example I love Google Maps but
Samsung wants you in their ecosystem
understandable but there's no dedicated
driving app with turn-by-turn navigation
from Samsung you have to get a
third-party app called your navigator
which is three dollars in the gear store
or the other app called
here we go which is free but it's not
the same robust experience also
dedicated apps that my family is on such
as aloe or Google Hangouts or available
you can respond to them on the watch
like I said any app on the phone will be
visible here but there's no dedicated
app for Tizen you can't initiate a
conversation as there is no aloe or
hangouts available this is more of a
personal issue but considering how many
are on Google or even Apple apps won't
find cross-platform use here to just be
aware of that elastic conclude this
review does the Samsung Galaxy watch
overall feel faster than the last
generation or just faster than any other
SmartWatch it's fast and it has worked
perfectly fine overall Bixby again was
low sketch but compared to the previous
generation or the competitors it feels
as good as any other premium watch out
there I wish the new Tizen OS and the
faster processor would have made it a
bit more zippy but Addison still feels
the same it's great but nothing
revolutionary for the average consumer
so overall I believe this is an
evolution in smartwatches if anything in
evolution to the Samsung gear s 3 it's
still a great watch the battery life
alone can sway people's decisions I'm
purchasing this over the Zen watch or
the Huawei SmartWatch 2 and the fact
that there's the 42 millimeter size out
there this might open more doors to
folks who didn't want to buy the Samsung
gear s 3 because of its size but if you
ask me personally I would stay with the
s3 frontier I really love the look on
that one it was just enough for me but
if you haven't owned a SmartWatch before
the galaxy watch is one of the best out
there
I would only caution the bixby function
and hoping that it was just only me and
my watch that felt a bit odd but again
owners please be honest and transparent
help us out here did that issue happen
to you as well for non owners does this
watch look appealing to you
