room over the next year film seems to be
picking up in popularity although they
have been around for a while today I'm
looking at the HD ones in--are Wireless
that Sennheiser sent over for review
they priced at $200 making these quite
the premium price option what I'll do is
I'll leave my affiliate links in the
video description below click on those
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
so sit back relax and hopefully my
videos help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's review
go over the physical features this thing
looks quite exquisite it's premium all
around and the black plus red makes this
thing pop the leather up top is indeed
soft and supple very much different from
traditional plastics if you do value
styling and how our product feels most
will appreciate the details and the HD
one now looking closely at the earbuds
they look and feel to be painted on
Chrome I genuinely wish they felt a bit
more cold or more metallic to the touch
to complement that price tag and the
rest of the neck band that would have
made this headset complete in regards to
comfort these are in ear earphones which
means that the ear tips do fit snug
inside your ear canal those sensitive
two in ears I honestly don't think would
be bothered by them at all the packaging
offers three other ear tip sizes for
your convenience so fit should not be an
issue and there's no ear hooks or ear
fin as well to mess with which is highly
convenient I also found them to be very
comfortable very stable here assessing
these while walking and moving around in
the office stayed on perfectly fine now
I would not recommend these though for
running or wearing at the gym as most of
that weight is at the forefront a light
jog even causes the unit to bounce and
you can feel and hear the HD ones
bouncing off of your upper chest at the
gym if you do sweat though these are not
water or sweat resistant not saying
that's a negative for Sennheiser as
these are technically a lifestyle
product but I wanted to point that out
there these are not for earphones now I
was aware that Harvard Canucks mentioned
that the wired placement was a bit funky
and stuck out on either side of his face
I didn't mind that too much personally
though but the wire coming out is right
under the battery and the chipset here
because of this there is slight wire
chatter it's not bad but listening at
lower bottoms you will hear wire
movement when the wire rubs against your
clothing now having the wires come out
the sides or maybe at the top would have
prevented the wires from rubbing as much
not a deal-breaker but again something
to point out if you were to buy these
yourself and test quickly take a look at
the buttons they are on the inside which
I personally liked as it does keep all
the visible parts on the front clean
here reaching for the buttons was easily
accessible by using my right hand and
crossing it from my chest there but I
will admit the buttons could have been
easier to identify it takes a little
muscle memory or getting used to to feel
around here but a bigger raise or maybe
some texture would have made it a little
bit more intuitive
while back here there's NFC or near
field communication for easy pairing and
the last feature is a vibration motor
for incoming phone calls now when you
receive a phone call from the Left
controller will vibrate while the one on
the right doesn't the vibrations were
minimal and feeling however my music
does stop and then I can hear the
vibrations actually coming to the wire
so in turn it does work but not
necessarily a hundred percent the way
that it was intended the vibrations
could have been maybe stronger or maybe
located in a better location for me to
feel a phone call performance was good
as my voice came across clear and
distinct however the left module again
if touched or when walking the audio of
me moving can be heard by the person on
the other end also background noises are
picked up quite easily as well so last
up here the HD ones do have bluetooth
4.1 testing this at 40 linear feet
proved to have no issues at all
whatsoever with my Samsung si+ regarding
better life Sennheiser is claiming up to
10 hours of use which is good yet
average it's right in the middle of
where other over the neck earphones are
but enough for typical everyday use with
my testing at 50% volume I was able to
get 10 hours and 20 minutes to be exact
and right before jumping into the sound
test San Houser does include a carrying
case which is very nice here it does
have a pretty large footprint but to
make up for that it has a very slim
profile perfect for travelers now
jumping into the sound test what you
might notice at first is the sound stage
left and right audio channels are very
much apparent and the distance of music
is easily distinguishable I loved it now
base for my interpretation was neutral
clean not a bass boosted sound signature
and not too recessed either if you're
needing more bass sennheiser does have
their own app which i'll discuss soon
moving on to the mid-range frequencies
they're not bright nor boxy the
mid-range very much complements the rest
of the frequency spectrum one feature in
the mid-range once again I did notice
the earphones having a decent amount of
fidelity and detail not the best but for
sure better than most
others on the market vocalists are very
articulate and string instruments can be
heard being plucked as for the highs
this wasn't its strong suit in my
opinion it did lack some sparkle at the
very top end here especially when you're
listening to rock music snare drums
those cymbal crashes and high guitar
riffs did not stand out here as much as
I would have to light now one thing I
almost forgot to mention
they're testing for sound leaking that
is at 70% in violent sound leaking still
kept to a minimum and did very well here
as for a passive noise isolation because
these are in ear noise isolation did as
good as other in-ear earphones blocking
out the outside world but jumping to the
app quickly here this is free from the
app in play store and can be used as
your default music player there are some
profiles which works best in adjusting
the audio that you want as for the
custom EQ settings I attempted to
increase bass but it does feel quite
limited here there was a slight boost
but deeper or lower resonating
frequencies were not available
attempting to give this higher mid or
attempting to boost the treble and
higher frequencies didn't have much
response either now this isn't an apples
to apples comparison but using Jaybirds
equalizer for example here with the j4
earphones those adjusted phenomenal with
results the average consumer can take
notice immediately I wish it was the
case here so there you have it folks I
hope this review helped you in some way
