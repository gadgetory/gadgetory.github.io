by James review room now today we'll be
looking at the Nabi dream tab HD 8
currently as of this video
ABI has 4 tablets in total ranging from
$99 to the current dream tab of 269
dollars and if you're in the market for
a tablet for your child Nabi is the
leader in offering kid-friendly content
with strong parental controls in mind
and this tablet does more than just
provide videos to watch games to play
there is a dedicated learning system
with a reward system for learning a
chore list and several other features
which I'll go over now hopefully with my
video this will help you decide if this
is worth the $269 or not so without
further ado we'll get started
now just like the rest of the Nabi line
it comes in its signature protective red
silicone sleeve and I'll admit it's not
as thick as the Nabi 2 I reviewed last
year's Christmas but it should protect
against minor drops and scratches now
underneath you have the plastic
construction painted in pearl white and
without the protective case maybe was
still thoughtful enough to include these
pegs on every corner so if your child
places this facedown the tablet's bezel
and glass screen won't be scratched the
new comes in with a 8 inch screen and
overall measures 9.3 inches wide 6.3 9
inches high and point 8 3 inches thin
now the dream tab also comes in weighing
at 4.1 pounds which was a bit heavy for
a tablet considering most premium
tablets today on the market weighs in at
about 1 pound now for an adult it's not
bad at all but for say a six-year-old I
would imagine he or she would leave this
at a table or have it set in their lap
for use but overall with my experience
the tablet is still very well built and
feels durable
going over its button layout you have a
3.5 millimeter headphone port through
the far left here with a microphone
right next to that far right has your
power and volume rocker buttons and then
rotating to the right has a micro SD
card reader that you can expand your
memory up to 32 gigs which is a huge
plus the very bottom at first I thought
was an HDMI port but it's really the
Nabby connector for charging your tablet
with the supplied wall charger on the
bottom left here houses a stylus pen
which is unique to the dream tab only
which no other ABI has the pen is
provided for an emphasis on being
creative with drawings and sketches and
now more on that later though now the
very front here houses 2 speakers which
for our tablet actually does well not
the best quality but again for a tablet
it's not bad at all they're just loud
enough for personal use with minimal
Distortion now the last several features
are a 2 megapixel camera on the front
for your kids who take self-portraits
and moving on to the rear here a 5
megapixel camera with a built-in flash
and these pegs in the back here are
meant to install accessories you can buy
from the Nabby store and you can
personalize it with little pictures of
your choosing or in this case in this
video here you can purchase the entire
alphabet to attach an a/b also sells a
little kickstand for $20 that might be
useful as well now going into its
contents the dream tab is filled with
things to do going over the very basics
first when a child is in their user
interface called
navi mode they have access to the tile
based apps and icons and there's three
web browsers that I've counted which I
have no idea why they put so many in the
first place now the first to the Nabby
web and the Foods website which is
several pages over are limited to what
Nabi has put on there now reviewing the
experience the Nabi web was the slowest
performing web browser and I wouldn't
call it a web browser at all as its
limited to its content that you as a
parent can't add your own web pages the
food web browser is basically the same
thing it's a little bit faster has
different content but again yet limited
the last and most true web browser you
can say is located on the menu button on
the bottom simply called web here you
can click websites already placed in by
the Nabi or you can add more by tapping
the Add button here a child can't add a
website themselves and only a person
knowing the parent password can only do
so
but besides the web you have a camera
that they can play with you can also
save music on to your microSD card and
play music right off of that and the
filing pages I'm showing here has many
episodes of their favorite cartoon
characters now not to mention some very
good interactive games that focuses on
their colors shapes and abcs now there
are some other games on there as well
where it's a bit more entertainment than
interactive learning though and lastly
the entire movie turbo from DreamWorks
is also pre-installed on the tablet as
well so overall I really think there's a
lot to keep a child entertained with
what's pre-installed by Nabi but what's
more important I want to go into detail
what really sets this tablet apart it's
the education aspect under university
basically offering such areas in math
English science and social studies with
some subject areas going up as high as
the fifth grade and surprisingly there's
a lot of content an example if you click
on math there's five different topics to
choose from for the kindergarten level
from counting to shapes now click on
either one of these topics and you can
see there's many modules for our child
to practice and go through and after all
the practice there's a quiz for your
child to take if you desire to do so now
the other learning system that Nabi
markets that's much more interactive and
much more entertaining in my opinion is
the wings system with whimsical music
and more vibrant colors and characters
your child goes through lessons via an
interactive map it works well in the
lessons that are available for pre-k
seems fine now this might be a downfall
and but it seems reasonable for Nabi to
implement this but once I change my
child's education level to kindergarten
and even all the way up to the 6th grade
you have to purchase more modules
typically a dollar ninety-nine through
the Nabi store so just be aware of that
there's no lessons pre-installed for
grades kindergarten and up but on the
plus side with the wing system after
each completed lesson of course getting
answers correct they collect stars and
the stars are then exchanged for Nabi
coins it's a virtual currency system
earned when a child completes a lesson
or finishes a chore and their chore list
more on that very soon though but with
the coins your child can go into the
treasure box app and with those coins
they can purchase additional apps games
content etc now as a parent you can buy
more coins with real cash to further
use for the dream tab here for many
years down the road but having the
ability for your child to learn or
basically earn stars I'm sorry and
translate them to coins I believe really
teaches your child hard work and the
reward that comes with it and as I
stated earlier there is a chore list
that their parents set up and throughout
the week as progress is being completed
the parent can check off the kids
accomplishment now in turn one chore
completed equals one Nabby coin earned
and what I'll do next is go into parent
mode where I can access the chore list
to customize you can add a wide variety
from homework responsibilities to
household chores to do something
longer-term like graduating from the
first grade now if it's not on the list
you can easily add one yourself and name
it anything that you want and just to
further expand on parent mode here it's
practically a standard tablet where you
can download almost anything from the
Google Play Store as you normally would
with any other tablet you have access to
Google Chrome calendar and Gmail with
entertainment options like Netflix
Flipboard Pandora HBO Go and YouTube
just to name a few
now games for both the Nabi mode and
adult mode ran perfectly fine on my end
here but in regards to overall
performance and just a heads up though I
ran into a lot of freezes a lot of
frozen screens when I first started
playing around with the Nabi and the
video playback had some hiccups where it
would pause and then resume play now the
system update for me was about 470
megabytes which isn't too bad but for
some reason it had taken over an hour to
download it probably close to two hours
and I have fast internet in the house as
well but once downloaded this isn't a
date I believe made the system run that
much more smoother than originally
starting and testing the range in the
Wi-Fi in the dream tab was a bit sketchy
at timed as well sometimes it's fast and
sometimes it's slow now in addition at
the time of this video the tablet is
still very new I guess you can say and
there are some features that are not yet
available as well so one of those items
is the dream pro studio the dream temp
selling point is offering your child to
express its creativity with drawing
pictures tracing being the inner arse
that they are while strengthening their
hand to eye coordination learning about
collars etc it's a great concept as the
approach studio is where I would see the
stylist coming in as being the most
beneficial now using the stylus on a
regular basis was okay you navigate
selecting apps etc but after using
Samsung tablets that offers a stylish as
well depend on the Nabi dream tab didn't
feel as smooth as I'd like almost
sometimes the Nabi doesn't register my
swipes and movement as well instead I
would go back to using my fingers and
that was basically more ideal now the
last server features which really is
beneficial to the parents you can set
parameters and time limits for your
child you can set a time for how long an
app or a game can be played for you can
even set up the dream tab to go to sleep
after a certain time period or a certain
time specifically letting the dream tab
shutdown itself without the parent doing
the dirty work you can say and all this
can be monitored as well you can see how
long your child has been learning versus
just playing games you can see their
progress on learning programs etc maybe
really again focuses on parental
controls as much as the content for the
kids now the last of our items I want to
mention testing the battery life playing
with the tablet and trying to learn its
features setting this up etc a tablet
from a full charge died after 4 hours
and 57 minutes of news so overall the
tablet has some great promises but did
have some performance issues
surprisingly and I hope by the time you
see this review most of those issues are
gone with the system updates the Nabi 2
was a hit last year and I know a lot of
parents really liked it at this time the
Nabi 2 content wise offers similar
nearly the same things as the dream tab
but yet 50% cheaper in price and I
really like the idea that the dream tab
comes with a stylus to indeed supplement
your child's learning and creativity but
I just don't understand why they would
release a product at this time with
features stated coming soon again by the
time you watch this video hopefully this
will be available and I wouldn't see why
not though now with all that being said
the dream tab at this moment is the most
up to date in regards to its technology
operating system Ram processor and even
the screen is the best looking screen
compared to all the other nap is
available a navvy product I believe is
really great if you're in the market for
a kid's tablet now if you're able to
wait though a Nabi 3 hopefully should be
coming out soon and at that time you can
see which one is more beneficial to you
so hope this review helped you in some
way and if it did all I can ask is if
you can please share this video as these
videos do take a lot of time to put
together find me on Facebook or Google+
