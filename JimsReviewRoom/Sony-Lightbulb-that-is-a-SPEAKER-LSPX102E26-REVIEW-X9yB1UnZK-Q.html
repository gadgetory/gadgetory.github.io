room Sony's life space UX is a very
niche part of Sony's product lineup I
reviewed their $100 LED lamp that
doubles as a Bluetooth speaker love the
look love the style and the build
quality was exquisite and most of Sony's
product do look good already but the
life space UX feels as though they push
one step further for me the pricing is
beyond practical but for those who want
something unique or can appreciate form
and function ingenuity basically the
price tag might not be an issue clearly
this product is not for the average
consumer so with that being said I would
like to introduce you to the sony LSP
x10 2e 26 also known as the LED bulb
speaker the LED bulb speaker is quite
subtle they fit into your standard size
light sockets they don't need additional
power and the bulbs themselves do look
very modern as mentioned in its name
there's a little speaker on the end of
the bulb here and going with little
touches to supplement the design you see
these sony logo right on the driver now
you also get this wireless controller
that sits on your table or desk it's all
plastic which is unfortunates having
some sort of metal casing would have
been icing on the cake now the
controller is able to increase or
decrease in volume while the button up
top allows you to pair pause and play
the button on the bottom allows you to
switch between audio modes either stereo
or mono if you have two of these bulbs
on at the same time now unfortunately I
didn't find there's a way to skip or go
back on songs now there is this rotating
scroll wheel that allows you to dim your
soft white LED the only issue I found
with this I appreciate a dimming of the
white LED which cast a nice warm color
but having the option to change its
Kelvin temperature to something lighter
or cooler would have been ideal we don't
get that the metal button allows you to
toggle into color mode using the same
scroll wheel you can choose a wide
variety of options and there
as good as my philips hue bulbs now the
colors are very ambient though and not
as bright to create or cast a nice glow
of color a nearby furniture or walls
that's very subtle and although I can
control brightness for the whites I
can't control brightness for the colors
which is a little bit odd
now with the song pal app provided by
sodium available for both Apple and
Android it's the same functions as the
controller but I also have preset
patterns which can pulsate to the beats
to volume or have them go through
several colors based on time now the
last feature is there is a timer that is
available for it to auto off basically
ideal for those having the lights and
audio going on before bed so jumping
into audio performance the Sony speaker
does use bluetooth to play music
wirelessly
I tested this and was able to get up to
56 linear feet before the bulbs started
to cut out the Sony speaker gave me a
very subtle performance overall almost
emphasizing that less is more the audio
output is clean and clear though and
ideal for more again subtle casual
listening at times it's for having
ambient music around the house rather
than an audio output to jam out to
having two speakers pair and plate at
the same time does help a decent amount
here with the ability to fill up a small
room that is but not knocking on this
sense the speakers are very tiny and
built into the light bulb to be fair but
for those who might be considering or
interested in buying I just want to give
you guys that heads up now my analogy
for this product it's like going to a
three-star Michelin restaurant to where
the dinner is very expensive and one
meal could be a one square inch piece of
sear tuna nothing big nothing over the
top here if anything the emphasis is
very small but once you taste it it's
subtle but darn good no fancy sauces not
over-seasoned but something in its best
natural form it's a similar experience
with a speaker small elegant very
expensive and once you experience it you
see it provides clean audio the light
source when looked directly at it does
look nice and everything offered is safe
and again the key word here in this
entire review has been subtle clearly
this product is not for everyone and for
the average consumer there's plenty of
other bulbs on Amazon that are
significantly cheaper but for those who
have the money to spend those value
branding
named Sony it's a design piece with some
functions that would complement your
lifestyle and by the way I've never been
to a Michelin star restaurant just to
clear that up so that's it for this
review hopefully it helped you in some
way be sure to LIKE and subscribe if you
haven't already and I'll catch you guys
on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
