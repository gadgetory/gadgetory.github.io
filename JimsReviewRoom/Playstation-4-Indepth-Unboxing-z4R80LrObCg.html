review room hope everyone's doing good
out there today we have the
much-anticipated playstation 4 and
before i get into my review and actually
start doing my test saying that i'm
running around with the system and
seeing you know how well it performs etc
actually just got this from bestbuy and
as you can see it still has the
playstation seal on here i have yet to
open it myself as you can see what I
want to do actually was a really
in-depth unboxing I normally don't do
that on my channel but because again
this is the PlayStation 4 I thought it
you only need a little bit of you know
extra treatment here so I don't do again
an in-depth tour i'm going to show you
around the box you can fast forward of
course to see what's inside the system
but again i'm going to go over the box
just for those some enthusiasts out
there and definitely those playstation
fans out there so what we have here um
of course is the front with neck we got
do from assassin's creed her destiny
watch dogs which is unfortunately
delayed until the spring of 2014
unfortunately it's not a day one release
here and of you got you get the guy from
infamous as well what i notice well as
soon as I stepped into best buy and saw
the boxes was it's very much more
thinner I guess you can say from the
previous generation PlayStation and I
know that's ages ago but he'll it's just
something up you know take note of it is
much wider again but it's much thinner
so that's the front there for you guys
and let me just roll to the back here
and the butt on the back is just the
system and the logo and of course the
controller as well all the systems this
year comes with a 500 gig internal hard
drive so that's pretty much standard as
well jet black no other colors and on
the other side of the box here I get
nothing too major but overall a nice
color scheme and whatnot it's know it is
what it is and then on this side here is
in sorry for the camera angles here but
it shows you what's basically contained
or inside the box for you and of course
like i said well get into a little bit
more detail on that as soon as i open up
this box run that that's about it let me
get the knife out here or key
or something we'll get right into it and
next week I will be having the xbox one
coming in as well be picking that up
from X by RF pick it up bring that up
from bestbuy as well so here we go guys
first time opening
there you go guys and first up here of
course we'll get all this the boring
stuff out the way PlayStation Plus codes
give me a free 14-day trial other
features associated with the PlayStation
service as well so pretty cool okay and
that's basically about it I'm sorry it's
a playstation plus 4 30 days to play
online so sorry about that and let's see
here a quick start guide of course I
think plenty of people been playing
PlayStation I don't think they know how
to start that up here is the brand-new
dualshock 4 controller Wow okay and try
to get a little bit of a close up for
you guys so as holding in my hand sesame
just holding it right now it does feel
you know a little bit heavier towards
the end of the handles here and very
light in the front a touch pad itself um
don't have any texture is actually
pretty smooth mmm it's plastic basically
there's really I thought there'd be a
little bit of a texture just a you know
have some friction on you trigger
buttons itself oh well yeah it
definitely does feel like a like a
trigger I guess you could say on a gun
or so it's actually a concave here so it
does kind of fit the your index finger
so that's interesting l1 and r1 feels
the same yeah definitely l2 and r2
definitely feels a lot more subtle much
more fluid feedback here that feels
really good actually it feels longer
down here than the previous generation
PlayStation and I guess because the
joysticks they're kind of caved in a
little bit here it feels like my thumb
stay in there you know a little bit more
friction and a little bit more secure
while I'm moving two joysticks around
but again these are very first
impressions the d-pad is definitely
feels deeper I can definitely feel that
right now these buns square X triangle
circle still feels the same so overall
very interesting and I believe I have
the old playstation controller here and
I just put it side-by-side and let me
try to get into frame here sorry about
that guys and like I said I'm just
freestyling everything right now so I
don't have a narrative I don't have
anything planned here I'm actually just
talking off my ass here but old
controller new controller as you can see
lee said the handles does feel a little
bit longer and yeah a little bit more
weight on a new controller I can I can
definitely tell a slight difference
there let's see here yeah the the old
control it feels a lot more slim mm like
I can feel like my my pinkies like kind
of like extending a little bit further
there and then here once you go to the
new controller yeah you can definitely
feel like I got so much more grip here
where my pinky finger is yeah it
definitely does feel better I'll mitt
that first impression definitely it does
fit the contour of my fingers and the
new controller so much better so
definitely I really feel a huge
difference now like actually comparing
it with the old controller so very nice
I'll put that to the side for now that
okay so you got your mono headset which
they supplied and wow very thin water
though I'm really shocked about that
very thin wire not too impressed by that
I feel like it's not I feel like it
might detached from the actual earbud
here but none that comes with a little
clip and a three-and-a-half millimeter
jack for your headphone and we see if I
can zoom in real quick here there you go
but again the wire just feels really
thin I'm not first impression again let
me try to get it zoomed in again the
cameras just trying to auto focus for us
come on there you go again it just feels
a little bit kind of thin so I'm not too
big not too big on that and damn this
earbud looks huge let me see if it fits
in my ear mmm I'll be honest with you
this thing fuse humongo and you know
what it does not fit too well in my ear
it's in there but it's not snugged so
out of course like I said I'd subscribe
to my channel like this video and of
course likes it I'll be doing a review
on this prime trying to get it out
pretty soon so let's see we got the USB
cord that connects to the micro USB port
here on the controllers for charging of
course I'm sure there we go as you can
see that and and this is so I thought be
a little bit squishy just like the place
they should move but that's not it
either so we got that cord there C
power-chord very small so no power brick
it has an internal power unit supply so
that's very good in PlayStation fashion
of course very nice and I believe and
correct me if I'm wrong this is the
first time ever that PlayStation is
applying a hdmi cable which is basically
you can go on ebay or amazon and get
these four dollars now it's not even
expensive any more like what it was when
the very first PlayStation came out so
good that's nice for them to offer that
and of course I believe that is it let
me see here of all the little minor
stuff let me get the box out the way
PlayStation 4 wow this black piano
finish is gorgeous and I don't know if
how clear you guys can see that but
pretty amazing beautiful black finish
and as the funny thing is like this is a
I mean I don't know if PlayStation was
thinking about this but it's kind of
like a throwback to the original
PlayStation 3 where it was all black
piano finish now this thing is basically
one-third black piano finish with the
same black plastic that's on the the I
guess the most recent PlayStation 3 so
very intriguing here Wow actually looks
really nice it looks futuristic kind of
Android ish not the phone android but
kind of robotic looking I don't know
it's like it it does look like its
next-gen definitely but let me Steven
get it closed up for you guys okay tap
of course and see here so i guess in
person it looks really nice in the in
the video i guess i'm trying to look
over here it does you know some justice
i guess there's some air vents and of
course some markings here as well that
indicates you know this has you know
dolby the surround sound hdmi ports
bluray DTS by dolby there you go and
again some air vents in there as well
and let's see left or actually the
Playstations right side if you're
looking at this from the front and
nothing on this side just more air vents
no logos no not much wording here that's
really that means anything to us here I
guess you can say and the all important
part here is the back and let me take a
look at the back myself first Jesus
Christ the back looks like the back of
like a space shot or something I don't
know but
here you go guys he goes the rear looks
pretty badass
okay and that is basically at nothing on
the bottom of course I wonder like I
said I haven't turned the system on yet
but I know it's the very front here I
see like a small little power button
logo right there and then a is that an
eject button i believe yes it isn't it
it's an eject button and I don't want to
press on it I don't it doesn't feel like
a button so I wonder if it's touch
sensitive so that's something unique
like you said I'm there's probably other
people that's already way ahead of me
but again this is the first time of me
opening and touching an actual
PlayStation 4 for you guys so there you
go that's about it and just real quick
here I still have you know ran into the
other room here and got my existing
present-day not so next-gen I guess you
can say now playstation 3 so there goes
a side-by-side comparison and just give
me a second just move some things out
the way here yeah and that way you can
see what the size is there so that's
about it lined up right there so it is
almost if not exactly the same size from
front to back okay and let me see here I
don't want to put the ps3 on top of the
ps4 but yeah you're looking at
practically the same size you know what
for the purpose of this unboxing for the
purpose of YouTube let's see if we can
do this and I said I'll be very gentle
with this thing and
see if we can make this work let's see
here there you go folks so it feels
almost identically the same in size and
I don't have the measurements as of yet
like i said i'll get that into review it
probably protrudes a little bit more in
the front right here just by a little
bit it's pride I'm just feeling it right
now prob about a half an inch or so it
is not that much of a difference but you
as you can see it is almost exactly the
same footprint as the old or current or
whatever you want to call it the the
PlayStation 3 so there you go folks that
is the unboxing for the PlayStation 4
with all the components that comes in
the box for you and I see the power cord
here and then all the start of guides
are on the side but that is basically it
um hopefully this is as it isn't too
long winning for you guys and hopefully
it you know helped you in some way here
but again subscribe to my channel I'm
going to be play around with the
PlayStation 4 right now actually and I
am opening this pretty shortly here to
play and I just want to see how
graphically gorgeous this game looks as
well on this new system so pretty
excited i'll get those two running
shortly here and basically spend the
rest of night playing around and seeing
you know doing what a youtube
professional would do testing out
products oh I hope you guys have a good
night and again like this video
subscribe I will be having a review up
pretty shortly with what I find next
week friday again the xbox one is coming
out I will have that in-house I will of
course do an unboxing on that and
reviewing that separately and then I'll
have a third video that will compare
basically the ps4 and the xbox one so
definitely subscribe at least just to
follow up and see what I can present
