review room today we'll be looking at
the Fitbit force now this is an activity
bracelet that monitors your movement and
even your sleep patterns and if you wish
I've also done reviews on the previous
model the cheaper Fitbit flex and also
on the competing activity bracelet the
jawbone up now the Fitbit force is the
newest and has the most features in the
fitbit product line so we'll see what
those features are and if it's worth it
to spend the additional $30 over the
Fitbit flex so without further delay
let's get started I purchased the Fitbit
force for one hundred and twenty nine
dollars at a time of this review and
only two colors are available for the
Fitbit force both in store and online
and approaches mine and slate as it was
the only color to store at the time and
black is the other option now in the box
it comes with the Fitbit force the USB
charger bluetooth adapter for your
desktop or laptop to wirelessly sync the
device and lastly is the starter guide
advising to download the Fitbit app to
your smartphone or tablet now regarding
the size of the Fitbit only two sizes
are available through the force but not
to worry about the Fitbit has various
notches that ensures whatever size wrist
you have the band will fit and also on
the side of the box also has a wrist
measure guide to help you in your
purchase there in regards to putting on
the band when you first purchase this
the notches or holes are pretty tight
though
and on the first several tries it may be
a little bit too snug to snap in the
band however over time the holes will
stretch a bit and you'll develop your
own technique for snapping it in
eventually the process will feel natural
to you over time the holes does provide
just enough tolerance for it to snap in
more smoothly and from my testing it
will continue to stay secure the rubber
material makes it very comfortable to
wear all day actually like to wearing
this more than I did the jawbone up just
for the fact that 90% of the band is
thin in just a rubber bracelet now the
only computerized part lays behind this
protruding piece here in turn this band
feels ridiculously light - we're almost
at times I forget that I have it on the
only time that you would take us out is
to charge it with the supplied USB cable
and typically the battery does last
about seven to ten days on a full charge
I personally was able to achieve about
nine days the only news is I found here
like all the other band
that I've used they don't come with a
wall charger you have to plug this into
your desktop or laptop for charging now
going back to the band here the Fitbit
force is water-resistant washing my
hands in showering daily with asan found
no damage to the unit itself and lastly
in regards to his physical rundown the
band features this black strip here that
tells your progress numerically once the
side button is pressed now this is
something that neither the jawbone up
nor the Fitbit flex had with the
previous models you had to tap the band
and that's would flash to indicate if
you're close to your goal of 10,000
steps for that day or not and to see
your exact amount of steps for that day
you had to pull out your smartphone or
tablet
each time now what makes the Fitbit
force and more intuitive product our
steps distance walked calories burned
how many floors and your active minutes
are all recorded autonomously while
still providing a watch feature that
tells time so the idea behind this
product was simple instead of wearing a
watch and a workout bracelet why not
combine both so all that information is
actually displayed right on the bracelet
itself now I have to admit the Fitbit
force is very easy to use by again just
tapping on that side button from my test
the steps are calculated very accurately
as I have counted my steps and pace and
the floor level is very interesting as
well especially for stair climbers out
there the force offers a free app for
download for either your Apple or
Android powered device now most new
phones do support bluetooth but ensure
your smartphone or tablet does have
Bluetooth 4.0 to ensure the force does
work now once downloaded and installed
everything is now done wirelessly and
there's no need to take off the band the
app does record your steps and distance
walked how many floors you've conquered
the minutes you were very active and the
calories burned now tapping on any one
of them expands its categories on the
app this is where I found myself wanting
to do better personally I didn't realize
how inactive I was now I do work in an
office environment and sit in front of a
computer most of the day unfortunately
so hence my chart looks a little bit
weak here but sliding the chart over
reviews to break down throughout the day
and again you can view burn calories
distance and active minutes then because
of this chart it was like a reality
check for me where I needed to get in
better
health and like how a pedometer works
the Fitbit also monitors our sleep
through movement during the night now
once I'm in bed and ready to snooze the
night away
I opened the Fitbit app and tell the
band I'm going to sleep as soon as I get
up the next morning I told the band I'm
awake in a summary chart of my night's
sleep displays now throughout the night
it tracks your sleep restlessness and
how long you were actually up now as I
said in my previous reviews it's a great
way to monitor if you're getting a good
night's rest and if not you can adjust
your thermostat maybe adjust the
lighting even napping a different and a
different mattress and comparing your
results to optimize your deep sleep now
other features on the Fitbit app include
food and drink intake which is a huge
plus when it's combined with the food
plan built into the app and the system
provides step-by-step instructions and
how to lose weight by recording your
current activity then recording what you
eat and I'll let's demonstrate that here
now setting up the food plan as you can
see after I input my current weight then
I would input my weight eventually
desired now I'm presented with a plan
intensity it's nice to feel though as a
system it's kind of like holding your
hand throughout this process now
regarding the plan intensity for example
I can choose the medium intensity plan
which advises if I follow this regimen I
should lose about 10 pounds by January
22nd of 2014 so after I set up my goals
on a daily basis I would just need to
record my food intake now I access the
food log through the calories eaten
category on the home page and simply
select a meal of the day
again this easily finds the meal that
you've inputted for you
and one of the downfalls I have to
mention though the step meter food diary
and sleep log they weren't as detailed
as a jawbone up the up actually had a
section after inputting your food you
can also view the amount of sugar fat
and protein taken the fifth bit only
recorded calorie intake and for sleeping
the up broke my sleep down to light
sleep deep sleep how fast I fell asleep
in and how long I was awake for the
Fitbit force only had the time I was
asleep a time I was awake and how many
minutes in total I was restless and the
information in the up was just a little
bit more easier to read and easier on
the eyes with more information in
general it makes me more of an informed
and health conscious individual
the last feature which isn't mentioned
too much is that you can log-in your
physical activity manually such as
jogging weightlifting even carrying
groceries or auto body work can all be
recorded as burn calories
now if tapping on the calories burned
category on your main home page there
that's where you can type in the
activity that you performed now the
activity provided offers an estimated
calories burned by doing such action
which will then be calculated once you
return to your home page and it's a
great way to compare the amount of
calories that you've taken versus the
calories burn just to balance yourself
out to a healthier you so all in all
it's real easy to use and the app
software does more than just track your
steps and sleep which it does
automatically as long as you're wearing
it with your interaction and commitment
you can log in your food and water
intake and workout sessions now if you
have friends with the Fitbit flex you
can compare and compete with your
progress within the app now another
feature is a vibrating alarm as well and
you can set up an alarm and wake
yourself up from a vibration on your
wrist without disturbing those around
you so in my opinion both competing
activity bands have their own pros and
cons the force and the Flex is a very
comfortable and subtle device to wear
while the jawbone up was a little bit
more of a chunky device and required
manually syncing the data however the
jawbone up does have so much more to
offer in its free app though like more
detailed breakdowns of your activity
exercise and daily consumption of food
and lastly the force for thirty dollars
more than the Flex and the force being
the same price as the jawbone up though
I believe the force is worth it and
worth purchasing because of its
additional features and I don't have to
wear my watch now Mike progress is now
on me and vailable without taking out my
phone from a jog and now it records my
stairs or flights of stairs that have
jogged up or down the food plan works
great in my opinion and it will work for
you as well if you're serious about
recording the data on a daily basis
so overall the Fitbit force is a great
device and on its own merit again it's
$130 at the time of this review while
the jawbone up is also one hundred and
thirty dollars so that's it for my
review of the Fitbit force definitely
