review room welcome to another review
today we'll be looking at the successor
to one the best sounding portable
speakers for 2013 it's the Bose
Soundlink speaker 3 it's a wireless
Bluetooth speaker that has its own
battery pack inside so you can play this
anywhere without any wires the sounding
3 is priced at $299 and BOCES website
claims this is their best performing
bluetooth speaker so far so without
further ado we'll get started now sound
like three still has that favorable
narrow design making this easier to
carry around and put into your bag the
speaker measures 10 inches wide a little
over five inches high and one point
eight nine inches thick make this
preferable than some of the more bulky
competitors out there it's still a bit
heavy they'll wing in a little over
three pounds but the weight does give it
stability and a feeling of a substantial
product the sound like three is wrapped
in aluminum with plastic running on the
upper and lower bands and I did apply a
decent amount of force on the front
metal grille and the aluminum didn't
dent nor any structural compromises
occur you can tell that sounding three
has the same build quality as the
previous one still a very rugged and
solid build all around
now all buns are located on top the
first being the power button to the far
left then the Bluetooth connectivity
next and although this is a wireless
speaker you have the auxiliary button
for physically plugging in your device
for sound and then further right a mute
button and volume buttons to follow and
all buttons are now covered seamlessly
with a silicone coating to prevent dust
buildup
now rotating to the rear the unit does
provide a three-and-a-half millimeter
port to physically connect your device
to play audio next is a micro USB
connection that's only for servicing and
upgrading the firmware inside it's not
for charging though and lastly is the
port for the supplied wall charger and
regarding the battery battery life has
increased by thirty percent instead of
eight hours of news up to fourteen hours
of use is expected when fully charged
and that's a huge number and at the top
tier amongst its competitors the only
downfall that I see here physically it's
missing a supplied case like some of the
other manufacturers provide even in last
year's model which I have here has a
built-in magnetized cover for protection
and carrying and it also folds to become
a stand
however stand or not the unit stays
upright and takes the same effort to
knock down nonetheless it's a small
nuisance and hopefully with the
following sound test it can prove again
this year this speaker is still worth
the purchase and price tag so what I'll
do is critique and then with the unit
cannot play summer songs and give you my
verdict afterwards first up is time
flies rendition of Jamie Foxx's alcohol
G coz I got it I get so so smooth like I
got it on tap yeah and I'm a shake it be
a good night while I'm on my gangland
while I'm drinking Bud Light can you get
it when you miss me
like I'm with whiskey drinking Jim Beam
me baby do you do it do it that way do
you do that did you take a brain you
know that I'm a beast when I kill it on
a piece like a six on the beach like
it's Malibu juice in the Caliph
but a little don't do it he does it
you're so fun I'm gonna leave it all for
tonight and you got fixed up to the
nines let me show you pressed up in
black and white and I'm dressed in the
dress you love is swing it in the air
tonight let me show you and there you
have it folks I hope you enjoyed the
sample there from these great artists
and all their information is in the
about description below now getting back
on topic here of course music heard in
person is much more clear in definition
so for me recording the sample from the
speaker and then you're playing the
sample and your speaker's now are
possibly not the best conditions but
hence my review here Bose again I
believe did an amazing job and just
being honest prior to the previous sound
like speakers I always thought Bose was
overrated I don't know about the other
Bose products but the Soundlink series
and this one especially again leaves the
bar pretty high for other Bluetooth
speakers to compete now during my tests
I play all audio on maximum audio from
music had no hisses and tinging on the
very high notes so listening to this for
some time shouldn't be an issue
snares cymbals and down to the singers
clarity and voice is all apparent in
regards to the bass compared to other
Bluetooth speakers this one still sounds
very good because the Bluetooth speaker
sizes they will provide a slight
vibration to the room or even in your
chest however for a Bluetooth speaker
this speaker still provides more warmth
and depth compared to the competitors
I've reviewed
from my tested movies I played The
Hunger Games to listen to ambient noises
in the forest to even the audience
cheering as the actors presented
themselves again just fantastic for a
Bluetooth speaker high in fidelity and
that active voices are very distinct and
environmental sounds are evident as
everything walks way the footsteps are
very clear scenes of the actors eating
dinner you can hear the Civil War
distinctly being placed on a serving
dish and clanking around alright she's
Marilyn all right my father buys her
squirrels
he says she hits him right in the eye
every time now I don't want to compare
too much to the Soundlink speaker to the
reason being the selling to will
eventually be discontinued but for those
wanting to know how much better this
speaker is I'll tell you I've replayed
music and scenes of movies over a
hundred times at least
alternating speakers at different volume
levels to different distances just to
see if I can hear a difference in
general it usually doesn't take me that
many tries but the audio quality is very
close to the previous generation they
want an only distinct change I've
noticed was this sound like three well
no question Phil larger rooms in areas
with no issues it's significantly louder
than a sounding - and a sounding - is
loud enough for me though but at times
assembling three I had to turn down the
volume if I stood too close to the
speaker it did not sound bad
it was just not at a comfortable level
at least for me the minor differences
were found more from movies I just
noticed that the auto having more depth
as I stated earlier you can hear minor
nuances and ambient noises and scenes
that were not distinct again in the
previous generation so if you have the
second generation like I do it's still a
very good speaker if not my second best
speaker after now the Soundlink three
the only big factor for considering
spending another three hundred dollars
and getting the latest sound link is if
you want the amazing increase in battery
life now if you don't own one selling
three is a fantastic product you can't
go wrong with it even though some of the
design changes were straying away from
the previous and I'm serious about this
both again sets the bar for other
companies to be in Bluetooth sound
quality so I hope this review helped you
