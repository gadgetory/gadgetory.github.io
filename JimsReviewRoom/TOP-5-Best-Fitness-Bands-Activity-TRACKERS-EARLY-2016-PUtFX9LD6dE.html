room I know many have asked and I know
some have been waiting for this for some
time but the time has finally come
I'm giving you my personal feedback on
the top 5 best activity trackers on the
market from budget-friendly
to best all-around tracker that I
experienced to one that I specifically
used for running and biking as always
I'll place the Amazon links in the video
description below so that way you can
see what the updated prices are today
considering prices are fluctuating a
good bit at the moment but jumping
straight into this number 5 starts off
with the jawbone up to priced at $99 now
job 1 has been at this for a while and
has refused to change its key styling
which isn't bad at all
their signature build remains offering a
very discreet build and one the simplest
and thinnest designs available if you're
not a fan of big bands or straps and
don't need the time to be displayed on
your wrist this is a great option the
clasp on the other hand that locks the
band in place I'll admit is somewhat
finicky but jawbone has provided
alternative styles to alleviate the
issue but where I do see job of making
up for this matter is the supplied
application don't let the colorful and
vibrant screens fool you though jawbone
is still one of my most favorite apps to
use because of all the features this
offers of course the band reads and the
app displays steps sleep calories burned
active minutes and whatnot but you have
a built-in food logger that breaks down
sugars fats proteins all within the app
there's no need to use a separate
third-party app unless you decide to do
so but there's gold settings
leaderboards and a competitive account
linking feature that way you can compete
with other jump on members you can
segment and log your workouts for sports
like basketball tennis weightlifting etc
and I'll admit this is hands-down one of
the easier apps to understand your data
and plan accordingly to adjust your
fitness goals and habits plus the app
again is rich in options and details
this app currently works for Apple and
Android devices and unfortunately no
Windows Phone compatibility or a web
portal to view your data just yet again
the link is in the video description
below for updated pricing now moving on
to number 4 the vivofit 2 from Garmin is
a heavy hitter for just $99 retail where
the job on products decided not to offer
on the band's
we decide to include here I did use the
original view fit and it was simply
amazing for what it offered at this
price point but being completely honest
I haven't tested the view of it to
myself however in a big however the fit
2 is similar to the first with the added
features like wireless syncing a backlit
display in audio cues for being idle for
too long when compared to the
competition at the similar or same price
the view fit band offers so much more a
watch style wrist strap that holds
secure and displays the time 24/7 the
better lasts up to an entire year versus
5 to 10 days on average for other bands
and it's also compatible with garments
chest strap if needed and they move bar
is always a great feature the garment
app has been revamped and offers an
easier platform to view your data the
app works on both Apple and Android
devices not to mention you can view your
info without a phone on the Garmin
Connect website overall this is a
perfect step up if you're desiring time
to be displayed on your wrist and a
great introduction into general all-day
tracking number three this deviates a
little bit and gets serious really quick
heart rate tracking has become some
pretty serious stuff and a filing ban is
more for the sports oriented individual
now I don't personally use it for all
day tracking but I do use it to track
specific activities if you're getting
into running or already a runner or a
cyclist and not just seeking an all-day
activity watch the polar m400 currently
priced at 179 dollars retail if you do
bundle it with a chest strap it comes in
at 230 dollars and this is personally my
go-to band when I do run or mountain
bike as it features built-in GPS for
very much accurate distance and pace
readings the m400 also displays the time
and never turns off offering a great
replacement for a watch if you want and
although it's always on the better life
is one of the best with at least 14 days
of use or more from personal testing a
great number considering five to ten
days is the average and most other
activity trackers on the market unless
this is one of the very few bands
offering the convenience of a microUSB
charging port rather than a proprietary
dongle now what I also loved about to
watch the data that shows on the band
itself helps tremendously during runs
and working out heart rate zones lap
times paced distance and speed are all
shown on here you can set up timers to
perform interval training you can
into your polar account online and set
up different workout profiles you're not
just limited to the ones that come stuck
with the the band itself not to mention
this is also water resistant up to 30
meters allowing you to swim with us on
this is indeed a more serious watch with
activity tracking capabilities if you're
a fitness enthusiast I think you can put
the aesthetics to the side and
appreciate the data that this can offer
and now moving on to number two and it's
getting a bit tight now although this
has been out for a while the Fitbit
charge HR still has one of the best
overall experiences for any average
consumer first the physical band is very
easy to wear here a fit enough profile
for most people to appreciate and the
band's width is ideal for a casual wear
all the way up to fitness inclined
consumers a big complaint that a lot of
my viewers on my channel had was that
other fitness bands were either too big
or just too wide it didn't look good for
females or just look - gargantuan to
wear at the workplace now I do admit the
features on this band itself isn't as
robust as the next activity band that
I'll be mentioning like full email
reading capabilities or the weather just
to name two out the blue here but Fitbit
makes this up with offering one of the
best apps available I've always believed
that with the data collected it's only
as good as how the end user interprets
it and how they can adjust their
lifestyle accordingly but besides steps
estimated distance and calories burn
being measured flights of stairs climbed
active minutes and coming back to heart
rate tracking here it's all measured
right on the wrist you can see a chart
of your heart rate throughout the day
and also throughout the night as well
and the performance in each run that you
have recorded in addition similar to
jawbone Fitness really provides a
holistic approach in food logging and
water intake it's all on here so you
don't have to register for another app
if you want the overall package of
all-day tracking the charge HR is a sure
bet and this leads me to my number one
tracker in the market currently if the
brand new garmin vivosmart
HR priced at $149 retail and now is a
very serious contender the band does get
a little bit bigger and resembles the
vivofit at certain angles but those
familiar with the view fit can attest
it's not bad at all - we're not even
close the reason why it's number one in
my list
the band is feature packed for its price
it has a super smooth touch screen it
works perfect in bright sunlight and the
newest feature here
our government for the first time is
introducing heart rate readings right on
the wrists again similar to the Fitbit
charge HR but not only that heart rate
zones are available right on the band
which is ideal for anyone training to
either lose weight or attempting to
improve their cardiovascular health in
addition this of course read the
essentials like steps taken floors
climbed there's active minutes calories
burned distance but the extra features
that just bump this up to number one you
can control your music pull up the
weather and receive notifications text
messages and emails all right on the
band and yes you can read all of it it's
not just a summary for the price this is
one of the most feature filled dedicated
fitness trackers on the market not to
mention you can also swim and shower
with this so water is no matter
unfortunately the Fitbit is only splash
proof and then regarding the government
app it did get a total redesign which I
mentioned previously and this does work
for both Apple and Android devices or
you can always log online with your
computer to Garmin Connect now on the
side notes I have many that write in
asking a very good very valid question
which is better this or the Fitbit
charge HR well from my experience Fitbit
does provide a very good band but it
also provides a stellar app experience
regarding garment it is just the
opposite it is a stellar feature filled
band but the app experience it is still
good but it is not the greatest
however because of what is offered on
the band and that new revamped app I can
see Garmin having a slight leg up in
features for these same price points now
you can be the judge
ready comment down below who do you
think Fitbit or Garmin who should be
first like I said it was very very tight
at the end so that's it for my top 5 but
one underdog or a bonus tracker that I
felt was really needed to be mentioned
and I didn't of course officially
including my top 5 here is the jump on
up move it's priced at just $50 retail
sometimes on sale for $30 on Amazon but
if you're looking for simplicity and
ease of wearing and the same essential
tracking abilities this is it the little
clasp attaches to your hip or your shoe
and it still tracks steps calories
burned the same sleep tracking that the
up to provides and the biggest perk
again the same job on tap which I love
on the job on up two and three is here
you get the same graphs charts metrics
and
data basically identical except for one
which is the advanced sleep tracking
that's only available on the up three
the up four not to mention it's also
splash proof and they better last up to
six months on a cell battery so hope
this buyer's guide helped you in some
way for a full review on each or their
updated prices again all the information
is in the video description below and
now I couldn't fit every band on here
and there's some very notable ones but
with the band's mention you cannot go
wrong as always be sure to LIKE and
subscribe if you haven't and be sure to
follow me on Facebook Twitter or
Instagram you guys take care and I'll
see you the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
