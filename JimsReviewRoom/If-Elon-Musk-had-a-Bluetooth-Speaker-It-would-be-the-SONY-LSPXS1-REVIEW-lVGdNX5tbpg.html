room what I'm showing you today is
something unique something that is
definitely not the average consumer some
can say it's a piece of art some will
say it's a contemporary lamp either or
this very much encompasses design with
function Sony sent over their live space
UX project for me to showcase and
although this looks like a contemporary
lamp it's also a Bluetooth speaker so
folks I'd like to introduce you to the
new Sony LS px s1 tested and reviewed
direct from Sony it is priced at a
whopping eight hundred dollars as always
I'll leave my affiliate links in the
video description click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time but jumping right
into this the glass sound speaker is
modern again it's contemporary it's
something you might see in Elon Musk's
home at the very top you have a very
soft and subtle passive bass redditor
and aesthetically it blends into the
product but when music is going you can
see a pulsating through the sound as
audio is being pushed up from the
speaker down below very similar to the
JBL speakers the entire glass enclosure
is meant to create this unique modern
look and I'll met it does look gorgeous
though in person one word of caution be
careful how to drop this there's an all
aluminum enclosure giving this se a
premium look and feel with a nice accent
of soft and supple leather now if you
look closely about a quarter of the way
up you'll notice the cone shape in the
middle look under here and you can see
the two inch woofer that fires down over
that cone that is getting a full 360
degree of audio output to the room my
only gripe though with the speaker were
the physical volume adjustments and the
LED brightness controls that are located
under the speaker making it a nuisance
to change now you can adjust the
function through the sony song tile app
from your phone as an alternative but
times you don't have your phone near you
you gotta flip this glass speaker to its
side the LEDs are indeed unique in their
own way so they cast a finely-tuned soft
light here resembling a glow from a
candle or a lantern in this
I mean Adam Thomas dark stairway
thinking it was the best way to show off
sony's glowing light but in the end i
thought it was cheesy I said let's not
waste any footage so here you guys have
it but all seriousness you can see it's
not meant to light up a room but if
anything meant to accent an area an
element it looks soothing smooth calm
elegant in a sense - but let's get back
to the studio here now going behind that
speaker there's your power input three
half millimeter port for physical
connections and the power and pairing
button to the far right there is a
built-in veteran lasting only up to four
hours though and then there's other
features does it get them out the way
it's NFC or near field communication
there's L DAC audio encoding to support
higher resolution audio files and you're
also able to double up or have two of
these glass Bluetooth speaker lamps here
play at the same time now wireless range
was tested with my daily phone at the
moment the Samsung si+ and I was able to
achieve 58 linear feet with one wall in
between so - the moment you've been
waiting for how does a $800 beautiful
sony lamp sound I'll play separate
samples for you guys and then I'll give
you my verdict afterwards nothing hey
when I take your findings
have you pass the ball pass down they
don't wanna run but you can't
I didn't know who you were
and there you have it folks
Sony's life space UX does emphasize
every sounding mid-range with my test
the auto characteristic is either very
balanced to at times pretty tame the
best Janna's for the speaker is
classical jazz and other such as John
was strong and instrumental and vocal
work the mid-range is clean there's no
question about that
offering a very easy to listen to very
smooth experience but it is missing
detail and resolution now bass is very
similar as well it's quite flat or
neutral mostly due to its small size and
there is quite a bit of roll-off that
prevents the speaker from making sharp
piano notes the cymbal crashes stand out
now this speaker is not meant to
personally jam out - not necessarily for
entertaining or filling up a room with
audio the speaker does lack a bit of
color and it's all your signature to
make it spin out for the price tag it
does elude me to expect something
spectacular but I did find it falling
short the practical side of me says for
$100 there's many other better options
out there even speakers at the 100 to
$150 price range but my artistic side
modern contemporary designs out of me
the aesthetics I love this thing and can
appreciate it in that respect guys down
below let me know in the comment section
what do you guys think of this I see
this in an architect's home an engineer
a designer but for an audiophile or even
someone just simply looking for good
audio there's better options out there
cheaper as well so that's it for this
review again I'm Jimmy with jims review
room and I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision you guys take care and
I'll see you on the next one hi
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
