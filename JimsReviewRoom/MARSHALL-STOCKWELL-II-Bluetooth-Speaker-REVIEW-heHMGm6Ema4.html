looking Bluetooth speakers on the market
right now this is the Marshall Stockwell
- they're an iconic brand in the music
industry they're known for making guitar
amps and such but how about the
Bluetooth speaker arena Marshall did
send us over for a review it's priced at
two hundred and forty nine dollars at
the time this video making this somewhat
pricey I will admit that but in the
realm of a more lifestyle product it
might not be too bad more than that a
little bit later as always being
transparent this video was sponsored by
Marshall their only request was to
disclose their unique features which
I'll go over but my assessment was not
altered in any way I'll be going over
both their pros and cons I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review and I'm here to help you
make that purchase decision
welcome everyone going over the physical
features first this thing was much
smaller than I thought this thing is
very portable it's really thin as well
just look at this side profile the
snackwell 2 also comes with the guitar
inspired carrying strap which looks
really good right here with that red
velvety lining on the inside now on the
front and also on the back here Marshall
did use a very solid metal mesh that's
I'm not till microphones on the market I
love the pattern and I love the look and
not only does it look good but it's
functional as well in protecting the
drivers behind here the entire body or
the rest of the body here is made of
silicone it looks and feels really good
in the hands the silicone itself gives a
very grippy texture there's also
reinforced end caps on every corner to
make this thing feel a little bit more
robust but keep in mind there's no drop
or shock resistant claims either
this is road worthy as Marshall puts it
but I'm sure it's against abrasion and
maybe some bumps here and there the
speaker is also IP 4 rated meaning this
can take on splashes from any direction
it can't take on water jet spray so
don't hose this thing down for the price
it would have been nice to have a higher
rating since other
granted they're not going for that
lifestyle look or so but they simply
offer more some of them can even be
completely submerged the splash
resistance might be enough for your use
with my testing of splashing water on
this thing it's been absolutely fine it
still functions let me know in the
comment section below is that enough for
your needs now taking a closer look the
knobs are also a nod to the music
industry and of course their amps the
knobs are very much quality made with a
rubber contact for your fingers here
making them ultra grippy but that click
feels ultra satisfying as you guys can
see on the screen you can make
adjustments on the fly as well for bass
and treble and that battery level
indicator on the far right here I'm
really diggin it compared to other
speakers that might have only one light
this year offers an entire stack and it
helps out big time now what you will
notice though this thing is lacking
pause play skipping going back buttons I
will admit that does stray away from
their amp design I know that's what
Marshalls going for but I think having
those buttons are very practical
especially for today especially with how
portable this thing is as well and if
you want to share the speaker having
others have the ability to skip and go
back on songs again that would be
convenient again something that you
would have to keep in mind as well now
rotating to the side there's a three and
a half millimeter port for physical
connections and then segwaying into
battery life Marshall went with a USB C
port this is a huge plus and I'm saying
it more often on my reviews here to kind
of remind you guys if you're spending
several hundred dollars on new devices
this year you might as well future proof
yourself by buying devices that has USB
C the Marshall is claiming up to 20
hours of better life on this thing based
on my test that 50% vine playing a
medley of genres I stopped at 25 hours
as they were still 50% better remaining
per this meter up top here I know we're
not at the audio test it just yet but I
will admit at 50% Vaughn the speaker
does sound quite low and I'm sure the
speaker would have blown that claims 20
hour better life out the water so I did
one more test this time at a very
respectable / loud and enjoyable 80%
volume and I got 19 hours in 26
it's worth of performance now this might
be the first ever Bluetooth speaker on
the channel that offers this feature
here the Stockwell - provides quick
charging just 20 minutes on that charger
and you get acclaimed six hours back
jumping into bluetooth performance
Marshall includes Bluetooth 5.0 this is
the latest Bluetooth technology has of
this video for those who don't know
jumping into signal strength it is
considered as excellence with me having
the ability to walk about 99% of my
apartment here without the signal
dropping the signal is going through
several walls and for a reference I'm at
about 1,100 square feet and a single
floor as well now testing the Stockwell
- on both Android and iPhone Netflix
YouTube and twitch that is played with
no syncing issues on either device
another positive in that aspect lasts
for Bluetooth you can indeed pair two
devices at the same time there's no need
to unpair one phone and then repair it
with another phone and maybe a laptop PC
what-have-you
that's another positive last but not
least there is no built-in microphone so
you can't take phone calls with this
which might be a bummer for some so
folks let's get into the audio test
before I give you the 3d audio sample I
don't think I mentioned this earlier but
Marshall is claiming to provide
360-degree audio how did they do this
since the speakers are only on the front
and on the rear here it's called the
Allan bloom liyan stereo sound this will
channel audio to be perceived as if
sound is blasting from all directions
which is quite impressive
we'll see how well this works coming up
alright folks again put on your
headphones or earphones to experience my
test and be sure to like and give me
some fire emojis down below here we go
she can't see you in pain your hands and
legs would you lean on me I catch you if
you fall
[Laughter]
and there you have it folks of course
audio recorded on my end and then play
through your speakers are not the best
depiction audio quality but hence the
following review here starting off with
how loud this can get
I'm usually playing this at about 75
percent volume and that's usually enough
to fill up a small room to about medium
sized open areas large open living rooms
and such will still have loud audio but
it's not as room filling which is quite
impressive for again such a thin speaker
I did notice though at 50% volume it
does sound very low between 60 to 70
percent that's good for casual listening
and at 75 percent and higher of course
that's enough to really get you into the
music speaking on bass performance this
little thing has a good bit of punch
surprisingly even standing slightly
further away from the speaker you can
hear the resonance from a distance
places near the corner and you get even
more bass reflecting and bouncing back
into the room now it's nice and punchy I
didn't experience any model mid ranges
or the bass itself becoming distorted
and with the bass nap up top here you
can add a little bit more bass it's
subtle but does increase the experience
slightly further unfortunately if you do
turn it all the way over you don't get
super deep bass instead it does sound
slightly fluttered and not as clean so
just keep heads up on that another
mid-range where most vocals and
instruments are heard by the human ear
they stand on their own and very much
have a presence as mentioned earlier you
can control how for do you want it to be
by maybe adjusting to treble a little
bit here but other than that I usually
leave it at number five up top on D
speaker and it's never underwhelming
it's never recessed and never sounded
boxy it's very clear very clean and
again adjusting those knobs do help
quite a bit
adjusting that bass does slightly warm
up the vocals a bit too now slowly
moving into the high frequencies overall
it's good but when you do pump this up
to about 75 to 80% loudness you can hear
the snares and tambourines and some rock
songs let's say for example start to get
lost up there they sound like they're
somewhat mashed together and you can
make the details at the slight nuisance
on what I think was majority and overall
good audio performance now sound stages
absent like most Bluetooth speakers but
regarding at 360 degree audio
surprisingly it works if you place this
in a middle of a room and walk around it
you generally hear the same vibe of
course the closer you are and especially
with the front speaker right here you
have a little bit more direct audio you
might have heard that in the sample but
let's say you have this outside and
entertaining in general when you're
walking around this thing you're mostly
getting the same audio so in the end
here I will omit it's not the Swiss Army
knife of Bluetooth speakers but despite
some of the missing features which are
typically found on Bluetooth speakers
you as a consumer have to ask yourself
do you need the full water submersion as
this doesn't have it do you need LED
lighting as this surely doesn't have it
either and do you need those pause and
play buttons is nice to have but can you
live without it do you think anyone else
would need to skip a song or can you do
it yourself again a lifestyle choice
overall what Marshall offered Bluetooth
5.0 no syncing issues quick charging USB
see a quality build here not to mention
that 360 degree audio experience overall
if you were interested in this Marshall
speaker I highly recommend it at least
give it a try and listen to how it
sounds folks let me know in the comment
section blow on what you guys think as
