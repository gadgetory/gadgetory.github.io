review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the clips our f82 tubes
floor-standing speakers we'll look into
the speakers construction and style
specifications and features and lastly
my pros and cons on its performance and
usage so before I get started here just
want to let you know that I am not
unfortunately an audio file or a huge or
big sound buff or sound guy take this
review as someone who either has you
know standard speakers or one of those
home theater boxes that you purchase at
Best Buy or Walmart where they come in
you know we have five speakers a
subwoofer and it comes with a receiver
those are great I guess for entry-level
if you just want some sound in your home
but if you truly want depth just
something to say WOW hat you do
definitely need to go with either a
customized home theater system we're
just going with true tower speakers like
the one this review if you want true
audio quality and sound I would suggest
to stay away from the home theater boxes
like I said they're anywhere from three
hundred four hundred dollars and some of
the range up to eight hundred dollars
and maybe even more I don't know the one
that I purchased at the time was a I
believe is about seven hundred eight
hundred dollars and I did buy it and
Best Buy a few years back and I did
upgrade to these clips so let's get
started here I purchased these speakers
as a pair from acoustic sound design
comm for $1,100 at a time and normally
retail is $1,200 it's very difficult in
my opinion to find a price lower than
retail in general these two tower
speakers they come in either cherry wood
grain finish or what you see in this
video the black ash vinyl and I gotta
make the black ash final is beautiful
it's a wood grain texture very modern
very contemporary look black matches
with almost anything so the dimensions
are nine point three inches wide forty
three point nine inches tall and sixteen
point three inches deep and each one of
these babies weighs in at sixty one and
a half
pounds now these speakers came out back
in 2010 and they are still current today
there's nothing to have replaced these
there's one level one level above these
speakers that perform better
it's the RF sevens and that's the
flagship reference series and the RF 82
2's in this review are at the second
best you can say in the reference line
the exterior features are the features
in general offers the track --tx horn
technology I think I pronounced it and
just basically think of it like a
foghorn or if you're shouting you put
your hands on both sides of your mouth
and shout it's supposedly offers more
crisp sounds less distortion and also
actually muses less power to give you
you know sound output
it also features these dual 8-inch
ceramic talaq cone woofers and they come
in a copper color again beautiful when
it accompanies the black finish
like I said just look at the video it in
my opinion so and I just love them I
just love the aesthetics on these things
it does have bass reflex via dual rear
ports in the back it is 150 watts RMS
and 600 watts of peak power and let's
start with the pros and cons here again
I'm not an audiophile so regarding the
performance I'm coming from the
standpoint of having a home theater box
into a profession I guess more of a
professional sounding system or a custom
sound system first off and most
importantly the sound is phenomenal I
can't stress that enough
prior repeat it again again the highs
and mids are clearly identifiable and
this clear in general you can hear
voices in movies distinctively without a
center channel you can hear just my new
sound details pin drops chairs and
backgrounds moving and this is just
specifically movies in music you can
clearly hear vocals different
instruments and sounds just in the back
that you did not normally hear with
either prior speakers or even you know
just generic headphones are in earbuds
now not only does these speakers pick up
faint noises but I do have to mention
the spatial sound recognition now I
purchased these two tower speakers first
I did not purchase the center speaker or
the subwoofer that you see in the video
the only two speakers that I had was
again the RF 82 to floor standing
speakers as you see and what I mean by
spatial sound recognition is although
its left and right channels you when you
play a movie that has surround sound you
can hear distinctly where sound is
coming from and you can hear from the
left side the right side the front when
people speak but you can also hear the
rears well pretty distinctly and in my
theory or thought it's almost like it
simulates surround sound just from these
two speakers alone so again it's
surprising but yet amazing in just what
these two speakers can do and most
people they do purchase just these two
speakers alone if they're on a budget at
the time I was I worked several months
to save up for these speakers and you
can start off with these two speakers
again the sound is so good that you can
probably take a break with these two
speakers and save up again to purchase
that Center and then this subwoofer in
general another pearl is just the look
itself I can't express enough they look
amazing I love the finish what I have is
the black ash as shown you can have the
grilles on or off sometimes when I do
kind of want to show off the speakers I
take off the grilles and the dark blacks
and then the rich copper and the cone
woofers just complement each other and
then my earth tone colors and the walls
again amazing I just love the way it
looks easy to set up two wires black and
white positive and negative nothing too
special about that
cons
I was a very few if any the base is good
for to floor standing speakers it's not
it will not give you earth-shattering
base and of course that's what a
subwoofer is for but again for the to
floor spanic standing speakers it is
good so if you don't have subwoofer
don't be alarmed you probably don't even
need one right away but you do lose out
on a little bit of immersion with the
lack of a silver in general the bass
could be a little bit more for floor
standing speakers they are good other
than that I double I don't see any other
cons the the legs the floor standing
speakers are strong stable and
supportive I don't suspect my speakers
from knocking over or flip it over so
that's it for this review I hope you
enjoyed this review of the clips
reference series the RF 82 to
floor-standing speakers now I do have
two other videos playing it on the side
feel free to click those they are a
review of my subwoofer and also the
clips reference series sensor channel as
