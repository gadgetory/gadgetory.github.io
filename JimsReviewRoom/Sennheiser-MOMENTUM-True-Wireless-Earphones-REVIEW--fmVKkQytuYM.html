video damn does it feel good to be in
front of camera once again listen I
bought a new camera stand and now we get
this top-down look that you guys have
here and I'll continue tweaking it to
make it look better over time but we'll
work with this for now so today I'm
showing you my test for the sennheiser
momentum true wireless earphones that
means there's absolutely no wires with
these things I'll place my affiliate
links down in that video description
below for you to get the most updated
prices in real time do you never know
when these things might go ahead and
sale also full disclosure here
Sennheiser did send these over for
review but my assessment was not altered
in any way I'll be going over both pros
and cons I'm Jimmy with Jimmy's review
room and I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review
all right folks going over the physical
features first the earphones are mostly
hard plastic with the Sennheiser logo in
very much Sennheiser fashion shiny metal
with texture and it does help to make
this look and feel a bit more premium
than many other more sport oriented
truly wireless earphones out there now
one thing that I will met though she's a
bit thick and I don't mind thick but for
earphones compared to many of the other
competitors you can see it's just ever
so slightly bigger I'll preface by
saying everyone's ears are a little bit
different and from my personal use in
the office to walk around the Sennheiser
do stay in the ears perfectly fine if I
choose to run with these thankfully they
don't fall out either but if you decide
to run with these they don't provide
that level of confidence like the j-bird
run XT is the Jabra 65 T's and the
others because I do notice the
Sennheiser is just ever so slightly
pulls a little bit forward for some
reason it's a very minut sensation is
not an issue though like I said I'd
never fell out of my ear but it is
something to take notice if you do own
these let us know down in that comment
section below for your experiences it
does help others with any Jim's review
room community now going over the
physical controls their touch sensitive
gently tapping or holding either
earphone down trigger some sort of
action for example holding down the
right side of my earphone gradually
raises volume while holding the left
lowers it down here's the list of all
the buttons on your screen feel free to
pause the video if it's going a little
too fast here now the only thing that I
would warn them if you are to readjust
your earphones like I'm doing right now
to make it more comfortable or the hard
time you may trigger Siri or Google
assistance or accidentally pause your
music now after a day I was used to the
earphones and then I stopped touching
them in general though the earphones do
provide very good passive noise
isolation not to mention very minimal to
almost non-existent sound leaking but if
for some reason you don't want to black
out the world Sennheiser does offer
transparency mode now with a double tap
on the right earphone like so their
microphones turns on and picks up the
audio in your environment now you can
use this for safety reasons or if you
want to hear what
going around you at work here now most
other air phones do amplify your
surroundings so you get superpowers that
is like being able to hear better than
what your ears aren't normally capable
of with these Sennheiser's it's
conservative compared to the competition
it sounds the most natural it doesn't
sound artificial which I don't mind at
all actually really do appreciate but if
you have music going on and transparency
mode is activated you have to play music
quite low to hear your surroundings at
the same time keep that in mind now
moving on the momentum truly wireless
earphones are able to take phone calls
from my personal testing it's one of the
clearest in the office when you're
around a quiet or maybe medium amounts
of noise it doesn't block out everything
but it does bring my voice to the
forefront and in those quiet to moderate
noisy areas it does suppress the
background a pretty good bit here now in
busier areas unfortunately just like
most earphones here it does pick up
background noises more noticeably but
again for these sanitizers it is one of
the better performers out there now as
for Bluetooth technology the momentum
true Wireless uses Bluetooth 5.0 so
thank you sanitize it for free to
proofing this thing basically the common
issue though I've seen on previous
brands where times the left earphone
doesn't sync with the right earphone no
my testing over the weeks that I've had
this I personally didn't have that issue
now the other thing the June preview
community is quite large now but every
time I review one of the things someone
always asked me if they can leave one
earphone in and the other one off with
these Sennheiser's I can leave only the
right one in and I can take off the left
one put in my pocket or so now if I swap
them out only leaving the left ear bud
or earphone technically in it doesn't
work if this is a must-have feature for
you I am reviewing the j-bert XTS most
likely next week and you can use either
one of them in your head in your ears
that is but getting back to you the
Bluetooth testing with video Netflix and
YouTube played fine with lips in audible
dialogue performing in parallel I do
recommend that you use these for movies
when you get a chance they do sound
pretty damn good here and last about
signal strength Bluetooth technology
bluetooth strength I'm able to walk 50
linear feet away from where I place my
phone in the back of your studio I
walked out into the hallway 50 linear
feet isn't so bad most average consumers
that'd be perfect
we find but compared to competitors I'm
getting usually a little bit better
performance last before I talk about
battery test these are ipx4 rated
meaning you can take a splash of water
from any direction
now I dripped water on this thing here
from my water bottle and it's still
working fine for my test if you want
protection from water sprays or
literally literally this drop into a
puddle of water and it's still fine then
you need I pee 5 or higher most people
are okay with IP 4 meaning if you get
caught in the rain you should be
protected with these 10 hyzers you just
can't submerge them in water now moving
on the case itself is very nice I
personally love the fabric look here let
me get this secret product I'm be
reviewing pretty soon here I haven't
seen where over the past month or so of
testing bees they've been in my bag but
pocket rubbing against other things that
I carry and it still looks really really
good also side notes they're magnetized
and does a very good job of holding
these earphones in the case as you guys
can see here drop jump drop nothing so
getting a closer look let's take a look
at the back here sennheiser is using USB
type-c thank you for future proofing
once again the case itself provides an
additional eight powers of power the ear
phones themselves provides up to four
hours of use so with my testing at 50%
vine I'm getting on average 3 hours and
40 minutes from a full battery to dead
so that sums up everything physical
about them going over the physical
features as well so let's get into the
audio experience now I have one or two
truly wireless earphones that I need to
test out and then I'll be doing my top 5
video pretty short here but for the time
being I can tell you that these
Sennheiser's are fair in quality
starting with bass these jaybird XTS
which is the other one that I again am
testing at the moment as slightly a bit
more bass but for somewhat relative
comparison you can tell that the
Jaybirds are actually a little bit more
bass boosted I don't mind that sound at
all I really like it but these
Sennheiser's are bassy but not
artificial in my opinion there's no
question enough thump punch Hecker
enough bass that makes any genre pop
Edie I'm hip-hop you name it it's clean
and it gets my head nodding when I have
vine bumping at boss
five percent the vocals are distinct the
key word here is very balanced across
the board I could use a little more
brightness or treble on the upper
mid-range to make this sparkle a bit
more from the factory settings but we
can fix that with the app which I'll
detail very soon now I think one of the
highlights is hands down these have a
wide soundstage audio separation
depiction of every instrument beat vocal
performance it's all there the mid-range
has good resolution detail again being
wide indistinct it's a very good
experience overall as for the high
frequencies it's never been ear piercing
never over reaching or crackling again
it could use just a little bit more than
my personal opinion but here let me take
out the app here and this has improved
it for me let me show you alright folks
let's take a look at the app as always
being transparent with you guys the app
was somewhat finicky at first I would be
paired via bluetooth with my phone and
the earphones functioned perfectly fine
I was able to play music use the
functions on the earphones themselves no
big deal at all but the app itself for
some reason could never see my earphones
after probably about three days of
messing around with it there was no
updates during those three days but
eventually the earphones started working
and they've never faulted or never had
issues since then so since it's been
working you do get battery life which
you can see here transparency mode is
right below and right down there is the
equalizer now although the equalizer at
first looked a little too simple for my
taste I'm honestly used to multi band
adjustments and such but after using
this the very subtle changes and the
adjustments do work one side basically
affects the other and keeps the audio
signature relative so overall you really
have ever user error or you can't really
just mess us up in any way of form and
on screen here's my setting I usually
leave it like right around here and
where it is right now compared to the
stock setting it sounds a lot better
just right around there so so last but
not least let me open up these settings
here and back out and go here so in the
settings in the menu you get smart pause
which means that whenever you take off
your earphones
music will pause automatically for you
that's an awesome plus then we have auto
accept phone calls and then voice
assistant access which is pretty much
self-explanatory so my entire experience
here it's been a very positive one if I
had to critique it would be this sighs I
wish there was a slightly a little bit
better battery life and honestly I wish
more wireless earphones would include
this but it's fine my ear phone action
within the app if I drop one of these
down on the ground or especially when
I'm outdoors it would be nice if these
can be pass ignore maybe on the phone it
will review the GPS I don't know I'm not
an engineer but for the price though I
think that's a really big deal in my
opinion and speaking of price if you
guys can afford these highly recommend
that you guys can give them a try most
of my viewers I would probably say wait
for them to go on sale and then
definitely definitely check them out I
think these you should not miss at all
again I'm Jimmy with Jim's room please
fire emoji up that comments section
we're on the road to 1 million right now
I'll catch you guys on the next one you
guys take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
