you guys doing good welcome to another
vlog there we go so I just dropped off
my little girl off at daycare and it is
flipping cold outside it is below
freezing I just below 32 degrees
Fahrenheit here for those here in the US
and it is all right freaking hand
numbing mind-numbing whatever and I got
to go for a run at this hat to test out
some products right after this vlog as
well but some things I want to address
birthday first things first is the
camera obviously you see the quality is
a little bit better than what I usually
take with my smartphone what I want to
do is eventually get a nice point shoot
a cheap point-and-shoot camera it has a
screen that flips up where I can see
myself and then we can film anywhere
where I go hopefully I can you know
stick it in my pocket it wouldn't be too
much of a nuisance and of course has a
microphone jack for this land earlier
Mike but I'm using that sounds much
better than if i did use the the roadie
mike pro on top of the camera but i
don't know just a commitment that i want
to make for you guys hopefully that's
coming down the road i want to push that
off to the side just for now it is a
thought but what I need to focus on is
my computer / less the last vlog that I
did I told you guys I need your help and
later in this video I'm going to give
you basically an idea of what I want or
need from the next computer from a video
editing purposes and whatnot so hope you
guys can help me with that on that I got
some new stuff obviously for review he
goes some behind-the-scenes stuff of
what is to come first up is the under
armour healthbox one of the fans and
Jim's review room personally messaged me
he said he was very interested in this I
looked it up and say hey this looks
pretty cool I know at the empty box i
unboxed it already but they got it comes
with the smart scale guys can see that
and it comes with a chest strap and it
comes with the under armour band
as well as the chest strap the under
armour band which I think I'm done
charging while I was driving a little
kid to daycare so hopefully that works
but that's the reason why I'm gonna go
jogging out in the freezing cold pretty
shortly r you guys notice i got the
another smart watch on as always at the
polar m400 the reason why i have that
out is I'm testing a polar smart scale
which should be coming up pretty shortly
here I'm almost done with that it's
probably my right my narrative pretty
soon but yeah so I got two smart scales
in the house right now that's so it's
pretty good to see how they both
function and work in this time trying to
put this band on other that in front of
me give me a second here I got these
clips earphones these are the r8 I
hybrids from clips these are brand new
this was i believe revealed at CES and i
want to give these a try these are a
little bit higher end I know you guys
are asking for some more affordable
items but I couldn't pass up on this and
you guys know i got these clips are f82
to speakers in the house as well alright
folks so those are on the calendar here
to be reviewed those so those clips
earphones here but and also got these
audio engine HD eight speakers that you
guys have you guys pricing in the last
vlog or two I just need to get a new
desk my desk my computer desk in the
back here is too short and with those
two massive computer monitors this would
block them so I just need to go to some
furniture store to get some cheap chairs
and desks and whatnot and set this up
properly of course for you guys have it
presented well and of course have a
station or air where I can listen to
these properly so this is next or on the
way coming down to in the next week or
two but what I really want to talk to
you guys about is again regard my last
vlog is my computer this is where I do
need some help I'm not as techy as I
used to be regarding pc parts that is is
because I just don't buy pcs so often so
I haven't been keeping up with what's
hot what's new today and what's reliable
today so the specs embody give you guys
are things that I need in general might
sound high-end to you guys I am just
trying to future-proof myself this is
just a specialist specifically for work
not obviously so much for gaming this is
for video editing I'm not doing for cabe
i'm working with a very high bit rate in
1080 with 60 p or 60 frames per second
but again i'm trying to future-proof my
computer so it could it would last for
the next five years or so if i make more
money down the road that'd be great then
maybe i can update my computer more
often going back to what i was talking
about is so a lot of these pc parts do
sound high end but keep in mind they are
for long-term purposes with that being
said the first thing I that need is a I
seven core processor from Intel
obviously I'm looking at the 6700 k it's
about four hundred dollars unfortunately
it's pretty high up there there's
probably the most expensive processor
that ever paid for a lot of people have
mentioned or said hey why don't you go
get the 47 90 k I'm sorry ting little
technical here the 47 90 k sounds like a
great processor it is about a hundred
dollars cheaper a little bit more at
times but I believe it doesn't support
ddr4 ram so next regarding ram i'm an
old school guy i've been using corsair
in the last several computer bills
they've been reliable obviously and i've
been using their power supply units i
might go with them again in the next
build i'm actually shoot them an email
to see if there's something that they
can offer i'm not a dedicated computer
channel so i don't know if they are
willing to help me but who knows but you
guys is where I need help who's reliable
today who's maybe better who works
better I don't know Lisa I'm old school
at i've been using corsair but recently
i've been seeing a hyperx amply kingston
makes them g.skill is a newer brand that
is newer to me that is of course samsung
is making ram sticks now so just let me
know who's a good brand of good and
reliability but more importantly i do i
need to know what's a good range in
regards to frequency and also latency
for the rest of my computer build that
obviously i'll be disclosing now besides
ram the next biggest thing is the
graphics card more than likely i'm going
to get the 980 TI from nvidia let me
know which brand is good you know Epke
gigabyte and i'm not going sli
I can't afford two of those cards but
next up motherboard my computer current
computers using gigabyte and the
previous bill that believe i used a sous
both them have been good i've been
paying around maybe a hundred and fifty
dollars or so for a motherboard so with
this bill since it is using some
higher-end specs I'm a up that budget to
maybe about two hundred two hundred and
thirty dollars or so so let me know if
there's a motherboard that you guys know
of a brand that you guys know if that is
reliable that is currently hot Lisa in
regards to reliability and performance
wise and features of course so shoot me
that one hard drive wise most likely i'm
going to be bringing over my current
samsung pro SSD air card already have
i'm going to put that into the new
computer i see one transfer it over
keyboard a mouse most like i'm going to
transfer it over so other vets i'm
trying to figure if i need anything else
Oh power supply units are briefly
touched on that with what I am trying to
get what wattage do I need I haven't run
a wattage calculator yet how much may is
800 watts good is a thousand watts is
that what I eventually need like I said
I'm not intending on going to sli
anytime any I don't intend on doing that
in the future anyways here tell you what
I'll put a template into the video
description and just copy and paste into
the comment and then just I just
basically type in what what you guys
recommend and that's about it so that
would be hella easier than what I'm
trying to explain for you guys right now
so that what you guys don't have to
remember everything that's about it
regarding this other things i want to
touch base real quick on is regarding
all this whole this money thing here
alright so regarding pay it's not it's
not a situation the youtube aspect where
youtube that company side the payout the
ad revenue what they pay per click what
they pay per thousand views i want to
get too technical on that has gone down
the back so let me just show you real
quick here here's my views I don't know
if it's going to be clear
that's Jim's review room right now and
that is insane I can't I can't believe
it so that's the amount of views that I
get and what I'm about to show you guys
is what the payout looks like this is
what we used to make over here up here
and you can see where it is today down
here and we're basically talking about
what a seventy-five percent drop in ad
revenues to compare to when I first
started so what I'm saying is that
regarding YouTube and where youtube in
general is going and it's not just me
it's every content creator out there
there there working harder they're
taking two steps forward and then
they're taking like one giant leap back
and that's where YouTube is
unfortunately going and that's injustice
the nature of the business Facebook is
start to dominate in video views
advertisers not seeing as much value
blah blah blah whatever so what I'm
saying is the money situate the views
have been going up which is great my the
brand the gyms review and brent is still
going at an upward trend things are
getting better which is again I'm happy
for and that's why I'm still doing it
and I'm able to survive like I said in
for those who don't know I do this full
time I do have a mortgage I do have a
little kid I try to take care of my
family as I'm sure that any parent would
try to take care of their own family so
if it youtube wasn't working out fit
didn't work it obviously I would have
quit a long time ago and go back to
corporate America but again youtube is
doing better and better and it just
takes time just takes that much more
effort that's why if you guys haven't
noticed I'm pretty sure you guys have
more folks are starting to you know
promote or do their own advertising in
the video so what I'm trying to say guys
I'm not going to do ads you know I'm not
going to say hey do skin care products
in in my reviews i'm not going to say
hey buy this product of my reviews I
want to keep my reviews clean what I
will be doing
is in my vlogs I will be doing those
kind of promotions so today's gonna be
the first one here and it will this
money goes towards the computer this
money will go towards buying the new
Samsung s7 that I want to review and
keep and keep only to do comparisons I
have the v10 which I absolutely love i
love the bigger phone i have the nexus
6p which has been good it's you know so
far to me but the s7 i want to keep in
other feature phones obviously to do
comparisons to make better reviews for
you guys and what pays for it youtube is
is struggled a little bit you know that
end the company YouTube itself is
struggling a little bit but for the
brand Jim's review room I need to do
these ads unfortunately I need to get
sponsored you know so they can pay for
some of these videos that would pay for
the items that i can buy so it sucks i
don't like ads either but it does pay
for the content you guys see and i hope
you guys can just support me on that
that's all and like i said the reviews
won't have those ads i still like the
clean look I don't want to diminish that
adds on the actual reviews so that's
about it first add coming up here is
from foreverspin com they take a
traditional spinning tap that we all
grew up with and make this really
sophisticated finely tuned metal object
and although a kid can play with this
working professionals that are very
analytical I would think would
appreciate the craftsmanship and the
precision it takes to make one of these
items now what makes this unique four
ever spin makes their spinning taps from
solid metal and there's cnc machine down
to a ridiculous precision that allows
for two tops to spin as long as it can
not to mention they do come in a variety
of metals as well you know they sent me
four different kinds here and it's
pretty cool to feel the weight that my
new yet different feel an effort needed
to spin each top as well now i have the
titanium stainless steel here aluminum
and cast iron they also sent in their
diamond carbon plates which offers a
surface that slick as heck here to
provide less friction and it basically
helps the top to spin even longer so
again thank you for the sponsor here and
this does have gems reverb to do more
reviews visit their website at
foreverspin calm
alright folks so there you guys go
that's basically it for the vlog here I
hope you guys do support me on this
endeavor again it does help me basically
get more items for the actual review
portion of Jim's review room and like
I'll try to basically just keep
providing you more content more reviews
that you guys do like and love and again
I just keep putting the bar up higher
and higher if I can so thank you very
much I of course update you guys along
the way regarding my computer and I am
off to go jogging in this very very cold
weather are you guys take care I
appreciate everything that you guys do
thank you for everything take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
