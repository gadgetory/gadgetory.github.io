review room so last week I was able to
get my hands and be Jabra Sport+ which
were more expensive bigger and the only
assumption that I had was it sounded
better than these Jabra steps now I was
completely wrong and they are indeed now
one of my worst ear buds that I've heard
to date and it's on considering Jabra
had made the Jabra rocks and they
sounded great so today I have the lowest
price wireless Bluetooth support your
buds from Jabra Jabra step priced at $69
retail as of this video and we'll see
how these sound and fit so without
further ado welcome to another review
going over the physical aspects first
these are built with very much
simplicity in mind the first thing that
you'll notice are the ear hooks are
really a gel tube with a cutout to run
the wires not a solid piece of silicone
gel or plastic they are detachable but I
wouldn't personally recommend this as
the wires are situated up top and does
pull down on the earpiece now that your
hook surprisingly does work despite it
being so light flexible and loose you
can say but more of my fitment and
comfort tests later now as for the
earbuds themselves there's no physical
buttons on these and again these are as
well super lightweight and feeling and
these are indeed sport earbuds being
dust and water resistant as claimed by
Jabra now on the right earbud is a
microUSB port for charging the step with
the supplied microUSB cable the controls
are actually located closer to the right
ear bud with volume controls up and down
and an action button in the middle for
turning on and off and pairing the unit
and answering phone calls as well now in
the packaging there's a total of three
silicon ear tips small medium and large
which works well for a $70 Bluetooth
headset much better than the Jabra sport
plus and almost as good as the $200
powerbeats2 they're not the type that
goes into your ear canal creating that
suction and holding that way like the
Jabra rocks or jaybird blue but X but it
sits on the outside of the ear canal and
it does a good job staying in place not
lifting off the outside of the ear canal
and then losing sound isolation because
of the ear tip design it actually
contours to the opening and then
actually blocks out outside noises
pretty well and helps create a bit more
immersion to the music that you're
listening to
so overall wearing these have been quite
a pleasure I was a bit skeptical because
they were so flexible but I personally
haven't had any issues with these
earbuds themselves jogging and of course
weightlifting these things stayed in
place for sure they are indeed so light
that I do forget that I'm wearing these
at times and having these on for several
hours I experienced barely any to know
wearing fatigue at all the only issue I
can point out at this time is the inline
controller does pull the wire to the
right shoulder and ear sometimes causing
a pulling action when you
in your head it's not a huge nuisance
but sometimes I do notice this issue and
have to readjust from time to time not a
deal-breaker in my opinion but something
definitely to point out and now moving
on to everyone's favorite part the sound
quality and let me just say these are
very very good for wireless Bluetooth
earbuds priced at just $70 now starting
with the base it's clean in my opinion
with just enough base to satisfy there's
just the right amount of thump and deep
base to make most genres enjoyable the
drummer rocks that I reviewed which were
more bass heavy almost having
characteristics of beats by dre products
it still provide a great audio and bass
if you're a bass head and deep into
hip-hop rap drum and bass etc but the
drop of step gives a balanced approach
without joining much of the other audio
fields per se again very impressed
coming from again a $70 set and
regarding the mid levels in audio where
most vocals reside listening to a
variety of genres from pop hip-hop to
rap to even more synthesized music of
electronic dance music overall all
genres are perfectly fine for the
average consumer now if you're not an
audiophile it'll sound great to you and
my channel does focus more on the
average consumer but for those with a
more peculiar ear these don't sound as
open as something more expensive choices
out there specifically the Jaybirds
Blubaugh Dex you do lose a bit of
clarity and that find my new detailed
audio and the singer's voice but as
stated these are very good ear buds for
the average consumer
you won't be disappointed in the audio
now the highs are good as well there's
no tinging and that high-pitched ring
found on high notes from cheaper earbuds
or headsets again wearing these for
several hours straight taking them
taking the ear buds off my eardrums are
not numb or ringing where I do need to
rub my ear canal a little bit there now
testing phone calls have been greatly
performed as well as other headsets with
audio quality on my end clear the other
and stating that it just sounded normal
I guess you can say and watching movies
these still performs good the
powerbeats2 had trouble syncing with
movies and Apple products and others
have noted this as well but the drop of
step does work with no problems
movies does good but again not perfect
as it does lack that
open and spatial field it sounds more
like mono sound rather than real
separates left and right audio channels
but again that's me being picky and
having tested other headsets on the
market now regarding range in a straight
line without any walls I was able to
achieve approximately 30 linear feet
sometimes at 25 feet or cut off in and
out a little bit button that if you're
gonna have your tablet or phone close to
you it shouldn't be a problem at all now
in regards to battery life charging had
taken just a little over two hours to
fully charge from a dead battery and
during my initial test during the
battery I achieved 5 hours and 28
minutes kind of a shock considering it's
more than what Jabra is suggesting so I
retested this again with 50% volume to
have an even base to gauge and I was
able to achieve 5 hours and 47 minutes
this time on my second battery drain
test overall better than what Jabra is
suggesting there's no other extra
features like some other earbuds except
these are dust and water resistant
there's no case that comes with these
which I thought was a bit lacking but I
guess it you can say it justifies the
price overall if you're looking for a
simple pair of earbuds great sound for
the average consumer and your budget
conscious as well no questions you
should look into these yourself so hope
