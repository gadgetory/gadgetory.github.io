review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the brand new fifth
generation ipad what Apple calls this
time the ipad air we'll see if there's
any significant differences that makes
this either a worthy upgrade or a
first-time purchase for those looking
for a tablet so without further ado
we'll get started the specific model I
have here is the 16 gig Wi-Fi only
version that comes in black and mine is
priced at four hundred and ninety-nine
dollars it also comes in white with the
same 16 32 64 and 128 gig configurations
I've had heirs with Wi-Fi and 4G LTE
internet are priced on your screen as
well and all models comes with the same
performance such as the same processor
the same RAM in screen resolution and
we'll get more into that a little bit
later in this review so let's go over
its physical features first my old iPad
is the same exact size for both the
third and fourth-generation iPads so if
you purchased a new iPad since march of
2012 you'll have the same dimensions i
have shown here now with this year's
model the ipad air comes in slimmer all
around at nine point four inches wide
six point six inches tall in only point
two nine five inches thin as you can see
a side-by-side comparison on the slight
differences that really makes a
noticeable change in feel to the device
in regards to fuel though the air is
twenty-eight percent lighter at only one
pound technically 469 grams while the
last two generations worth 650 grams
matter of fact from my research the air
is the lightest 10.1 inch tablet on the
market as of today and the air is
possibly the thinnest tablet i've
personally reviewed so far so when
holding on to the air compared to the
previous generations it actually feels
refined modern and even though a not so
jurassic change in size it truly feels
less bulky now although it's then the
chassis is all aluminum and doesn't flex
at all so overall in apple's fashion the
devices feels solid with no corners cut
now compared to the previous generation
models it's almost identically the same
physical layout you still have your
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
input and power button on top screen
lock and volume buttons on the side your
home button on the front is the same in
the new Thunderbolt 2 USB connection
here to charge your iPad and transfer
data to your computer and compared to
the previous generation models to
speakers centered on the bottom of the
iPad now the sound quality is still good
as the previous models but being in the
center does make the sound output more
symmetrical and not just from one side
there's still no distortion when valium
is at maximum so there's no tin unis on
high notes again they're very good
speakers for a tablet and lastly you
have a 1.2 megapixel camera on the front
that records in 720p resolution in the
rear having a 5 megapixel camera that
can record in 1080p both cameras are
identical from the fourth-generation
iPad and there's no upgrades there and
as you can see on the screen right now
our actual photos I've taken right from
the new iPad with no editing photos are
at random and consist of bright light
low light and also close-ups as well
still with this year there's no LED
lighting on the back of the tablet the
screen finally receives smaller bezels
on each side giving the tablet itself a
more tapered / slimmer look however the
screen itself goes unchanged this year
from the last two iPads with resolution
running at 2048 x 1536 which translates
to 264 pixels per inch and for those who
don't know they're more pixels per inch
abbreviated PP is the more density you
have on your screen meeting clearer and
more crisp content now with the reviews
I've done new tablets have came out in
the past month or two the higher screen
resolutions and PPI yielded no
difference from my experience the images
and this iPad or retina display looks as
crisp as the other tablets and I do have
2020 vision and I'm pretty peculiar when
it comes to display quality and content
so I want to emphasize for all new
tablets coming up consumers out there
needs to understand color reproduction
is possibly more important in today's
time now the previous iPad when
comparing to other tablets
my previous reviews showed slightly
washed out content now with the new iPad
air finally does the screen at least
slightly improves that skin tone and
color saturation skin looks a little bit
more realistic and not as pale and
saturation is more evident as you can
see this in the side-by-side comparison
again it's very minor and you probably
won't notice it yourself unless you
place them side-by-side but at least
it's in the right direction overall the
screen is very good from my comparisons
now moving on internally in regards to
performance and features this generation
houses Apple's latest chip it's a 1.4
gigahertz dual-core processor with one
gig of ram on board and currently runs
on iOS 7 now apple claims the processor
to be twice as powerful than the
previous generation and if you're
intending on using this just for basic
email web surfing and youtube videos the
air will no question run it flawlessly
and personally my third generation ipad
can run everything available on the
market right now however the air runs a
bit more robust and smoother for basic
day-to-day activities however the more
CPU and graphic demanding tasks such as
productivity apps 3d gaming and large
amounts of data processing in general
this is where I noticed a big difference
everything just runs so much faster on
the air as you can see on the screen I'm
running the toughest and most demanding
graphics test from 3dmark and you can
see how much smoother runs next to the
older iPad again the processing power
for your tasks where they're demanding
or basic the air will handle it no
questions asked in regards to batter in
usage apple claims you have up to 10
hours of better in life while using this
device now while charging I'd use my
wattage meter and found the air consumes
about 7 to 8 watts while charging so
that's not bad at all for those
considering of purchasing an iPad the
operating system is probably the easiest
tablet in use as Steve Jobs puts it in
his company speech way back in nineteen
eighty-three he wanted someone to pick
up a device and learn how to use it
within 20 minutes the ipad is just that
the interface is just apps on a grid
there's no widgets or multiple windows
running there's no large icons
extracting what you're looking at
everything is very uniformed and
collective it's easy access with all
apps laid out in front of you and
there's no need to fiddle with anything
then the homepage you can place your
most used icons on the bottom as I've
done here internet YouTube music etc as
you can see on your screen right now
flipping in between apps opening closing
them and lastly categorizing apps by
just holding down the icon and dragging
again simple yet effective enough so
overall the ipad air is a very good
tablet in its own merit it performs very
well then even outperforms the newer
tablets with quad-core processors and
even more RAM in there and again typical
of Apple to provide yet another very
solid build product so knowing this
tablet can handle practically anything
you throw at it you'll be owning a
device that will be with you for quite
some time the only downfalls I see and
I've been noticing for some time now
with Apple it's slowing down and
offering features all of the rest of the
hardware might be impressive but it also
needs the software in internal features
to make this iPad continue to be unique
like I stated earlier the Apple
interface is the easier interface to use
which is great but android's market
share is growing rapidly and I'm not a
market analyst but the market might need
a breath of fresh air maybe being too
simple it's starting to become a little
bit bland so leave your comments below
and tell us what you think Apple or
iPads today you're missing but overall
there's practically nothing wrong per se
with this iPad but it's a matter of
preference so if you decide I'm
purchasing the ipad air either way
you're still walking away with a very
good product with amazing power and
great build quality and I don't think
you'll be disappointed at all so that's
it for my review if you can please like
