another one of my vlogs here if you guys
are new to the channel don't expect any
kind of polished video here they look
nothing like my reviews it's just a
quick and easy way for me to show you
guys want to do in the background here
you know my personal life and a little
bit of behind-the-scenes stuff with
Jim's review room too I don't know I
just get away from the mundane very
standardized reviews that I do in my
channel but anyways hope you guys
enjoyed this here in my last blog at
150,000 some I told you guys I was
repainting the entire house and sure
enough that ladder is still the same
place as in my last video but i did
finish prob about ninety percent of all
the trim work around the corners i
painted around the windows so far i took
down the curtain rods and painted that
and everything around the windows and
the cabin tree that way when i do
usually roller I don't have to go back
and tape everything I don't have to you
know bring out the paint brush so often
and it shouldn't make very much much
quicker process if I'm rolling it
probably would take me in tight maybe an
entire day to get the entire first floor
done so wish me luck on that maybe on
the next video the painting should be
done down here so let me show you guys
real quick here what that looks like I'm
kind of done with all that the builder
grades brown and tan you know the earth
tones I'm going with gray which is a
little bit more modern it should pop
with the hardwoods here but as a side
note here this house I actually built
back in 2010 master bath we're welcome
to shortly and the wall which I'll be
facing it was just purely an investment
I prior to that I used to you know
investments are real estate before the
economy went to crap I then again i
bought this or built this in 2010 and
the reason why i'm doing this myself and
these brown hardwoods here it used to be
carpet and vinyl or linoleum whatever
you call it and in the kitchen i used to
be you know linoleum or vinyl as well
and i went in and installed all this
stuff and it's called sweat equity it's
just basically me
avoiding labor charges me putting in my
work and due diligence to hopefully you
know provide value for this house and
you know when it comes time to sell I
mean I saved boatload of money on labor
and I enjoy doing this stuff I I am
intending on getting back into real
estate not this year of course hopefully
next year but at the end of day guys you
know hustle hustle hustle as long as you
still have energy as long as you have
not yet you know feel settled or want to
slow down keep pushing use that momentum
and I've been non-stop ever since and I
can see the the fruits of my labor
coming about and I'm happy I'm in a good
place in my life youtube you know itself
is doing great and I just want everyone
everyone to you know just be motivated
and feel like they can make it happen it
does take a lot of work but dreams do
come true just keep pushing and I am I
am you know I want to be humble I don't
want to you know brag or anything I'm
just saying I literally started from
nothing and you know I Gant if I'm not
rich or anything like that but I'm just
saying the things that I want in life
they're slowly coming about and I'm just
more happy you know that that it's
becoming a reality but anyways
regardless vlog here I have three
different things talk about positivity
and all that stuff there's something bad
I gotta talk to you guys about there's
something good and then there's
something great so let's start with the
bad stuff first let me set the camera
down real quick here alright folks going
over the bad news person I always try to
stay positive on the channel here and
stay positive in life but once in a
while some things do need to be
addressed so just try to make this
really short for you guys several weeks
ago I had the opportunity had the
opportunity to answer this competition
and try to win a one plus three phone
when it's released and you just have to
do a review great so about 15,000 people
a little over 15,000 people entered and
I made it into the top 60 which was
crazy which is mind-blowing and you know
very
by it was crazy I would expect other
publishers and editors you know that
when far surpass my writing skills and
writing that essay to submit into that
competition but anyways so out of that
sexy the composition needs needs to
narrow it down sorry about that needs to
narrow it down to the top 30 and then
whoever is in the is left in the top 30
wins the phone and gets to review it to
in order to basically win the phone I
have to have viewers fans whoever that's
reading that sa to basically vote for me
so i posted up on my social media I
didn't put out youtube you know Facebook
Twitter Instagram and a lot of you guys
and for those who did you guys know who
you are I read through every comment
thank you very much for those who voted
it I won the phone and I got it right
here for you guys well here goes and uh
it is an amazing phone but let me just
say something first I get here comes the
bad news so on Tuesday they notified me
that I won the phone great shift it to
me I didn't get the phone at the at the
office until maybe thursday afternoon
thursday night or so and on friday
that's one actually unboxed it myself
and basically started you know logging
my credentials and downloading all my
apps and stuff like that so anyways
sunday rolls around sunday night i got
an email from one plus and they said hey
where's your review we noticed you
haven't posted anything yet i'm like
review i've only had the phone since
friday for God's sakes I only open it
since friday and they said well you need
to open up the phone by fri are a sunday
you'll have like maybe four hours left
or so so they needed the review uploaded
by sunday at midnight going into Monday
I didn't find out until that sunday
night and I did and I have a screenshot
of it as well I asked them or someone
hasten when's the deadline they say just
focus on doing the reviews that deadline
will come later and that was maybe
friday night or saturday or so so again
i was signed blinded they said they
needed to review out by sunday you know
it's a great phone let me just say that
first one plus one plus in general as a
phone company the customer service i
heard is a different
you know on a different scale or
different end here you know whatever I
never experienced it but the phone is
great don't get me wrong but the fact
that they asked me as a reviewer to
basically push out pump out a review a
foam review that is within two days or
three days or so this is not including
my video editing and recording narration
all that fun stuff that I do behind the
scenes to basically upload and package
it to you guys I'm just talking about
just testing the phone for what three
days or so in my humble opinion I don't
believe that's enough time to really get
the full experience and that's what a
bia at that moment kind of really pissed
me the off the reason being is
because I'm a consumer myself granted I
review a lot of tech I have that
opportunity but let's say if I want to
buy a car and I was reading reviews and
someone just basically pushed out a
review athlete driving the car once for
like three hours that afternoon on a
test strip or so and it that's like an
initial impressions he's not getting the
full experience again this is my humble
opinion I feel like it's a disservice
for you guys and I have told you guys
again and get on my channel in my vlogs
particularly even go if you guys go back
about a year and a half or so when i
first started youtube I told you guys I
pride myself on the honest integrity
openness that have with you guys and
yeah I could have pumped out that review
and I'll give me I don't know but if I
were to help out their review by sunday
night or so and get all the video
editing done and you guys wouldn't even
know but behind the scenes my experience
with the phone wouldn't have been fully
encompassed I guess you can say is it
different when you have your phone at
work and you use it in that kind of a
setting and then on the weekends and
granted they wanted me to put out a
review on a weekend yeah it is a
different experience you know you're
playing with your phone you're using it
to look at movie tickets you're using it
for you know a lot more for social media
maybe for directions gps during the work
week we're doing the work day I don't do
that so again I'm not
on the other 29 reviewers that one and
got a chance to review this you know
whatever you guys do your own thing and
if you guys want to pump up videos that
fast it is what it is and I'm not hating
on that whatever but I'm just upset that
a company is willing to push you know a
reviewer to pump out a review in that
short period of time and I feel like
it's a disservice to the consumer is
that this service to customers in
general and granting like I said it's a
great phone for four hundred dollars is
cheaper than my Nexus 6p it's a great
phone the screen is not as sharp and
vibrant as the Samsung AMOLED screens it
is what it is but for the value holy cow
aluminum body the specs whatever it is
it's a great phone I'm not knocking the
phone but I'm knocking the integrity and
the principles I'm not trying to get
really upset or really pissed off here
best I just wanted you know to say my
piece and it just for you guys is now
you know trying to bash 1 plus I just
want to vent my frustration that I mean
that just one plus but any other company
that does this and I just feel like it
doesn't help the consumer and if you're
going to label it as a review it's a
review of any day let it be beneficial
to the consumer it shouldn't be
beneficial for press and marketing
purposes for a company really that's
kind of that's kind of dirty don't don't
don't mark it a review as you know
quietly as a you know a marketing G
whatever it may be anyways uh moving on
to good news here I want to share with
you guys some awesome awesome stuff I
got this box in the other day we're
actually a little over a week ago
actually and I have not opened this Hey
oh I opened the front box yet but I
haven't opened up the actual package
inside and I want to share this moment
with you guys it's my 100,000 subscriber
play button so this is what I came in as
it comes you know let me trying to look
it up here yeah bubble wrap whatever
comes in this box obviously and then
when I lifted lifted up the cover okay
it's right side up and I finger stuck I
looked it up the cover
and I saw this letter in here and as
soon as i saw this letter i closed it so
here you guys go I'm pretty straight
guys have seen a bunch of these now I
mean everyone's doing YouTube these days
and whatnot but you can pause it if
you'd like so I got the letter I obvious
I haven't even personally read the
letter myself all right well thank you
very much Susan at YouTube I don't know
how to say your last name i'm sorry but
so this one came as kim ynez I place
that I have not seen the play button
myself all i read was that letter i have
not seen this yet so here goes I'm
trying to show you guys pretty god this
is a fall out the box here his head none
of that no actions have happened on set
here so far and oh man oh it's so shiny
but let me just take it out via
protective box here holy cow there's
Ashley a little bit of weight to this
whole again I was expecting something
really light man look at that oh man I'm
so excited about this I've been waiting
and waiting and waiting for someone I
reached a hundred thousand subscribers
on December 10th in 2015 so it's been
about six months waiting for this to get
here and the reason why I'm so throw em
and I'm happy about this it's crazy to
phantom a hundred thousand if you guys
were at this time a hundred thousand of
you guys enjoy my work holy cow that's
already mind-blowing um you know you
know when you're when you are your own
boss there's really not much that you
know like gives you a pat on your
shoulder and the funny thing is when I
was wearing a corporate and you know
sometimes you know people wouldn't you
know good performance awards and stuff
like that and for me I am I am throwing
I'm proud of the big awards don't get me
wrong but one song you get these like
little achievements and at the time like
n but now you at the time i was taking
it for granted and now you know being
your own boss there's really nothing
that says hey you know good job whatever
and um i don't know i am this is
something that what i'm trying to say is
I'm gonna hang up proudly it's a lot of
hard work to even just get to 100,000
subscribers it is not an easy feat at
least it wasn't for me and I
and happy happy happy thrilled to have
something to reflect that for the rest
of my life and if for some reason
youtube blows up crashes and your
facebook video takes over so you know
this is something that i can always keep
them at wal this is something that was
remember and cherish holy cow like I
said there is some way to its wholly guy
yet it has a meat to it which is greatly
said I was expecting it to be a little
bit lighter but it was the back if you
guys are interested in seeing what it
looks like here but anyways oh man
definitely definitely definitely I'm
prior hang it up tonight to be obviously
they don't put a nail right through my
wall get that up so a lot of you guys
we're saying when I had 100,000
subscribers back in December you know
hey time to aim for a million I'll be
honest guys i am not intentionally any 4
million i'm not trying to chase numbers
i feel like if i continue to keep
putting out you know a good product the
numbers the success or whatever it may
be and anything else in life for you
guys it could be money for you guys it
could be the cars for you guys even with
you know the opposite sex or the same
sets in this day and age you work hard
at it and the results the byproduct will
reveal itself eventually we're gonna be
a million subscribers where there would
be you know money from your job or
whether it be you know focus on yourself
and prove on yourself or to be you know
social skills physique or this
personality whatever it may be
eventually eventually it will come to
you again it just takes it just takes
work and man i believe me i'm so excited
about that thing so thank you very much
thank you everyone for that um I'm
speechless man I all I can't say just
thank you from the bottom of my heart
and I feel like even even though it
surpassed like just seeing that's not
just holding it I feel it man I feel
like this energy this ah is its way just
like his energy but again this
humbleness like this this oh my god like
almost in disbelief so thank you very
much guys thank you
