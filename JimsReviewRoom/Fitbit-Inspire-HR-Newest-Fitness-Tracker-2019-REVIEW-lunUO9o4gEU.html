Fitbit inspire HR and folks I think this
is the activity band to get if you want
something minimalist but just enough
features to get you by I did personally
pay for this at the retail price of $99
the price point on this is very low and
the not HR model is going for even
cheaper a place my affiliate links down
a better description below I'm Jimmy
with James Revere and I'm here to help
you make that purchase decision let's
see if the inspire HR is right for you
hey folks has a quick side note I
finally have some good news that I will
be moving that's why the background
looks a little bit funky that's why I'm
not in my office right now but more
details on that a little bit later but
this is somehow a segue to the video
sponsor for today raids shadow legends
is one of the most ambitious RPG
projects of 2019 it recently released
for both iOS and Android and it's free
playing rate is the most immersive
experience you'll find on a smartphone
and the features of awesome 3d graphics
giant boss battles PvP battles and
hundreds of champions to collect and
customize there's also an upcoming
special launch tournament with crazy
prizes the performance on this mobile
game the feature set this offers
it's insane look how crazy the details
are on these champions raid is getting
big real fast so get in early so you can
get a head start go into my video
description right now and download great
for free and only through my link you
get 50,000 silver immediately and a free
epic champion part of the new player
program alright folks back to my empty
office so to start off guys first the
features here I'm coming from the Fitbit
Alta H R since it was released I had
this for quite some time now you
probably see me aware and a lot of the
other intros other reviews of price and
clips right now for you guys but jumping
to the point for those on the offensive
upgrading from the Alta hr2 the inspire
HR I recommend doing so for those who
haven't owned a Fitbit or thought about
downsizing from one of the bigger models
or maybe downsizing from a SmartWatch
let's see what features you get and what
you don't
at first I thought this gigantic hump
here the computer the brains here was
going to be an issue it's not when I
place this side-by-side with most other
activity trackers fitness trackers it's
about the same thickness it is
comfortable to wear during the day and
for me personally comfortable enough to
wear to sleep for the sleep tracking
feature the band feels like silicone and
I've never had any kind of skin
irritation or rashes breakout and it's
very light small and I personally feel
it's a little bit better than the charge
3 again the charge 3 offers different
features but for something minimalist
this is good at first it looks somewhat
playing to me though but after some time
I realized there's a lot less resistance
on the band and wearing this with my
jacket with some long sleeves it feels
less cumbersome put comment down below
and let me know what we guys think of
this particular style versus a couple of
the other ones that I reviewed
previously now keep in mind the bands
are also replaceable with a quick
release lever on the back there's no
tools required no logic needed it's very
simple to do and if you want different
colors or different materials you can do
so there now taking a look at the screen
here it looks big at first but similar
to other Fitbit devices the display
doesn't go edge to edge for any tivity
tracker it's one of the brightest
screens and does a great job and the Sun
compared to the older models the numbers
are big enough for a telling time but
even if the numbers are slightly small
for your other health metrics the larger
illustrations or pictures basically
helps identify what screen you're
looking at but let's go through what
Fitbit offers and see if there's enough
for your needs now from the factory you
get your time and with a tap you can
cycle through your step count dates
heart rate etc which are on the
following screens as well swiping up is
the step count another swipe reviews
your heart rates and I love this display
year there's four different quadrants
that indicates your normal heart rate -
fat burning heart rates - cardio all the
way up to your peak now with heart rate
tracking you can also see what your
resting heart rate is within the app
which is what great indicator of heart
health now next up is calories burned
another swipe up is how many minutes
you've spent being active you've
estimated your estimated distance here
travel for the day how many steps you
have taken for that hour and the goal is
250 steps per hour and it's a friendly
way to remind you to stay active next up
here or how many days you've actually
hit your activity goal for that
particular week hopefully that makes
sense here next and I love this the
amount of sleep you've gotten from the
previous night not many activity
trackers or bands even offer this very
few smartwatches
even offer this I usually have to take
out my phone to see how many real hours
of sleep I've gone this is right here on
your wrist now next up is your water
intake which I do appreciate
what
wish there was a way for me to input how
many ounces of water I've consumed right
on the watch here right on the activity
band instead of again whipping out my
phone here and then inputting it in I
know you're not getting 64 ounces of
water I'm not getting 64 ounces of water
per day I'll be peeing like a horse now
last but not least is your weights if
you have the Fitbit scale which I am
planning on getting keep track of your
weights for that day here now there is a
little button on the side that brings
you back to the home screen if you hold
it down you get your option so you turn
on and off your screen with the flick of
the wrist here and as a side note this
felt to have improved over the Ultra HR
if it doesn't register as most trackers
and smartwatches are not perfect here
either tapping the screen here it brings
it up and this performs excellent from
my testing now last is the option to
turn notifications on or off that comes
from your phone now phone calls coming
in text messages and emails are shown on
here you can't respond back to them you
can't deny a phone call and if the text
message or email is quite long and you
can't really message in its entirety
which is again normal for a smaller
activity band but for most a summary is
usually good enough and if it's that
important I think it's reasonable to
take out your phone then now going back
to that main screen and then swiping
down instead you can start and track an
exercise I'll have a list of the
activities that you can track on screen
for you once again so be sure to pause
if you need to now there's the
relaxation app which God knows I need
you can choose two or five minute
sessions where the FIP inspire helps
guide your breathing helps calm your
body and mind down and refreshes your
well-being I'll be honest it sounded
cheesy and like firstworldproblems but
you guys know I work crazy hours and
just simply breathing or meditation has
helped somewhat it doesn't fix
everything but it does how clear my mind
for majority of my days I'm usually
going about a hundred miles an hour but
that's just be you can try it yourself
it's offered on here
now times are included which features a
stopwatch or a countdown you cannot do
intervals out here it's simply a
stopwatch pause
zoom and reset the last are the alarms
which you do setup within the app with
my testing this little thing really
buzzes compared to most other trackers
I've tested it's up there with me
sensing the vibration when it goes off
if you're a deep sleeper this might work
for you for light sleepers like myself
this was a no-brainer same when
notifications come through I can sense
it now there's also the auto recognised
exercises this was good to you okay for
me the key word is intention if you're
not intentionally going for a walk but
say you do walk for in the entire mall
that is for let's say about thirty
minutes
Fitbit can register that as a workout
that's awesome and it happens behind the
scenes it's automated but if my
intention was to run Fitbit requires me
to run for at least 10 minutes straight
which for some is no problem at all but
if you do slow down maybe check your
wrist for an extended period of time and
maybe let's say you ran for the full 20
minutes of running here but Fitbit will
then stop and segment that exercise and
that minimum of 10 minutes of running it
has to restart and on the app it will
show that you performed technically
another exercise when maybe you're just
taking a break if your intent was it
workout I would recommend manually
starting that session as I shown you
earlier by swiping down rather than
relying on the auto logging feature now
what the Fitbit inspire HR offers is
honestly enough for what most people
need I believe for the average consumer
but let's go through what you don't get
keep in mind this is priced at $99 so
I'm not bashing the tracker but
informing you and what you might be ok
with not having so there's no weather
readings and flights of stairs climbs
right on your wrist the charge 3 and up
offers that you don't have music
controls or music storage built in
that's when you need to step up to the
Fitbit Versa or Fitbit ionic you don't
have the ability to respond to text
messages you can't talk into your watch
like an Apple watch that's pretty cool
there's no built-in GPS but the inspire
HR does pair with your phone's GPS on a
run and tracks and as
plays everything in real-time which is a
huge plus but again you gotta carry your
phone on that those are the main
features that are practically missing as
we're better life if it is claiming up
to five days worth of use I'm averaging
about four days in one and a half hours
this is consistent with Fitbit products
but it's also dependent on how many
notifications you have coming through
yourself and as a side note I did have
these silent vibrating alarm for Monday
through Friday
as for heartrate accuracy this is
somewhat finicky resting heart rate and
heart rate readings while I'm at the
office at home etc are very good when
I'm at like vigorously active it's great
and cross-checks with my other devices
but during a run though it's a good
generous reading but not spot-on
from my experience unfortunately now as
for the step counter like most activity
trackers even the expensive smart
watches out there there's times it's
going to read a random swing here when
you're sitting or working with your
hands and it's not an actual step like
what I'm doing right now probably but
again there's still very good at general
tracking that's much better than nothing
at all sleep tracking this has been
spot-on regard in regards to the time I
started sleeping to the time I am awake
for those who are unfamiliar with
activity trackers if you open your eyes
at night and are awake but you don't
move it might not register as you being
actually awake but if you move around or
get up to go to the bathroom that's been
accurate from my experience so overall
for the price I feel like you're getting
a lot of value and a better product than
what the previous generation or previous
models has offered
although the charge 3 gives you some
more features the size of the inspire HR
basically sealed the deal for me this
gives me definitely enough data on my
overall activity so make me conscious on
what I need to focus on
that's better sleep and maybe being a
bit more active on my office days guys
comment down below and let me know what
you guys think hopefully this video
helped you in some way I'll text you
guys on the next one hopefully you'll be
back into my office see ya bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
