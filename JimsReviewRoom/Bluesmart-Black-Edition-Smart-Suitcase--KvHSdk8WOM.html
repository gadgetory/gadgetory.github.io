room welcome back to another video I
just got back from the airport here just
got done filming for Blu smart these
guys are the first-ever makers of a
smart suitcase so check them out at Blu
smart comm tell them jim's review room
setting you guys but just to remain up
for and honest with you this is a
sponsored video this is not a review
they just want me to go over the
features for you guys to showcase what
this is all about and that this helped
them gain a little bit of exposure in
the tech community so check them out
again Blu smart calm and keep in mind
sponsorships do help the channel very
much here so thank you to Blu smarts and
as you guys know some phones are coming
out next month and also in September so
look out for that but anyways going over
the physical features first and the
exterior looks pretty standard here
but this is a polycarbonate exterior
shell so it's pretty much reinforced
like I said I have traveled with this
I've been through I believe one of the
busiest national airports here in
America maybe the busiest International
Airport it's in Atlanta and every time
every chance that I got I get checked
this since there's really any overhead
bins that are available anyways so I get
checked this and it's been through again
conveyor belt the back of planes thrown
into the back of you know uber vehicles
my trunk of the car as well and really
no problems at all now one of the unique
things that they're trying to promote as
well and they're really advertising is
these wheels as simple as it may looks a
really unique design but they're hubless
which means less parts less likely there
would be faulty and no brake or
malfunction down the road and also
they're ridiculously smooth pushing this
back and forth and the terminal as you
guys can see right now again it just
glides along the floor so going through
the front here fabric material design
looks really modern really original as
well on the very top this is really
unique here at least to me there's a
locking mechanism now if it's unlocked
you can use your hands to basically open
and close it just like here and just
press it down and it snaps into place
now this works with iOS and Android
devices on your phone you can manually
lock this so that way you can't have
access to it no one can try to open this
up and gain access to the zippers and of
course you can unlock it from your phone
now the big question is if you're at
airport security
how can the
basically open it for you if you're a
way or on a plane already there is a TSA
lock on here and you also get two
physical keys as well if you ever maybe
lose your phone or your phone does you
need access to your suitcase those keys
can open this up no problems at all
whatsoever
and once the TSA or security officer
closes the suitcase back up it will lock
in place once again so really cool about
that now there is a proximity sensor out
here if you walk away from the suitcase
you get a push notification saying hey
you forgot something back there it will
auto lock on you once you walk back to
your suitcase you can have the app
automatically unlock the suitcase for
you as well so again proximity sensors
have built right in another unique
feature here there is a built-in power
bank again for the modern traveler the
techy traveler of today you can charge
your phones you can charge your tablet
you can charge your headphones your
Bluetooth headphones whatever it may be
there is a ten thousand four hundred
miliband will it have better built
inside also in addition on the front
panel here I mean there's a little slot
to store your stuff now once you open
this up here there's a magnetized flap
that keeps you know everything you
basically sealed but gently pull this
out and you have much more access to all
of your equipment or other electronics
on the inside right here now I have an
iPad in here as you guys can see and
back here I got a Samsung 15 inch laptop
which holds perfectly fine and smooth
and all the materials in here is very
premium as well very smooth felt lining
as well and again just compartments
meant for the modern-day traveler just a
section off your again electronics but
also your documents as well now one of
the other unique smart features this has
a built in weight system which is
ridiculous which is crazy or unheard of
here or if you have weight restrictions
when you are flying this can calibrate
the weight of the suitcase on a flat
level surface and using your app you can
have this measure how much or how heavy
your goods are within your bag for you
just the case again if you have those
weight restrictions the last very smart
feature which is ridiculous again this
is pretty common probably more common
for some people who travels often if you
lose your bag the airport is responsible
they have to find out
your bag is in your case with the blue
smart bag here with the Black Edition
model there's GPS built-in if you ever
ever lose a suitcase
pull up your phone GPS can find your
suitcase and basically what you retrieve
it that much faster for you guys so
again that's some of the very unique
features right there for you looking at
the inside let's open this up here
there's plenty of compartments I have
two other suitcase personal suitcase
absolute before this came here and you
know really you know name-brand stuff
you know for quality purposes that is
you want a good sturdy suitcase but on
the other suitcases compared to this the
blue smart has more compartments more
zippers more places to stow your wires
more places to hold your hygiene
products more places to I guess you know
stow away you know and then your
standard size is to stow away some of
your you know socks you know
undergarments whatever it may be but
again the compartments are all on there
very very Universal very versatile to
use as well so again this is the blue
smart suitcase this is the black edition
tons of smart features out here I can
see this some of these features here
being the future of suitcase and future
of travel again visit blue smart comm

phones coming out so hopefully you guys
