testing a lot more sound bars here at
the studio recently and after hearing
polt claimed that their new magnify mini
which is like pretty much the size of a
subway footlong but they say it produces
sound similar to setups three times its
size so I knew I was just going to have
to check this one out for myself
the magnify mini is currently retailing
for $299 on their site but as always
I'll place all our affiliate links in
the video description down below click
on those links and they'll give you the
most updated prices in real time I'm
Jake this is Jim's review room and we're
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review the first thing you'll notice
when you open the box is just how small
this guy really is it's only thirteen
and a half inches long it's about a
third of the size of its main
competitors and although it is small
inside they're able to squeeze in for
two and a quarter inch mid-range drivers
and to half inch tweeters as well with
all that packed in I was actually kind
of skeptical about how loud it could
really get for its size I wasn't
expecting it to feel cheap when I picked
up this speaker for the first time I was
pleasantly surprised by the build
quality it has a bit of heft to it if
you have beefy and tightly packed there
really is a lot jammed into this small
design looking at the wireless subwoofer
now it has a six and a half inch down
firing sub there are no physical
connections or independent adjustment
knobs or base levels or audio gain
anything like that so it's pretty much
plug and play but going back to the
sound bar it has no wall mounts so that
is something to note if you were looking
for that in your setup you do have your
usual buttons up top as do it on your
screen right now
and a special one to note is the night
effect button it's something I haven't
seen on any other sound bar and what it
does is it turns down the bass and
enhances the voices for use when others
are sleeping and testing this feature
did work really well the bass was much
less pronounced while still providing an
enjoyable listening experience they also
included a remote control that gives you
a few more options such as individual
bass and voice level adjustments as well
as providing sound profiles to tailor to
what you're watching what
that's movies music or even sports I'll
talk more about that after the sound
test but folding to the back of the
soundbar you'll have your standard ports
that's power obstacle in aux and
Ethernet and you may notice there's only
one HDMI connection not many know about
this even though it's been around for
quite a while but this sound bar uses
arc technology so you can plug all your
devices into your TV and it will be a
hub and then you plug one HDMI cable
from your TV into the sound bar and all
your devices will play through this
setup the magnified mini also has Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth capabilities plus being
able to connect to Spotify and
chromecast accounts all these features
are just improved by the built-in 5.1
Dolby Digital surround sound system and
that leads us to the final part of this
review here's the sound test I'll play a
few different samples and then I'll give
you my final verdict afterwards
Wow the surfaces are
down
so away from my girl open
he's bumping up the floor three corners
good with 14.2 remaining for this system
in particular we had three tests the
first was movies then music and then
finally one for sports what the volume
turned up to 70% I reached a very
enjoyable listening experience my first
time trying to set up I was blown away
by the quality coming from such a small
speaker the base itself was actually
louder than the thousand-dollar Yamaha
speaker we recently tested in this
studio the bass coming off the sub has
lots of body and it was booming and just
well adjusted in our movie and music
tests the low frequencies gave off a
bass boosted sound signature providing a
punchy experience in action sequences
and still a deep resonance during
explosions the deep bass gave you a
sense of movement when a large object
would move across the screen and that
just helps complete the immersion moving
into mid-range frequencies actors voices
were pronounced and cleared with a solid
amount of detail on the audio signature
especially when you consider the price
range despite offering a good amount of
bass vocals were never mixed with the
face or the highs in the background with
the highs the magnified mini crafted all
the Kriss classes that you could need
the twin tweeters helps complete the
soundstage and finished off the
signature as a whole there was no tinny
or crackling noises present during any
of the testings that we did
regarding the 5.1 virtual surround sound
the setup gave off a level of separation
that was unexpected from a system this
small it's not the same as a full seven
point one physical surround sound you
might have in your home but it's enough
to get the listener an idea of where
someone is on screen while talking but
still knowing to own the other side of
the screen of buildings falling and
while the system is lacking on the full
experience of sound coming from behind
you're still easily able to distinguish
sounds if they're still in your field of
view as discussed earlier the remote
offers options to adjust sound profiles
in the movie profile I found the best
results where 80% volume with the bass
turned up to about 75% this not only
gave me the Bhumi bass that surprised
all of us in the studio it also showed
me what the soundstage was capable of
with the setup for the music profile my
settings were pretty much the same the
bass coming from the subwoofer was super
unexpected especially when you consider
the size
and the soundbar cave off clear audio in
all directions the highs were sharp and
the mids had a great separation even
when paired with a vocal tract all the
genres of music that throughout this
thing during testing sounded superb from
electronic to metal everything was great
the sports profile had a similar effect
the voice of the announcers was clearly
separated from the game audio even when
buzzers were ringing in the background
voices were still easily heard overall
this setup gives you such a great bang
for your buck you not only get a small
but powerful sound bar you also get a
wireless subwoofer that you can put in
the most precarious places you can find
this is perfect for dorm rooms small
bedrooms tight spaces but the audio
performance will handle well in medium
or large sized rooms as well well guys
that's all I have for the poke magnify
mini if you guys have this set up or are
currently looking for something like
this let me know in the comments down
below and while you're down there hit
that like button and if you're new to
Jim's review room hit the subscribe one

I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
