review by Jim's review room now you know
when this little thing was first
released on july 24th it was sold out on
amazon and basically a week it went a
backwater and i finally received mine a
whole five weeks later now these things
are flying off the shelf and could
possibly be one of the top-selling items
this upcoming holiday season so this is
my review of the chromecast from google
so what's so special about this little
guy and why is it a hit well chromecast
allows any TV with an hdmi connection to
have features that you normally see on
quote unquote smart tvs now you
essentially have internet content stream
to your TV wirelessly and why this might
be at the competition well the next
thing similar to what chromecast can do
is the Roku streaming stick priced at
eighty-four dollars at the time of this
review and how about the chromecast well
it actually comes in at $35 flap it's
priced so low it's almost an impulse buy
for those who are curious about this
product and lastly it's insanely easy to
set up and for me it typically takes
about four steps the box says three I
saved four but they're all easy
nonetheless step one plug chromecast
into the back of your TV step 2
chromecast needs power and Google does
provide the wires to do so so either
connect chromecast to a USB port on the
back of your TV or connect chromecast to
the wall step 3 from your selected
device you can use your computer laptop
mobile device or tablet and either one
of them can be Android or iOS and go to
google.com / chromecast / setup you have
to download the app there step 4 once
it's installed just enter your password
for your home Wi-Fi and that's if it's
very simple so before I can get into
this this is very important to know now
some folks determine from chromecast
because they said it will eat up their
data plan their answers technically no
content is not being beamed from your
tablet or phone directly into your TV so
there's no need to worry about your data
plan being used if you are on your phone
and play netflix video while on let's
say 4g the cast button won't even show
up all data is actually being
transferred from your wireless router
and your internet at home your phone
tablet or computer only gives chromecast
a signal to retrieve the information
itself so what can you access so far so
in regards to content Google is offering
the filing at the time of this review
Netflix google music google movies and
youtube and as you can see it's very
limited at the present time however
google has claimed that there are many
more apps on the way from news articles
and sources linked through wikipedias
chromecast web page we're anticipating
AOL on HBO Go Hulu Plus Pandora pocket
casts redbox instant revision3 and Vimeo
are all the works and I'm confident that
Google is doing everything that I can to
get these amazing apps for you guys so I
performed my test after i download the
google cast app from google play then
usable apps like netflix and youtube now
has a cast button once you click that
your video will display your TV now i
pulled up netflix and canton appears as
good as any other device and playback
was identical as well i didn't have any
hiccups or issues with this little USB
device i did set up my TV downstairs on
the opposite side of the house and you
can imagine the data stream through
going through several walls and through
the ceiling of the first floor again no
problems at all now i'm an ad vid
netflix user and some things I want to
mention which are definitely perks we're
looking at videos on your phone or
tablet while watching netflix on your TV
there is no interruptions you can
control your content audio and video
right on your phone or tablet instead of
using your TV remote and lastly this
applies to all programs not just Netflix
you can continue using your device for
example make and receive phone calls
while you're casting basically now
YouTube works the very same way clicking
on a video and then the cast button will
then display your content on your TV
seamlessly
again image quality for YouTube with no
issue at all content and playback with
smooth and I controlled everything from
my phone or tablet now I also want to
mention if you're on one device and
decide to use a different device
chromecast will allow you to switch on
the fly it's not limited to one product
for example I started a movie on my
phone and then I found something in my
iPad I cast from my tablet and as you
can see here while I watch a video in
the background my content changes once I
clicked on my iPad here and the last
feature I want to mention benefits
laptop and desktop users now as long as
you have google chrome as your web
browser you can download google cast
extension in the Google Play Store now
this enables you to allow mirroring and
your chrome tab to the big screen and
your chrome web browser the cast button
is located up top and once you click
that will instantly have your TV display
your content so whatever you can watch
or display in your web browser you can
have it show on the big screen now I
didn't notice a slight lag once it
performed an action on the computer and
what was displayed on the TV again it's
not detrimental down but it is there i
guess worth mentioning and now for the
cons and since we're on the topic of
mirroring you can't mirror your entire
desktop it's only limited to one chrome
tab now I would have liked to see the
chromecast mirror my entire computer
desktop obviously and hopefully this
will be a new feature that will be
implemented through a firmware upgrade
in the future so again um there's
currently a limited amount of apps but
Google did announce that they will have
more support for other streaming
services in the future so it's still
very hopeful on what this device can do
though and for $35 you really can't beat
it overall this is a great device if you
already don't have a smart TV or a
blu-ray player with these similar
features or a Playstation or Xbox
connected again for only thirty-five
dollars you get a well-built product
with features for now that justifies the
price if you're using that flicks alone
this is still a great tool to use rather
than spending a lot more to purchase in
blu-ray player so you can just stream
netflix or content
your TV so that's it a quick review I
hope you enjoyed this review the
chromecast from google if you have not
please take your time to like and
subscribe to this video for future
alerts to new products and definitely
i'm on facebook right now at
facebook.com slash Jim's review route so
this is Jimmy from Jim's review room
tick everyone and have a good day take
care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
