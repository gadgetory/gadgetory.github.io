room it's been a long time since I've
shown you a what's in my bag video since
then I've gotten new equipments and of
course rocking a new camera bag before
getting started every item that you see
in this video I'll place their links in
the video description below click on my
affiliate links and they'll give you the
most updated prices in real time you can
also get these specific model names and
numbers just in case I don't mention
them in the video so a little background
for those who don't know I'm a full-time
publisher reviewer youtuber what have
you a lot of my work is indoors but once
in a while I like to mix it up a bit and
venture out into nature and get some
awesome footage that evokes some emotion
so I personally like traveling as
lightweight as possible whether
personally on vacation and definitely I
work for these reviews so I want with
the sony alpha back i personally bought
this back in May of this year
and it's been a nice upgrade it
seriously comfortable with tons of
padding around the shoulder and more
importantly for me my lower back if I
ever do walk with a full set of gear
it's not a huge bag but again I want to
be minimalist as possible and with a
smaller footprint less pockets and such
it makes me more efficient when packing
now check it out the very top here you
can see the orange lining makes this
thing stand out here super bright to
help me find my things
ASAP now first up for any camera guy get
extra SD cards and a Pelican case I
personally bought this for the fact that
it's water-resistant and it's tough I
also carry this massive 15,000 milliamp
hour Bank not only because it looks
great in my opinion but it's made of
aluminum so it's much more durable over
plastic it's super slim as you guys can
see and it fits perfectly into that bags
sleeve and the biggest thing for me
there's a touch LED sensor that
indicates exactly how much better life I
have remaining
and before if you get here this is
clearly not a Jim's review room power
bank I don't make power banks myself but
I bought this from Ankur a while ago
again the links will be in the video
description they should give you the
model numbers in there as well so next
up are my cables these are from today's
video sponsor it's RAM pal they
specialize in making nothing but cables
and power banks ever since they shipped
them to me I do personally use them and
over time the aluminum casing and
braided wired cords are easier to manage
they feel great and offers peace of mind
that these cords are going to last I
have been using their 2.0 or USB 2.0
cord and also their USB type
see wires for my Simpson si+ and the
laptop which I will be showing you
pretty shortly here now there links are
in the video description below check
them out they really do make some very
good stuff now other than that at the
top of the compartment here I have my
cleaning smock for those lenses and
screens that I have some extra batteries
for the camera and a mini toolkit just
in case we need to remove a
quick-release plate or adjust some items
on my tripod now speaking I try thought
whatever we don't need a tripod to use
and intend on doing some guerrilla
footage recording I keep the Joby
Gorillapod with me at all times I've
used this thing to vlog before Adam here
has used it as a stabilizer to keep the
camera from shaking too much and simply
because of its adjustable and sturdy
legs I personally have been able to wrap
it around poles and trees and have the
camera stay up instead of having me hold
it now on the right side of the bag I
have this awesome bottle from Cole
they're based out of San Francisco and
makes is premium yet rugged feeling all
metal canister they claim to keep
liquids cold for over 24 hours and they
seriously do I love this thing as
compact is rugged it does what it claims
to do so shout out to them all right now
getting back here into the main area I
have the quick access side pocket but
opening the top so you can get a
top-down view here this fits our new
camera the sony a7s 2 and I'm currently
using the G master 24 to 70 F 2.8 so far
loving 2 extra features this camera has
we do have to contend with the color
grading a bit over my previous Nikon
d810 but having five axis stabilization
and the 120 frames per second has opened
new doors to our shooting style the
running done mic of choice here is a
Sennheiser MKE 440 this look like pants
I know but these two separate mics on
this and the audio separation is much
more noticeable and this versus the
roadie mic Pro that we've been using for
years now now also we have the wind muff
here too so it looks like pants on pants
I guess
but anyways because we do shoot indoors
or outdoors a bit more often than before
here I did purchase this nd or neutral
density filter from whole yeah now what
this does is keep my f-stop very low
keep that background blur in my shots
and not have the video blow out this was
more of a recent purchase we always keep
this in the bag just in case last up is
my in-ear ear
this is one of maybe three or four that
I use but most of the time for audio
monitoring I use my RH 80 20s they sound
phenomenal and you guys know I like nice
stuff so it feels premium too with the
aluminum accents here and there I don't
bring the headphones just because I want
to pack as light as I can and reduce the
clutter I'll probably make a what's my
go-to headphones and hear films kind of
video later on let me know down below in
the comment section if you guys want to
see that or not
now last up and this is on the reverse
side went out in the field to check our
work or back up our stuff we carry our
Dell XPS 15 this is the 2017 model I
didn't go with the 4k version because
it's subtly expensive but the 1080
version has the i7 processor and 256
gigs of storage eight gigs of ram which
we do intend on upgrading one of these
days but overall it's been a very good
computer some minor hiccups and freezes
here and there which is odd for this
price but this laptop has been our
workhorse 90% of the work that you see a
Magento has been completed on this
machine and to finish any left side of
the bag I have my old school pen and
paper plus this thing called a track or
Bravo if I ever misplace my bag or if
it's stolen this low tag helps me locate
my bag I keep my wallet and keys on me I
don't like the idea of this bag were to
go missing and all my eggs are in one
basket so that's it for this video here
I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did
it's minimal it's simple
nothing too fancy and honestly no fluff
thrown in here as well these are the
items that we really use on a daily
basis again links are in the video
