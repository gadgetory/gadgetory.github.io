review room welcome to another review
today we're looking at the latest and
top-of-the-line DJ headset from
Sennheiser the HD 8 DJ's now these are
some unique over-the-ear headsets geared
towards professional disc jockeys and I
mean professional here now prices are on
your screen and I'll go over these
features that makes these headsets stand
out from the rest so without further ado
we'll get started
after testing so many audio products and
headsets these are truly designed
uniquely not as unique as v-moda but for
a professional set they do stray away
from your traditional u-shaped headband
because of this angle for design the
headset band sits a little bit further
forward on the head and turn providing a
bit more stability and leverage and
looking at the band itself they're very
well padded with its synthetic leather
but what I found was more interesting is
the bendable band on top
this feels nearly indestructible as you
can see but that's only the beginning
though as I've noticed through my
testing this thing is very very well
built and it takes some abuse as well
a perfect again for professionals on the
road and doing shows now regarding
adjustability it's quite extensive to
ensure proper fitment going along the
sides is metal construction that slides
in and out very smoothly but just enough
tension to not extend accidentally while
in use and what you'll find is the ear
cups themselves only pivots while the
entire arm swivels to ensure fitment the
arm itself has the Sennheiser logo on
the sides and also Sennheiser DJ warding
on what appears to be the ball bearing
wheels with a blocking mechanism and
this is truly original from Sennheiser
allowing DJs which typically moves one
ear cup behind the ear instead now
allowing the air cups pivot in three
different locations keeping the rest of
the headset basically in place now first
is having it over your ears the next is
half ear any last click here does go
behind the ear itself now doing so keeps
a one ear monitoring your audience and
the speakers while the other listening
to the headset to beat match etc and
while I have these on my head these have
been very comfortable to wear they're
not too heavy and actually feels very
balanced and maybe this is just
personally me but because of the headset
sitting a bit more forward it does
provide a lot less tension on the crown
of my head here where I do notice on
some headsets does cause soreness and
wearing fatigue over time the only grab
that I personally had on these after
several hours of news though about two
and a half hours in while typing my
narrative and testing and sound quality
the tension or the clamping on your ears
and a little above the job online it
does cause a little bit of soreness
right there now in the Box does offer
pleather air pens but also the velour
material as well in which both are super
flushed with its blue
and as they are interchangeable
following them off and snapping the
other one on is very quick and very
simple but besides comfort it looks
equally important is the sound isolation
and sound leaking there is no noise
cancelling features on this headset by
putting these on and put into use sound
isolation is very impressive putting
them on and speaking you can hear your
own voice muffled considerably and
conversations new you are droned out
quite a bit
it's impressive for a passive sound
isolation very ideal when you need to
hear your own mix when DJ and regarding
sound leaking with these around my neck
like any monitors you hear them
distinctly but putting them on my ears
the sound output is greatly reduced and
I know some folks have mentioned finding
the correct left and right audio
channels to put on your head is somewhat
confusing because of its new design
however it became a quick habit to
either one have the Sennheiser warding
face away from you or to just remember
which side the wire is connected to on
your ear cup that alleviated the
confusion for me at least now regarding
the case it's huge but it's worth it for
travelling though with the same color
scheme as the headsets the exterior is
built tough the inside is molded to hold
all of your accessories including the
extra ear pads provided and also forgot
to mention the DJ headset folds inward
very nicely and compact for stowing and
goddamn it this case alone just shows
the attention to detail Sennheiser has
for those lugging these around stowing
using and also for a professional
environment as well regarding its
accessories two cables are provided that
stretches up to nine feet long or three
meters to be exact for those and the
metric system one straight cable the
other is a cold cable that's a little
bit more compact and on each end
it's gold-plated and threaded to
interchange with either the 3.5
millimeter or 6 millimeter inputs to
ensure this fits all of your audio needs
the other end locks into place into the
headset themselves with a simple twist
and they do stay secure
now these headsets again great for
professionals but if you want to listen
to them casually say when you're out and
you want to connect this to your
smartphone for listening
the wires are indeed too long though and
the shorter ones are not provided now on
to the best part of the review here how
do they sound now I've tested this on
several friends that came over who are
not audio files but a good
representation of the ever
consumer and what they described was
superb clarity and a sense of being
surrounded by music and one friend even
said that she felt like she was
traveling through space and music and
not sure about the latter but from my
test here these are personally one of
the best headsets I've listened to in
regards to audio quality correct the
clarity is there and very accurate
reproductions and the mids and high
levels in my opinion the spatial sound
is impeccable from these drivers and the
amount of detail can be said the same
listening strongly to idiom again with
cascade and black Mill is immersive but
listening to a bit more bass-heavy Tunes
whether it be rap hip hop and pop the
bass is very good but very clean as well
it's not like the beats line up or the V
motors which are exceptional brands in
their own right but has been also
described as being based heavy
Sennheiser comes in still very nice
strong bass without droning other audio
levels the bass in general to me is
almost perfect where it does hit low and
it is thumping but it also accompanies
the other notes as well now if you've
been watching my channel as well for a
while now you'll know that I very much
like balance over dominant bass as a
general headset for all genres of music
but overall listening to these four
hours have never fatigued my ear there's
no ringing in the ears
no ting unis on the high notes ears are
not numb from all that bass it just been
simply amazing and watching movies in
these have been outstanding as well and
gives a whole new level of audio
definition now if you're on the road
heavy into music production and like to
use these for casual listening as well
the price is really justified the build
quality to the audio quality just
screams professional news all around and
despite some minor setbacks though this
pair is definitely still worth looking
into so hope this review helped you in
