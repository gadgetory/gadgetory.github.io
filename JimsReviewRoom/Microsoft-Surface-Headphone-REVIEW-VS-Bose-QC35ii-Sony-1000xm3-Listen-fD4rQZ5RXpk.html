video now Microsoft releasing active
noise-cancelling headphones seems a
little out there but hey you might have
a winner I personally bought this at the
retail price of 349 dollars putting
these at the same price as other premium
ANC headphones more specifically the
bose and QC 35 s that I have here in
this video QC 35 twos that is as always
I'll leave my affiliate links down in
that video description below click on
those links for the most updated prices
in real time you never know when these
things might go out and say I've got my
hands full here
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
video now governor of the physical
features first the headphones are
quality built they feel tight very well
put together and at least gives me the
impression that don't last a very long
time the headband is reinforced metal as
well with a ratcheting clicking system
are here for adjusting though not
intending on trying to break these now
but I do this to hear if there's any
kind of creaking or cracking areas where
there might be a little bit too much
flex or any kind of chatter that makes
this feel like it's on the cheaper end
now with my personal assessment and
being fair Bose and Sony headphones
feels a little bit more premium though
and justified for the price with Bose
you have that faux leather up top and
whoops drop these here and then this
Alcantara material on the bottom not to
mention the ear cups themselves are
metal and cool to the touch with these
Sony's it's plush on the headband and it
feels us a little bit more substantial
in the hands yet lighter than the
surface headphones now Microsoft is not
a bad design it just doesn't feel like
$350 but one thing I do love about the
surface headphones it's the volume
adjustment on the right side right here
and the active noise canceling dial on
the left side a nice simple glide
forward and back adjusting levels that
you want to obtain and it is smooth now
getting back to the physical stuff first
before I get deep into the features keep
in mind these headphones unfortunately
don't fold in and themselves so storing
these will be a slightly wider footprint
carrying case but keep in mind they're
also thin
well I didn't mind this at all jumping
into comfort had tested these a little
after release and for the past several
weeks they've been worn at the office
while out and about etc and I noticed
they are comfortable enough but not as
comfortable as the two giants and the
markets but the boss is hands-down the
lightest and most eerie feeling while
Sony did make great efforts and making
fares lighter as well the surface
headphones comes in at 290 grams which
is happy heavier sigh while these sony
1000 x m3 weighs in at 254 grams and
boasts at 232 grams at 290 grams they
felt more average in comfort and felt to
weigh in my head after about an hour of
wear it's not bad but as a review and
experiencing other headphones on the
markets not to mention having several
here at the studio to test and compare
the surface headphones did just feel
slightly heavier over time ever so
slight pinching at the crown of the head
here
moderate draw pressure and slight
warming of the ears but to be fair not
as warm as the Saudi 1000x m3s looking
into the ear cups here those were big
ears this felt like the in-between of
the three it's ever so slightly recessed
in this gives a little more room for
your ears to breathe my ears are ever so
slightly touching the inside lining but
to be fair again Sony I'm definitely
touching the inside lighting and with
Bose my ears are not touching at all as
for the ear pads and ear cup design
sound leaking is kept to a minimum the
surface headphones are one of the least
sound leaking headphones I've ever
experienced and it leaks the least out
of Bose and Sony now getting back out
here power pairing mute with the newest
USB C connection or out there last is a
3.5 millimeter plug for physical
connections and good to know yes you can
use the headphones when they're off and
if you have no battery life left and you
just won't have a and C or any of the
controls to use now jumping into battery
life first microsoft claims up to 15
hours with anc on but before you say
this is low compared to the market which
technically it is and Microsoft's
defense they're promoting an always-on
voice assistant Cortana versus either
Bose or Sony requiring you to press a
button for Siri or Google assistant it's
give and take
at the time as video there
a way to turn off Cortana if there is
I'll definitely a guy's know if there is
let me know in the comment section below
so other viewers can see now with my
testing at 50% in vine I was able to get
13 hours of use the interesting part if
you turn off Bluetooth and go into Wired
mode for example using this I'm in the
airplane maybe you can get up to 50
hours of playback the most will use this
wirelessly of course but the extended
better life is there as an option
charging from a dead better to full
merges of claims less than two hours now
moving on bluetooth 4.2 which is fine we
don't have the latest bluetooth 5.0 but
the wireless bluetooth connection is
really really good I tested the distance
on these things and surprisingly got up
to 100 linear feet even with a signal
going through one wall with video on
both my Samsung and iPhone no lag or
delays on both Netflix and YouTube let's
get some fire emojis for that no jumping
into features before I discuss Bluetooth
performance besides the awesome rotating
dials here there's touch sensitive
controls as well tapping on either ear
couple pause and play double taps and
triple taps will skip or go back on your
music respectively and a double tap or
answer and a phone call and a long hold
when your phone is ringing
will decline a call now as for phone
call performance the surface headphones
picked up background noise quite easily
though but my voice was still audible
and clear the QC 35 twos picked up as
much background noise as well but my
voice was very clear and those is Sony
1000 XM threes picked up at least
background noise but the voice was not
the clearest out of the three now last
this is only most important features
that set the surface headphones apart
it's the always-on built-in voice
assistant the headphones are always
listening and waiting for you to say
that command and as a side note if you
don't want to use your voice you can
always hold down the side of the ear
cover here to activate her now in
contrast
Bose and Sony uses a physical button
here which works very well or you can
use your voice the difference though
with Bose and Sony you have to make sure
your phone
here you that's the device that's
technically always listening not the
headphones themselves for boats and
Saudi if your phone is in your pockets
maybe your bag your desk etc you have to
use the button as most likely your phone
can't hear you
that's where the always-on listening
from Microsoft comes into play their
headphones themselves is the one that's
always listening not your phone in this
case and that's something you'd need to
ask yourself in deciding if these
surface headphones are worth a purchase
first and foremost do you need or want
Cortana specifically and second are your
hands usually busy or do you prefer not
to use your hands to activate your voice
assistant so with that being said using
Cortana command from my weeks of testing
I noticed it's somewhat slower in
general compared to the competition in
rural tests Bost takes about 2 to 3
seconds from the end of my question to
me receiving my answer so any was
similar as well but here was a core test
of what I'm talking about here not the
most scientific but you can experience
this in real-time yourself to show up
being unbiased here basically hey
Cortana what's the weather right now
right now it's partly sunny and 49 in
Charlotte what's the weather right now
currently in Charlotte it's 51 degrees
Fahrenheit and sunny in Charlotte today
it'll be partly cloudy with a forecasted
high of 52
hey Cortana what is fifty five times
five thousand three hundred fifty five
times five thousand three hundred is two
hundred and ninety one thousand five
hundred the answer is two hundred ninety
one thousand five hundred what's fifty
five times five thousand three hundred
the answer is two hundred ninety one
thousand five hundred so in the end with
Google in Syria it's just so much faster
intuitive it just simply flows so
anyways alright enough about those
voices I'm sure Skynet is going to have
a huge ego boost right now let's get
into the audio test now first up are the
active noise-cancelling test and then
I'll get into the music test back here
at the studio I just being up front
everytime I'm testing and filming
headphones in public I'm using my
gigantic camera and using my
professional binaural microphones and
I'm still using those professional
microphones of course but from here on
out I'll be setting the camera on the
table for you guys so it looked a lot
less conspicuous in public I had my fair
share of security and staff saying stuff
and I got our respective you know same
tests just different angles and to show
you support please be sure to follow me
on social media my Instagram is in that
video description below
all right folks make sure you have your
headphones or earphones on yourselves
that's the only way to go and hear the
effects of the binaural microphones here
goes the very first song just one that
there's one percent it's like nothing as
long as you can show me a good time I
don't need promises honestly no big deal
as long as you can show
don't you suppressor or need some
insulin reason to throw my game oh do me
a favor
pour me another glass for hearts getting
poured out looking for tension I'm not
looking to me
and there you have it folks now first up
active noise-cancelling is impressive
kind of shocked I honestly wasn't
expecting to beat Bose but Microsoft did
it it's now the second best ANC
performance I've tested here at Jim's
review room better than Sennheiser PXE
550 s better than the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins
px is better than again the boast QC 35
2's which are heavier here and you're
hurting yourself in the audio test now
the only one it couldn't beat is the
Sony 1000 XM threes Sony beats Microsoft
just by a smidge here the surface
headphones blacks out a very good amount
of background noises suppresses a lot of
the vocals and chatter around you
including that music they had blasting
in the background now regarding the
audio test blasting this around 70% vine
was comfortable and enjoyable listening
personally for me overall the audio
characteristics are very similar to the
Saudi 1000x m3s with the basic sound
signature any loud performance the
surface headphones is suitable for most
average consumers and those who
particularly prefer bass I will admit
though you might have heard this in a
demo but the mid-range is clear enough
but it is missing a bit of fidelity or
clarity there is a slight sense of that
mid-range being slightly recessed and
not having a clear separation from base
to the vocalist you could hear it when I
transition from Microsoft to boast but
transitioning from Microsoft is Sony the
difference then wasn't as drastic it's
only evident when you have them side by
side with the competition or heard
through my demo here but by itself I can
see most consumers experiencing mostly
positive audio performances now as for
the high notes I never had listening
fatigue the music never shrieked there's
a good bit of roll-off on the top and
preventing their headphones from being
tinny your ear piercing it is missing
that sparkle up top and simply
brightness overall on the headphone now
the one thing that I think was missing
was the amount of audio separation and
the soundstage I wish those were a
little bit more appearance the Sony
a little bit better and the Bo's did the
best here so in the end I don't think
these surface headphones hits this out
of the park as being the best out there
but if you personally value Cortana and
the always-on listening feature the
active noise-cancelling the audio
performance and you're big into using
Windows and its features I definitely
think you should check these out if you
don't care for katana and the always-on
listening feature just those two right
there I would say Sony provides slightly
better ANSI performance slightly better
audio performance and combine most other
ANSI headphones just simply waste less
and have longer battery life these
surface headphones are not in my top
three ANSI headphones but I can see them
being up there somewhere in the top five
again if you do value Cortana now it's
big enough top headphones next week I'll
be working on the best anti headphones
for the year so be on the lookout lest I
would be really interested in hearing
what you have to say in the comment
section below what do you think of these
surface headphones
all right folks hopefully this video
helped you in some way you guys take
care
catch you guys on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
