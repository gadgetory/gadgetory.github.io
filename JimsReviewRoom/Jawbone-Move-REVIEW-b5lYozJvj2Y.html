review room now a couple weeks ago I had
reviewed the misfit flash at the time it
was only $50 and provided practically
the same performance as the original
model the misfit shine
well jawbone has done the same with
their similar priced jawbone move but
with the same speculation ahead with the
misfit flash I'm sure they had to cut
corners somewhere to get this price down
this low well I'm here to find out what
it is so without further ado welcome to
Jim's review don't over the physical
features first you can see Jovan went
with a clasp instead of a wearable
wristband in their retail packaging
although jawbone does sell wrist straps
as a separate accessory online and I
think going with the clasp is a great
alternative if you don't need the extra
features of each job on up 3 and from a
brief comparison the job on up 24 is
identical in features with the move that
we have here so if you don't want to
wear a wristband that doesn't display at
a time the clasp is again a perfect
option the design is simple with the
brains of the unit separate from the
holder itself and inside the module
holds your supplied flat cell battery
now jawbone claims up to 6 months worth
of life and if you ever need to swap out
the battery it costs roughly three to
four dollars either on Amazon or at your
local Walmart but overall the design is
very simple with job on using TPU rubber
or what job one simplifies by explaining
its hypoallergenic rubber that's
completely latex free now it really just
feels like rubber more than silicone
used in the misfit flash offering a much
smoother feel the styling is one thing
and you can be the judge on how it looks
but the material does feel more
expensive you can say then The Misfits
version the clasp is very tight holding
on to clothing very well with running
and jogging posing no issues but the
only problem that I did notice is with
the white version that I have here
clamping this on my jeans has already
started to leave that blue dye on there
now this may end up looking a bit dingy
in the following months but jawbone does
offer four other color variations if you
decide not to go with white now as
really features it's very simple
offering OneTouch clicking to see your
progress first is this orange person
here indicating how far along you are to
complete
your activity goal for that day and
holding down the action button will
activate sleep mode right before you
sleep and holding it down once again
when you're awake we'll stop the clock
now tapping this twice will reveal LEDs
to determine the time with a solid lit
color being your hour hand and the
blinking light for the minute hand and
the last feature here is activating
workout mode now right before starting
your run or any other activity press
once then press again and hold it this
time and you'll see the orange Runner
blink to indicate you start your workout
now once you're done tap and hold it in
the same fashion and your data will be
saved into your app for viewing later
but before going into the Jawbone's app
here the band is only rain splash sweat
and shower resistant you can't swim with
this and in general you can't submerge
it under water
unless this does work with both Apple
and Android powered devices I had tested
the jawbone up24 last year and had the
opportunity to experience the app then
literally a whole year later and if
you've been an avid fan of Jim's review
room you've seen that I've tested many
if not all the mainstream bands on the
market today now I can still safely say
after all this experience I still
believe jawbone as a company has the
best app to offer for the average
consumer now going over the main screen
here which very much resembles an
activity feed like on Facebook or so
you're greeted with the most predominant
information which is sleep and activity
respectively both providing a real
number in relation to each but also a
percentage on how close you are to
hitting your goal a V tap on either one
of these tabs this is truly where I
believe jawbone outperforms on its
competitors not only is this very easy
to read on screen but the amount of
detail and information sleep is broken
down from light to deep sleep also an
indication on how fast I fell asleep in
and my total time in bed and you can see
my sleep isn't the most pleasant as our
little 8 month old daughter wakes up in
the middle of the night from time to
time but here scrolling further down
reveals your last 7 days to give you an
idea on how your week is progressing
Anna last item here in regards to sleep
you can scroll your fingers over the bar
chart which indicates the exact
time job on record light versus deep
sleep with its corresponding light and
darker blue colors and with the orange
color indicating time that you were
actually awake now going back out here
and clicking on your activity it's very
similar robust information you can see
active moments and how long you were
active for versus the longest time that
you've sat idle and sadly I do work at
the computer most of the day with a
workout normally around lunch so my
chart and information is it the most
flattering but going back out here onto
the main page right below the tabs is
your date to switch back and forth in
between your data and below that again
is a nifty information window give you
hints about your health but also generic
facts that really seems interesting now
going below are your actions that's
taken so far for that day and this
includes everything from the affirmation
sleeping activity but also food exercise
and mood logging which I'll show you
shortly again think of this like an
activity fee that you see on most social
media apps everything from the most
recent descends in order going down now
on your current day you can press on
this plus sign here to manually add your
activity now first is your exercise in
which you can click your activity type
performed like biking cardio tennis
basketball etc and there's a slew of
them and then you manually adjust your
effort level and select your duration
now this will eventually give you an
estimated calories burned to be placed
on your chart for a bit more detailed
data logging and as stated earlier you
can start the workout session right from
the band itself by pressing once on your
band and then pressing and holding again
now going back out here next is the mood
indicator that you personally slide up
or down to record how you're feeling at
that very moment it's a good way to keep
track of how you're feeling and once you
become more aware
you'll probably be more conscious to
strive for a better mood in general down
the road
now the next category is a huge plus and
I don't recall any other activity band
with this built-in most people can work
around this by using the MyFitnessPal
app which is a great app by itself but
having jawbone provide this is very
convenient it's a food lager and it's a
very good one at that now type in what
you had for lunch and for example had
the Asiago sandwich from Panera Bread
and it finds it for me and all I have to
do is click Add
saves it to the top-right holding it
there and I continue adding in any other
items that have had maybe chips or a
soft drink but if I happen to forget and
continue to press to the next screen to
finish up and the bottom here also
includes these side items that Panera
actually offers at their restaurant
specifically the kettle chips and again
the drink now I have that all together
tap the plus sign again on top and
that's basically it
now if you're the type of person that
counts your intake this new green tab
here in the main screen is now available
now tap that and look at all this
information now I personally like to
watch my sodium and sugar intake and
again it's all there
anyone that's bulking up you can watch
the protein intake for the entire day
but again there's more to this actually
now going back to the ahead of food
screen here you can say if you're on
your smartphone
popular restaurants and some local
restaurants where you're standing at are
also picked up and you can browse their
menu and add items with their nutrition
facts calculated in but wait again as we
all know eating out is it the most
healthiest but you can always type in
apples manually or type in the dish that
you've made for example like chicken
parmesan and you can adjust the servings
to your choosing and by any chance if
you have a package you can also scan the
UPC code and this will also provide you
everything off of the nutrition label
and yes for my random tests on items at
home it's accurate and it's worked on a
bag of popcorn - a snack bag of
cranberries - a bag of potato chips all
right here enough on food here going
back to the main page and that plus sign
once again here you can enter in your
weight from time to time and you can
personally see how your weight is
fluctuating in relation to what you're
physically doing or eating of course you
would have to manually enter this in
again either on a daily basis or at your
choosing and last year if you forget to
tell the job on move you're going to
sleep you can manually enter it in from
this menu option here and now finishing
up this full featured app here the menu
on the top left opens your profile in
which I believe only one profile can be
assigned to the app you can't have
several family members with a move uses
one app on this one device now I wasn't
able to confirm this by the time I had
this video up with jawbone but from what
I could tell I believe that's the case
now if I'm wrong please correct me in
the comments below
or message me on my Facebook now the
next setting are for your goals you can
adjust what you personally want to
achieve and unlike garments auto or what
they call SMART goals these goals do not
adjust based on your previous
performance automatically again you have
to manually change this to push yourself
if needed next up here is trends and
basically it's very helpful by providing
a historical view of your previous days
weeks or months worth of performance but
what's even more interesting you can
compare two sets of data to one another
by tapping the bar graph icon on the top
right you can select for example your
weight compared to your calories burn
that's logged by the move that way you
can see if your efforts are really
making a difference or not now would
have been really interesting to see more
than just one set or more than two sets
of data I'm sorry like food intake and
calories burned in relation to weight
loss but having this nonetheless is
something I haven't seen on any other
app I believe now going back out here
and clicking on team you can add friends
or online friends to share and compare
your numbers with to help motivate you
when others are doing better than you or
if you're just in a competitive nature
and you just want to beat everybody that
you have on that list now if you do add
those random friends that you see that
I'm doing so here of course they have to
accept your friend invite first though
before you guys can actually see each
other's data and now the very last
feature here job one works in
conjunction with third party apps and
it's astonishing with the amount of apps
it has to offer from the ever-popular
My Fitness Pal RunKeeper and Strava to
name a few all the data talks to the job
on app and vice versa and I'll lead the
screen playing so you can see what is
available and basically what's not now
as I mentioned earlier in this video
I've tested many bands over the year in
jawbone somehow almost hits it perfectly
on the head now this job on move doesn't
vibrate or has any alarms or smart
alarms it doesn't read your heart rates
but those aren't cons of this product I
would say this is such a simple device
for the basics but for only fifty
dollars it's the cheapest admission
ticket you can say to what I believe is
the best app for the general health
conscious consumer and yes I believe
this beats out the misfit flash so
that's it for this video I hope this
video helped you in some way if you do
like my work be sure to add me gyms
view room on Facebook Twitter Instagram
and also on Google+ to get updates from
me and updates on items I'm testing out
before I actually put them on the
website again this is Jimmy with Jim's
review room you guys take care and I'll
see you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
