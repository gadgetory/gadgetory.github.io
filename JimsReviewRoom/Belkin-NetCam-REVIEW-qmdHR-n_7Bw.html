preview her I bought the Dropcam last
year as a baby monitor and today it
still works great but I wanted to
revisit what's on the market now since
several other manufacturers have joined
in on the competition with various price
points of course
now although Belkin does make several
different tiers of network cameras I'll
be using their cheaper model priced at
just $99 as of this video just see what
a lower end product just in general may
offer I will also review a mid tier
model the d-link pan and tilt priced at
169 as of this video and you can find
that as well on that website so without
further ado i'm here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review the Belkin net cam is very
simple offering the camera itself the
power adapter and some wall mounting
screws that's practically it it's very
light with an adjustable base and
adjustable neck offering a full 360
degree rotation and a full 180 degrees
in tilt now finding the right location
and angle wouldn't be an issue overall
the neck can be tightened down and
because the camera is so light the
camera stays fixed in its arrangement
now on the back of the camera you have
your power input and the Ethernet port
if you decide not to go wireless
but speaking about its connection here
its strength has been quite impressive
leaving this downstairs and on the other
side of the house from where my router
is it never disconnected or shown any
horrible skipped frames now I'm sure
everyone's experience will be a little
bit different but if you have a good
router with good signal strength I think
you should be fine so overall the
physical build is quite simple and it's
very straightforward and I can say it's
the same with setting up the device it's
actually similar to what I experienced
with Dropcam very fluid
download the app which works on but with
Apple and Android powered devices plug
in the camera then set up a Belkin I D
or an account and that's practically it
it connects automatically once you sign
in now this is where I start noticing
the budget price tag being reflected not
saying it's a bad thing but if you're
shopping for a camera here are some
things that you should consider now
right off the bat their resolution on
this one here and many budget models
goes up to a maximum of 640 by 480
that's basically standard resolution
some people may be fine with it and that
basically fits their needs into the
attaced for standard resolution it's if
you're not comparing to any other
competitor out there
it looks fine during the day but me
being jim's reviewer here here's a quick
comparison first is Belkin of course
second is the mid grade d-link that
shows a 720p resolution and last year is
the almighty drop cam that started this
all this also comes in only 720p as well
now all three models were at the same
distance from the router and what I
noticed first besides the resolution
here is the wideness of the lens it's a
bit more narrow showing 64 degrees of
horizontal viewing now keep in mind the
resolution stated earlier is also a 4 by
3 aspect ratio it's not widescreen now
second here with the more expensive
models both the d-link and Dropcam you
can pinch and pull to zoom in and out
now of course this being standard
definition zooming in would make the
image quality more pixelated but keep
that in mind if this is something that
you'd need to consider but if you're
utilizing this maybe for a warehouse or
maybe someplace that High Definition
isn't really needed the video you see
doesn't look too bad again for a
standard definition now also as
important is the audio how clear can it
pick up sounds now from my testing is
not as sensitive as I'd like you can
still hear faint noises but it's faint
at best
it's not as clear or amplified as the
other brands that I've tested and each
time you start a video feed to hear the
video footage now you have to click on
this speaker button it's not automated
each time you open the app but while
we're down here on the screen the left
button allows you to snap a quick photo
of what's being viewed and it saves it
right on to your phone now as for a
video
I wish Dropcam offered this but Belkin
allows you to record your current video
with the tap of that metal button no
sadly and likely $200 drop cam pro it
doesn't come with a built-in SD card
slot to record footage right on the
camera itself all that would very much
come in handy when motion is detected
and utilizing that feature now Belkin on
the other hand
offer cloud recording basically storing
photos and video off sites on Belkin and
its third-party servers but if you ever
read the fine print only video recording
is reserved for the HD models for this
standard definition model only photos
are backed up and similar to many other
brands the cloud recording is not free
and is considered a premium service now
the last several features before showing
off the night vision test the net cam
offers motion detection as stated
earlier as soon as someone or something
walks into the field of view of the
camera the net cam does alert you via
email but not through a push
notification like drop cam is not too
bad since you're receiving an email
alerts but a push notification would
have been a bit simpler push
notifications is only available if you
sign up for the again cloud recording
now let's look at the night vision
performance now placing this in a
pitch-black room just like the drop cam
I'm shocked by the performance it allows
you to see all the way across the room
while some other competitors only work
up to a certain distance and I'll omit
the image is a bit darker than some
others but you can be the judge and
determine that this is enough for you or
not so overall for the price of $99 it's
seriously on the lower end of things and
giving credit for being a low-end device
it still performs what it claims to do
and still offered from my experience
excellent connection in smooth video now
I do admit the audio is lacking but if
that's not your concern and if you're
understanding the resolution is not high
definition it's not a bad consideration
so hope this video helped you in some
way if you like my work be sure to add
me gyms review room onto Facebook
Twitter or Instagram you can see what
items I'm working on behind the scenes
before I put them on the website again
this is Jimmy with Jim's review room you
guys take care and I'll see you in the
next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
