flagship the LG g4 makes some subtle
changes to what was already an
impressive phone from last year but are
those subtle changes enough despite the
drastic changes we've seen with other
manufacturers now everything sounds
great on paper offering some of the best
of the best specs with some so far
really great reviews specifically about
the camera and the screen now with that
being said and pricing isn't too bad as
I anticipate this to be $200 on contract
here in the United States and $600 off
contract just like the g3 from last year
now as my followers know I really do
test these in world world situations and
present them to the average consumer as
best I can so I'm here to help you make
a purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room
getting right into it the g4 touches big
phone territory with a 5.5 inch display
not the biggest screen considering the
note 4 comes in at 5.7 inches but not
the smaller screen as the galaxy s6 and
HTC m9 comes in at five point one and
five inches respectively now the
dimensions are also on the screen coming
in at five point nine inches tall three
inches wide and what possibly some would
say hearing this may be an issue a
thickness of nine point eight
millimeters now indeed side by side with
most other phones it is just slightly
thicker but because of the edges being
tapered normal real-world experience
your palm will actually sense the phone
as being thin well that's slight bulge
in the middle where your hand cups you
really won't even feel it
matter of fact having this in my pocket
didn't feel much difference either and
this shouldn't be much noticeable to the
average consumer to be honest and for
those who never owned a bigger phone
having this in my pockets sitting down
getting up never did the phone feel like
a brick in my pants but aesthetically
here this is all plastic construction
although the removable back plate of
mine is called metal craft it still
feels like again plastic now I
personally like to look though that is
different and more modern but it just
doesn't feel as nice as I expected but
LG is being very smart here offering
very premium back plates specifically
real cowhide turn into leather with
different dies now I haven't been able
to obtain one but from the announcement
of LG they have used nothing but the
most premium leather that they could
find so that should feel really
interesting but on the sides and top
virtually no buttons just an infrared
transmitter for changing your channels
here on your TV which I absolutely love
and on the bottom is a micro USB port
for charging and transferring data from
your phone to PC and vice versa and last
year before going into the hardware and
performance the rear has your volume and
power buttons again for the average
consumers out there at first it is
unusual but I quickly became accustomed
to this after a few days of use now in
the very bottom house to this speaker in
which it's loud enough and despite being
on the rear your hand cups when holding
the phone it doesn't truly block out
that one speaker now more importantly
here on the back is this camera that
everyone has been talking about it
features a crazy low one
point-eight f-stop allowing for tons of
light to enter into the camera sensor in
turn providing better low-light
performance as a 16 megapixel camera
with superb optical image stabilization
more so than my Samsung Note for
preventing blurry photos from shaky
hands and lasses the focusing system
provided by LG using lasers to measure
distance offering faster zooms and
pinpoint accuracy or so they claim
overall it's a super fast camera minimal
to no lag at all with those burst shots
in pulling up photos in gallery mode
right after taking a photo here was not
an issue at all even on the back side of
the phone here with the screen off
pressing the volume button down twice
brings up the camera right away and it
takes a photo allowing you to never miss
a shot now here's a few photos I've
personally taken around the city with
zero editing and I'll admit the g4 does
take more accurate photos with what the
real world looks like the color palette
is nearly identical to what you would
see in person now this review isn't a
direct comparison with these Samsung
Note 4 but it's the only phone that I
currently own at the moment and it's
always nice to have something to compare
to now with that being said Samsung does
provide a warmer photo with a bump in
color saturation now some may prefer
this right out the box while others
prefer again the more natural style but
one thing I did notice I wish the g4
would do a bit better was its sharpness
now photo after photo I ensure this was
in focus and in the right areas as they
note for but yet it's still not sharp
where there are the supermarkets or
outdoors looking at some buildings
colors looked great for the most part in
regards to accuracy but the sharpness
was a bit lacking I haven't decided to
shoot down at the flat ground to ensure
the focusing isn't aimed sporadically
and still you can see the evidence in
the photos now the only other issue that
I found in regards to the photo quality
was the overblown highlights now if you
look at the clouds and this photo but
details are lost comparing that to again
the note 4 you can see the details are
retained
now you also see some of this fool with
very bright light sources as well and
although there's slightly blown out at
night it's the night photos in general
where the g4 really shines that most
areas are very well lit and colors do
look great dark areas have minimal
amounts of noise present and this photo
here of this church is a perfect
ample now in auto mode just like the
rest of the photos that I've taken so
far not the best picture in the world
considering it's an auto again but
compared to the note 4 look at that sky
more noises on the Samsung and the
overall picture just looks more grainy
when compared side-by-side now one of
the biggest positives about the g4
there's manual mode you can adjust
practically anything in manual mode like
a full-blown DSLR from shutter speed ISO
levels aperture etc and you just can't
adjust saturation or sharpness though
which is odd however the g4 even allows
you to shoot in RAW files removing the
compression that you normally see with
JPEG photos in turn allowing you to edit
photos with greater flexibility more
options to work with and yes the ability
to sharpen your images then in Photoshop
or a Lightroom and with that being said
and despite those two areas of sharpness
and slightly overblown highlights the
image quality and color accuracy are
still well-done on a phone in general
it's only better if not one of the best
ones out there due to its low light
performance and features of manually
controlling their shots and it wasn't
talked about much the g4 is able to
record video in 3840 by 2160 at 30
frames per second so yes viewers this
can record video in 4k and it is very
sharp and the colors look great in video
mode more so than I believe versus the
photos it takes but overall the video
aspect works out well I also tested the
image stabilization that's why you see
me walking with the camera here it's a
little bit shaky but video wise here it
does ok but the optical image
stabilization works darn well when
taking photos but right now enough about
camera since it was such a huge focus
from LG I'm going to move behind the lid
here for the time being the g4 offers
what's sadly now some phones that don't
even offer that's a removable battery I
know there's debate on that but in my
defense I have had phones too
rechargeable keyboards and mice is fail
after so many recharging cycles
not everyone replaces their phones every
few months saying some actually still
buy old or used phones too but the other
great option here is the expandable
memory it's up to 2 terabytes that's
with 80 who has a built-in microSD card
slots again some others are not offering
theirs as well but let's rotate you only
make
selling points here the screen 5.5
inches offering a flagship resolution
just like last year of 2560 by 1440
that's 538 pixels per inch for an ultra
sharp display there's no question about
that
but what's even more intriguing gear
from my test is its color accuracy
there's a 25% increase in brightness
from the last model 50% increase in
contrast and 56% improved color
reproduction now my test when putting
another device side-by-side really does
prove the screen having brighter whites
deeper blacks and the colors are just
rich with accuracy so if you decide to
purchase this or I already have one you
know how good your screen is now as
important and moving into the internal
side of things
LG features the latest Android as of
this video that's android 5.1 but there
is an LG overlay now it's not intrusive
in my opinion it's not heavy or bloated
to slow the phone down and overall it
flows in my opinion nicely now under the
hood LG went with the snapdragon 808
chipset with three gigs of ram which is
no slouch either playing games watching
movies on netflix to multitasking with
its dual window mode all went without a
hitch
no dual window allows you to run two
compatible apps simultaneously no other
features unique to the g4 are it's smart
notice under the weather widget here
indicating unintentional apps you have
in the background that may be draining
your battery or something as convenient
as reminders and weather forecasts later
that evening now sliding all the way to
the left here has your smart bulletin
which I found pretty useful providing
very much a summary for that day
including LG's health app that tracks
your steps a calendar of your current
schedule and last I want to point out is
these smart settings now LG provides
this great mode that depending on your
location settings will change
automatically for you example if I leave
the house here I can have the Wi-Fi
signal turn off automatically or if I'm
away from the house here I can have the
volume levels up higher to compensate
for that noise when you go into the city
an additional feature that comes with
the phone here is free and no
third-party apps needed is free built-in
tethering now you can make your phone a
hotspots and have other devices around
you connect to it that's something I
personally need from time to time
if I'm working remotely so with all this
horsepower and power management the
battery life is on par with other
flagships from my experience under
moderate amounts of use and this was on
the day that I went up recording that
video and taking all those photos that
you've seen earlier and of course using
the web the battery lasted a little over
24 hours with three of those hours and
screen on time now if you come to the
acceptance of recharging your phone
every night there shouldn't be an issue
per se and with my testing from a near
dead battery using the supplied wall
adapter here the battery recharges in
exactly two hours and lasts about the
battery here it does get slightly warm
when playing games and doing some you
know processor intensive tasks here as
evidence when I first started using the
phone and downloading all those app
simultaneously but when you're video
recording that's when it actually really
gets hot but overall from my experience
with this phone the feature that comes
with this - the features retained that's
the removable battery the microSD card
slots quad HD screen offering tethering
4k video recording which others have yet
to mention here the camera as well but
more specifically the manual mode in RAW
files just a name off some of the
stellar offerings I believe makes this a
very competitive phone for 2015 and
actually now just coming to mind here
that five and a half inch display it's
actually built on a smaller footprint
compared to other competitors on the
market but anyways here with everything
being said I believe it does overshadow
some of its minor shortcomings as
mentioned earlier in this review so I
believe if you're in the market looking
for a phone definitely look into the LG
g4 and get that leather backing so hope
