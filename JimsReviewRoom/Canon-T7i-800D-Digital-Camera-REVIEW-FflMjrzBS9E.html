room the rebel series has been one the
most popular dslr's for beginners and
amateurs out there many of those just
getting into photography in film school
and even starting out with YouTube goes
towards this lineup because they're easy
to use very much functional for the
beginners out there and it's a great way
to get started with Canon lenses and
bodies today we're looking at the brand
new t7 eye or the 800 D in other parts
of the world and this was released in
2017 and should have a lifespan of
around two years before the t8 eye is
released this one is priced at seven
hundred and fifty dollars and just for
the body only on B&amp;amp;H photo calm and $850
if you decide to buy the kit which
includes the 18 to 55 millimeter lens
I'll leave my affiliate links in the
video description below click on those
links and they will give you the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
so without further ado I channels here
to help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's review room
before getting started all my videos are
for the average consumer I'm taking a
look at this camera as someone that's
new getting into photography and or
using it for video for YouTube etc and
seeing how it fares so first I'm going
over the physical features the p7 is
super lightweight here it's aerodynamic
and seven generations in everything is
solid and built well for beginners
camera is going to feel like a
beginner's camera with a reinforced
super smooth plastic but they used here
it's understandable for this price range
that it doesn't feel as premium or it
doesn't feel as diesel or well-built
with an aluminum frame and such but one
area that I would critique is where my
palm rest when holding the t7 I by my
side there were times when the camera
feels ever so slightly slippery nothing
detrimental and nothing to prevent you
from buying but something I want to
point out additional textured grip on
this area would have helped a lot now
looking up top you have your typical
buttons laid out on your screen please
feel free to pause the video if you need
to but to turn on and off the camera or
to go into video recording its toggled
by this switch here at the very top you
have a hot shoe to mount your microphone
or lights and moving to the left side
here are your inputs now there's no
cables provided in the box so make sure
you buy USB cord yourself or have a SD
card reader on hand a mini USB and mini
HDMI port are available to connect the
camera here to your PC or a TV monitor
respectively and to the left under the
smaller flap there's a port to connect a
remote control and last is an audio
input for your microphone there's no
headphone or earphones out port to bond
it to your audio and that's pretty
typical in this price range for DSLRs
and mirrorless cameras now while we're
still on the left side here there's NFC
pairing which I love on every camera
here perfect for those heavy into social
media take a photo tap your NFC enabled
phone on the side of the t-seven eye and
have the file transfer to your phone
instantly from here just edit and post
now getting back to the camera rotating
to the right side down just a cover for
your SD card and then on the bottom of
the camera its threaded so you can use a
tripod to the right is the battery cover
flap looking at the rear it's very much
straightforward you'll see all these
buttons on most cameras the unique
buttons would be the Wi-Fi button which
when press allows you to send your
added to your phone laptop to your
printer even or up to the web depending
on your wireless setup the other unique
button here is the cue button for quick
access to certain menus and features on
the camera now looking at that
touchscreen display it's 3 inches in
sides with the ability to swivel out
flip to a selfie or fogging orientation
and can be converted flush against the
back for viewing now the screen is
bright and I'm impressed by how visible
it is outdoors and in direct sunlight my
2500 plus sony a7s to that screen
doesn't even perform as well now the
touch interface is sensitive enough and
thankfully the screen doesn't feel
plasticky and flexes during my presses
it's solid and responsive now looking
into its menus and interface it's quite
simple here it can be overwhelming for
some coming from their smartphone let's
say and purchasing any DSLR for the
first time but with the t7 eye it
includes these little pop-ups that gives
you a briefing of what each setting
means and what it does it's not a full
explanation I'll omit that but something
right then and there without the need to
flip through the manual overall very
much intuitive the menus flow smoothly
it regards to camera performance the t7
I make some decent improvements across
the board most noticeably there's 45
cross-type autofocus points versus 19
during my time testing the t6 i from a
year or two ago now with 45 points the
auto focusing system covers more of the
sensor covers more of the image so when
you're pointing and shooting the camera
locked on very fast and you have more
precision on what you want the camera to
focus on for those getting into video
the t6i and 7i gives you smooth flowing
autofocus as well it's one of the
reasons why I would get this / Nikon and
I'm personally a Nikon user myself now
you also have the ability to simply tap
on the screen and the Canon locks onto
the object or person that you selected
here and it keeps it sharp while you
move about and around now with my time
testing it does moderately well Khasra
movements keeps it locked on all
slightly more aggressive moves does call
it the t7 I to lose its anchor point you
can say no other quick improvements
worth mentioning before I show you
samples the t7 I gets up to 6 frames per
second for photography versus 5 from the
t6 I
there's a new image processor the digit
7 and less regarding video you get 1080
resolution with high dynamic range but
this time you have 24 30 and 60 frames
per second of video recording but the
t6i in previous models it was up to 30
frames at the 1080 resolution so getting
into the photos samples here keep in
mind all photos we're taking in auto
mode as this video is catered to the
average consumer if I did take any
photos in menu mode I'm surely going to
indicate for you on the screen now first
up that's heading the whitewater rafting
center and snapping some photos the
image looks great the photos are rich in
color the high dynamic range keeps the
clouds intact without blowing them out
and using the supplied 18 to 55
millimeter lens the wideness in this
shot looks phenomenal I think now here's
another photo though with a gorgeous
background sun's coming down and the t7
eye captures once again some gorgeous
colors now if you look at the for long
chairs right in the middle the image the
chairs looking vibrant now moving on to
some photos during lunch with any DSLR
you get some nice focus photos in the
forefronts with that blurred image in
the background depending on your
aperture now one thing I did notice that
there aren't times when photos taken in
auto mode slightly blows out the image
now looking at this next photo here at
first glance these fries look fine well
actually there's sweet potatoes put
carefully looking you can see the image
is a little too bright but here let me
switch to a better example here's a
photo in auto mode and this is what it
looks like in manual mode now automotive
once again on another photo and
switching over to manual mode to
properly compensate this is what it
looks like when properly done now one
more shot here just in case as you can
see it's slightly blown out here and
this is what it looks like when properly
exposed keep in mind this doesn't happen
every time most of my time testing the
photos turned out great but what it does
happen it is noticeable now here's some
night shots with auto mode you do get
some noise in your images but it does
quite well obviously this wouldn't be an
image for a photo shoot or professional
magazine but for everyday average
consumer use this is impressive
I also want to throw this up there
colors are still done well the sky looks
great in the staging areas brightness is
bad
with the rest of the image at least for
this shot but going back to I stated
earlier once in a while in auto mode you
get this blow up unfortunately now once
properly set up in manual mode you get
much better reasonable shots like this
one last stuff is video performance the
auto focus worked very well for my test
whether focusing on me and my face here
or focusing on an object also with that
flip-out screen this helped tremendously
for those self shoots here I also did
leave it on auto mode and colors were
vibrant but at times a helmet that's a
little too vibrant here I also noticed
when walking under varying lights such
as in my office from under the lights in
the ceiling to another area it takes a
while for the t-seven eye to adjust if
you do have the proper lighting and you
do intend on keeping the camera
stationary maybe on a tripod or so the
video looks great in my opinion at that
time if you're into sitting on using
this for vlogging walking outdoors in
the shade outside etc the varying
brightness alone might be a deal killer
for some the last the onboard microphone
which I never recommend anyone to use
but surprisingly it sounds good for
built-in microphones for a DSLR camera
here's a quick sample pretty cool also
let me know in the comment section below
what do you guys think about the colors
what do you guys think about the video
quality back there the lighting and also
natural skin tones would this be
something that you would use right out
the box and basically upload directly to
YouTube or make videos from I guess be
interested to see what you guys would
use this camera for all right so that's
it for this review here I hope it helped
