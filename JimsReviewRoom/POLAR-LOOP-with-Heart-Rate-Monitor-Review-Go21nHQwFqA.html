review by Jim's review room today we
will be looking at the polar loop and
this model is priced at $99 at the time
of this review and for those who don't
know polar has been around for some time
and specializes in heart rate monitors
for the fitness community and we joined
their products have been a watch style
device but the loop in this case works
as a band in connection with your
smartphone providing visual data and
record-keeping so without further ado
we'll get started the band itself is a
silicone rubber like material with
chrome accents and featuring a metal
buckle type fastener as well
there is a simple LED display that
lights up with indications on your
progress such as calories burned steps
taken the time any bar that fills up
throughout your day indicating on how
much more activity to reach your goals
now after the bar is displayed the polar
loop tells you how many minutes of
jogging or how many minutes of walking
that you need to do to reach your goal
which I thought was really handy because
at the end of the day just knowing a few
more minutes of jogging or walking can
get me to where I need to be and the
inner part of the band there is a data
port for syncing the loop to your
computer and it's also used for charging
and polar does provide its proprietary
cable for connecting which is magnetized
to stay together with the band but be
rest assured although this connection is
exposed though polar states this band is
waterproof meaning you can shower with
this and even wear this while swimming
now keep in mind the polar loop does
have bluetooth technology so you can
wirelessly sync your data with your
phone or device then one of the big
benefits unlike some of the other
popular bands out there this works on
both Apple and Android powered devices
now in regards to battery life polar
claims up to five days of news and for
my tests that's accurate
looking at my progress casually
throughout the day and taking my data
every other day early on about day five
the polar loop indicated that the band
needed to be recharged with about 10
percent of juice remaining and lastly
polar states this will hold 12 days
worth of data so if you forget the
sinker information for a few days it's
no problem at all
now the band has been very comfortable
to wear as it's very lightweight the
band only comes in one size though and
you do have to trim the band at home to
fit your wrists it's a pretty
straightforward process but I don't work
with watches too often so taking the
pins in and out was a slight nuisance
though and of course be sure to cut a
little bit at a time if you're unsure
now I do wear this all day and even to
sleep and it really feels like a light
watch almost at times forgetting that
it's there the only issues I ran across
were not big that would basically deter
me from purchasing this again but it's
worth mentioning though the metal buckle
does hold the band very secure though
however it does scratch over time
causing some blemishes it's only a
cosmetic issue though the inner band I
noticed because it's dimpled does
collect some soap scum than others other
nasty gunk more easier than some of the
other bands out there in the market and
lastly the button information at first
was very stiff a firm press is needed to
display the information tapping and
tapping hard does not work but a press
doesn't work for you one way I worked
around this was sliding my finger over
the button instead of pressing which
yielded better results and I noticed
over time the button did become a bit
more reasonable to sensitivity so issues
stated again they are there but not a
huge downfall in my opinion but
something I believe that's as important
or maybe even more important are the
features and it's software that the
product possesses now what's unique
about the polar loop it records
automatically for you on screen is the
main page you'll see on your smartphone
or tablet
and the hand clock shown has a ring that
fills throughout the day with different
color bands as you can see towards the
bottom of the screen indicates what each
color-coded band represents and the
amount of time spent doing so now why is
for sleep or resting while sitting down
is great
and the band can differentiate from
light standing work walking
to full-on running and intense
activities now scrolling down here a
little bit further shows the percentage
of how close you are to your goal and
suggestions on what you can do to reach
that goal for that day and the very last
segment here shows how many calories
burned steps taken how long you were
considered as active and how much sleep
you obtained and regarding sleep
monitoring I was not too impressed
because the sleep monitoring records
only for that day it starts at 12
o'clock midnight regardless if you slept
at 11 p.m. the night before so if you're
in early sleeper and want to view your
data there's no information and the
entire night's sleep as a whole since
it's not there you have to scroll back a
day and piece the data together yourself
and real quick here if you've been
inactive basically not moving for a
certain period of time this will show
how many times you're inactive
throughout the day in over the course of
time your goals will change based on
your profile height and age will be
inputted once you download the app but
your weight also changes ever so often
here and this will of course change this
set goes automatically to keep you
continually becoming fit so going back
onto the main page here the will is a
different style to the other bands I've
reviewed it works in ways that you can
see your entire day at a quick glance
and where and how active you've been I
really like the fact that it can
differentiate me from being casually
active to moderately active just a bit
more precision in my day in speaking of
precision though like many other bands
when you're weightlifting or let's say
if you're into yoga those movements are
not as physical where your wrist is
flying everywhere like a lot of the
current bands out right now they're
great for being active and moving around
like joggers walkers playing basketball
or tennis etc but relying is to count
how many calories burned when you're
lifting dumbbells and one set consists
of only eight to ten movements that's
probably not the best but that's where
polar as a company comes in as I stated
earlier polar is known for the heart
monitors and I had the loop for several
days first and really didn't find too
much benefit compared to the other
activity bands out there and I quickly
found out it didn't have a built-in
heart rate monitor either the loop works
in conjunction with one though
so how to purchase the polar loop h7
heart monitor for $80 at the logo
and I know it's another expense but
after playing around with this if you're
buying a polar you have to have a heart
monitor as well just to get the best
data and the results back and
considering the competition the new
Garmin vivofit is $120 without the heart
rate monitor and 170 dollars with 1and
basis has a built-in heart rate monitor
as well right on the wrist strap and
that's priced at 200
so this polar combination is right in
the middle in regards to price and from
what I can tell a chest strap is
possibly the best and most accurate way
to have your pulse read in real time now
getting back on track here about reading
accuracy and precision before I had the
heart rate monitor the chart would show
I am just low to moderate ly active when
I'm lifting weights my heart is actually
much more active than that though
although it's not cardio my heart rate
is on average about 130 beats per minute
the loop alone can't tell that and when
I'm lifting it only counts the movements
on my wrist which is minimal the loop
again working connection with the heart
rate monitor records myself now as being
an intense activity now after each set I
would look down and press the ban and
this will indicate my beats per minute
in real-time when I performed em one
hundreds cardio basically my beats per
minute averaged around a little over a
hundred and fifty now it's calculating
more accurately and how many calories I
burned and a true visual representation
on how active I was better than other
bands out there now going back here the
top right features a calendar where you
can compare yourself in a broader sense
to see if some weeks or months are
better than others and how you can
recover if you had some bad weeks or so
now to the left is the options menu to
change settings and your profile with
the activity tab being your main page
where we were just on now the training
summer is only shown or available if you
do have the heart rate monitor and I've
just purchased a monitor recently so I
don't have too much data but you can see
this measures for the week but once you
click on the individual training session
there's a lot of information to make you
self reflect to maintain or do better
next time and I'm the average guy so my
numbers are not stellar but you can see
over my workout time how much I was
pushing myself in the top and bottom
areas of the line chart indicates where
I'm just
FAT to areas where I'm actually getting
fit as well now scroll down to the end
and there's numeric information being
present any small paragraph and how
Paulo things that you're doing now
backing up from here and then tapping on
the info tab reviews how they'd use the
loop which is pretty straightforward and
lastly on the options menu is settings
to change your profile as needed in
regards to weight height and if you're
male or female at the time so the loop
by itself is okay too decent for the
price that you pay but you read the true
benefits you have to buy that heart rate
monitor once bought this combination is
ideal if you're in the market for an
activity band
and you also do workouts that maybe
doesn't involve too much wrist movement
so I hope you enjoy this review of the
polar loop and the heart rate monitor h7
