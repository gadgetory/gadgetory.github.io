review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at my personal headset on use
for gaming they Tritton ax pros this
particular model features true Dolby
Digital 5.1 surround sound coming from
eight total individual speakers four
from each ear Cup the ax pros is
connectable to any digital source such
as pcs DVDs Xbox Xbox 360 Playstation 2
and PlayStation 3 in this review I'll
show you how it's connected its features
its construction and how I personally
feel about the performance here I
connect the headset into its in-line
audio controller and from there I
connect it into the digital audio
decoder the digital decoder offers Dolby
Digital Dolby Pro Logic for converting
to channel stereo sound into simulated
5.1 surround sound lastly is dynamic
range controller also known as a DRC
which assists with lowering loud noises
and increases quiet noises so a more
balanced volume is achieved and a side
of the decoder you have manual controls
to convert the audio to your setup the
settings you see there are currently
what I have from my personal gaming
system the decoder box does have 5.1
analog outputs on its side and the wire
is supplied by Triton as well USB
connection and optical in on one side
and the other side has two outputs for
two a X Pro headsets to be connected the
coda box is also in the same silver
finish as the headset and as well as the
inline audio controller here the end of
the inline controller has two
connections one goes directly into the
decoder the other will go into its power
source which I connect here
the power adapter off-screen has two
ends one end needs to power the decoder
box the other goes into the headset line
this headset does require a lot of power
as you can see the decoder box lights up
in a neon blue light color the inline
audio control lights up as well with
different colored LEDs for night gaming
the color of LED indicates the volume
you currently have set and in this close
up each button controls the volume for
its respective name I can independently
increase the value in a subwoofer or
increase my rears to hear people
sneaking around behind me behind the
audio controller or corresponding colors
to value the last two wires to connect
are the optical cable and the USB cable
which both connects from your decoder to
your gaming system
I found this headset to have ample
wiring which is great for those who have
large rooms yes so much wiring that it
does cause somewhat of a mess I've
counted at 12 5 connections around my
decoder box alone transport for this
headset might be a bit of a hassle
because of that however considering
other flagship headsets they're similar
an amount of wiring as well - the
turtlebeach px files which are wireless
though I've had this headset for a year
now and they're still going ahead long
and strong their ear cups still swivel
in and out and they still fit to the
contour of my head the headset itself
clicks and continues to stay locked
there's no unwanted adjustments during
gameplay which I would expect from a
premium headset the headset does flex to
assist with fitment to the user however
doesn't clamp on your noggin too much to
cause discomfort I was afraid the expose
was too big and too heavy but it's
actually light the top band is extremely
light with a foam pad which you can
remove and replace the foam ear cups you
see I have news for a year and have yet
to flake rip or tear they're still soft
and supportive to my ears the headset is
connected to a three-and-a-half
millimeter microphone as seen here the
microphone exterior is made of what
feels like a hard rubber and as and the
very tip is plastic the microphone feels
very sturdy and stiff
the microphone is easily detachable as
it is attachable as seen here it lacks
in place securely and does not fall out
over time and as you can see the hard
rubber prevents the mic from bending too
much some people might not like that but
in my case it's it's fine to me and here
I'd show detaching the microphone and
also each side of the Tritons have
detachable outer casings with a Triton's
tee logos they light up orange when in
use and can be visible at night
besides the foam ear cups the X pros
comes with faux leather replacement ear
pads and headband pads as well in the
box again this unit is surprisingly
light for a size build construction is
top-notch and as for the aesthetics they
do look a little bit clunky in space age
but some may something like the look and
some may not in general yeah it's up to
your discretion after wearing the
headset for extensive call of duty
sessions after about 3 hours usually I
personally start feeling it weighing
down on my head a little bit but the
discomfort is only slight though but in
general it's still a nuisance
nonetheless now because the ear cups are
so big it's difficult to put the headset
around my neck to rest instead I have to
take off the headset completely and set
aside one flaw did see is the ear cups
don't swivel to offer a additional
adjustment it only rocks back and forth
or up and down all in all the
construction fitment is very well made
although there are a lot of wires Triton
does provide all the wires in its
packaging this includes the optical wire
USB cable 5.1 analog cables on asset row
face right there power adapters Dakota
box and the headset itself in addition
the extra faux leather earpads it had
been pads are a plus as for the
performance this headset offers a great
base for those loud and deep explosions
this is it
the mids and highs are decent but the
price for the headset I was expecting a
bit more there not too much of an
audiophile however I wish spatial
recognition was a little bit better at
times I have to really pay attention to
notice gunfire is coming from the right
instead of the Center for which base
ease of muse with the inline volume
controller and I guess the Space Age
look this is for you if you're going for
the competition I would recommend for
another hundred dollars more you get the
Astro a40 s and it's mixed amp and
they're the way to go but for a total of
$250 for - for a 40s
I'll pass they're a little bit too much
you can get these Triton's ax pros for
$160 on Amazon as I speak and that's
about it I hope you enjoyed my review
and please like the video the more likes
the more support I receive and the more
content I can put out for you and please
remember subscribe for future reviews
intending to do a lot more products
coming out and that's about it thank you
very much and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
