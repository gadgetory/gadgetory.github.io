review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the LeapPad to power from
leapfrog for ages 3 through 9 as of this
review per leapfrog they are the number
one learning tablet for kids on the
market today with this kids tablet it
combines both the fun aspect while for
the parent offering hundreds of apps
ebooks and learning cartridges to
supplement your child's learning now
what's unique about the specific model I
have here again it is the LeapPad to
power it comes with a nine hour
rechargeable battery and all previous
models require double-a batteries to
operate and you can imagine how
expensive that was going through all
those batteries there so without further
ado we'll get started and we'll go over
its physical features first now this
particular model comes in at $99 retail
and there's two other versions that are
available as indicated on your screen
now the LeapPad is an all plastic
construction with a five inch
touchscreen and the top of the tablet
includes a three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone port a cartridge reader and
we'll get into that a little bit later
and to the right of that is the mini USB
port to connect this to your desktop or
laptop the tablet also comes with a
stylus pen that is tended to the side of
the tablet to prevent loss and it's also
magnetized as well it's a nice feature
to have rather than just using your
fingers on the screen and getting some
plunges everywhere the only nuisance I
found with the stylus pen though it
might be difficult to put back in
especially for young children the stylus
has to line up perfectly for it to sit
flush with the tablet now continue with
this physical layout the left side has a
built in microphone in the charging port
for the wall charger and then going on
to the front here has your power button
your Valium buttons a directional pad
and the home button on the bottom with
an integrated speaker to the left of
that the last two notable features are
the front-facing camera located here in
the rear camera located on the back now
lastly the rear holds the rechargeable
batteries behind two covers on either
side the covers don't go on too easily
but that's a good thing though since the
covers don't come off easily as well and
again the batteries last about nine
hours on full charge a tablet also goes
into standby mode if you don't use it
for more than several minutes so if your
child forgets to hit the
our off switch you don't have to
remember so overall the physical build
it feels real sturdy and a solid build
although plastic and it being plastic I
would be worried if I did drop it down
on a tile floor or a concrete ground
again nonetheless as a product it still
feels like a quality build for children
so let's get a little deeper in this
review the lead pad offers you to create
up to three profiles so if you have more
than one child it's ideal for them to
save their own progress and work the
interface is very simple with icons that
you tap to access its corresponding
action now what comes with the lead pad
is the pet pad which is an e pet that
you can take care of feed bathe etc the
next icon is a camera function you can
take photos or video with this device
and after you take in a photo you can
bring it to the photo lab where you can
doodle and place other miscellaneous
pictures over that picture you've just
taken so the cameras are good enough for
a young child and this isn't the same
camera quality as you would expect from
like an iPad or your smartphone but
nonetheless the kids are going to have
fun with this
the remaining apps include my stuff that
houses your documents books music sneak
peeks - what else is offered by leapfrog
a calculator calendar and on the second
page a clock and notepad so as you can
see the leap pet offers a good
foundation just to start with apps to
have your child at least wanting to use
the device in my opinion that's the
camera and the pet pad I guess are the
most notable but as a parent I bought
this to supplement her education
now with the LeapPad connected to your
computer you would go to leapfrog comm
slash connect where you download apps
for as cheap as $5 and sync them with
the tablet now apps are categorized by
style learning such as learning through
a game or through an ebook and audiobook
music etc it also breaks down by age and
subject as well such as math science
listening skills etc so majority apps
from my review are about you know one to
ten megabytes in size with the
interactive story books being about 90
to 100 megabytes in size but not to
worry though the tablet does have four
gigs of memory to store all of your
content though now what also is offered
in store are learning cartridges now
these cartridges
from 20 to 25 dollars at the big
retailers and they do offer much more as
well now giving you another variety or
method of educating the child now these
cartridges usually have a known
character for the child to relate to and
I purchased this problem-solving
cartridge aimed for pre-k through first
grade and it helps with the child
development problem-solving skills and
as guests the learning experience will
be with Mike and Sully from monsters Inc
or monsters University now within these
cartridges there's multiple games such
as matching mazes creativity skill
building just to name a few and as a
child grows additional learning programs
can be bought and more advanced
questions and games are presented now
here I have the Magic School Bus for
ages 5 through 9 and the subject is
dinosaurs the games in this cartridge
speaks of specific dinosaur names -
probing questions on dinosaur bones
showcasing Jurassic periods and even
Cretaceous periods so it's pretty
in-depth for a child now from my review
I've also tested if I were to create a
new profile and I changed my present
grade attended where the questions get
any harder now unfortunately not though
the questions were the same if I told
the tablet if I was a 6th grader
versus a first grader so after using
this personally in testing the tablet I
do believe the lead pad should only be
viewed as one of the many tools to
supplement your child's education I do
see the tablet lasting for some time
especially in the very much younger age
groups though and with a tablet they are
interacting a bit more than if they were
just watching a learning program on TV
now the only fault that I really saw was
the fact that it might add up depending
on how quickly your child can master an
app or cartridge depends on your child
of course the good news is the
cartridges alone are a bit more in depth
and offered more variety of questions
and interaction so it will take some
time for your young child to go through
a master I truly believe at the end of
the day though you would have to ask
yourself are you personally ok and
purchasing a new cartridge every so
often and again a cartridge would be
about twenty to twenty-five dollars
while these smaller online apps starts
off at five dollars
so overall the tablet is a good product
it does what it needs to do but more
importantly it offers such a wide
variety
matters and age groups now to add to my
thoughts this LeapPad and like the other
model leapfrog offers none of them are
super powerful
however they are just enough for a young
child and for this price range of $99
this is the cheapest tablet form factor
you can offer a young child to use and
this is just my opinion but if the child
is 6 or 7 years of age or older I would
recommend looking into the Nabi 2 which
is Lea pads main competitor it's a bit
more responsive however the tablet is
more powerful and seems more fluid in
dynamic and just more fitting for that
age group and as a recap
leapfrog is good for ages 3 through 6
maybe through 7 years of age I
personally believe that Nabi 2 is
recommended for ages above that and if
you really have the money maybe the
Kindle Fire HDX is the Holy Grail
tablets for both kids and adults to
share and you can go to my channel at
youtube.com slash gems review room and

LeapPad to power from leapfrog
