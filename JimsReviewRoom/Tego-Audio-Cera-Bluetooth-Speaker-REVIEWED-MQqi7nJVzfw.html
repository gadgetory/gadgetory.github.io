review room welcome to another review
today we'll be looking at this small
bluetooth speaker the Sarah from tego
audio priced at $89 at tegu audio comm
now the folks there was very nice to
advise me you can use promo code mom 20
to receive 20% off into a mother's day
of 2014 making this speaker a little
over 71 dollars with free shipping so
without further adieu we'll get started
what I have been trying to do is support
smaller companies specifically in a
gadget type genera that have been trying
to make it on the scene and at times
there have been very innovative products
offered by brands that we have heard of
yet the saram Bluetooth speaker is one
of them
this feature sleek orb-like speaker
stands in just two point four inches
high and has a diameter of 3.5 inches
wide and weighs in a little bit more
than a quarter of a pound now to power
on the unit you just press the center
which then elevates its unique design
inside houses a 40 millimeter speaker
with a pretty modern feeling blue LED
now the plastic construction works well
and does come in white and red
however the glossy black finish I have
here I've noticed does attract finger
prints pretty easily as expected now be
sure to use a microfiber towel when
wiping to prevent any fine scratches now
all the buttons are located up top with
a sophisticated feel of being field
sensitive gently press and volume up and
down or toggled with forward and reverse
on the opposite sides then around the
bottom of the Sarah speaker is a mini
USB port for charging the speaker with a
three-and-a-half millimeter port nearby
for manually connecting this to your
audio source in regards to better like
tego audio claims 5 to 7 hours of use
per their website and I personally
tested this and left it at full volume
and this continually played for 3 hours
straight until a charge was needed so
the battery life is slightly on the
lower end but I somewhat expected this
since the unit is quite small oh and
before I forget
tako audio does provide all the chords
in the box for connection this also
includes a mini USB 2 three-and-a-half
millimeter chord for daisy-chaining
multiple Sarah speakers together and
last it does come with a carrying case
that helps prevent scratches when
stowing in your bag now with all that
being said how's the sound quality to
Crete
in devil the unit I'll play several
songs and give you my verdict afterwards
let me get a good look at you oh so flag
down oh wow oh you fits it it's so sick
baking meals like a heaven all right Oh
and there you have it folks I hope you
enjoyed the sample there from these
great artists and all their information
is in the about description below now
getting back on topic here of course
music heard in person is much more clear
in definition but hence my review here
this little thing is surprisingly loud
for its size it's not earth shattering
nor will it keep your neighbors awake
nonetheless your family members in the
next room but in the key words here it
holds up well for personal and casual
listening and I'll admit it's not as
loud as the UE MIDI room or the speaker
I reviewed from reactive sounds but it's
just right below it by here and keep in
mind those speakers are slightly bigger
though the important thing is there's no
Distortion
there's no raspy Ness of the high note
and that's impressive in itself for such
a small speaker with a decent amount of
value there is a much bass or warmth
though but again for this price for its
size again it works really well for
personal and casual listening I can tell
a ticket audio focus on its design and
the port does work with spreading sound
360 degrees so if you leave it in the
middle room you'll have equal
distribution of sound last on my test
the range was on par with other speakers
I typically leave the iPad flying in the
studio and then I walk down to the other
side of the house downstairs and the
Sarah speaker never lost connection and
that's about 40 linear feet going
through several walls and of course the
first floor ceiling so I believe the
speaker style and design are the real
selling points here with audio being
good for the small speaker segment I
wish the better life was a little bit
better though but considering if you can
get this cheaper than retail and if you
really like this modern looking design
it's not a bad deal so hope this review
helped you in some way please take your

Jim's review room hope to hear from you
soon hi
