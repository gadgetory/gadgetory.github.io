room welcome back to another top five
fitness band video and I'm seriously
excited about this one since activity
trackers or activity bands have been
improving very much to not only tailor
the experience towards fitness
enthusiasts but making a product that
the general public would enjoy using and
really there's just been two companies
that's been really dominating in both
the experience and features we'll find
out which ones shortly later in this
video now with every product I'll be
showcasing I'll place all my links in
the video description below click on my
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time and if you
do decide to purchase it does help
support the channel so starting off here
I got to hand it to the Fitbit blaze
with the retail price of $200 this is
one of the thinnest activity watches you
can get at the moment with good better
life at a little bit more than five days
from my testing the brains of the device
is detachable from the bezel so there's
very few parts that could malfunction or
wear down over time now we've seen this
sadly on the Fitbit charge the charge HR
and the jawbone products where the
band's adhesives would break down over
time from normal wear besides being
super thin and comfortable if the band's
ever wears down here or if you want to
color coordinate for that day
use the quick release pins you can swap
out the bands effortlessly the blaze
isn't meant for swimming so that may be
a deal-breaker for some however it is
water-resistant for washing your hands
or taking this into the shower one of
the biggest benefits why folks are
considering the blaze is the display it
notifies you of push notifications and
text messages in its entirety it's not
just a summary you can have music
controls out here and there is a
vibrating alarm too with you up in the
mornings now jumping over into the
health side of things the basics like
steps taken or calories burner there but
this can read how many floors you've
climbed and of course heart rate
monitoring is here as well and guide
workout sessions are right on your wrist
if you're into that kind of thing now
the only feature that is lacking though
unfortunately is GPS however in keeping
with its slim design Fitbit does allow
you the option to pair this with your
phone during a run and use the GPS off
of your phone now once paired you can
see everything other dedicated GPS smart
activity bands offers like pace and
accurate distance readings it's a
workaround but
you have to carry a phone keep in mind
this video isn't a review you can check
out my full review in the description
moving on to the fourth activity tracker
and keep in mind my channel is geared
towards the average consumer Samsung
gear fit - I believe steals the show and
unlike before the s health app and the
gear fit - does work on all Android
phones not just Samsung phones anymore
as long as you have Android 4.4 or
higher you should be perfectly fine
there's been several mixed reviews out
there but I'm speaking from my personal
experience from my personal testing and
looking at the overall picture I believe
there's very much a lot of value with
this band here this is what a lot of
consumers were asking for a very good
performing hybrid that offers fitness
focus features with techy and SmartWatch
like amenities first and foremost this
is the best screen available very
vibrant very fluid and no signs of
stutter not only are all your Fitness
features on here like steps floors
climbed etc but you get on the wrist
heart rate tracking you get built-in GPS
you have push notifications and messages
shown in its entirety and you're able to
respond to those messages with quick
response options the band is very
comfortable the bands are also
interchangeable but the only concern
that I had and others - I'll be fair
about that there's only one nub for the
wrist strap and it may be prone to
coming apart some reviewers have said it
has fallen apart on them for me from my
personal experience it never happened to
me but indeed from experience of other
activity trackers having to Nub's would
have made a little bit more ideal so
take it for what it is I'll still give
it a shot though considering what
features are offered on here and this
can auto recognize some of your workouts
automatically and segment them for you
heart rate data is taken throughout the
day at certain intervals while it takes
it in real time when you are on a run or
doing a performing exercise now
regarding better life compared to other
fitness trackers it is somewhat on the
low side I'm just hitting that three day
mark while some that are more active
than I am who uses GPS more often or has
more notifications that comes through
the band is lasting a little over two
and a half days keep in mind that
display is hitting that SmartWatch
territory in SmartWatch battery life
averages around a day and a half to two
so the gear fit isn't so bad when you
look at what is offered again tons of
features here that you know
see on a $250 activity tracker the gear
fit 2 retails for only 179 now moving on
to the third band here the Fitbit Alta
for the money conscious shoppers out
there this will be replacing my job on
up - from my previous list the reason
being those wanting a minimalist and not
bulky design a modern feel with a secure
strap it is and not to mention there's a
display showing your time date text
messages and incoming phone calls this
is seriously a great alternative to the
job on products now I've also been keen
on replaceable wrist straps as stated
any last activity band here the jawbone
up and fit bits over time has had some
adhesive issues with this design again
the brains are all in this module above
and removing the straps requires no
special tools this is also sweat rain
and splash proof is unfortunately no
floors climbed counter and no heart rate
monitor
but the ultra is really good towards
mainstream users who just needs general
activity data and sleep logging the
battery life from my testing is around
five days of use and this does also have
a vibrating alarm but it's not as strong
as some of the other competitors out
there the Fitbit Alta is priced at 130
but again my links are in the video
description below they'll give you the
most updated prices
now moving on to number two it was
actually number one earlier this year
and it's the garmin vivosmart HR there's
nothing wrong with the Fitbit charge HR
for those who are Fitbit fans here
that's a great band but I felt the
Fitbit blaze offers so much more
and a better build quality but the V was
smart HR here is just the perfect
balance Garmin offers your basics like
steps taken floors climb calories burned
the vibrating alarm etc but additional
features include media controls the
weather and best of all push
notifications and text messages coming
through and you can read the entire
thing it's not just a summary and before
I forget here there's of course a risk
heart rate monitoring included with
heart rate zones and resting heart rate
information displayed right on your
wrist you also have the option of
pairing this with a chest strap for even
more accurate results and garments
unique move bar is all included the
display is very responsive and it has
very fluid feedback here and what is
unique it's always on
while majority of the Bands out today
screen turns off to save power better
life for my test here are a little shy
of five days in the V with smart HR is
rated at five atm meaning that you can
swim with us on if you choose to do so
the only items lacking is GPS so you
don't have pace information and you're
only getting estimated distance but for
the price of $150 retail and with all
those features being offered there's so
much value over the competition in these
same price range now last but not least
here indeed the size has gotten big here
compared to the older model but compared
to other GPS Fitness watches like the
Fitbit surge like the M 400 from polar
the vivo active HR from Garmin feels
more comfortable we're looking at one
very fitness focused band so if you are
an active runner or a fitness buff here
then how many people active HR might be
for you it's jam-packed with tons of
features like an always-on display in
which you can choose different styles
here there's sport profiles that details
what kind of workout you performed and
of course the basics like steps walked
floors climbed calories burned and
before I forget the view of active HR
and it's in its name here now has a
wrist based optical heart rate sensor
bill
but what makes this bin number one on my
list for this video it's all in the
details with GPS built-in which works
very fast here with the HR sensor you're
getting both pace distance average heart
rate max heart rates cadence elevation
changes and list continues and goes on
now check out the heart rate data in
graph form here right on the wrist look
at the breakdown of your run after
completing it there's just so much
information that you can use to better
yourself as a fitness enthusiast now on
the SmartWatch side of things here
there's a weather widget pre-installed
giving you not only what the temperature
is right now but the next several days
and the next several hours - there's
push notifications text messages all are
available right on the wrist
everything's literally shown here and
you very suddenly need to pull out your
phone for any needed information now
this is rain sweat and splash proof and
you can wear this into the pool for
swimming if you'd like overall this has
to be the best enthusiast Fitness watch
available for the general consumer
before you step up into the triathlon
and $400 and up activity watches like
the Garmin Phoenix or the suit two
models out there and the only thing that
may hold this activity watch back is its
size but again most GPS smartwatches or
watches in general are about the same
vivoactive hrs priced at $250 and again
check my links in the video description
below prices could have changed since my
uploaded video so there goes my top 5
activity trackers or Fitness watches of
today obviously each has their own pros
and cons but looking at it from a bigger
picture the list should be a good
representation of what's out there now
let me know what you think in the
comment section below as a friendly
reminder for individual reviews of each
item they're all in the video
description along with my links for
updated prices and feel free to add me
