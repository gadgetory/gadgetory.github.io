broom Happy New Year welcome to 2018 new
beginnings for the channel and as always
moving up and moving forward hope you
guys are having an awesome start
yourselves now today I'm giving you guys
an update on the newest TV here at the
office this is LG's newest nano cell 4k
television this thing is massive coming
at 65 inches and if it's perfectly on my
TV stand and snugged in between the
shelves and the speakers I've been
playing around with the TV all last
month and in January it is somewhat more
of a challenge or UV do schedule that is
so want to take some time to share this
with my fans has always been transparent
this video was sponsored by LG and as
always I'll place my links down in that
video description below if you want to
check updated prices or you can google
yourself nano cell TV to find out more
information alright folks let's get
right into this starting at the bottom
and working our way up top the stand is
gorgeous with a strong curve beautiful
finish and something about that small
print that says super UHD makes this
thing look official the frame of the TV
has super thin bezels making the TV look
almost frameless in some instances
there's no physical buttons on the TV
itself which I don't find too much but
I've been so used to having volume or
power on the TV just in case I walked by
and needed to adjust it so no big deal
now we're rotating to the rear this is
pretty neat the entire back is white
including the power cord and pretty
nifty to have this blend into more homes
today since most newer homes are going
with a white or gray wall in the
background the SJ 85 comes with 4 HDMI
ports three USB ports one coax for your
cable one component for those going
old-school and on the audio port side of
things there's one optical and 1/3 1/2
millimeter input the connections that
you cannot see are wireless AC in case
you don't want to use the ethernet ports
and bluetooth yes you can connect your
wireless headphones or earphones and
watch TV I love this feature it's my
first ever TV where I can listen or
watch without disturbing those around me
unless right before I start talking
about the display the built-in speakers
are Harman Kardon they're good for
built-in TV speakers I wish they were a
little bit louder but surprisingly
they're clear accurate and offers a good
bit of simulated surround sound from
built-in speakers just
you change the audio settings to
surround since the TV does come with it
off now finally touching on the display
and man I rather talk about this rather
than the specs I just went through the
TV looks gorgeous 4k with trumotion 240
basically a refresh rate at 120 Hertz
does help to reduce motion blur and it
is noticeable faster day 85 does offer
active HDR from multiple high dynamic
range formats including HDR 10 HL g and
dolby vision no matter what format is
offered this TV covers it now several
years ago it was about vibrant colors
that were at times glaring and emit
inaccurate and how men again at that
time it did look good to me but over the
years with experience and just basically
honing in my color accuracy skills
looking at the LG the colors are not as
in-your-face but the best word to
describe it is its rich in deep skin
tones to wet dirt or yellow leaves from
the fall season here looks highly
accurate in my opinion now if you have
Netflix premium with 4k and HDR
available which I'm showing on screen
the LG SJ 85 emphasizes deep blacks and
shadows makes some a pop Bix clouds
visible there's simply more of a balance
on screen now one new feature that LG
has implemented is nano cell display
technology LG implements tiny little
particle is about a nanometer in size it
absorbs excessive light wave forms to
help colors pop also reducing on-screen
light glow and the Nano cell gives off
much more accurate colors and for LG the
viewing angles are much wider sitting at
varying angles I can personally say it
looks the same in every seat now the
last thing I wanted to go over and
demonstrate the control looks pretty
much straightforward at first glance not
too big of a deal on Netflix and Amazon
are shown on the bottom the controller
for quick access that's pretty
convenient but the feature I thought was
practical and worthwhile to use there's
a scroll wheel right in the middle
allowing you to flick and flip here
through LG's new Web OS 3.5 now we're
looking through YouTube videos or
Netflix on TV you just basically flick
it up or flick it down
but what's even more impressive this
controller works has a pointer as well
11 get a type fastened when searching
for movies and channels you're able to
look through content again faster and
with more precision over the traditional
left and right up and down buns that my
old
TV had so overall this has been pretty
slick here now as we're content while
watching press at home but out of
control they can flip through a line of
apps for you to select from and it's
crazy smooth as this moves through
everything
buttery seamless so that's it folks hope
everyone enjoyed this video be sure to
LIKE and subscribe if you haven't
already and follow me on Facebook
Twitter and or Instagram guys have an
awesome 2018 I'll catch you guys on the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
