by Jim's review room today we'll be
looking at the Kindle Fire HD from my
favorite online place to shop amazon.com
now I did do the review in the Barnes &amp;amp;
Noble Nook on my youtube channel you can
check it out there as well I'll put the
link in the video here but the main
reason why I'm doing the Kindle today is
there's been speculation that the Barnes
and Noble Nook may be discontinued or at
least no longer being manufactured you
can definitely check out the links or do
a quick google search and I'm pretty
sure you'll find the articles on that so
if you can't no longer buy the note a
Kindle is of course an alternative so
let's see how the Kindle stacks up here
now there's minor differences between
the Kindle models the main differences
are the screen size and pixels the
amount of storage that you need and if
you truly need 4G LTE for the Abaco
Internet so I'll do my best to explain
the key features and basics and
hopefully with some of these
specifications and explanations of each
one it may help you decide on what you
may purchase now the model I have here
today is the most popular and the most
purchased Kindle based on ratings per
amazon.com if the Kindle Fire HD tablet
in the 7 inch form factor the 7-inch
comes in under a pound
weighing in at ajust about 13.8 ounces
now the bigger HD tablet from Kindle
comes in at eight point nine inches and
weighs in at 20 ounces so let's take a
quick tour of the exterior you have your
power button on top here if you hold it
down it will power it up and power down
of course but if you tap it once while
it's on it will turn the screen black
and go into the you're sleep mode now
the valium rocker buttons are here
there's the three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone port so standard earphones
will fit now you have a micro USB
charging port on the bottom and next to
that is the mini HDMI port which is very
nice so that way you can connect it to
your TV now the kendo only came with the
USB wire and there was not a USB wall
charger you just need to connect this to
your laptop a computer to charge it
though what's really unique about the
Kindle that you can't find on the Nook I
previously reviewed
there's dual speakers in the back now /
Amazon's website the Kindle has
exclusive Dolby audio processing which
should give you some pretty decent sound
and I'll get into that a little bit
later down and
review here and lastly the feel of the
Kindle Fire HD it's very light it does
feature a slightly rubberized backing
for grip it's not as thick as the Nook
but I definitely prefer this over the
iPad though the iPad or the iPad Mini
etc is a one-piece a little bit of
chassis which it does slide off of your
hand I like this feeling it feels more
personable and also secure so let's get
a little bit deeper in the review the
main difference is price at the time of
this review the Kindle Fire HD tablet
that I have here with 16 gigs of memory
is on sale for $169 and retails for
$1.99 for Amazon's website now the
equivalent nook which per the Wall
Street Journal will no longer be made by
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is still listed on Barnes
and Nobles website for $149 and lastly
the atrocious iPad Mini that's a
whopping 329 dollars so the Kindle Fire
does have two varying price points one
that displays small banners and ads on
your lock page slash screen saver now if
you choose to have the Kindle without
the ads you do have to pay fifteen
dollars more but with mine use the ads
are very minimal and it feels properly
placed so it's not a nuisance or a
distraction
there are similar banners or ads that
you see gnome and web pages so the ads
don't show up while you're reading or
watching a video again it wasn't a big
nuisance or a distraction at all it's
not bad at all again but if you have the
option you can always pay $15 just to
get rid of all those ads altogether the
next important form factor is the
resolution and battery performance to
put this in simplistic terms resolution
is better measured on the e-readers and
tablets by pixels per inch so when
you're able to squeeze in so many pixels
into one square inch of the screen that
image is more dense in turn providing
more crisp letters and words and more
contrasting photos
the iPad Mini which is one of the Kindle
HD competitors has 163 pixels per inch
with the Kindle HD these 7-inch version
which is the most popular that I have
here comes with 216 that's 25% more
density in more detail than the
had many the nuke HD itself has 243
pixels per inch
now that's 11% less pixels per inch for
the Kindle not detrimental and with a
small margin of difference you basically
can't even tell the difference
so when comparing the Nick HD in the
Kindle Fire HD as an e-reader the
letters in the words are on the same or
similar level where each letter is clean
crisp and clear the difference in pixels
per inch is minimal enough to justify
purchasing either or now I'll reiterate
again the Nook might be discontinued or
manufactured by a totally different
company and still sold through Barnes
and Nobles website based on recent news
it's still early to tell so we don't
know as of yet but as for the iPad the
price alone justifies purchasing a
Kindle HD over the iPad Mini now for
gaming it appears on par I tried popular
games and it performed as normal
the Kindle HD kept up with my latest
iPad actually video playback is also on
par with the iPad in sense of speed and
consistency if anything the Kindle HD
had much more contrast and the iPad did
now skin tone levels looked much more
natural and less washed out compared
again see the iPad Mini another nice win
for the Kindle so moving on here the
battery itself lasts about 11 hours of
continuous news / Amazon that's the
longest lasting battery out of all the
devices I've been comparing I was
shocked that the Kindle didn't come with
a USB wall charger though and just a USB
cable so that means I have to have
computer access or bring it laptop with
me just in case if I have to charge the
Kindle now Amazon does sell an adapter
for an additional ten dollars however
one remedy if you're fortunate enough to
have a phone that uses the same microUSB
and use that personally to charge my
Kindle so how's the platform operating
system especially if no one ever used a
Kindle or a tablet before let me tell
you it's very simple and layout is
straightforward the main page of the
candle will feature everything you need
there you can access everything from the
top side scrolling menu here you'll also
have what Kindle calls your carousel
which will rotate through
most news items to make things even
easier you can also save your most used
items to your favorites and access them
anytime just hold down an app then save
to your favorites from here you can tap
on the screen and click on that star and
the bottom right and access anything
that you have saved now with other
tablets there's typically a physical
home button that you would press now the
Kindle however has a home button built
into the operating system so what you do
is tap on the screen anytime and click
down that little house and you'll return
to your home page so there's a real no
concern of getting lost again very easy
for anyone who's never owned or use the
tablet before in addition as long as you
have Wi-Fi you can have access to your
built-in web application and surf the
Internet another thing though there
wasn't a selection to browse email
though now however you can easily
download an app to access and organize
your favorite accounts like Gmail Yahoo
Outlook whatever so overall as a tablet
it's very good it performs as good as
any other tablet with features like
photo viewer web browsing music
listening videos movies and you can game
on this like any other higher-end tablet
now the specs on this thing is up to
snuff for whatever you throw at it today
lastly I wanted to talk about how easy
it is to review and purchase books after
all this is an e-reader as well from
your main menu select books then store
and you can browse by genre bestsellers
daily deals etc and once you select a
book in here you can read reviews from
other readers read the synopsis and even
sample a little book with a choice to
purchase it if you decide to do so in
the future and again if you're ever lost
you can always press that home button
locate on the bottom and you'll be back
to your home page it's easy for someone
to pick this up and start other
performance features the Kindle HD has a
built-in camera though it won't take
great photos like an iPad would but it's
nice to have it just in case you ever
need a Skype or I don't take random
photos of yourself or so
it also has Bluetooth connectivity to
connect your Bluetooth support devices
such as a Bluetooth speaker and
regarding its exclusive Dolby audio the
stereo sound
in field of direction for this tablet is
very well done you can tell the
difference although at maximum then the
high notes can be a bit tangy and
ringing but yet again the immersion from
the auto you have compared to the
competition the Kindle wins what's
really cool is with Android phones
there's this swipe typing as you can see
in my demo here I just swipe my fingers
to corresponding letters and some
amazing feet it picks up their word that
I'm trying to type its innovative and
unique some people may like it some
people may not but you can type as you
normally would if you choose to some of
the cons that I've seen were not
detrimental since other tablets or
readers have the same problem like the
iPad and Nook you have a glass
touchscreen and it does reflect light so
if you're outdoors let's say at the
beach the park etcetera and in the Sun
it's difficult to read the screen from
eclair if you're directly under a lamp
or under recessed lighting you'll see
the glare from the lightbulb as well now
the Kindle screen does feature a new
touch technology where the design
process helps with reduction in glare
now without being too technical the
screen doesn't glare as much as the
competition but glare is still present
and I just want to make sure that you're
aware of that that's all no another calm
there's no expanding memory slot for a
micro SD card to expand the space if you
decide to download so many goods but at
16 gigs that's probably sufficient for
the average user it's the same boat for
the iPad as well there's no expansion
memory slot and the last con that really
stuck out but yet again it's not really
a big of an issue I guess you can say I
do have to state that I do love Amazon I
purchased so much junk off of there you
can only use books you bought off of
amazon.com you can't purchase books from
elsewhere and read them on your Kindle
but if you're an avid Amazon user or
even in Prime member and Amazon this
shouldn't be an issue at all
Amazon usually has great deals so I'm
sure with this quote-unquote limitation
it shouldn't even feel limited since
Amazon itself is a great company maybe
I'm biased but hey I like them a lot and
just to wrap things up with my summary
the Kindle HD options are a great
alternative to the costly iPad
Linna now reading web surfing email
youtube videos movies Netflix you name
it this Kindle is able to handle it all
it does what I believe the average
consumer is seeking for and it's even
better for children get them interacting
with today's quote unquote ebooks
actually I'm electronically now there's
parental controls that you can easily
adjust through the menu scheme control
your kids read and watch and even how
long they even use the Kindle for video
playback is great image quality sound
quality are enough to have an enjoyable
experience so overall I'm excited about
the Kindle and to be honest
Apple's losing a lot of its luster on my
end get the Kindle HD it's a full fetch
tablet with all the apps that's
available for Android and it's a hundred
and sixty dollars cheaper than the iPad
Mini so I hope you enjoyed this review
of the Kindle Fire HD from amazon.com it
did take a bit of time and effort to put
this video together if you can please
