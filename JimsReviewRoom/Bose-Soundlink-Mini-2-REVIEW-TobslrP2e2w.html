original sound like many was introduced
actually back in 2013 considering other
manufacturers have been pumping out new
designs and improvements annually but if
it wasn't broken why fix it right
well Bose returns with this nearly
identical look and feel to the original
model but after reporting on its press
release here that changes are what lies
inside now I personally paid one hundred
and ninety nine dollars for the mini two
at the time of this video and compared
to other small bluetooth speakers it is
on the upper end in regards to pricing
now as always visit my website for
reviews on other speakers and more
consumer products
I'm Jimmy with jims review room calm and
I'm here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to the review
getting right into it
the mini 2 comes in at 7 inches wide 2
inches tall in 2.3 inches deep it's
still that same portable size but
because of its beautiful one-piece
aluminum that goes all the way around
here this thing feels heavier when you
have it in your hands it's not a bad
thing but it seriously gives you the
feeling of being rock solid or so than
some of the competition out there though
the same can be said with the front and
back girl offering zero flexing or even
compromises when I press on this very
firmly Letta top features the power
volume up and down and the bluetooth
pairing button to the right now in the
center is the control playback and to
answer phone calls as well with its
built-in speakerphone feature now
regarding playback I did test this on
the Android Samsung Note 4 here and also
the Apple iPad air 2 and playback does
work on both operating systems that's
going back skipping forward and also
pausing and playing music but now going
back to finish its simple layout on the
right of the speaker features a 3 and
1/2 millimeter port for physically
connecting this to your device and below
that which is also a huge plus here for
everyone is a micro USB connection to
charge the speaker the last model relied
on an AC port which meant you had a
carry BOCES electrical cord if you were
traveling now just like the last model
there is a charging cradle that comes in
the retail packaging which does come in
handy and it is completely optional now
leave this sitting on your night
stand or so and just drop the speaker
into it and the unit starts charging
very simple but regarding power and
battery life since were on it here both
also improved its performance by
offering up to 10 hours of use now with
my standard test that I do on all of my
speakers leaving this at 50% volume
playing music after 12 hours straight
here and then checking on the speaker
60% of the battery was still remaining
crazy I know
now I had to do the same test one more
time just to be sure and sure enough it
was the same result so I did another
test here and this one I normally do not
do this time at 100% volume didn't say
also a stress test this time the sound
like mini to died in five hours and
exactly one minute so from my personal
experience here and conducting three
separate tests the light use is great
and the heavy use keep in mind blasting
this at 100% it actually does decent
some speakers i've tested in the past
here lasts only 5 hours at 50% volume
and after the full 5 hours I notice the
unit was just ever so slightly warm but
far from feeling like a hazard or an
issue but enough about the internal
battery here the very last feature that
does improve on the sound like minis
performance is its verbal feedback the
mini tells you how much specifically
battery is remaining informs you who's
also calling you and which device it's
paired to here's a quick sample before I
get into the sound test better eat 100%
you're ready to pair on another device
call from seven zero four seven four
nine so that's a nice feature to have
there but let's get into my sound test
here I'll play several songs or some
samples for you guys and I'll give you
my verdict afterwards now keep in mind
all this audio is unedited
here's alcohol
gee cuz I got it like that flow so
smooth like I got it on tap
yeah and I'm a shake it be a good night
while I'm on my giggling while I'm
drinking Bud Light ah can you get it
when you miss me like I'm wit whiskey
drinking Jim Beam need baby do you do it
do it that way do you do that
did you take a break you know that I'm a
beast when I kill it on the P so far and
you got fixed up to the nines let me
show you
and there you have it folks
now of course sound recorded through my
microphone and then played through your
speakers are not the best depiction of
audio quality
hence my review here now most i got'em
it has done it again
the high price i swear is warranted in
regards to its sound quality the bass
and keep in mind for a small bluetooth
speaker here does hit a level that i
very much personally enjoy there's just
enough yet it's not overpowering most
generals of music will for sure be
enjoyable and to better illustrate when
comparing the base and this compared to
the competitors out there the mini tube
does have more bass than most in its
segment most other small bluetooth
speakers are underpowered in this area
so if you're listening to more
modern-day music pop EDM rap and hip hop
if you're looking for a portable units
for sure than mini - is the one that
does hit harder and as for the mid-range
where you hear vocals and most details
of instruments it's clear it's not boxy
sounding nor dull the mid-range provides
enough life and emphasis while retaining
a tonal balance that accompanies the
slight bass boost that you hear in the
lower frequencies and for the high notes
it's not your ringing or tinging either
and in today's music that constant 808
beat that you hear throughout the music
for the most part stays intact
now regarding loudness this no question
would fill up small rooms bedrooms dorm
rooms even bathrooms if you use it in
there it works perfectly fine now medium
sized rooms like master bedrooms living
rooms this does very well also now also
tested this in a larger open floor plan
those areas are okay for personal
listening but I'll be honest it's not as
immersive of course that's when you need
to look into possibly the Bose Soundlink
3 or if both ever makes a sound link for
now regarding audio separation which is
very hard for any small Bluetooth
speaker to do the Mini 2 is still not
there in having left and right audio
separation it's not as distinct however
I did notice in regards to physical
location forward and back locations of
music and especially in movies are more
evident now if you're looking into a
category of a small bluetooth speaker
they both sound like mini - is one of
the best on the market despite lacking
some of the features that would
love though like NFC which I use all the
time now and it charged out port the
auto characteristics is what really
shines here and this speaker so hope
