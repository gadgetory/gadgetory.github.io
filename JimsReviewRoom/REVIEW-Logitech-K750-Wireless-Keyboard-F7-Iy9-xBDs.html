review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the Logitech K 750
keyboard now if you're in the market for
a new keyboard this one is definitely
unique it's solar powered so let's get
started here I purchased this for $52.48
from amazon.com at the time of this
review and now at your local Walmart or
Best Buy they'll have it retail for
$59.99 so I purchased mine in black then
it does come in white as well to match
your Apple products and both keyboards
will be the same price regardless of
which one you choose and the thing is /
logitech's website only the black
keyboard appears to work for Windows and
the white one works only on Macs now I
don't know if that's true or not since
both are USB connections and
plug-and-play but if you prefer one
color over the other
you got to purchase with this question
so regardless the installation is simple
again it's plug-and-play and for me the
Windows operating system installed the
drivers automatically once I plugged it
in now the construction is very nice
once you remove this plastic film here
it reveals a glossy beautiful black
finish and a full keyboard with numeric
keypad to the right now Epping users
didn't have the numeric keyboard on
their OEM keyboards so I'm sure this is
certainly helpful aesthetics helps out
the function way in my office on those
bad days the K 750 keyboard is very thin
and I really like it it keeps my
workspace looking that much neater and
modern you can say hey with such a thin
profile the keyboard to me is still
easily accessible though you can raise
the keyboard with the little stands on
the back once you prop it up it will put
your keyboard up at an angle like any
other keyboard there other features
include quick function keys to access
your favorites like email internet your
valium buttons etc
and on the top right you'll have your
battery indicator tool with either a
smiley face or sad face to indicate your
power reserve now going on to
performance this thing works flawlessly
and I never had the better drop to where
I needed to stand next to the window to
charge it up again this keyboard not
only works with sunlight but with
interior light as well the Logitech
claims quote-unquote moderate lighting
is required now my office aka Jim's
review rooms world headquarters has one
window
and a whole week of rain here has
yielded not the best lighting conditions
in the world however this keyboard still
smells green at me and it still
functions properly of course now you can
use this keyboard in complete darkness
as well as it does retain a charge with
a small internal battery the held charge
per Logitech's website is up to three
months
now that's ample for me and I think it's
ample for anyone else since I'm sure
I'll have several sunny days mixed in
with some cloudy days as well now the
keyboard feels really comfortable
I thought with such a slim profile and
what I call the tic tac keys I was
expecting a small nuisance and
discomfort while typing now some laptops
with the tic tac keys are so tightly
packed or even the feedback from the
keys are very minimal yielding and typos
but that wasn't the case at all I was
able to type as normal and felt fine
with its outcome maybe this is was just
me but I felt more refined typing on
this thing as well like a publisher from
some major magazine in New York I don't
know but I like nice things and that
function well and if they look good too
demands a bonus for me so in regards to
cons there really isn't any of that I
could think of if there was it's more
wishful thinking I would have liked the
LED backlit keyboard with white letters
so that we can see it at night but of
course I'm certain that would drain the
reserve battery to some degree and if
only this keyboard was Bluetooth
connected as well it would have worked
on my iPad and Android devices but again
it's possibly due to energy management
that Logitech decided not to include our
desires on there but that's ok though
there is in Bluetooth keyboard from
Logitech but it's not solar powered
though it's the model K 810 and that
retails for $99 and then you can connect
that to your iPad or Android devices or
any kind of Bluetooth connection so
that's it it's a quick review but I hope
you enjoyed this review of the Logitech
solar-powered keyboard model k 750 and
if you have not please take your time to
like and subscribe to this video for
future alerts to new products again this
is Jimmy from Jim's review room take
care of one bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
