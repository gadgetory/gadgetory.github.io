quick and short video for you guys and
then back to reviews after like being
five months ago on here but listen this
video isn't for everyone but I felt like
I owed it to you guys my fans my
supporters out there those who have been
with me since the beginning I feel like
I owe it to explain something to you
guys and honestly it might help someone
out there who's going through something
similar so what is going on my peoples
it's been a while hasn't it where the
hell have I been I miss you guys a lot
though and I miss YouTube damn I miss my
little studio here but I am good and yes
I am coming back take my time though but
I'm feeling good my family's good life
is good so thank you for all the warm
welcomes back and also blown up my
social media this past week well voice
you guys don't know I was devoting to
youtube about 12 hours a day when I
first started five years ago just like
any other business there's a lot of
sweat equity and don't get me wrong I am
perfectly fine with that it is work it's
something my immigrant parents instilled
in me and I've always had this saying in
my head are you going to work for it as
much as you want it and I want to get
out of poverty at that time I want to be
the first one to finish college I wanted
to be an entrepreneur and just work my
way up here I wanted to buy a house etc
etc and then busted my ass and I did it
so what many don't know besides being a
workaholic here I have a fiance and a
little girl I think I only shown her
once on the channel and for those with
kids I think you might be able to relate
once she was born I went into dad mode
knowing daycare or good one was not
cheap here and simply just prepping her
for life it's getting more expensive
every day
so just in hearing that has known that
that's why I kept working long hours I
knew I was sacrificing a few years of
busing mass now and maybe several years
later I wouldn't get time back that's
why I got the office and employs a
little over a year ago wasn't a flexor
was to show off or anything I want to
buy back some time and to keep things
professional it unfortunately didn't
work out I ended up working on average
12 to 14 hours a day instead and I'm not
even exaggerating including weekends and
such eventually it just wasn't healthy
not only for me but for my family and I
was so conflicted thinking believing
that
what I was doing was securing my family
but being away as much as I was even
though I worked under the same roof as
my family I wasn't there mentally I was
always fighting this battle in my head
and just not understanding why my family
just didn't see it at that time and
don't get me wrong if anything my family
was the one who helped me out of this
mess I'm not blaming them at all but at
a time before I lost my family here
before I missed out more years of not
seeing my little girl grow I had to stop
and rethink and understand it from a
different perspective so that's why I
got off of the Internet altogether
in my head I had good intentions but why
slowed down when work was helping the
family we have a rare opportunity these
days in life that is and why would I
pass it why would anyone would there
were so many of those kinds of reasons
in my head
but in the end despite good intentions I
took it towards an unhealthy path I
realized I wasn't single Jimmy anymore
grinding investing than going out
staying out late and then grinding the
next day I now have a family so as you
guys know again I took several months
off I visited my mother which I wasn't
doing so good at that time either she's
almost 70 for god sakes but she is good
now she's healthy now I met him with my
dad he's 60 years old and is still
grinding today saw my brother spend time
with my family of course my little girl
etc I got my health back in checking got
some decent sleep for the first time in
five years it took me a while guys to
see that it's going to be okay that
shear time is valuable that having good
intentions is fine but for me I just
needed to execute it in a different way
now don't get me wrong I still believe
in hard work and aspiring to be the best
person that you can be I still believe I
can have the same aspirations but again
just in a different way so where does
this lead us where does this lead Jim's
review like I said I feel good after
seeing the smoke clear up I feel renewed
rejuvenated almost as though I have a
new purpose so I am back to reviews I'm
going to start slowly and see how it
goes and just being upfront you might
not be as sexy as they used to be just
to cut down a little bit of time but the
same content that meat that helps people
make a purchase decision it will
definitely be there am I intending on
however my new crew I would like to but
we'll see how the sponsors do and I got
to see what talent is out there there's
to be more news down the road coming in
the next several months so hang in there
but folks I just can't wait to get
behind the camera again start showing
you my my work here my artistic work man
I don't know I've been itching to come
back I'm clawing my way back here but
yeah at the same time he said my family
is gonna be first and I hope you guys
understand that and it's something that
honestly took me a while to to realize
that I just needed to do it in a
different way so anyways folks I don't
mean to drag this on here thank you guys
very much for being with me thank you
guys for being patient thank you for all
the messages over the last several
months that I was gone I actually just
recently checked it I try to respond
back to as many as possible thank you
guys very much man you guys are awesome
and this past week since I've been
announcing my comeback and I don't mean
to hype it up or anything like that you
guys have been showing me so much love
so thank you in the comments section
let's not forget throw some fire mogees
in there let's light it up about another
week or two back to reviews alright
folks see you guys around
