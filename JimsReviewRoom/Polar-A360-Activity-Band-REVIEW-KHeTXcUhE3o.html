another review many of you been asking
for this on social media and I'm finally
uploading this video polar has made some
great activity bans but one of the
biggest setbacks for mainstream
consumers is the need to wear a chest
strap for heartrate data now I
personally like chest straps
whether it's garments or Polar's because
they provide time and time again very
accurate and very consistent data yet I
very much understand this may be
uncomfortable for some well polar for
the first time is offering risk-based
heart rate tracking with their new polar
a 360 it's priced at two hundred dollars
retail as of this video and I'll place a
link in the video description below so
you can check for the most updated
prices today so without further adieu
I'm Jimmy with jims review room and my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another video
going over the physical features the
a360 comes with a supersoft silicone
band it's very easy to wear in general
and not gargantuan looking when wearing
with casual clothing I do wish they went
with a more watch style buckles give
peace of mind of course however the
button press method and this works
perfectly fine and it does stay secure
during my runs and other tests that I
performed the display in the brains of
the a 360 is detachable as you can
interchange the strap for different
colors to fit your preference but
regarding that main display this is a
touchscreen and the only physical button
here is located on the side use this to
turn on the display hold it down to sync
your band through your phone and to stop
a workout session which I'll demonstrate
shortly now rotating to the back at
which more bands would include this
polar does graciously offer a micro USB
port for charging eliminating the need
for a proprietary cable and giving
further use to my phone in car charger
regarding better life polar claims up to
two weeks of use which is very
impressive as the average activity
tracker that uses rechargeable batteries
they last anywhere from five to seven
days from my use I'm averaging one week
and four days with occasional workouts
in between of course and averaging a
little over seven days of use when I'm
more active that particular week now
moving on to the display this has to be
one of the best so far haven't gone into
content just yet but I'm just speaking
about the display alone this is far
different than most at this price range
this works fine in bright light sunny
situations in one of the few dedicated
activity trackers to offer a color
touchscreen now what you also see in the
video the a360 displays does turn off
automatically to conserve battery
sometimes it does turn off a little fast
for my taste before I can finish
analyzing my own data but the screen
does turn off regardless if you're
wearing this throughout the day or
during a recorded run I know server
asked me that from time to time there's
not an option to keep this on during
your workouts as I'm sure it's for
battery reasons you can always press the
bun on the side or use this feature you
find mostly on smartwatches today
turning your arms similar to looking at
the time on a normal watch the a 360
display turns on automatically from my
testing this works for the most part
better than most other Auto and displays
with smaller slight movements activating
the screen as shown in
video only on a few occasions that I'm
sure some will experience to where you
might have to turn your wrist one more
time
to get the right angle for this to work
again it is very minimal and within
reason to be honest with you
less regarding the display if you are
intending on wearing this to sleep for
sleep tracking I know some have
complained the screen lights up while
moving around in bed but as of this
video there has been a new firmware
update there is a Do Not Disturb feature
which basically eliminates this issue
the main display can be changed by
holding down the screen and selecting a
total of four different styles with
three out of the four in an easier to
read vertical configuration swiping left
to right has no options but swiping up
offers your day which includes a listing
of today's activities and its general
data there's a progress bar of your
daily goal steps taken distance with
calories burn next and below or any
inactive moments that you've had now one
of the neat features and more bands are
including if you have been sitting for
too long the band does vibrate and give
you an alert to get up and move with
polar every time the band does alert you
you receive an inactivity count for the
day tapping on the screen at this moment
does offer specific activity suggestions
and how many minutes you need to reach
your daily numbers it's a perfect way at
the end of the day to find and realize
maybe a quick 15 minute run or so can
have you reach your daily goal now
backing out there is training where you
initiate your exercise once in this menu
give this about 10 or 15 seconds and the
a360 will find your heartbeat from the
factory running cycling other outdoor
other indoor mountain biking walking
weightlifting group exercise and
swimming are available to be reported
now keep in mind you can always change
what kind of exercise you performed via
the app or your polar account online and
there is a ton out there offering other
options that you can label and save as
you're not limited to the ones I just
mentioned going back is the fitness test
which uses your heart rate rating to
perform an analysis which oddly enough
after the last firmware update this
can't find my pulse any longer however
my heartbeat can be found easily when I
do start a workout and add phenomena at
the moment though and last on the screen
you have an option to find what your
heart rate is right at this moment
moving on let's take a look at what a
workout looks like in real time here as
soon as the starts you have your
heartbeats being displayed
timer down below swiping up reveals the
time and calories burned and last are
your heart rate zones as you go through
different levels the colors change and
as you're in a certain heart rate zone
for longer periods of time the other
bars adjust in size for those who do
value heart rate zone training which I
fully recommend to anyone this is
hands-down the best display it's
colorful very easy to read and the
information provided is very useful but
polar on their website does market this
as a fitness and cross-training band so
we don't see estimated distance steps or
pace during a recorded run if you are a
more serious Runner stepping up to the M
400 from polar is worth the
consideration for that kind of data
now last fitness bands are slowly making
their way offering some smart features
and with the a 360 snippets of incoming
text messages Google Hangouts email and
social media notifications will pop
right on the band for both iOS and
Android devices as of this video Android
users will need at least version 5.0 for
this to work now the only thing that I
wish was available since I just reviewed
the government vivosmart HR I wish there
was a way to read the entire message an
entire text message that is or open an
email to read it in its entirety versus
just reading the first line or two but
again polar is more of an activity band
rather than the SmartWatch so let's take
a look at the app now see how all this
data is shown and I'll go into detail on
how accurate my heart rate tracking is
here's the polar flow app available for
both Apple and Android devices
polar has really taken the approach if
it's not broken don't fix it they've
been using this app for some time but I
gotta admit it does work pretty well on
the main page there's an activity wheel
showing literally your entire 24-hour
day at a glance everything is
color-coded on the wheel but for more
precision the merits are provided down
below and yes polar does an amazing job
here at automatically differentiating
the moments you're sleeping sitting just
standing around walking and running
moving down your daily status bar
appears once again with suggestions
below of activities that you can perform
to reach your goal and some of these
suggestions are pretty funny if you look
at the screen and what is available
next is calories burned active minutes
steps and your night's sleep in which if
you tap any of these red triangles
distance can be displayed or your nights
sleeping performance can be shown the
one thing that I wish polar would work
on over time is if they're sleeping data
was a bit more robust considering other
bands are now offering very detailed
charts with REM sleep number of toss and
turns in an easier chart to view versus
the activity will now going back out the
number of inactivity stamps received
when you were inactive for an hour
during your day and on the bottom is
your weight which you can personally
enter and track on a daily basis polar
does provide a weekly and monthly
comparison chart to which is always nice
to compare and contrast your overall
performance the very last feature I'm
sure that you're waiting out here is the
heart rate tracking whenever you record
an activity on the band look down the
activity wheel and you will see a heart
icon tap on that and you can see a
breakdown of your workout performance
you can see all the information recorded
on the screen here with an explanation
on how this workout affected your body
which surprisingly many other
manufacturers don't even offer at times
but down below is the heart rate chart
with heart rate zones and I want to take
a moment to discuss my findings and how
accurate the heart rate readings are now
everyone's experience will be slightly
different as there are a number of
variables that could affect the results
that could be hairy arms tightness of
the band or the lack of a clean and
clear optical sensor in the back and as
you can see in the video I barely have
if any hair on the arms here and I did
ensure the optical sensors were wiped
down each time I also test this on
both arms and for sure warned this prior
to the wrist bone as advised by all
activity trackers at the market
not to mention wearing this on the top
and underside of my forearm as well
regardless this did take me several
attempts to find my most optimal
location now looking at some of my
charts as proof of its performance
against their own tried and true h7
chest strap that data deviates very much
and it's honestly not accurate enough
for me to have confidence in the overall
readings for those who haven't found me
for some time you guys know I have
always been upfront and honest about
these things and I do pride myself on my
integrity after numerous tests I did
everything I mean everything that I
could yet every time I initiate an
activity rather be running weightlifting
etc the a360 would be lower than what
the chest strap would display now if you
move to the 15-minute mark here on the
chart this is where the deviation
eventually minimizes but during my
interval test there's still decent
differences despite performing better in
the last half of my 30-minute runs I
would say this is not accurate enough
for someone to rely on a huge
disappointment
considering personally I am a big fan of
polar products now backing out of this
and looking at the top left menu button
there's your feed which lists all of
your activities recorded and the
training diary gives you your weekly
analysis of those activities performed
once again and that's basically about it
those are the main essentials of the
physical band itself and the app so from
by testing and experiences probably
provide some very original features like
the color touch screen the amazing heart
rate zone display more information the
app that educates the consumer more so
than any other activity band that have
experience and the automatic readings
are playing down sitting versus standing
etc all those features I just mentioned
are done the best here on the a 360 and
it does shine above the competition but
on the apps attend the device with a
retail price of $200 that has been
accurate heart rate readings any lack of
distance or pace during my run the
essentials I believe are really missing
for me to justify its price and they may
be in for the time being its purchase
and yes I'm aware color didn't market
this as a runner's watch like the M 400
but the competition even the cheaper
bands out there are offering heart rate
tracking on the wrist that is much more
accurate and yes it does include
distance information while running who
knows
an update a firmware update that is may
fix all this down the road so that's it

you in some way and it did help you make
a purchase decision you guys take care
