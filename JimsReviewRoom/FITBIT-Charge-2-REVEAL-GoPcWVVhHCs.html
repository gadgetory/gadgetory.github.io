Jimmy with Jim's review room making a
very quick video for you guys yesterday
Fitbit announced a replacement to their
best-selling activity tracker on the
market it's the brand-new Fitbit charge
2 now it's going to be priced at $150
retail here in America and 130 pounds in
the UK did check Amazon for some reason
the pre-order price right now is a
hundred and fourteen dollars now I did
place a link in the video description
below click on my link and hopefully
that price is still there I'll put up a
screenshot of what it looks like as
proof here so you guys don't think I'm
trying to tell you guys I clickbait or
anything like I've always said on my
channel I want to be known as a
trustworthy Channel but my review should
be coming out shortly after the fitbit's
hit store shelves well getting into what
has been released so far I'll list them
so it's easier for you to follow some of
the same things do return like the
five-day battery life there's all day
tracking Auto sleep tracking which is
pretty standard
there's Auto exercise recognition water
resistance makes a comeback but it's
only sweat rain and splash proof just
like the previous generation it's still
not a hundred percent waterproof just
yet and the HR sensor makes a return
however using fitbit's proprietary pulse
scent technology and with my testing and
the previous models here it's still not
100% accurate not close to the chest
straps that is but it's honestly like
that with most risk-based HR trackers on
the market and of course this works on
Android Apple and Windows Phones as well
now getting into what is new though
right off the bat and new and bigger
display which I'm completely thrilled
about hopefully making this play much
more easier to read it's not touch
sensitive unfortunately per the verge
when the there article yesterday so you
do have to use the physical button on
the side now another improvement is
receiving calendar notifications text
messages and like before incoming phone
calls my concern or desire with these
bans though if they're displaying
incoming text I hope it has the ability
to display the entire message as some
bands in the passive only giving you
like a sentence or two or a summary in
addition sadly there's no push
notifications from what I could gather
as well from my informational sources
now a second thing I noticed here a huge
improvement so my fans have shown me
over time with their current
charge HR the adhesives would fail over
time and the band would come apart now
you can do a quick Google search and
pretty much a good handful of people
unfortunately have experienced this this
time around we have an all-metal tracker
just like the Fitbit Alta and on the
sides the bands are removable
replaceable and you can of course
exchange it whenever they wear out or
exchange them out to suit your style a
huge bonus right there if you guys watch
my Fitbit blaze review Fitbit did
introduce GPS but it only worked in
conjunction with you carrying your phone
it's the same thing here with GPS it's
not built-in but considering the pricing
is more for the average consumer not so
much for running enthusiasts just having
the option of having GPS just paired
directly with your phone having the GPS
information display in real time and the
charge HR - and then the data of course
automatically being imported to the
Fitbit app this does make it stand out
from the others on the market again I'll
test this in my full review but just
having this option again keep in mind
this is priced for the average consumer
not die hard running enthusiasts I guess
the Fitbit surge is geared towards those
I think it's good to have these options
now the next health item is called
cardio fitness and I wish more bands
would introduce some kind of tests like
this over time Fitbit performs an
estimation on your health based on your
age gender weight but also your heart
rate levels while you run and your
running speeds and with all this data
Fitbit will give you a cardio score
letting you know roughly where you stand
so that's pretty good to know I tend to
get a base or a measurement for yourself
and the last new feature there's guided
breathing something I probably need to
relieve stress throughout the day with
the on-screen display the band will
guide you through some breathing
techniques or exercises based on your
heart rate now some may find this useful
some may not even use it all to be
honest with you guys but having it there
it doesn't hurt to have something
offered so that's really it that's
really the main point of the new charge
HR - for the US it should be coming
within a week from this video overseas
viewers on my social media who
pre-ordered this so far says it's coming
in within two or three weeks from today
so again check out my links in the video
description below again at least for now
it's much cheaper for some reason
hopefully it's still there and be sure
to add me on to Facebook Twitter and/or
Instagram have both my personal accounts
and Jim's review room you guys take care
and I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
