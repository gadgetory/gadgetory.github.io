month into the galaxy note 4 is
potentially announced in Samsung will be
hosting their unpacked 2014 episode two
event on Wednesday September 3rd 2014 in
Berlin Germany Beijing and New York
simultaneously and if you're not part of
the press you can watch the live
broadcast at the following address on
your screen so for sure mark those
calendars but what indications of the
note 4 being announced well it's the
tagline in samsung's official
illustration stating note the date but
is it coincidental I don't think so as
the illustrated picture is the S pen's
menu on previous note products released
in the past so what I'd like to do is
bring you everything that I personally
know of so far on the note 4 and provide
you some insight before the potential
announcement in less than a month we'll
stay away from rumors as much as I can
and not hide this launch but provide
what's been leaked or at least what's
most likely to be available I'm Jimmy
with Jim's review room welcome to
another video
the note phones from Samsung has always
been there best of the best
top-of-the-line smartphones to come from
the factory
especially the note 3 offering an
amazing and contrasting 5.7 inch screen
it featured a 1080 display an amazing
camera and all the bells and whistles of
an ultra high-end smartphone you can
even record 4k content which was
amazingly sharp all from a device that
fits in one hand but the note 3 in the
latest galaxy s5 had its own fair share
of criticism maybe due to being over
height or maybe we as consumers were
expecting too much specifically during
the launch of the s5 so we're ahead of
time expecting a metal body construction
64-bit processing more RAM etc etc and
probably at that time it was meant to be
released but again Samsung decided not
to there's still great phones
nonetheless but Samsung has lost some of
its luster per its second quarter
earnings but to daven a little bit
deeper and from my research samsung is
losing in its low level to mid tier
handhelds and Samsung did admit they
spent more on marketing than usual to
compete and they are getting rid of
their old inventory to make room for new
ones this upcoming fall either case
although Samsung is having its worst
performance in two years as confirmed by
these reports Samsung is still a giant
wrecking ball and no question won't be
global leaders and more importantly
market influencers and that's the hope
of the note for that there's enough
change or innovation once again to shake
the industry and give some life back to
smartphones and tablets you can say in
general now starting off with a screen
reports or speculating the same 5.7 inch
size is coming back but this time with a
resolution of 2560 by 1440 translating
to still a 16 by 9 aspect ratio in a
crazy 515 pixels per inch
now the Oppo find 7 and LG g3 are the
only other phones at the moment to
feature the same resolution now with
that being said reading engadget.com
TechRadar and Android Central States
with the additional pixels it's no
question that it's very sharp but you
really have to pay attention or put a
qHD screen side by side with a 1080
resolution display to really know
and not to mention more pixels equals
faster battery drain so we'll see how
Sam Sun will address this but what's
more unique per News Agency routers comm
Samsung's senior vice president of
product strategy mentions the note will
be a new form factor now nothing more
has been leaked or discussed on that
aspect but speculation leads to a
possible curved screen as shown on one
of Samsung's conferences in the past
showcasing all LEDs and prototype
display technologies so the form factor
change is confirmed but only time will
tell
if there is a change to the screen at
all and what kind of change we're
looking at in speaking of the physical
form factor I think we're still seeking
a bit more of a premium material to be
used rather than these similar plastics
on the s4 s5 and galaxy tablets although
the plastic does work and it doesn't
bother me too much personally but once
handling say a HTC m8 or playing around
with the g3 going back to plastic does
feel a bit different and I'm just saying
I'm paying a premium price it'd be nice
to get a premium feel as well now moving
to another big area the arms race the
SOC or processor that's possible in the
nude note 4 showed up around June 23rd
in the benchmark program and - - now two
variants showed up one is from Qualcomm
the newest quad-core Snapdragon 805
processor and the other is Samsung's
newest eight core Exynos 5433 now specs
are on your screen and when comparing
these pre-release numbers the 805 shows
a 15% performance boost over the current
note 3 which uses the snapdragon 801 and
come to think of it it's possible the
newest chip of course will handle the
higher resolution but more importantly
battery management will be better a much
better that is for the additional pixels
on screen at least here's hoping and per
Qualcomm website the graphics portion of
the Snapdragon processor called the
adrenal 420 GPU is 40% better in
performance compared to the predecessor
the adrenal 330 found again in blasters
note 3 now more than likely the
Snapdragon will be here in the US but
what I'm totally bummed out about is the
Exynos will more than likely be
available internationally and per those
elite
benchmarks the Exynos is even more
powerful than the 805 and just I here
under the almighty k1 processor from
Nvidia which I just reviewed about a
week ago and looking at the charts and
numbers the Exynos does much better in
cpu performance versus the Snapdragon
805 so here's hoping the lagging
stutters are going away but one last
tidbit the Exynos is a 64-bit
architecture catching up to Apple you
can say in that aspect but per tech
radar one of the many websites who
reported on the leaked benchmarks
indicated the eight core Exynos
processor was not tested in its 64-bit
environment the processor wasn't even
fully utilized and per android authority
they speculated the processor was only
running at one point three gigahertz and
if that's all accurate just imagine when
this processor is really tested and it's
full offering so we'll just have to wait
and see and what comes about here in the
States
and what comes about across the pond you
can say and other notable upgrades that
are strongly suggested is a 16 megapixel
camera which is the same resolution as
the s5 but people are suspected with
optical image stabilization just to help
out with those shaky hands and blurred
photos and I'm sure the s5 heartrate
reader and fingerprint scanners are
coming to the note 4 as well which which
is nice for them to include but I
personally would rather see a focus on
better better life or a more refined
TouchWiz interface refined and being
less intrusive towards performance that
be phenomenal so everything else that I
want to mention is more speculation and
rumors like articles stating there's
possibly a UV sensor a curve a fully
curved display that is and even a retina
scanner for improved security measures
and I don't want to hype this product
any more than it is I guess you can say
as that's what happened with the s5 I'm
realistically optimistic I guess you
could say especially the mentioning of
the new form factor again we'll just
have to wait and see but that's
everything that I know of so far so this
video did take some researching and if
you can please share this video in any
way that you can be sure to find me on
Facebook Google+ and Twitter and of
course show your support by liking and
subscribing if you haven't done so let
me know in the comments below if you're
intending on buying this phone or the
iPhone 6 regardless of what comes
this is Jimmy with Jim's review room
