room jumping right into this one Fitbit
released the charge too and if you guys
saw my review it's a serious upgrade to
the previous generation but there's one
other main competitor out there that's
the garmin vivosmart HR now both are
priced at 150 dollars at a timeless
video but I'll leave my links in the
video description below click on my
links and it will give you the most
updated prices in real time now as a
side note here there is the government
vivosmart
HR plus edition that's $50 more at $200
retail and it does come with additional
features including built-in GPS but
we're comparing the non plus version
today as it's more of a apples to apples
comparison with the Fitbit now looking
at the physical aspects first the
garment looks to have a bigger screen
but the actual display area is a bit
more narrow over the charge too now one
of the things I love about the garment
and what it does better than the Fitbit
it's much easier to read in bright
sunlight now on the other hand the
Fitbit offers a beautiful OLED display
here that shines very bright in dark and
low-light environments compared to the
backlit display that Garmin offers now
you can make the choice based on your
dates if you're an early morning or late
evening runner
maybe the Fitbit is for you if you run
or workout more so during the day in the
sunlight again the Garmin shows a bit
better now moving on to the band's I got
a hand it to Fitbit they're starting to
introduce swappable bands so you don't
have to worry about defects or abrasion
issues like the previous model not only
the support silicones are available but
also use as a fashion statement metal
and leather bands are now options as
well now with Garmin there unfortunately
fixed however I haven't read or seen any
viewers message me that their Viva Smart
bands are defective or falling apart
there could be but I personally haven't
had or heard any as of yet now both uses
their own special adapters who charge
the devices Fitbit and Garmin claims up
to five days of use in world practice
during my testing for their reviews I
averaged four and a half days with the
Garmin and surprisingly I've been
getting six days worth of use with the
Fitbit now getting into the meat of the
comparison Fitbit has introduced several
great features for the $150 price point
now first although some of the viewers
are happy about this well some are
pretty much bummed the Fitbit offers GPS
tethering if you want GPS real-time data
to show on your watch like pace in more
accurate distance readings that charge
to or require you to carry your phone on
your runs now those who are more serious
into running I'm seeing that demographic
spending one hundred eighty to two
hundred dollars and up for those watches
with built-in GPS on the wrist for
Fitbit to offer an alternative and still
keep the price at $150 I don't think
it's a bad deal at all but again it
honestly depends on if you mind or don't
mind bringing your phone now on the
other hand Garmin there's simply no GPS
at all but with the lack of this
particular feature Garmin somewhat you
can say it makes up for this by giving
you media controls and a weather widget
right on the wrist you don't get those
on the Fitbit now with both bands
there's smart phone notifications
available however something I think
everyone buying any band if they offer
notifications ensure they offer the
entire message to be viewable Fitbit
only provides a summary of a text
message while a garment with a tap and a
simple swipe with a touchscreen you can
read the entire message which is a huge
plus now looking at another feature
Fitbit wins in this department by having
Auto recognition of particular exercises
now if you have been walking for a
period of time here Fitbit knows to mark
that down as a workout session and it's
viewable in the app afterwards it's
another piece of data that you can
compare month over month in C if you
have been more or less active in a given
period of time even when you do forget
to log it the band will do so
automatically now same with running and
cycling as well besides walking now
Garmin has a similar version called move
IQ however it's only available on the HR
plus model not on this one now one of
the ultimate decisions and deciding
which one to get here the Garmin is
rated at 580 M meaning you can swim
snorkel bathed with this one on here but
Fitbit unfortunately retains only a
splash sweat in rain proof disclaimer
Fitbit says it's specifically on their
website the charge is not shower proof
either so don't wear this while
showering folks in the second-to-last
feature I want to discuss is the heart
rate tracking now after experiencing
both I can say the Fitbit is more
accurate the government does okay too
good but had some trouble during
interval training or simply times when
I'm running then out would slow down and
then I would eventually pick up my pace
the government doesn't stays consistent
during those times as compared to the
fitbit in those regards now to finish up
the major features in this video both
offers vibrating wrist alarms having
both on my arm at one time the Fitbit
does provide a slightly deeper or harder
vibration but the government vibrates
for a much longer period in the end the
strength isn't too much of a difference
but the garment vibrating for a longer
duration is nice to ensure that I get up
in the morning honestly felt Fitbit was
a little too short for my taste
so in the end here man this one is
really a tough call I think the
government view of smart HR when I first
reviewed it it was an absolute killer
over the previous charge HR from Fitbit
it's still a great band today and I do
like the details that offers the very
fluid touch screen the fact that it's
shower or technically swim proof here
for added peace of mind and possibly the
best feature of them all the entire text
message or notification can be viewed on
the band itself now I think Garmin now
falls into the best general activity
tracker with great consumer features not
to mention the weather widget and media
controls as a plus but those with an
ever so slightly more sport oriented
mindset a Fitbit with GPS connection to
your phone better HR accuracy auto
recognizing inactivity as those should
be counted even if it's something as
small as walking through the mall here
the fitbit seems to win in that aspect
at the end of day such a tough call guys
