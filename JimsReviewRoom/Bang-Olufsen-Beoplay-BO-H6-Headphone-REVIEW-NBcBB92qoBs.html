review some products from bang &amp;amp; olufsen
you guys suggested it I finally ordered
a pair for myself now what we have here
today is the bno play h6 special edition
coming in this beautiful almost copper
finish the color choice is called
graphite plush in these retail for $400
at the moment you can click on my link
in the video description below for the
most updated prices so without further
adieu my channel is here to help you
make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to gems review room going over
the physical features if you're a person
with strong attention to detail the h6
provides so much to look at you'll
definitely appreciate the craftsmanship
the headband up top offers real cowhide
leather with the cross-section viewable
from the side moving down to the
extendable metal arm vino passed on
having a ratcheting system we see on
majority of headphones but instead it's
a very smooth very refined amount of
resistance that's offered here for
adjustability and they do stay locked in
place very well here without accidental
movements during wearing now down each
ear cut besides our anodized aluminum
offering a stunning reflection and light
but when touched you'll feel a slight
texture that's just different from most
headphones after having these for
several weeks now toss them into my bag
without its carrying case as you can see
still no signs of wear or scratches that
last on each ear cup you have the option
of using either the left or right ear
cup to connect the supplied 3.5
millimeter cord directly to your sound
source despite not having a true locking
mechanism the connection is very snug
and accidental poles were not an issue
at all over just premium feeling all
over now during my stress test here that
I perform on all my headphones it is a
bit extreme but the h6 is stays intact
with nothing breaking the headband has
been slightly more so than other
headphones causing a less firm squeeze
in the head but you can always bend them
back to its original shape if they ever
accidentally get pulled to this extreme
now moving on to comfort these are the
second lightest pair of headphones I
have ever tested coming in at 230 grams
while the lightest pair I've ever used
are they both qc25 these are absolutely
comfortable for long-term wearing
minimal clamping force along the jawline
and despite minimal and not so plush
padding up top here the lightness of
these headphones provided no discomfort
and the crown of my head now wearing
this for two hours straight never did my
ear sweat here there is some minor sound
leaking and these are not noise
cancelling but it does provide a subtle
amount of passive noise isolation when
using these outdoors and in busy
environments but other than that that's
really it it's really clean there's no
extra features there's no microphones
for phone calls just simply and well
made pair of headphones but let's move
on to the sound test here and see how
that goes
starting with bass wow these are just
right up my alley here it's clean
tight and bass boosted to have music
thumping just recently reviewing the
parrot Zik 2.0 and threes the h6
provides more depth while I'm not
droning the mid-range while not being
distorted or you're fatiguing now the
mid-range is pushed forward somewhat
bright in my opinion with vocals in the
front of your ears here just clear with
hearing the finer details of a song and
regarding the high notes here in my
opinion it doesn't have roll off as a
good handful of headphones uses that
technique to prevent reaching levels of
distortion but regarding the h6 the
highs on here from cymbal crashes to
snare drums and the likes the h6 for the
most part does well with keeping things
intact accurate and not pinging or ear
ringing these are the type of headphones
to wear when you want to become immersed
into your music and not just good audio
quality for casual listening I still
have my open back Sennheiser HD 598
which are known for having a great open
soundstage but having me side by side
alone are a apples to apples comparison
the soundstage and the pianos here was
more pronounced and directional sound
was a bit more identifiable surprisingly
considering open-back headphones are in
general known for their soundstage
performance now if there was one area
where I really truly had a critique and
I don't think this is much of an issue
I'd notice I had to have volume close to
90% to really enjoy these they're loud
enough for most people but to truly
appreciate these I noticed higher volume
than other headphones was required but
again that's if I had to give some
criticism but overall these must be the
best audio performance headphones that
I've personally tested so far here at
the studio if these had noise
cancellation and retain its lightweight
these would have been absolutely killer
so that's it for this review I
absolutely love these if you can't tell
already I'm not paid by being known or
has been oh and myself ever exchanged
emails but seriously the overall package
of having good looks a quality build and
being how lightweight they are the audio
performance as well these are simply
amazing to me so if you can like and
subscribe if you haven't done so already
and be sure to add me on to Facebook
Twitter and or Instagram and tell me
this review sent you over to me
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room you
