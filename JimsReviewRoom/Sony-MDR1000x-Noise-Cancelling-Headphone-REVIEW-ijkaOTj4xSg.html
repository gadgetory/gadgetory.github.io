Jimmy with Jim's review room this has to
be one of the most requested videos ever
had this channel this is the sony MDR
1000x
I personally paid for these at the
retail price of three hundred and ninety
nine dollars at the time of this video
but as always I'll place my links in the
video description below click on my
links it will give you the most updated
prices in real time and as a side note
I'll reference the bose QC 35 s from
time to time in this video but I'll make
a dedicated vs. video very soon so
without further ado help support the
channel by tapping that like button
subscribe if you haven't already my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review
so jumping right into this what you get
in the package is a lovely carrying case
that's stable and protective for light
use in the package you do have the
standard micro USB cord a
three-and-a-half millimeter wire for
physical connections and an airplane
adapter for your in-flight entertainment
now looking at the physical features I
really love that Sony use the right
amount of metal in the right places not
only to give it a more bold or stronger
look but it does feel very premium in
the hands and although it's synthetic
leather this feels very good
giving slight resistance when you rub it
or getting the confidence of a stable
grip and a side note it smells like a
new pair of leather shoes when you first
open the box so just an FYI it's
somewhat adds to the unboxing experience
but getting into comfort I do feel the
1000x
having slightly more weight versus the
very poplar QC 35 now as I've mentioned
in most reviews and as a guide to you
though
anything under 300 grams is considered
comfortable for me personally and I
would think most consumers would be on
the same board as well now thankfully
these here are lightweight there's also
no wearing fatigue that you could notice
at times on the crown of the head and
the clamping force at the jawline is
very subtle it doesn't bother me at all
now they stay in my head very well when
I'm walking through the city so I didn't
have any slippage of the headphones
themselves any 1000x the
ever-so-slightly do warm up my ears from
extended listening there's no sweating
though but there's minimal sound leaking
they're not bulky at all and they're
very easy to stow away as they do swivel
and fold in now overall these are one of
the best out there in regards to comfort
now looking at the physical buttons and
features the right ear cup here offers
gesture controls and they are as good as
the Sennheiser PXE 550 s I've recently
tested very subtle swipes up and down
adjust your volume and double taps to
pause and play swiping forward and
backward skips or goes back on your
music and one of the most unique
features and I love this there's an
ambient audio feature allowing you to
hear your environment the microphones
are the headphones allows you to hear
your surroundings basically but let's
say you're listening with noise
cancelling on and someone walks up to
you and tries to speak with you
basically place your hand over the right
ear cup like this the music stops the
microphone turns on and you can hear
your environment clearly
take your hands off noise canceling
comes back on and your music resumed
it's very convenient now looking at the
physical buttons they are a bit hard to
find though when you first get them but
over time you'll remember where
everything is located ambient sound is
up top noise cancelling on our office
next power and last is the three half
millimeter input and the right ear cup
is simply the microUSB port for charging
these things out it does take a very
long time to get full dough from a dead
battery at roughly four hours now Sony's
claiming 20 hours with noise cancelling
on and 22 hours with noise cancelling
off now getting in to noise cancelling
performance it's simply amazing there's
an ever so slight amount of cabin
pressure that feeling that's common with
active noise-cancelling headphones but
it's less than most though but the
recent Sennheiser's that I've recently
reviewed again barely had any at all the
pressure is objective but it didn't
bother me whatsoever now testing these
walking through the city with
construction in the background and cars
whizzing by here these sony 1000x blocks
out most testing this at the coffee shop
with many around me speaking and
Starbucks having their own music playing
in the background
again the 1000x does very very good at
blocking out or at least suppressing a
lot of that noise down now is it better
than in both QC 35 that's probably the
biggest question since the QC 35 s has
been the best performers the best active
noise-cancelling performers i've tested
to date and I gotta say Sony may have
beaten the boats but not by much though
if anything it's maybe by a few
centimeters and not being by several
feet it's very money and I honestly had
to switch both headphones on and off
several times in every environment to
fully realize it either or they perform
very similar and you can't go wrong with
either as I stated earlier in this video
a comparison or much detailed versus
video who will be coming soon and lastly
audio test here jumping into bass first
a nice clean bass experience if you're
looking for an accurate signature
looking for something that isn't bass
focus or bass heavy yet focuses more on
details Sony does well here for bass
heads you might need an equaliser or
look elsewhere in general mids are
performed clean and clear very neutral
and yet very detailed inaccuracy voices
are well pronounced and simply hearing
the little nuances under each breath
from dominant vocalists is simply great
as for
trouble and the higher frequencies very
easy to listen to nothing sharp or tinny
however I do wish there was a slight bit
more sharpness or detail on the top end
but overall the sound sinker is very
well balanced very easy to listen to
simply a joy as an all-rounder genres
where I think this shines is rock pop
and instrumental / classical music other
genres still perform great like hip hop
EDM which I personally listen to or
enjoy but I do wish there was a little
bit more bass for those particular
genres again I asked for a spatial sound
it's easy to experience how wide it is
and performs as possibly one the best
for a pair of active noise-cancelling
headphones now last thing before I
forget here the wireless signal there
was no problems whatsoever standing on
one set of house while the phone was on
the other end no signal loss was
experienced so in the end a phenomenal
pair of noise cancelling headphones the
audio quality is up there with the best
at this price point the additional
features someone justifies its price and
it's a nice touch and they simply work
now as a reminder be sure to subscribe
I'll have the most QC 35 vs. Sony 1000x
video coming soon
so be on the lookout and last follow my
personal account at jimmy long official
or for just the tech related stuff gems
review room is where it's at give this
video a thumbs up if it helped you and
as always take care and I'll see you on
the next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
