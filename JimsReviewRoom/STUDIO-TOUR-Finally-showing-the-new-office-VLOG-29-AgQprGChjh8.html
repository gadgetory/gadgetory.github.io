and welcome back to another one of my
blogs hope you guys are doing good it's
been quite some time a little over two
months since I did my last vlog I do
apologize it's been crazy hectic crazy
busy but finally today for the first
time ever on the channel and give you
guys a tour or a showcase of what is my
studio it's been a long and hard journey
for those who are not too familiar with
my brand or with me just a quick recap I
started this channel about three years
ago I left my corporate job my banking
job cold turkey besides just pursue my
dreams to pursue pursue something in
creativity and fast-forward to today I
got my first ever commercial space we're
about to hit 300 thousand followers I
definitely hired some help and it's a
godsend because it has been exhausting
um but to basically try to pursue my
dreams and get to where I'm at today so
thank you very much to my team here but
if anything ginger theorem is ever
expanding and I am grateful I'm thankful
to be able to share with you today so
thank you very much to all my fans out
there first and foremost before I
continue with this vlog if it worked for
you guys none of this would exist at all
so first things first I guys can imagine
getting to this point here today it's
not a trial and error I never wanted to
go back to school FL a school wasn't the
best way for me to learn so today's
video sponsor it is from Skillshare it's
a community-based learning service with
over 15,000 classes that ranges from
photography videography and many other
sort of skills that you can put tension
we learn from know engage you can do
what I did and have a lot of trial and
error a lot of late night searches but
skills your offers a lot of those
professional classes in one centralized
location you can take as many as you
want now if I had that service back in
the day I'm sure things would have been
a lot less frustrating so definitely go
check them out I'll put my personal link
any good description below and we'll
give you two three months so utilize
that to your advantage and learn as much
as you can also if you're a professional
yourself pretty versed in your own skill
set you can become a teacher on their
platform and earn some income
on the side as well so that would check
out Skillshare for your convenience I'll
leave the link down in the description
so alright folks hope you guys are
excited as much as I am here I know it's
been a long time in waiting anticipating
for this video keep in mind it's not
fully completed yet that's still a work
in progress
so there goes all right folks so welcome
back to the tour of the show you guys is
first room here this is what I call the
man cave this has been the evolution to
what ginger broom has been all about is
you guys have been watching my old
videos again oh I went with a dark color
theme dark table it just to be different
from all the other YouTube channels at
that time so previously it was dark grey
I went all out
I went matte black we're talk about like
the Batman theme and just being dark and
mysterious I guess who knows but anyway
I want all these wooden beams here these
poles to give them all a little bit of
texture keep in mind it's still a work
in progress so I haven't solved the
lighting system just yet but working
lighting system is in here it should
make a pole pop during the video reviews
now look at these red tears I hope you
guys have mentioned about these these
are imitation or as close to the red
shirt that Morpheus sits on in the movie
The Matrix these are the one that I
could find here in the US
hopefully hopefully you guys like it
this is something that I would love to
be a key element during the reviews and
I think you guys have been noticing that
moving back here a lot of guys haven't
asked me about these as well as have
been in the background
ever since I started the channel I
believe these are the clips are f82
tubes
I personally purchases these several
years ago before I get YouTube they're a
little bit older but they still some
very very dark I still love these things
Oh in a tidbit these colors are black
and the copper bronze color by clips was
actually the inspiration to what the
gems review of channel colors look like
today so food for thought there so
looking over here we got the Amazon echo
I love this thing here not only do I
listen to podcast listen to my music as
it worked as a Bluetooth speaker but I
can control my smart light which I have
my TV I got a Philips hue LED light
strip and with the Amazon echo Alexa
turn the mancave lights to orange and I
go with that sick or what
so I utilized that for not only my
lighting in the background here but I do
have some lights at the review table as
well will just show you guys shortly by
moving on I got the logic cam security
camera here I actually have two of these
here in the office I also have some at
home as well I love this thing and if
you guys have been watching me I used to
have the nest cam which was a great
phenomenal camera but with the logic cam
and now offers 1080p which is great a
really good resolution but it also
offers three to four hour recording
which is a huge plus in that camp is not
offer this again free so that's why I
have that I look it over here again
these shells are a bit sparse these
actually just came up a couple weeks ago
I got the Yamaha Wi-Fi speaker which is
a competitor to son√≠s I am comparing
that or review that so that will be a
channel pretty shortly looking down here
you guys have been specifically asking
for sound bars on the channel so I have
I got this brand new Yamaha sound bar I
got polk audio some bars that are coming
I got a clip sound bar as well which
I'll be testing out again you guys asked
for it I love you guys love reading your
comments I'm doing the best that I came
here to listen to you guys and basically
get them on the channel so again I'll
look for that ah
when there is time when there is free
time if there is any we have the
PlayStation 4
we got the Xbox one here for console
game I do have only to the Wii U but we
use at home I didn't give the Nintendo
switch actually just listen to the
reviews and it doesn't seem like it was
really getting traction so I said you
know want them just save my money and
just move on from there but walking out
of here as you guys can see this audio
equipment everywhere this channel is big
on audio I got like a clip center
speaker there I got the Yamaha subwoofer
down here another clip speaker a
subwoofer down there that I have owned
for quite some time but let's look at
the review table alright so this is
where all the magic happens is the
iconic black table you guys have seen
over the years on my channel here with
the lights with the smart
and look absolutely gorgeous because
those lights to absorb into the black
and causes really this really beautiful
glow that is we're looking at the
Manfrotto tripod here with the Manfrotto
502 HD fluent head and this is how I get
those slick very smooth pans here as you
guys can see they you guys have seen
have a channel looking over here this is
the soft boxes I bought off by Amazon
maybe two and a half years ago or so
prior paid I think 60 bucks for a pair
of them and there's really simple really
basic but again with lighting
you don't need high-end lighting you
just need to know how to use them of
where to place them and you guys can get
some darn awesome shots so just tip for
you guys looking here this is the
Sennheiser MKH 416 I love this
microphone I've been focusing a lot on
improving the audio recording on the
channel with my recent Bluetooth speaker
reviews I've been using this right here
this is a professional broadcast quality
microphone this will definitely be used
much more on the channel and again in
providing quality content quality
reviews quality tests for you guys now
looking over here because where
everything is constructed every bit
piece together everything that goes on
behind the scenes here we've got this
stuff here this is my videographer this
is Adam say hi Adam you know and he's
doing all my editing and video work as a
recent it goes my desk over here and
this is much greater than what it was
earlier today trying to make it
presentable for you guys still testing
the Logitech MX master 2's I know I did
a review rape I'm doing the battery test
got some memorabilia or something to
remind me of you know some humble
beginnings and such CES was one of the
biggest dreams that I want to attend I
tend to say yes for the first time last
year or earlier this year technically in
2017 humbled by that first time going
there it was a crazy experience I
recommend anyone ever let's go there if
they've never been got my youtube played
one when I hit a hundred thousand subs I
remember I tried to stay up as late as I
could that night to see the number world
over again that is very memorable to me
at the New York City Subway transit
system here this New York has always
been a place that I loved I visited
numerous times if I could open up my
business thing or move back there and
bring my family to that'd be great but
I don't think it's happening but this is
always a reminder of what home is to me
moving back here let's look at the
cabinet's is black chemists houses most
of the review items and I know I still
have a lot of junk behind me here we're
just we're already running out of space
but and let's take a look in this
cabinet we got some of the review items
that I have here that I keep for our
comparison purposes just to make sure
it's really sure you know which one
sounds better or not we've got of course
noise can I active noise-cancelling
headphones here we got some bluetooth
speakers smaller ones here we've got
some sport earphones we got some cell
phones down here we've got Bluetooth
speakers we got gaming headsets some
smartwatches you name it again this is
just one cabinet out of the three or
four that I have here
really good stuff I want to keep them
again just to ensure that I get a very
valid pass when I test them with other
newer products let's look over here I
don't you guys probably geeked out over
this I want to show you guys some of my
video equipment it's nothing too crazy
like I try to be a practical person so I
don't like overdo with lenses and stuff
I would love to but at the same time
with the lens that we already have which
is the 24 to 70 millimeter F 2.8 on the
sony a7s 2 that you guys are watching me
on right now it's been working
phenomenal but the camera prior to that
and I will most likely going to sell
this this is the Nikon d810 also a 24 to
70 lens that I've used again for the
past year and a half it looks it's been
phenomenal the reason why upgraded to
the a7s2 was for the optical image
stabilization and also the potential of
going to 4k eventually the morning more
than anything is the optical image
stabilization the roadie microphone here
which I don't use too often I've been
using another Sennheiser microphone they
just been really darn good products here
I'll list the model number any video
description I don't remember I'll pop my
head I also have another lab Mike that's
Wireless from Sennheiser h4n zoom we got
some more lights we've got a bunch of
wires we've got
these camera bags that we of course when
we go out and film out in the field we
bring them with us and this is a Sony
bag which is pretty cool pretty hard to
find but I don't know and let's look at
the last station last area here and to
address the pink elephant in the room
yes this is the entire office basically
it's very small and there's no window so
it's kind of a like a dungeon in here at
times but you know humble beginnings
have always stayed in the channel we all
have to start somewhere so looking over
there we got Forge which was the which
was the computer that I've built last
year which was a phenomenal builder are
anticipated to build another system in
the next month or so so be on the
lookout for that I did upgrade my
microphone I'm using the Sennheiser mk4
which give that almost I was it the amsr
sound effect very detailed in my voice
that you guys hear my narratives on the
reviews and of course we've got the
Corsair keyboard and mouse setup we got
the audio engine HD 3 2.0 speakers we
got to Dell monitors that I actually use
for editing it's 99% srgb accurate it's
not technically a game monitor but again
maybe four tours later at the end of
this year I might get a dedicated real
gaming monitor that is we have like a
hundred and forty-four Hertz or so to
compensate and use g-sync and all that
fun stuff but others that that is really
it for the office hope you guys enjoyed
it so far again I want to say it's
really from the bottom of heart thank
you very much for everything if it
wasn't for you guys I'll repeat again I
would have none of this today I wouldn't
be able to make content for you guys
today I wouldn't be able to quit my job
and try to pursue this dream here and I
can't say more than enough thank you for
making this a reality so hopefully you
know I provide you guys more good
content coming down the road for the
year so the years to come that is and
you guys continue supporting me so thank
you very much I will see you guys on the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
