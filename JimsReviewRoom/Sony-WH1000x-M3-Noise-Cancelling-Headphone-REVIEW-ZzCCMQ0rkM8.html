only a handful of times of year that I
get a product in the studio and everyone
goes crazy this is the review of the
Sony 1000x and threes that you guys
specifically requested for and for those
wanting this to be compared to the boast
QC 35 2's please subscribe and turn on
those notifications if you haven't as
I'll have that video up eventually also
this Apple watch series for I personally
paid for this at the retail price of
$349 pretty pricey but for what it
offers it might be justified as always
I'll place my affiliate links that in
that video description below click on
those links for the most updated prices
in real time you never know when these
things might go on sale
I don't Jim e with Jim's review room and
I'm here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
and these things look good or what
quality-wise they feel nearly identical
to the last generation and compared to
the competition the 1000 x mark threes
have the same clicky headband up top
soft ear pads and what feels to be the
same quality as the M twos now
aesthetically there's an added piece of
bronze or copper accents which adds a
bit of class to the headphones but oddly
Sony removed the texture on the ear cups
and compared to the first generation
we're talking about like three years
back or so the leather texture is gone
we're at all plastic which takes away
from that premium feel is not a big deal
and they still look great though but the
leather feels so much better
aside from looks this is where it gets
interesting comfort is improved as the
metal reinforced headband and arms are
now thinner that leather up top has some
extra cushion and the overall shape of
the headphones have slightly changed if
you can't tell on camera in person you
can see that the newer model it's just
slightly a little bit more narrow with
all that added up and gave this away on
my custom branded scale and I'm glad to
say Sony reduced the weight on B's to
beat most competitors out there just
look at the numbers now Comfort wasn't
an issue I had minimal zero wearing
fatigue at the crown of the head no jaw
line fatigue from the clamping force and
the overall design remains stable when
moving around and about it compared to
the mark twos it's less sharp and less
pinching at the crown of the head
everything else is as comfortable as it
was before the ear pads are redesigned
on the new model and are not as firmer
as thick as the previous generation but
they do feel slightly better as they're
slightly more plush against my face
unfortunately they still cause my ears
to slightly warm up after an hour of
wearing not ears wet but feels a bit
humid back there anyways compared to my
boys QC 35 twos I still love the way
those feel it's Airy light and my ears
breathe just better in there but to give
Sony credit compare this to the Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins P X's or the B and O h9 eyes or
the beats studios what-have-you
I can wear the zone is a lot longer
before I start feeling that wearing
fatigue but by doing my little stress
test right here I'm not trying to break
these okay folks but what I'm trying to
do is try and see if there's any
creaking
and he seems poppin to look for any kind
of weak areas they feel as they are they
going to hold up fun and I don't foresee
any issues of course time will tell
now getting a closer look the m3s
upgrades this to us b/c for charging
please future-proof yourself with this
new input right here what makes the mark
through better than most out there is
the ability to fast charge last year's
model provided 70 minutes of playback
playback time that is when charged for
10 minutes with the m3s 10 minutes gives
you freaking up to 5 hours of playback
that's insane the fine print says to use
a 1.5 amp charger or higher to get fast
charging capabilities by the closest
that comes to mind are they beat studios
and you get three hours back which was
impressive back in a day and again as
much as I love boats they offer 15
minutes of fast charging for 2 hours and
15 minutes worth of playback and as you
guys can see soon even raising that bar
much higher than anyone else for the
time being
touch him based on battery life so he
claims up to 30 hours of playback with a
and C or active noise-cancelling on from
the ANC headphones that I've tested so
far only a few can actually match those
30 hours and with my battery test of
real world testing here playing this at
about 50% vine with all settings stock
from the factory I got a total of 20
hours and 8 minutes from a full battery
ted-ed now testing the rest of the
buttons and features power and the cycle
of sound modes are on the left ear cup
which are easily identifiable and clicky
you do have a 3.5 millimeter chord for
physical connections and with my testing
yes the headphones still work even
though the headphones are off ANC's just
simply won't be on does it sound better
with a physical connection very tough to
say I try this numerous times and it
might be slightly better but it's so
many though that some songs I couldn't
personally tell and I've been again
testing headphones for five six years or
so now now going to the right ear cup
the touch sensitive controls are back
and for me they work to absolutely fine
swiping up and down or holding the upper
or lower regions of the ear cup raises
and lowers volume swiping left and right
skips and goes back on your music and a
DoubleTap pauses and plays all the
actions are intuitive responsive and
gentle glides with the fingers is all
you need if I had a critique once in a
while increasing Vaughn on my
gently skip a song instead but that
could be from my crooked finger with
that same right aired cup you can hold
your hand over it and the headphones
will lower your music turn on the
microphones and pump in your
environmental noises this is highly
convene you have someone coming up
talking to you at work or at home and
you don't want to mess with taking the
headset you know taking it off the Saudi
1000x m3s oddly doesn't offer Bluetooth
5.0 considering how future-proof and
high tech everything is on these things
but bluetooth version 4 points you still
works great I'm still able to walk my
entire yet modest 800 square foot
apartment with zero connection issues
once I step outside my front door with
that external wall about 40 linear feet
was all I got until the signal basis
started to cut off at the office right
here in the studio I'm able to stretch
the connection to 90 linear feet before
the signal
started to break and that's with a
mainly clear line-of-sight
about two walls in between now keep in
mind the m3s can only pair with one
device at a time it can't pair with
multiple devices which is possibly the
biggest letdown and this pair of
headphones switching from my phone to my
laptop every morning when I get into
work it's a little nuisance now one of
the biggest benefits of going with Sony
some of their headphones offers you the
best wireless audio transmission which
is called el deck here's my fancy
graphics ratings from best to worst at
the moment for wireless audio and with
Android 8.0 and higher Android phones
now support this too now can the average
consumer hear the difference that's I
don't see up to you guys but it is
available if you're an audiophile with
high quality music files or if you want
to get into that in the future again
future proof yourself all right before I
demo the noise canceling an audio test
quickly touching base on adaptive sound
control and a quick look at its app the
headphones have the ability to
dynamically change the amount of noise
it's lets in based on your movement all
automated so while walking the streets
you might want to hear your surroundings
for safety but as soon as you sit in
transit the headphones automatically
changes to 100% active noise-cancelling
now you can always turn this off and
have it at a and C 100% of the time so
it's your call from my personal and
testing sitting and then standing it
takes about 30 seconds to a minute
or realizes that I'm on the move by
going from walking to sitting this
actually takes several minutes which is
odd as heck it's not instant being this
feature functional but at times
unreasonably delayed then last on the
app there's an ANC optimizer that you
can perform for maximum effectiveness
and new environments you can position
where you want the audio to come from
which I can't figure why someone would
use no offense there but simulated
surround sound audio profiles are
available which were very subtle other
brands offers much more engaging changes
than Sony and last is the equalizer
which does offer some changes but the
app does force you out of El deck and
into the SBC codec to explain this for
my average consumers and viewers love
you guys out there you went from
basically high resolution audio
transmission to mp3 quality if you
normally listen to mp3s or streaming
services it's not a big deal if you
purposely blocked high-end files it's
better to use your own dedicated
equalizers you don't drop down to that
lower quality in the end the app looks
robust but it's been ok from my use just
being upfront about that alright folks
let's finally get into the active
noise-cancelling testing this in transit
while in Singapore to being inside the
restaurants and coffee shops here in the
States
nearly all the ambient air is gone
voices are greatly reduced cars driving
by are barely - not even audible at
times ANC headphones don't cancel
everything out but the m3 man it's on a
whole nother level
so even testing this on the airplane and
sadly I didn't bring my biner O's with
me the demo but this made my 24 plus
hour trip across the ocean here across
the states that much better it felt as
though I was in my own private cabin or
area and the in-flight entertainment was
the main focus loud and centered now not
to get too technical sony implemented
their own processor that takes their
noise canceling up several notches on
the m3s I honestly thought it couldn't
get better since last year the Saudis
were the best at noise cancelling but
the m3s this generation blows everything
else I've tested so far out the water
it's very noticeable how much better it
is and doesn't matter if you're an ANC
headphone junkie or not my average
consumers out there you're going to
notice it as well surprisingly I
personally didn't feel
any air cabin pressure feeling which can
be noticed on other competitors but
again that's a great thing to have that
pressure isn't that bear now I don't
think my baton euros were going to do
justice but here are the tests that I've
taken please use headphones earphones
says that's really the only way that you
can hear directional audio with the
microphones that I'm using here we go
ambient hand
noise canceling power
Oh
noise canceling
alright folks I met he'll jump into the
audio test right now please be sure to
comment down below to help support my
work here send some fire mode is my way
but also add me on my social media
that's Jim's review room and Jimmy
little official Instagram folks is where
I'm at and also on Facebook those links
are in the video description but here we
go alright folks give you a little bit
of ASMR microphone action right now but
again please put on your headphones or
your phones so get the best vine euro
audio experience there goes
baby on the track I'm going wrong try to
catch me when I pull up and there's
ozone Oh driving buddy Shore looking for
some more
little break
we are gonna copy on
and there you have it folks
now the m3s are very similar to the m2 s
but I would say it is slightly refined
it's ever so slightly brighter and more
for than a previous generation but if
you compare the m3s to the competition
the M theories are very base focused
headphones if you like based m3s gives
off a punchy and some resonating
characteristics it doesn't hit deep sub
bass like these sony xb9 50 and ones but
the m threes are perfect for those who
like a blend of hip-hop EDM and pop
music it was typically are my personal
John Roos that's perfect for those type
of songs
the m3 still does well with vocals and
detailed focused music but the basic
times is predominant and that mid-range
Mike shiner BS Ford as some would like
the mid-range isn't necessarily recessed
though or dwarfed by the bass if
anything the mid-range for vocals and
most instruments are neutral or slightly
above neutral from my personal
experience it's still awesome to listen
to again if your bass focus as for the
high notes never sharp or ear piercing
with roll-off on the top deaden I think
it's missing a little sparkle up there
to make cymbal crashes and snares really
identifiable and to balance out those
lower frequencies to help with the 808
beats now soundstage is quite apparent
for a left and right audio channels but
there's not much dimension of audio
being in the forefront then another
layer of audio being further out same
with the rears and besides now sound
leaking happens at about 75 to 80% vomit
and it is minimal though they do
suppress a lot of the audio from leaking
or coming out so your neighbors can hear
it too much
the m3 is I believe will be loud enough
for most people I never needed to play
these at 80% vibe or higher and one
thing before I forget here I did testing
microphone for phone calls and it does
pick up my voice pretty well here but
there's a minor echo but the downfall
though it picks up most if not all my
background noise so folks will hear
everything behind you and last but not
least I tested this with movies and
praying that there are no syncing issues
I tested this my samsung s A+ and showed
some love for the Apple users out there
with my iPhone 10 both YouTube and
Netflix glad to say I personally didn't
experience any syncing issues this Sony
1000x m3 is not perfect but compared to
everything on the market that I've
tested so far either cheaper or even
more expensive the M threes nails it
uncomfort the best and fast charging on
the best and battery life the best and
active noise-cancelling and if you like
bass
this certainly kills it the 1000 X M
threes are highly recommended from me
folks find me on Instagram if you
haven't already and like it subscribe if
you haven't done so already as well
again everything is in that video
description you guys take care
hopefully I helped you again at another
purchase take care Oh as a side note I
actually purchased these headphones from
a freaking vending machine at the
airport here's a really quick clip a
little sneak behind the scenes kind of
thing alright
Wow look at that
don't break it
thanks best buy at the airport awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
