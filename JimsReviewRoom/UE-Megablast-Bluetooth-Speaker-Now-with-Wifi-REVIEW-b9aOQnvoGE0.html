being a member of Jim's review room and
thank you see those who have stumbled
across my work now I finished reviewing
the Yui blast a minute ago check that
out if you haven't already but today I'm
showing you the bigger version this is
the you√≠ve mega blast as always being
transparent with my work Yui didn't send
this over for review our assessment was
not altered in any way please watch the
entire video for both pros and cons well
the mega blast retails for two hundred
and ninety-nine dollars they come in
four different colors here the one that
I have is called Merlot as always I
place my affiliate links down in that
video description click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
these things might go on sale so without
further adieu having Jimmy with Jim's
Ruthie room I'm here to help you make
that purchase decision welcome everyone
to another review starting with the
physical features the mega blast at
first glance looks very similar to the
mega boom but they're sharper lines a
cleaner look and if anything it's
slightly bigger maybe not cleaner
because this one's a little bit dirty
but although there's some additional
weight compared to other 250 to 300
dollar Bluetooth speakers the mega less
don't waste less than the extreme or my
sony xba-40
now when someone asked me to recommend a
very durable a rugged speaker that is I
do highly recommend the Yui products out
there now the fabric its stain proof
dust proof water proof mud proof
essentially its life proof with my
testing now first up its drop resistant
claimed by Yui
I personally dropped this several times
as proof in the video here at the Meg
blast it's still going strong now this
also has an ip67 rating with the seven
meaning that this can be submerged
underwater for up to 30 minutes and up
to one meter of depth now with my
testing first tossing this in the
speaker did float the butt of the
speaker is the buoyant part here but
repeating the test unfortunately the
speaker kept going down with my
observation I'll be very cautious about
this epilate taking a closer look and
getting back into the studio the buns
are tactile and simple enough here but
we don't have any buttons to pause or
play your music and with the previous
mega boom speaker holding
plus and minus right here gave me
battery life remaining we don't get that
having a battery level indicator by a
few LED lights would have helped
tremendously in my personal opinion last
NFC or near field communication is
awesome lacking then the flip side
there's voice controls which is the next
big thing and with the mega blast
there's Amazon Alexa built-in and from
here on out in this video I'll refer to
her as Lex so it doesn't activate your
speakers at home now with your voice you
can tell it to skip songs they can ask
for it to play different genres of music
you can control the volume as well the
only limitations that pertains
specifically to music playback the voice
Actions only work with whatever is
connected through Wi-Fi or through your
Amazon account now if you have your own
local music or local music stored on
your phone that is playing through
bluetooth and you use your voice that
will unfortunately not work so
definitely take that into consideration
now testing microphone quality there are
three far-field
microphones built into the units I
didn't stand over 40 feet away and was
able to use my commands my voice
commands that is at moderate speaking
volume when audio was matte flame now if
you have music going it does somehow
drown out my voice sometimes it doesn't
pick up my voice at all so that's
something to be cautious about as your
phone calls oddly and identical to the
blasts this does not work as a
speakerphone whatsoever at least at the
time of this video now looking at the
bottom of the speaker here you do have
this little d-ring to hook this up to a
carabiner or maybe a hook or so URI does
sell a separate charging dock and with
their special d-ring which I already
have on here you can charge the speaker
while it's standing upright like so now
it is $40.00 but the extra accessory is
well worth it in my personal opinion
when you're ready to go when you're
ready to leave the house grab it and
walk out that door now if you're staying
a bit traditional UE does offer USB 2.0
and with again this small little opening
I can't fit other USB cords in you have
to use theirs now all the USB 2.0 is
still abundant these days because this
opening is so tight make sure you don't
lose their cord basically this end right
here now testing better life you is
climbing up to 16 hours I'll place my
comparison on this screen for you guys
now I left this at 50% bottom from full
battery to dead
at that in 13 hours and 26 minutes now
it's very close to the JBL extreme but
compared to newer speakers 13 or even 16
hours is on the lower end even the mega
boom was up to 20 hours now as for
Bluetooth signal strength I confirm the
mega blast has class-leading performance
I was able to achieve a hundred and
forty eight linear feet with a clear
line of sight on my si+ now with three
walls in between I was able to achieve
eighty liter of feet instead before the
audio started to crackle now one last
item before I jump into the audio test
at the time this video we currently
don't have double up you can't peer this
speaker with another one or several
other UE speakers and have them off play
in sync now I'm certain they'll have a
firmware update on that soon but it's
more of a matter of just when also with
the app it's quite limiting at the
moment there's no equalizer or sound
profiles but you do get the battery
level indicator here and through the app
this is where you set up Wi-Fi change
the auto shutoff timer and input your
Amazon account information and that's
really about it so everyone to the
moment you've been waiting for I'll go
ahead and play several audio samples for
you guys be sure to use your headphones
or earphones to experience my 3d audio
test be sure to LIKE and subscribe to
help support my work and get ready here
goes
we are
all right folks so there you have it the
UE mega blast sounds much better than
these smaller blasts speaker if you can
afford this one the mega blast that is
hands-down get this one the mega blast
fills up large rooms and because it
pushes 360-degree audio there's no dead
spots this is perfect for entertaining
to ensure everyone gets the music
experience
now after testing Bluetooth speakers for
the last several years ue are not really
based focused compared to the JBL
extreme or the again the sony xba-40
with the mega blast its punchy but isn't
heavy or resonating nor does it sound
bass boosted I don't want to say it's
tame but I know some may want something
more basically and because how neutral
the bass sounds it's clear and clean
with a distortion free experience even
at maximum vibe now some may prefer that
bass is another one of those
characteristics I think you guys should
definitely take into consideration if
you guys are planning to buy a Bluetooth
speaker they're going into the mid-range
the mega blast provides a slightly more
forward experience which I very much did
enjoy vocal performance two instruments
sounds very distinct and genres of rock
classical and pop performed very well if
you compare this to the smaller blast
speaker that I have here this sound is
clearer and more accurate than the the
little brother you can say now there
wasn't any audio separation or true left
and right audio channels which most blue
thin speakers don't have but again the
biggest benefit is that this pushes out
360 degree audio sound let it both
revolved plus and the other cylinder
speakers don't have spatial sound stages
either now regarding the very high
frequencies I was afraid since Yui was
going for more of a forward audio with
less bass that the speaker would
emphasize the top and a little too much
thankfully that wasn't the case no tones
are very detailed that didn't have any
raspiness the mega blast didn't sound
tinny and I didn't feel any kind of ear
ringing in my ears if anything it did
very well here and that's with me
testing both medium and maximum volume
so overall the mega blast is a great
speaker if you're looking for something
super rugged here offers 360 degree
audio sound and in 10 I'm using the
Amazon Lex features keep in mind there's
not much bass compared to many of the
other mainstream competitors out there
and the voice commands does not work on
everything locally but it works for
nearly everything that's on
Wi-Fi sorry folks in the comment section
below let me know what you guys think
about that mega blast let me know if you
want a comparison if so who should I
compare this speaker to again I'm Jimmy
with Jim's review you guys take care and
I'll see you guys on the next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
