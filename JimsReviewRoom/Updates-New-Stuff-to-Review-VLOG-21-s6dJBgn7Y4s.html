doing good welcome back to another flaw
here hope you guys been enjoying my
content recently I had to do another
video of course for those original
members of course you guys know for the
newer members at every 10,000
subscribers I try to put out one of
these vlogs here give you guys some
insights of behind-the-scenes stuff so I
just recently hit 170 thousand
subscribers so thank you very much hope
you guys enjoyed this content and the
vlogs are be honest with you really
half-ass there don't look anything like
my reviews but anyways a lot of
information for you guys today today is
Monday july i believe it's the 17th
upper put the date up here if I got it
incorrectly but I'm gonna show you guys
this year in my last vlog I told you
guys I was repainting the entire first
floor and I'm about 80% done before the
fireplace in the connecting walls here
with my tan brown and it was good it was
nice back in a day I'm still trying to
make a little bit more modernized to
guess so who knows hopefully it looks
better to you guys if not then it's a
lot of time in hours put into painting
this ain't going down to waste but
anyways I'm playing again tenor rent or
sell this house down the road here some
who knows here goes the room that has
yet to be painted I don't know if I'm
gonna knock it out of this upcoming
weekend I really want to get done to be
honest with you but at the same time I
don't want to burn myself out there's a
lot of stuff that's been happening last
of it going on you know for work and you
know and good stuff you know in personal
life as well but let me go upstairs real
quick and give you guys more updates on
what to expect and some more information
dcache should know as well alright be
right back hey guys before I forget here
and just as a friendly reminder over the
weekend some people had asked me if I
announce whoever the giveaway winners
were that's still ongoing actually it
won't be announced until this upcoming
saturday i believe that's july twenty
third so about five days from today so
just hang on tight guys if you guys have
answered already congrats you know best
of luck to you guys you guys haven't
answered yet look in the video
description below on my video right now
there's a gleam i'll link gleam io will
basically detail you give you all the
information and what you need to
basically enter the competition it just
basically need your email so that way
whoever gleam io pics randomly we just
need to eat
you can get your mailing address and
then you just have to follow us on our
YouTube channels and social media
channels as well so best of luck to you
guys but back onto the main subject area
back to business basically I got this on
Prime day it's the Amazon echo and this
is just really more for looks like a
coffee mug but anyways how many guys
that asked me to review this here it's
been out for a little while it's
actually for personal use I've been
using ok Google you know my android
phones i've been using Siri on my iPad
that's in the bedroom and they you know
they've been hit-or-miss or so so I want
to give echo a shot let me know if you
guys want to review on this I'll be out
like I said I'm being dead serious not
trying to hype anything up here still
debating if I want to do a review on
that just let me know if you guys are
interested if you guys are then you know
push one out for you guys but you guys
have been asked me about this one here
this is the Amazon tap this is a little
bit newer than the echo obviously this
thing has been pretty bad ass so i'm
anticipating i'm reviewing that for you
guys and there's one other item here
it's not a review actually it is a
sponsorship a smart suitcase and what
I'm trying to say is those sponsorships
do help tremendously in helping me get
other content that you guys want to see
as well no merit of sponsorships I try
to pick out really good ones for you
guys who may find some interest in them
the smart suitcase is the world's first
smart suitcase so again that that will
be coming down the road probably be the
next video at his vlog here I'm actually
going out to the airport right now to
finish filming i didn't travel with it i
did personally use it though i've been
using it for like the past month or so
but i'm just wrapping a filming and
marrying and editing and hopefully
getting you that video probably within
the next day or two again as a really
quick sponsorship and then probably
amazon tap is next i like that i had
that sense Prime day so I've been tested
over the weekend and sitting with echo
as well and that's it that's really
within the next week or so and of course
there's more stuff coming down the road
I did or some new stuff this morning I
can't tell you guys what those are but a
lot of you guys have been asking about
it but it's been it was big overseas it
just wasn't bigger over here in the US
but now it's available again just wait
hi pipehype whatever but anyways alright
guys I'm gonna get back to work here
hope you guys enjoy this real quick you
know I hope
wish you guys the best in life best in
you know business best in your personal
goals and guys keep working keep
hustling and again it's all for a better
tomorrow you guys take care I see you
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
