j-bird just released their newest pair
of earbuds these are the j-bird runs and
they're truly wireless earphones the
Jaybirds are going for 179 dollars
Etha time this video and indeed j-bird
is slightly late to the game considering
I have reviewed the samsung gear icon X
John brought lead sports and the Apple
earpods now all excellent competitors
but jaybird does beat them out in price
now as always being transparent with you
guys j-bird didn't send these over for
review my assessment was not altered in
any way please watch the entire video
for both pros and cons last I've placed
my affiliate links in the video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time I'm Jimmy with Jim's
review room and I'm here to help you
make that purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review
go over the physical features these are
hard plastics with a lovely matte finish
around its logo with three different
sized ear tips and orphans jaybird has
redesigned the accessories hoping to
offer a more secure fit over the last
few products being released now I did
have slight trouble in the past with the
j-bird x2 and x3 staying in with the
j-bird runs I still unfortunately had
slight trouble as well but more on that
later but before getting into comfort
let's go over all the features and let's
see what is unique now very similar to
other truly wireless earphones a
charging case comes included when you're
not using the earbuds stow them away in
the case will recharge your earphones up
to two times from a dead battery and
when you stow them away they
automatically turn off now once you take
them out they automatically turn on and
the right earphone automatically goes
into pairing mode you don't have to
manually do it yourself which is highly
convenient very handy now once you take
both out and they pair with each other
and you're good to go now going on runs
and this is clearly subjective as
everyone's ears aren't different but
these Samsung Ikon X and Jarmo elite
sport that I had previously reviewed
stays on more secure at least from my
ears it is recommended to try different
fins and ear tip sizes which I have done
nonetheless during testing and even
during our filming as you can see here
the ear buds simply fall out no moderate
runs were okay or walking was perfectly
fine I would pay very close attention
here to make sure that these stay in
your ear while running please test them
out now moving on each side of the
earbud there's a single button very
tactile very good feedback because it's
a single button at each side there isn't
limits of functionality now in order to
increase or decrease Bob you have to go
into the app and select alternative
controls but you lose Google assistance
pause and play so this was possibly the
biggest letdown for me that I don't have
all my features readily available on the
earbuds themselves while most other
truly Wyler's earphones do then moving
on jaybird are known for making water
and sweat resistant earphones and a
jaybird runs are no difference i
drenched these things in water and
they're still functioning perfectly fine
unfortunately they're not i feeI crated
but for those who have owned Jaber
products before the freedoms the X 2 s
and X threes let me know in the comment
section below how long you've had them
for and if they're still working today
after getting rain or sweat on them mine
are personally going strong jumping into
better life
no charge they last up to four hours
more than the Jabra elites way more than
the icon X in real world testing I know
it sounds low but same with the Apple
earpods same with the other competitors
you definitely have enough for a workout
or a run most average consumers go to
the gym for about 45 minutes to an hour
anyways but when you have your earbuds
stowed while driving to your place
driving to the gym or so they're
charging I never found myself running
out of batteries also I confirm the five
minute charged in the case does give
about one hour worth of playback testing
the battery performance with off my
audio products I left it on at 50% vibe
from a full battery to dead that jaybird
runs lasted four hours in 21 minutes to
be exact
quickly touching base on my other test I
could not find the Bluetooth specs they
might be available when this video goes
up here but testing this with the
Samsung si+ I was able to get 46 linear
feet until the runs crackled in
connection the Japan runs are available
to take phone calls as well but I
noticed one the person on the other line
speaks it's only audible in the right
ear microphone quality is very good in
solid environments as my voice does come
across very very clear it does pick up
background noise and if you're running
there is some slight wind noise being
picked up as well so right before
talking about audio performance after
testing these for some time I realized
jaybird is aiming towards sport earbuds
with simplicity now you want music while
running that's what you get keep in mind
there runs retail for 179 dollars it
does undercut many out there many
competitors with the trade-off there's
no heart rate tracking or no health
tracking there's no onboard music
storage which would have been great and
although the jaybird runs provide very
good passive noise isolation when
wearing there are no ambient wear
features as an alternative so alright
folks through the moment you've been
waiting for my audio test here with the
jaybird products i implore you to
download the jaybird my sound app these
are one of the easiest tunable apps
available for the jaybird earphones even
extending them all the way up to see if
there's any distortion there's none at
its default flat setting this sounded ok
but once you start tweaking them wow
they sound amazing you want bass like
the power of beats 3 slide it up to the
max and you get it I prefer a bright
mid-range punchy bass and with the
tuning I'm able to achieve that now
whatever some profile I'm feeling
the moments I'm always impressed on how
much these can change without sounding
altered or pieced together you can say
that some other equalizers can do now
there is ever-so-slight listening
fatigue at higher volumes and extended
play but it's very minut lowering the
vehemence midge or at least turning down
the higher frequencies do help the sound
stages once again very good for a pair
of support here phones with a wide sense
of instruments presence and spatial
directional sound too now I love my
Samsung icon X giving great reviews on
its audio quality but the fact that I
can tune these and they tune well makes
the jaybird runs sound better the audio
is clear crisp vocals stand out the
snapping of fingers snare drums are very
distinct and the drums do have authority
when you have the bass up the overall
every general that I throw at this and
with the tuning they sounded great so in
the end if you look at the price point
they are not flagship they're not the
most high-tech pair of truly wireless
earphones which is fine but as a pair of
earphones you can pick up and go and you
simply just value a good music with no
wires the runs
I personally highly recommend I would
throw some caution though about the fit
once again everyone's ears are
subjective so just make sure they fit
for you and if I were to critique I
really wish that there was some way to
store music on these and I wish the
earbuds didn't have limited control I
was hoping for a vibe up and down and
all the other features to be available
