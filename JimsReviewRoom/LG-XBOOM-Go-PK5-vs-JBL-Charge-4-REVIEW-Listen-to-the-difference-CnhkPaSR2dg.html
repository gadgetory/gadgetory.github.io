browsing for things to review and
realize LG dropped the price
dramatically on their speakers at least
at the time this video they are
currently on sale they're considering
they're cheaper than before and a JBL
charge for is here let's see if LG is of
good value as always being transparent
LG did sponsor this video but my
assessment was not altered in any way
I'll be going over both pros and cons
LG's goal was to help receive exposure
from my channel that's it I'll place my
affiliate links down in that video
description below click on those links
for the most updated prices in real time
for example right now they are on sale
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
video
all right folks going over the physical
features first the design is quite
original and gets away from a lot of
that typical rectangle or cylinder shape
speaker the X frame not only helps with
making this look unique but it's
actually practical the grab and go
handle comes in very handy now the
entire unit is made of plastic with the
drivers protected behind this metal
grille but the biggest part of the LG X
boom go speakers are the LEDs they
pulsate to the music and it helps a lot
with the aesthetics that I personally
keep them on but you can always turn
them off if you'd like with the button
on the very top of the speaker moving on
on either side there's dual action bass
that's what LG calls their passive bass
radiators that vibrates and moves back
and forth when you're blasting music
it's pretty cool see as always and this
is not what I recommend for you guys to
do at home by giving some very firm
presses right here the bass radiators
are still intact no issues from my
testing the exponent golf PK 5 is IP x5
rated and this is clearly dependent on
your needs but it is splash and weather
resistant comparing to the competition
like JBL and sony those offer an ipx7
rating meaning that they can be
submerged underwater with LG's rating it
can withstand splashes and water sprays
from all directions now for some people
this is enough for those plans to use
this near the pool simply just drop it
in the pool with my testing of dripping
and dropping water here spraying it
actually the X boomed go pk5 it's still
working today now I'm taking a look at
the very top of the speaker please pause
the screen if you need to our buttons
are very responsive and very clicky here
everything is there with the option to
activate Google assistant or Siri and
the pause play button if you press that
twice you can skip forward if you press
it three times it will basically push
you back a song now I do wish there was
a better battery level indicator as well
it's just one light so far on the very
far left that a speaker shines either
red or blue and that's really it's
having a voice indicator like Bose or
maybe five LEDs like JBL
to indicate better level would have
helped tremendously now rotating to the
rear we have your USB hi
see port for powering up this speaker of
so thank you for LG for future proofing
this the JBL charge for also has type C
as well and Sony at least at the time of
this video are still using USB 2 for
some reason but I'm not really comparing
the sony xba-1 because the XP 32 is
right around the corner
they just haven't released the new model
just yet the LG has your 3.5 millimeter
port for physical connections a pairing
button so you can connect to LG X boom
go speakers and I have the the PK 7
actually right here you can see the size
difference as well pretty cool and have
them both play in sync now I've said
this before having two Bluetooth
speakers are going to sound so much
better than just having one big speaker
so if you get two of these I recommend
that option but depending on your
situation comparing to JBL and even Sony
those two brands the two other
competitors you can actually pair over a
hundred of these speakers if you'd like
if you need more than to connect at the
same time these two competitors are the
way to go by getting bad to that USB
ports LG claims recharging the battery
takes up to four hours while the JBL
charge four takes up to five and a half
hours battery life is rated at up to 18
hours abuse the JBL charge for claims up
to 20 and performing my test here at the
office with 50% of I'm with the Meridian
technology clear voice and enhanced bass
on I was able to achieve 11 hours and 31
minutes the JBL charge for achieved 9
hours and 14 minutes LG did a great job
here even after Clemmy and lower battery
life also that the fact that I have left
the LEDs on as well that's quite
impressive they comparing both of these
speakers both LG and JBL have bluetooth
4.2 we're not a blue 2/5 for some reason
but the bigger question how's the
performance signal strength wise JBL
achieved 89 linear feet and e LG X boom
go pk5 got 90 linear feet before they
signals start to crackle very minut
difference here but overall performed
very very well video wise both performed
very similar almost identical to each
other on both Android and Apple devices
YouTube and Netflix for the most part
played perfectly in sync
while the well on the very few
it felt like it was maybe a nanosecond
off it's so small that I don't think
this would bother most people using any
of these two speakers for just casual
video watching so alright folks touching
base on the audio before I give you the
demos here LG did partner with Meridian
technology the sound engineers the
designers and brains behind very
high-end home audio we're talking about
up to $80,000 loudspeakers they're
claiming for perfectly balanced sound at
any level volume not to mention the X
boom go pk5 has FX HD for high
resolution audio playback we don't get
that with JBL so this all sounds
promising but let's listen to my
unedited audio sample be sure to put on
your headphones or earphones as I'll be
using my binaural microphones that's the
only way you can hear this 3d audio test
and folks be sure to subscribe if you
haven't and throw some fire emojis in
that comment section let's see you guys
light it up here we go alright folks put
on your headphones or earphones for the
3d audio binaural test here we go
you know the rhythm is my enemy
no good I just don't like the sound
could you clean amazing Road and get out
on my face
I can't blue so get outta my face so
will you give me some air
try to be more what I need you don't
know
we
how you feel as long as you can show me
a good time
I don't need promises honestly no big
deal as long as you can show me good
and there you have it folks now audio
recorded on my end and then played
through your speakers are not the best
depiction of audio quality
hence my review here so first off Wow at
first these speakers did sound really
close with each other but after some
time I can pick out the nuances in
person both speakers are loud for the
midsize class of Bluetooth speakers
perfect for medium-sized rooms with
larger rooms good for general audio
listening
starting with bass there is slight
slightly more here at blg / JBL it's a
smidge more and you can somewhat notice
it on the second song with the second
sample that I provided earlier now JBL
already provides bass that I really like
out of a Bluetooth speaker and with LG
slightly offering more without being
distorted that's a plus for a midsize
bluetooth speaker it does well and I
will admit it's cleaner sounding and
better than the older sony xba-1 now
heading into the mid-range frequencies
where the vocals reside and the range
where the human ear interprets most
audio LG did a very good job by being
more balanced than the charge for from
my experience JBL has always been a bit
more forward and brighter which I do
know many like I really like the sound
signature too but I believe for those
who aren't looking for a more accurate
sound signature something that may be a
bit more balanced and less altered the
LG sounds more fitting in that area the
one area though that I was slightly
letdown with the charge for the alley
went with a single driver if you're
listening in a smaller room or simply
sitting closer to the charge for it
doesn't sound or it doesn't have that
wide experience the PK 5 because of
those dual drivers on the front the
sound is more direct and uniformed when
you're standing directly in front of it
but this goes without saying oh gee
isn't perfect either at maximum volume
levels because the charge 4 is so much
more forward so much more brighter in
comparison it makes the LG X boom go PK
5 clown slightly recessed if you had
both to compare back-to-back it's a
parents not a deal-breaker but if you're
planning on blasting this and maximum
volume constantly that's something to
think about now going into the high
notes again LG keeps it neutral never
overextending you don't get the ear
piercing ear piercing screeches or ting
in the ears but there is enough there to
be satisfied you can listen to the
speaker for extended periods of time and
not have listening fatigue the JBL is
slightly sharper on the top and but
again it's not harsh so in the end here
both speakers I think performed very
well in their own way I believe with the
Meridian technology the audio is tuned
to be neutral across the board some
people would prefer that or very much
enjoy that and some people would prefer
maybe more in a live sound signature now
do wish there was better waterproofing
on this thing but everything else to be
honest with you it's a clear winner
there's better better life in rural
tests you get the LEDs as well you get a
design that's original compared to many
others out there and now considering
that sales price that's honestly the
main reason why I chose to review this
just to see how it is LG is offering a
lot of value right now with the sale
that's going on guys check out the LG
speaker with my link down below or check
out LG's website on line I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review and I'm here to help you
guys make that purchase decision you
guys take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
