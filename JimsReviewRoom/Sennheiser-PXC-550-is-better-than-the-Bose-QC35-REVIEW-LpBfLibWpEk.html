room active noise-cancelling headphones
are getting a lot of traction we have
the best of the best that I've
personally tested so far that's the
boast QC 35 we have these Sony Hurons
100 ABM and today I'm testing the
Sennheiser PXE 550 s that several of you
asked me to review prices are on your
screen and retail wise these
Sennheiser's are slightly more expensive
at the time this video but I'll leave my
personal links in the video description
below click on my links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
so without further ado my channel is
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to James
going over the physical features first
these do feel very premium the leather
headband up top is soft and supple and
it's also cool to the touch when we look
at the extendable arms they're
reinforced metal to keep the headphones
in tact but yet there's still one ear
those a bit concerning to me it was the
all plastic hinges that Sennheiser
decided to use during my stress test
here that's pretty standard on all the
headphone reviews that I do I'm aware
it's a bit extreme but at least you'll
know how well these hold up here they
didn't even make a creak I did notice
though the headbands do stretch but
thankfully you can always bend them back
quite easily
now Sennheiser does market these as
travel headphones just like the bose
qc25 in boast QC 35 s the ear cups do
fold inward and the air cap to do
collapse for compact stowing moving on
to the ear cups themselves this is where
Sennheiser shows off its uniqueness to
turn on the headphones turn the ear cups
to its natural position you'll hear and
feel the ear cups click into place
signifying that they're on now I wasn't
too fond of this feature though since I
would have to be mindful each time I
place them down or else I could
accidentally leave them on and that way
they would drain the battery completely
now the right ear cup where there's
touch sensitive controls and this has to
be the most responsive touch controls
that I've ever experienced that a pair
of headphones a gentle swipe up and down
raises and lowers the volume gentle
swept left and right skips and goes back
on songs
tapping pauses the music and plays it as
well and with a long hold it will give
you the battery remaining levels now
another great feature that I would love
to see on other headphones Sennheiser
calls it smart pause now when you pull
one side of the ear cups or take the
headphones off altogether to hear your
surroundings the audio stops and once
you put back that ear cup or the
headphones on your head again the music
continues just make sure you turn this
particular feature on in the app as
smart pause is off by default from the
factory there's also this nifty feature
DoubleTap on that right ear cup and your
music stops
and the microphones will pick up your
environment and somewhat amplify your
hearing I would imagine this being
useful when you're at a conference or
listening to a speaker or if you want to
eavesdrop on somebody near you last of
the hidden features available this one
is pretty straightforward
NFC is offered just tap that left ear
cup with your NFC enabled phone and both
devices will pair with each other a
little faster than going into your
Bluetooth settings but let's take a look
at the buttons here on the right ear cup
once again the Bluetooth switch is
pretty much hidden by one of the ear cup
arms yet moving down slightly the first
button is to turn on and off the hybrid
active noise cancellation feature which
I'll detail right before I get into the
audio test the next button cycles
through different sound profiles to
change the audio characteristics while
you listen to either music movies
podcast etc and yet to the bottom of
that is the microUSB port for charging
your headphones and since we're on the
subject of batteries in charging gear
Sennheiser is claiming up to 30 hours of
use if you do keep active
noise-cancelling on Sennheiser then
claims up to 20 hours of use in which I
was able to get 21 hours and 17 minutes
and then without active noise canceling
on my battery tests showed 30 hours in
42 minutes at 50% volume recharging
though did take about 3 hours to
complete from a dead battery but back to
that microUSB port once again for a
quick second all of the perks you can
connect this to your laptop or desktop
and you can listen to audio through the
supplied USB cable and at the same time
the headphones will charge while you're
using them perfect for those in that
office environments and doesn't mind
that wired connection and the very last
port here they went with a two and a
half millimeter jack if you would like
to connect this traditionally now my
only gripe though I personally have
physically on this particular device one
it is in use it is somewhat hard to find
these buttons since they are not as
pronounced or protruding as other
headphones aesthetically it looks great
it looks clean but in practice it's hard
to recognize when you need to adjust
those settings
as for comfort as I've mentioned before
anything around 200 to 240 gram ranges
light weight for me the Sennheiser's
here came in at 227 grams there's very
minimal to no fatigue whatsoever on the
crown of the head when you do wear this
for several hours straight the draw line
pressure is very comfortable as well and
these over ear ear pads just ever so
slightly cause my ears to sweat but
never felt like they were overheating in
indoor environments so last before I
touch base on sound quality this does
come with a carrying case you can
determine if this is big or not for your
traveling needs but inside there is an
area to keep all of your supplied cables
contained the cables include the two and
a half to three half millimeter cable as
we discussed earlier the USB cord the
airplane adapter for use for in-flight
entertainment and last is the adapter
for connecting you to your receiver or
at home amp or if you have a studio
somewhere in your house so let's get to
the active noise-cancelling performance
Sennheiser is claiming to offer a hybrid
system meant to adjust to your
environment called noise guard you can
turn it on to a maximum if you like or
you can leave it at 50% or turn it off
altogether and to be clear or for those
who are not too familiar with active
noise canceling headphones they don't
block out everything however they do
block out a good amount of noise outside
noise that is to offer a more immersive
listening experience from my testing the
PXE 550 s does very good here testing
these they do very well at Starbucks
with many people around here talking and
moving around I've tested this in the
middle of the city during rush hour and
blocked out a good bit of noise yet one
of the things I noticed from the bose
qc25 s in both QC 35 you don't
experience here on the Sennheiser's how
describe as pressure from turning on a
noise canceling feature for some that
airplane cabin pressure feeling that's
part of the best I could describe it is
a discomfort for some and it is
experienced definitely on the bose qc25
and 35 s you don't get it here on a pxc
550 s now with these Sennheiser's you
still hear slightly more chatter or city
noise around you
though they still perform great though
but more on par with the likes of these
sony ABN s and the pair at Zeke's in
regards to noise canceling performance
now moving on to audio quality first and
foremost let these burn in a little here
when you first use them they do sound
slightly recessed and not expansive at
all even as short burnin about 30
minutes of using them I did notice a
difference now afterwards bass was found
to be tight and punchy not overdone for
those who like some bass the PXE five
fifties provided that though it provides
lean non bloated bass now if you want
deeper bass a definite bass boosted
signature a sennheiser momentum to
wireless i reviewed a while back does
provide that now here the mids are good
and it's rich in detail from my
experience very balanced and very easy
to listen to the high notes I do admit
are somewhat bright and possibly the
most emphasized out of all the
frequencies all these sound frequencies
that I've been describing so far now
it's not your ringing it's not your
singing it's not your piercing but
something that you'll notice some mate
like the higher frequencies especially
those listening to instrumental those
piano keys snare drums cymbal crashes
they do stand out very much with great
detail for the average consumer
most will still enjoy the silent
signature but the more analytical
listeners they find it not as natural or
neutral because of these high notes
being pushed somewhat forward here so
Sennheiser does alleviate this with
their cap tune app for both Apple and
Android devices and the app does provide
a very good EQ adjustment now to change
the sound profile to your liking
basically as for the soundstage it's
already amazing staff from the factory
very clear distinct left and right audio
channels very clear on where the audio
direction is coming from the soundstage
is quite impressive so overall I really
enjoy these pair of headphones despite
having some weird quirks here like the
ear cups needing to lay flat to turn off
and the sound signature that isn't the
most accurate I'll omit that but using
the supplied app to EQ does seriously
help again in the comments section below
if there's other headphones you want me
to compare with
these here write it down and I'll see
what I can do so guys remember to add me
on my social media the addresses should
be on your screen right now
like and subscribe if you haven't
already and guys I'm Jimmy with Jim to
review room here to help you make a
purchase decision you guys take care and
I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
