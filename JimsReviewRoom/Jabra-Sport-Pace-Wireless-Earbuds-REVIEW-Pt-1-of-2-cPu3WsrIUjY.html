room many folks we're buds in the gym or
while running but sport earbuds they
give you the added protection of being
sweat and dust resistant not to mention
they're usually built a little bit more
rugged Jabra offers this with their
sport pace model at the retail price of
$99 but what is unique besides offering
sound for your music of course these
earbuds provides you information about
your workouts in real time now get into
detail about that pretty shortly now
I'll make this video part 1 of 2 and I
also suggest watching part 2 here which
is a very similar model that Java
provided me the Jabra sport coach it
features a different design and some
different features as well unless you
can always click on the link in the
video description below for the most
updated pricing so without further adieu
I'm Jimmy with gyms review room my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review going over the physical
features first there's no question this
looks like the powerbeats2 if you prefer
the stability of the ear hooks rather
than the wingtips on the drawbar
sportcoat these are the way to go up top
that your hooks are flexible yet they do
stay in a fixed position although they
don't hold its form after you bend them
to offer a more versatile fit they feel
perfectly fine and the comfort was no
problem at all but more my comfort test
a little bit later
moving down the left earbud features a
microUSB port for charging with Jabra
climbing a battery life of up to 5 hours
from my testing of leaving this on all
day at 50 percent volume with two
15-minute runs in between I was able to
achieve 4 hours and 24 minutes of use
which when you do compared to other
wireless sport Bluetooth earphones the
up to 5 hours or my actual results are a
bit on the low side but to be fair
besides the JBL model that I have listed
here the sport pays for draw bruh
actually cost significantly less
remitting on the Left earbuds on the
outside of device there's a small button
to answer phone calls and when pressed
during a workout gives you information
on your current performance of our
construction on these are all hard
plastic which held up well when throwing
these into my bag and probably even
worse here into my pockets
but taking these out of my pocket the
chords are tangle-free limiting some
frustration here and the sport pace
model does come with a reflective
coating so you can be more visible at
night while running or cycling last on
the right side our volume control
buttons but also works at skipping songs
by holding down either volume up or down
and this worked on my locally stored
music plus streaming services like
Pandora or iHeartRadio also be aware
some earphone the bottom control buttons
only work with either Apple or Android
just be aware of that however it did
confirm with the sport pace it does work
on both platforms last as I stated
earlier these are water in dust
resistant Java state this is IP 54
certified with the number 5 out of 6
indicating this is of course dust
resistance and the number 4 out of 9
indicating this can withstand water
splashes from any direction essentially
you can sweat with this on or get them
wet or of course be caught in the rain
and have no problems after my testing
which is a little bit more aggressive
don't try this at home
my earbuds are still working fine and
right before getting into comfort Jabra
unfortunately doesn't provide a carrying
case so the earbuds and the included ear
tips won't be as protected as you'd like
but regarding the ear tips there's three
in total and they do provide a good bit
of comfort
although these support pace includes the
ear hooks the area tops do sit somewhat
in the ear canal from my experience
they're not fully in your earphones but
they do isolate a good bit of outside
noise now I know with some runners and
especially cyclists this can impact
their purchase decision as it does
isolate your surroundings may be causing
a dangerous environment but on the other
end having some sound isolation does
provide an immersive experience allowing
you to hear music and the audio cues
much more clear so you guys can be the
judge on that but these worked out great
in regards to staying in my ear where
they're running or maybe doing some more
vigorous exercises like jumping jacks
maybe some push ups here or running up
an oddly shaped Hill the earbuds never
fell out of my ear nor did I lose audio
isolation but before getting into the
sound test Jabra and their sport lineup
of earphones differentiates from other
sport earphones that just basically
plays audio by offering a very
comprehensive app to help supplement
your workouts on the main page any of
the metrics you see on screen you can
customize and have it show different
bits of information on this page you can
select either distance calories burned
average pace speed in your split pace
moving down you can segment your work
and label it as any of the filing you
see on your screen and if you need to
feel free to rewind the video here or
pause it if I'm going a little too fast
you can choose free mode which will
measure most of your basics for you or
you can set goals before you start an
activity you can target a specific
distance time calories to burn target
pace which is my favorite or interval
training now while you're working out
the app through your earphones will
provide audio cues and your current
progress for example while you're
running this will indicate how much
distance you've ran indicate your pace
time etc without the need to take out
your phone last you can select your
music and I'm glad you can choose local
music store on your phone but choosing
show more you have a bunch of others to
choose from like Pandora iHeartRadio
even twitch for example but let's start
a running segment here and just see how
that works when you initiate a run your
phone's GPS will kick in to track your
distance and help with calculating your
pace speed and other various data during
the run as stated earlier you can tap on
the button on the left side of the
earphone to get all this information in
your ear but if you prefer to pull out
your phone distance in duration are
shown right from the factory but like I
said I can always change this
information displayed by just a simple
tab also and before I forget to mention
comparing to the Jabra sport pulse and
the Jarboe sport coach the apps are very
similar at first glance but there are
different metrics that are displayed for
each one example I didn't see cadence
being available for running on here as
it was indeed available on the Jabra
coach again watch part 2 if you want to
see what else is offered swiping right
much more information is displayed again
all customizable and the very last page
is a real-time map of your run and I'm
showing you my run from the other day
since I don't want to show the GPS
location where my studio is currently
located so once you finish here you
receive a quick summary and as I always
love here graphs to see your performance
now for those who already using apps
like endomondo RunKeeper Strava My
Fitness Pal and runtastic this app does
feed data to those apps for you now
before going into the audio portion next
here let me show you real quick what
other features are on here in the menu
icon you have history to see all of your
runs of course but better achievements
are viewable to see and compare your
best week your best month and you can
even compare what was your best record
for the entire year there's also a
fitness test which you can perform when
you first get this to a baseline you
performance as well and last in settings
as I stated earlier during any of your
workouts the earphones will periodically
come on lowering the music if you have
that on as well and inform you of the
following information on the screen now
what's also important you can select
when the audio prompts comes on every
minute or even up to every hour or a
read out at certain marked like every
half a mile or every mile that you run
and for those who will be at the gym
some folks leave their phone down on the
ground while re-racking or may be doing
deadlifts and whatnot they don't want
their phone in their pocket I tested the
signal strength and I was able to
achieve about 35 to 40 linear feet until
the audio starts to cut out a little bit
here as proven here in this video so if
you got a walk across the room I don't
think should have any problems
whatsoever finally let's talk about
jobless sound signature starting with
bass these do offer a good amount of
bass it's not sub bass levels it's not
sounding as deep as the power beats but
these offer I think a very much
acceptable amount of bass boost fitting
from most genres of hip-hop pop and EDM
and although it's a bit more basic it's
clean without droning in general and not
bleeding over to the mid-range the
mid-range accompanies the bass levels
without sounding weak yet not sounding
bright either for the price of these
earphones vocals and the mid-range of
the instruments are done very well with
clear audio that's still Pleasant and
satisfying to listen to and as for the
high notes there's nothing screeching
there's no tinging nothing to
high-pitched
basically for me to listen to an
experience to cause any kind of
listening fatigue now overall I'm really
enjoying this to be honest with you if I
had to critique there isn't much or to
be a Trojan maybe any sounds separation
at all or any soundstage to be present
which is a bummer but yet again for the
price it's not a bad experience so
that's it for this review remember to
check out the links in the video
description if you want to check for
updated pricing or to watch part two
which I detail the Jabra sport coach and
compare that with these here remember to
