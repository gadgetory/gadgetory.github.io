of my life i have been absolutely happy
with this little device chromecast
essentially lets you play a slew of
online media content from Netflix Hulu
HBO GO and many others that I eventually
list on the screen making quote a dumb
TV into a smart one for those who are
heavy into movies or better yet original
shows like orange is the new black in
house of cards that you can't find on
cable TV this device is a must-have
here's how it works in simplest terms
along with my review of the new
chromecast from Google so without
further ado welcome everyone to Jim's
the device itself is all plastic with a
rubber like protective jacket for the
cord unlike the original chromecast
which resembled a thumb drive the new
chromecast will dangle once connected
the main part measures just 2 inches
wide and remains relatively thin working
for most people's setups but for those
with a very slim profile TV and hangs on
the wall like mine here I'm happy to say
the new chromecast still fits but
instead I'm using this old TV here slash
monitor circa 2008 to show that this can
work on all models of TV's as long as
you have an HDMI port the chromecast
does require a separate power source
than Google does supply a power cable
claiming a length of 5 and 3/4 inches
now when I personally measured this it
was about 5 feet and 8 or 9 inches or so
but this included the chromecast the USB
cable and the wall adapter all connected
together so just a heads up on that if
length is very important to you now for
those who do have a USB port on the back
of their TVs you can use that instead I
recommend using a smaller USB cable
lying around here as I did for this
particular situation and this works
perfectly fine next download the app and
go through the very simple instructions
on setting up the chromecast to find
your router and that's basically it so
how does chromecast work well let me try
to illustrate here on your phone any app
with the chromecast icon like Netflix
Hulu etc tap that to signal that you
want this particular show or movie to
play your
phone through Wi-Fi will signal the
chromecast to open its own app and
retrieve that particular video from the
Internet the chromecast never gets your
streaming video directly from your phone
in a few seconds that little dongle you
connected will start streaming your
video through the homes internet
wirelessly your phone is free to do
whatever one so you can turn it off
watch other videos on your phone think
of it as your phone as an interactive
and versatile remote control as well
you can adjust volume fast forward and
also back as well and browse all the
shows at your convenience and before I
forget here this does work on both Apple
and Android devices now the new
chromecast has been bumped up in speed
and more importantly Wi-Fi connection
stability having the old versus the new
the new chromecast would load about 10
to 12 seconds faster from the time you
turn on your TV to the main screen and
the clock would show up now as we're
loading apps the new chromecast loaded
on average and keep in mind this is an
average I know the video I'm showing you
right now is actually one of my tests
but the new one here loads 2.3 seconds
faster again that's just from the time
that you click cast to the time that the
app starts buffering for the total time
this includes the app opening into the
time the internet is done buffering of
course this will vary because everyone's
internet speeds are different the new
chromecast loaded about seven point
seven five seconds faster for me again
on average some apps loaded about the
same speed while other apps did take
slightly longer when comparing between
the old versus the new but with all
those fancy numbers it does prove that
it's faster but in real world
experiences it's not too drastic to say
wow they're still slight buffering you
will notice an increase from time to
time but there will be other moments
where you will say this seems pretty
normal if you have used the old
chromecast from the past yet the biggest
benefit though and I do stand by this
the connection feels more stable since
it now supports a wireless AC with my AC
router the AC band works on five
gigahertz in laymen terms there's less
noise less traffic less interference the
strength range and again stability in AC
technology alone is the haymaker punch
in this redesign I think now the one
last bit that I want to touch on here
chromecast just like the original one
supported mirroring your Chrome web
browser last model was laggy twitchy and
barely good streamed video at least for
me here
testing this one there's just a
one-second delay in between my actions
and what is displayed even video is play
perfectly fine for me now I do have to
say the resolution or clarity in general
is not HD like what you see on your
computer screen so texts and images
won't be as sharp but for something
simple that needs to be quickly shown it
works very fast and very simple right
from your chrome desktop browser now the
only issues really with the chromecast
although this now has much more content
or apps supporting device Amazon
streaming services and iTunes are not
supported at least not yet as of this
video but if you're into the other major
ones you definitely should be fine the
other limitations and for me personally
I don't mind this some will say it
doesn't come with its own independent
controller like Roku or the Amazon fire
TV and despite not having a huge or
major update to the software side of
things like offering an interface or
menu screen on your TV again which I
don't mind are technically not present
here but for just $35 and all you're
doing is streaming and not desiring to
let's say play games like the fire TV or
Nvidia products you really can't go
wrong here again 35 bucks so overall if
you have the original chromecast I'd say
keep it I still use it from my other TV
if you don't have one or just value a
slight increase in speed but a more
stable connection then this is perfect
no question this will be on my holiday
gift guide later down the road
alright Facebook fam that is it for this
review if you haven't already done so
like and subscribe to my channel here
and follow me on Facebook Twitter and or
Instagram you guys see some sexy photos
of behind the scenes stuff and also of
course the products that I will be
reviewing again this has been the review
of the Google chromecast and bought by
me personally myself I wasn't sponsored
and I'll put the link in the description
below you can click on that sometimes
