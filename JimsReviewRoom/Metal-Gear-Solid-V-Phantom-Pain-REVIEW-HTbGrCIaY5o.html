snake is finally back well big boss
technically now I won't go deep into the
MGS history since it's very deep
spending across two decades of story
line if you have never played any Metal
Gear Solid titles before as a standalone
game phantom pain is still very
enjoyable but I'll say the details once
we get started here if you need updated
pricing and how much it's going for
today you can click on my link in the
video description below just to see what
it's going for on Amazon currently so
without further ado welcome everyone to
another review
the core mechanics and feel of the Metal
Gear franchise is still here the subtle
humor of sneaking around in a box the
emphasis on stealth and the
out-of-this-world science fiction but
phantom pain surprisingly makes a lot of
changes that you wouldn't see at first
glance unlike the previous titles
wearing different camouflage does help
in hiding of course but there isn't a
percentage of how effective it is no
more numbers are shown in the top right
hand of the corner the degree of
difficulty of enemies seeing you in
various distances has dramatically
increased and we as the player have no
way of telling this in addition the open
world around us has completely changed
due to different elevations time of days
changing over time and in lack of narrow
hallways and corridors as older titles
and all this is not a bad thing at all
to be honest with you it really adds to
the depth of the game now let me further
illustrate what is different with
phantom pain the open road kijima has
created is rich with patrol members of
walking along random roadways and convoy
trucks are making random stops
throughout the entire game now despite
tagging everyone in your mission area
when you're doing reconnaissance you
never know when an unmarked soldier
might drive up and find the bodies we
left behind but on top of that and
further into the game there's snipers to
be wary about and soldiers with
night-vision goggles and although it
sounds much harder it's really not
there's still a very good balance of
being mindful of what you're doing but
more so than other previous mgs titles
just there clear that up but about that
open-world it is vast it's huge you
travel with your horse companion and
other vehicles in the game like in many
metal gears and Walker here and you can
use your support helicopter to get from
one place to the other navigating isn't
too difficult of course but man the
distance from one place to another can
be daunting from time to time and you're
just riding and riding if riding across
the land here now the helicopter works
but there's tons of loading screens that
going by horse may have gotten you there
in the same amount of time but it does
add a sense of realism about traveling
and whatnot but there's times you just
want to get up and be dropped into the
mission
area but because of the open world the
game is less linear offering multiple
points of entry and execution that you'd
need to be thoughtful about as well now
besides the main 50 missions or so
there's 157 side missions that will keep
you busy for a very very long time as
for gameplay mechanics like all mgs
titles before that I played the controls
are very fluid and moved with ease now
once you start to master the quick
select features you'll be switching
weapons to flashbangs in no time again
very fluid very dynamic and regarding
weapons
I think Metal Gear has outdone
themselves here with a crazy amount to
develop and choose over time the only
area that I would take regarding the
gameplay is sometimes the camera angles
are just too close to Big Boss creating
distractions from your main area of view
but other than that graphics look
appropriate with some Allison here and
there though but it's really minut but
the lighting in this game looked amazing
from the floodlights to the Sun setting
all beautifully done with a new Fox
engine but what I wanted to do is move
more into the game's progression and
replay value no good first 10 to 15
hours I'll admit it was quite slow for
me you're really just building up your
army by knocking your enemies out then
attaching what they called The Fault in
balloon to extract your enemies and
convert them to your troops in phantom
pain you go at the length at collecting
both enemies raw material scattered
throughout the game and GMP basically
Metal Gear Solid in-game currency
now with the new recruitments and the
rest that I just mentioned here only
then can you further develop your
headquarters and develop better weapons
and gear in general completely ignoring
the recruitment of new personnel and
focusing on the story exclusively can be
done but this does leave you to a big
disadvantage later on when certain items
would help greatly thankfully it doesn't
seem tedious like a full-blown RPG yet
it does add an additional dimension or
element to the game now because of that
foltyn balloon system I mentioned
earlier I rarely hit a body I would
extract nearly every one of them making
at least this aspect of the game much
easier unlike all previous mgs titles
you had to be smart and hide bodies well
that's a little disappointed or really
exploited that feature that they offered
in phantom pain an additional layer to
mother base since these servers for
online gameplay is down since the game
launched I couldn't test this but you
can false an extract turns and
eventually vehicles offering defense
free HQ once online returns once you
reach a certain point in the game you
can go into the multiplayer mode and
invade other bases in attempt to destroy
it and of course steal the items and
recruit your own personnel so building
up your base now in the single-player
campaign can be a fun side game later on
again once multiplayer is up and running
but back to the main storyline here
after Afghanistan which is the first
open area that you would explore the
second open world you explore is South
Africa about 20 hours into the game it
then starts to pick up security cameras
are just introduced and from their enemy
aiming abilities more water tanks and
deadly combat choppers are in the air
and of course the story starts to pick
up with little bit of a twist and a turn
around that marker around that point
overall the tactical espionage of the
game I think is amazing now to be answer
to the best in the mgs franchise the
replay value is tremendous with the
ridiculous amount of side missions to do
and surprisingly I didn't feel it was
very repetitive most missions are at
different locations in an open world so
each brings a new dynamic or a style
execution when you enter into the
mission area and then there's the online
element which should be coming back up
very soon now as for the story not
getting too deep since it's deep as hell
it is very drawn-out and the boss
battles didn't seem as iconic and as
memorable as the previous titles
unfortunately but when the story does
headed twist or turn child soldiers
defecting characters and seeing how this
ties in with the whole future of Metal
Gear Solid games makes up for anything
that's lacking in phantom pain which I
felt was very minimal but that's all I
can say that is a real negative to be
honest with you I know some sites were
giving this a 10 out of 10 but if I had
to give an informal ring I would still
give this a 9 and a half out of 10 no
question worth a purchase worth playing
through all the way to the end and worth
playing part of the Metal Gear Solid
saga I won't spoil the story or its
ending but I'm sure there's tons of
other sources out there if you want that
I just want to give you an idea of how
this plays
in general enjoyability so hope this
review helped you in some way if you
enjoyed my work be sure to add me on
Twitter Instagram or Facebook and stop
by to say hi again I'm Jimmy with jims
review room you guys take care and I'll
see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
