review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the Kindle Fire HDX from
amazon.com and hopefully with this
review it does help you with determining
if this is worth a buy or not I'm going
straight into this review because there
is a lot to cover so hang in there the
specific model I have here is the 7-inch
HDX 16 gigabyte version priced at $229
the HDX also comes in a 8.9 inch at 379
dollars now of course check amazon.com
for its latest pricing and I'm a
reviewing the 7 inch today because the
previous generation Kindle Fire they
were way more people buying the 7 inch
version over the 8.9 inch
now both does come in 16 32 and 64 gigs
to meet your storage needs and both have
the same processing power with a 2.2
gigahertz quad-core processor which is
three times more powerful than the
previous generation Kindle from Amazon
so in this review we'll take a tour of
the exterior first the HDX features a
unique design that have beveled edges on
the back of the tablet when I first seen
these images of the Kindle HDX I was a
bit underwhelmed because it did look a
bit blocky there kind of reminded me of
like a transformer so but in person it's
not the case at all it looks refined and
serves its purpose as you can see on the
back you'll find your power button here
and on the left side here the Valium
rockers here which both feels much more
quality oriented with very solid clicks
and feedback compared to lancers model
and on the very top still features two
speakers from my test the speakers are
good with no distortion and there is
depth and spatial sound thanks to his
Dolby Digital processing an example
would be a crowd of people in the
background with the main characters in
the foreground speaking you can
distinguish the sound fields for a
tablet the simulated surround sound is
good and loud enough when you have it in
front of you
going back to the Kindle on the right of
the Kindle features your 3.5 millimeter
headphone input here and Ali left
features your micro USB connection to
charge the unit and this year's model
came with a USB wall charger which is
great since last year's didn't have this
you can still charge the HDX though
through your laptop or desktop with the
supplied USB wire battery life is the
best on the HDX line having about 11
hours of mix and use compared to 10
hours on the regular Kindle Fire that
Amazon's themselves now the unit is
still very comfortable to hold and fits
perfectly in my medium-sized hands and
the HDX lineup is as at least 22 percent
lighter than last year's with this
7-inch model coming in at 10 point 7
ounces and it's on par with the newest
7-inch tablets slowly coming to the
market today the Kindle Fire HDX does
feature a 720p resolution front facing
camera which is ideal for those free
video calls on skype or performing those
self-portraits they're only on the 8.9
inch HDX does it feature the same
front-facing camera but the rear now has
an 8 megapixel camera as well that
records your videos in 1080p and again
it's only on the 8.9 inch models that
offers the rear facing camera and will
dive into the hardly Kindle and what
makes this such a unique tablet the
screen features a 1200 by 1920
resolution display which now features
323 pixels per inch and for those who
don't know the more pixels per inch
abbreviated PP is the more density you
have on your screen meaning more detail
to your content and for your ear eaters
out there crisp and clear text as for
this review at 323 PP eyes this beats
every ereader out there and is on par
with latest and greatest tablets on the
market today in the screen also boasts a
hundred percent color accuracy / Amazon
that matches the RGB color spectrum
precisely so all of those jargon sounds
really nice on paper such as one of the
fastest processors on the market today
clear resolution and color accuracy
etc but through my test does it hold up
and absolutely it does in almost every
way if you're currently using the
previous generation Kindle Fire or even
the Nook HD which I have personal
experience from and done reviews on this
new tablet will be a serious and I mean
serious upgrade for you a screen looks
amazing and it's correct the colors are
vibrant and the contrast is deep and the
blacks are black and the whole whites
are truly white nothing's washed out
because of its processor and graphics
engine which is the best that Qualcomm
has to offer today this thing screams
it's fast as can be with nearly
everything I open it opens instantly
they're more demanding applications and
high-definition video still you with a
slight buffer time like comparing with
other tablets currently available it's
as fast or faster now every game that
I've thrown edit so far showed no signs
of slowdown or issues running so overall
performance hands-down this thing is
amazing you don't even need to question
what you can use on this everything
available for the tablets today this
thing will run so if you're a first-time
user of a Kindle or think of jumping to
a Kindle tablet for the first time it's
very easy to use if you already own an
Android powered smartphone the Kindle
Fire also uses an Android based
operating system which means you'll
probably be familiar with some of its
menus for the most part you'll mainly be
on the home page here the home page on
the very top gives you a list of menu
items to choose from such as your
downloaded games downloaded apps videos
for you to purchase or access free
videos if you're an Amazon Prime user
you can surf the internet here view your
photos etc so very simple and
self-explanatory the next section and
your home page features what Amazon
calls a carousel that shows your most
recent open applications and you can
remove them from your carousel just by
holding down on the icon and tap on
remove from carousel again it's simple
again to customize and Leslie below that
are all of your applications you've
downloaded so far you can customize this
section as well so you can have easy
access to your applications anytime
you're on the home page and if you're
ever lost within any of these programs
all you have to do is find this little
house icon here and it will always bring
you back to the main page searching for
books is robust as well from the main
page click shop on the top left here and
anything that you can browse before
purchasing can be found along here as
well I can click on books and the
library is open at your fingertips I
click on a book for example and you can
view its synopsis you can read other
people's reviews look at the release
date etc and I can download a sample of
the book before even purchasing so as
you can see it's very easy to use and
straightforward however if there's ever
a time you're confused or have any
issues only and the HDX lineup features
a Mayday button is what Amazon calls it
at any time during the day and anywhere
in the world as long as you have Wi-Fi
you can call upon tech support free 24/7
swipe your finger from above and you're
setting menus will appear tap on this
Mayday button right here and you'll have
a representative in no-time guide you
through your questions the Amazon
representative also circles and
indicates where on your actual screen on
what to click and where to go Amazon
already has in my opinion excellent
customer service but for them to evolve
customer service to this level where
it's a bit more visual really sets the
bar high for hopefully future companies
to follow imagine for your parents or
your children or a not-so tech savvy
individual this is truly guidance here
and I see it as very promising and don't
worry the Amazon rep can't see you you
can only see them
other noteworthy features that are
exclusive with Amazon and its Kindle if
you're an Amazon Prime member you have
much free content such as free shows and
movies through Prime's instant videos a
variety of books are also free you'll
have access to cloud storage so if you
upload anything into your Amazon Cloud
account you can access it anywhere in
the world through your tablet and lastly
you can set up timers and restrictions
for your kids to limit their usage on
the tablet now any product in the world
will have some sort of flaw or con here
in this case there's not many cons at
all but I do have to mention them
there's no external memory support now I
can't use an SD or a micro sd card to
expand its memory something that I wish
was available it would be easy to
transfer files or expand memory with
this feature another issue here a flash
support is not supported if you don't
know what flash is or don't utilize it
it's not a big deal it isn't necessarily
a negative since you've probably been
fine without it it's not Amazon's fault
though on this issue but Adobe the
makers of flash encoding has decided not
to support Android any longer so
although flash is slowing or dying down
in a sense some folks still utilizes
Flash content though another drawback I
can think of was not all apps were
available as of today I'm still trying
to find the official YouTube Google Maps
and Google now apps all of which I
consistently use on a daily basis and I
wish that that nice 8 megapixel camera
was found on the back of the 7-inch
models as well but I'm sure they would
drive up the price point but besides
that I I really can't think of any other
issues I didn't find any errors or flaws
during my time with the device so far so
it's been very solid it's a quality
build and it's better than last year's
model as a tablet it has possibly all
the highest end specs you can find in a
tablet at the moment and it's all price
for only 229 dollars which is
but cheap for such features and
performance that you get so that's it
for my review I know it's a bit longer
but I hope this review did help someone
else out there as always I appreciate
all the support and if there is
something that I did left out as a
