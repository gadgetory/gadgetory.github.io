by Jim's review room today I have the
Logitech c920 Logitech's newest flagship
webcam what I want to do is talk about
the construction style the specs and
also the features and also my pros and
cons after I use it for a bit just give
you an opinion of what I think and feel
after using it for a while let's start
here the construction itself it's made
out of plastic and a matte black finish
the only area where it's not matte
finish is this top part here where it's
a clear coated glossy fingerprint prone
area as you can see here a strong sturdy
construction that weighs in about seven
point seven ounces I just have a little
bit of weight to it
now I would be concerned for those who
are anticipating on bringing this to
travel with them
it doesn't fully collapse I can see the
webcam maybe tilts up and down 160
degrees or so folding this and then
putting into your laptop case it might
be a little bit of a nuisance and plus
it comes with and this is a good thing
because of a six-foot-long cable so at
least that for transport it might be a
little bit cumbersome but in general
it's a solid billet webcam and comes
with all the wiring maybe enough
wondering that you may need on that the
exterior does features these rubber
mounts that are pretty sturdy as well
they do clamp on to your monitor or TV
exceptionally well and provide that grip
lets you prevent any slippage as well
and you get that rubber grip here and a
rubber grip here as well another
exterior feature is the threaded mount
here which is great in this one of the
big reasons why I bought this webcam you
can actually use this threaded mount to
mount it onto a tripod just to have a
fixed shooting angle or fixed camera you
can say the exterior also features LED
lighting you have and it's not shown
here but two LED blue lights that come
up when you are recording
when it's recording which is also a neat
feature it also features dual
microphones on each side to give you
that stereo sound the sound that you
hear right now is from a second Logitech
c920 webcam and that you currently hear
right now so you can judge how the audio
sounds like you said what you hear is
actually what we see 920 is recorded
right now that lets go into the specs I
guess this does feature a Carl Zeiss
lens and again you're looking at image
quality from another c920 which I have
recording and this is the quality that
you see right now it's recording in 720p
resolution so you can make judgement
I'll try to show additional pictures as
well probably right now and the photo
quality and video quality and you can
make judgement on that
I think it's exceptionally well
especially of course in well-lit areas
it captures color tone captures colors
vibrantly focus when you zoom in and out
a little bit sometimes it takes a little
bit of time but on that the quality of
the video is good as ooming then it's
good but it could use a little bit of
fine-tuning on that beside the carl
zeiss lens the zoom factor most
importantly this is what the logitech
c920 is known for or lot of people will
purchase it a significant upgrade from
the previous model
it's the H dot 264 encoding it's the
newest or actually the current HD
encoding practice that you know blu-ray
players and use YouTube uses and it's
actually built into the webcam itself so
it's faster encoding it takes up less
system resources when you're recording
videos and a record than a mp4 format so
you can use a much less memory space as
well so that's a huge Pro with this
webcam and what differentiates it from
most of the webcams out there currently
on that um it does come with built-in
software I have Windows 7 as soon as I
plugged it in and installed right away
and it does come with a video capture
which is what you see here and also has
a feature where you can take a photo as
well it does come with a 15 megapixel
camera which is in my opinion huge and
you can actually take photos still
photos from this webcam it's compatible
basically with all the other Skype
software Yahoo Messenger all web
chatting software out there is
practically compatible with and is
mentioned right out of the box for you
uh lastly I purchased this webcam from
Amazon for $80 I do have a Prime
membership which I do pay $80 a year so
I did receive free shipping on this item
but again Amazon sells it for $80 if
you're not a Prime member of course you
have to pay shipping and handling on
that that's about it I'll probably show
let me show you a brief video of the
software that comes with the logitech
webcam like I said it is play play and
it will download automatically for you
alright guys I just want to show you my
desktop here this is my personal desktop
and I want to show you software from
Logitech like I said this is a
plug-and-play
product as soon as I plug it in and
downloaded the Logitech webcam software
automatically and I was up and running
time within three to five minutes so
it's very user friendly very quick I
just want to show you some of the
features in a software itself what I
used to record the video that you just
seen is click quick capture here and for
some reason it does take a little bit of
time slowed up in my opinion and I have
a I seven processor with 16 gives you a
pretty decent graphics card but and not
complain too much but it doesn't Java
yes but here's the actual layout and the
- video feed and you can see me moving
the spots around here you can change
your mics set the resolution like I said
I'm recording right out at 1080p or at
least I should be and let's see I said
earlier the zoom for at 1080p is only
one level and I'm just doing right here
at the maximum I can go which is kind of
awkward but it is what it is if I go to
720p and I'll switch it over and I fit
pride but maybe four levels or so and
with these buttons up here I can this is
a pan or zoom tilt up down left right or
so none zoom back let's go back to 1080p
it's a switch shortly yep some of the
advanced settings right as you can see
right sound right light it just
basically means it's auto sound and auto
light for you I left practically
everything on auto and default as well
and you can see my settings here that's
about it for this I don't want to record
your videos I mean there's saves they're
shown here you can get it your
containing folder or desktop where you
choose to save it as you can actually
take photos with this actually takes
photos at 15 megapixels which is pretty
high for webcam pretty impressed with
that motion videos that's something I
definitely want to show you let me close
out an application or let me go to make
menu there no sir and motion detection
it's really cool
works like a security camera you can say
and I'll show you right now how it works
and basically I mean you can you have to
have a PC out of course but whatever
there's obviously motion the camera will
start recording for you until there's no
motion at all and you can have I want
you can see my mouse here but the motion
sensitivity up on the upper right hand
corner I can change this so let me try
to move this box let's see you can see
the sensitivity moving up and down
you see that let's move his oh is it
intruders
trying to steal empty box so let me try
to turn a silent record and show you
what it does basically wouldn't turn out
of the mouth sets it motion sensitivity
a little bit lower and right now it's
active and ACC it's not recording but
let me just sneak in there you have a
court and a staffs reporting you can see
on the body left of the software there's
a five second recording on Spanish back
here I'm taking my beverage space but as
you can see it does record it the worst
phenomena I'm really impressed you can
see if I don't put this thank you I
don't know oh there has put it and
record the audio as well so very
impressed by that I also thought about
getting some security cameras and this
is probably cheap an effective way to do
it obviously only maybe I don't need
1080p but I can definitely hook this up
to my laptop's thinking outside the
window or so very impressed very pretty
enthusiastic about that piece um there's
a scheduler on here you can actually set
to when to schedule I will sue but
haven't tried that feature up yet but
other than that that's about it uh thank
you guys my camera here and uh finish
this video up alright guys I want to go
over my pros and cons have been using
this webcam for a while some of the pros
I just want to go over is the I like
video quality it looks exceptionally
well from a webcam that gives you that
HD quality as you can see here I'll be
watching this and 720p on YouTube the
mount itself likes it I'm very grateful
of this and that many webcams have that
but it does have a threaded tripod mount
great great great features well the
construction sturdiness can't go wrong
with that I feel like this probably will
last me for quite some time
another great feature about this webcam
is that it's so easy to use it's
actually it's literally just plug in
play as soon as you plug in my Windows
seven recognize the webcam and
basically install the drivers and
installed the Logitech software as well
the software is very intuitive and use
it to record my videos as you can see
here and also if you would like to take
still pictures from it the security or
motion detection feature is very cool to
use at least I have yet to set that up
but more than likely and put it with my
laptop and maybe set up the camera in
the corner of the room somewhere for
security purposes maybe just for the
office or so which is a pretty cool
feature than that the 6 foot long cable
like I said not many webcams I think
it's only one or two-letter much thick
webcams like I should come with a 6 foot
long cable but this definitely does help
with just pulling the camera from one
side of the room to the other alright
guys so that's it for my review in
general is this Logitech a Buy or try or
don't even buy it all I think it's
definitely worth a buy it's worth every
penny it's great so god then get it
again its 8000 Amazon plus shipping
handling if you're not a Prime member so
to conclude my video if you haven't done

three to one so guys if you haven't
