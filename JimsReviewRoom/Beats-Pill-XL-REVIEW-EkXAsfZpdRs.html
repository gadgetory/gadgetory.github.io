review room welcome to another review
today we'll be looking at the Appel
excel from beats by dre and beats have
been known for big sound and big bass
and we'll see if this one holds up to
its name on the pillow excel is priced
at 299 dollars which is comparable with
other big Bluetooth speakers on the
market we'll look into its construction
features and performance today so
without further adieu we'll get started
the pillow Excel is definitely
extra-large
measuring and 13.3 just wide 4 inches
high and 4 inches thick while weighing
in at 3.3 pounds giving the idea this
thing is loud and having a decent on a
bass and the front aluminium grille
doesn't flex at all when I put force on
it and the remaining plastic is all hard
plastic with no movement at all although
this might not fit in your bag as
comfortably dre was nice enough to
include a nice handle for portability
the rear of the unit features a
beautiful gloss black finish that is
prone to fingerprints and light
scratches I'd recommend using a soft
cloth or better yet a microfiber towel
for wiping around the handle itself
locates maggiore the buttons and
connections
starting with the far left you have your
charging port first next is new to be
for Bluetooth speakers is a
three-and-a-half millimeter input and
output port although this is a wireless
speaker you can physically connect your
device to play audio but you can also
daisy chain the speaker to any other
speaker with the audio out port and
that's a nice feature to have next is
also a new feature slowly appearing on
the latest Bluetooth speakers Dre
includes a USB charge out port for your
devices now if you're running low on
batteries let's say your smartphone
connect a USB wire and the pillock cell
charges that device from its own battery
and on a topic of battery power beats
claims 15 hours of battery life from a
full charge which is on the top tier
amongst these competitors and then going
to the right here of the handle features
a battery remaining indicator glowing
and LED white with volume buttons up and
down in the power button after that and
lastly is the NFC pairing location now
you can tap two pills together and
they'll both play the same song and if
you tap it twice and you'll get
basically left and right stereo channels
now if you have an NFC enabled phone you
can tap this area as well and it will
connect a speaker for you making it
easier than going through the
traditional method of going through your
settings now going to the front here and
writing up the remaining outstanding
features the pel XL has is the beats
logo which enter a certain amount of
taps does play pause and skips tracks
for you and lastly the pill Excel does
feature a speakerphone meaning you can
answer your phone call with this device
the unit does include a built-in
microphone where recipients on the other
end can hear me clearly through my tests
although they can tell that I was on a
speakerphone once I slept about five to
six feet away now the only downfall that
is see here physically when the unit
rest on its designated area the volume
controls are faced down I have to tilt
the device to adjust settings or to turn
on and off the
unit not a big deal but it's something
to point out though nonetheless this is
so far a very impressive feature filled
Bluetooth device but how is the sound
well what I'll do to the critique and
demo the unit I'll play several songs
and give you my verdict afterwards first
up is time flies rendition of Jamie
Foxx's alcohol cuz I got it like ya go
so smooth like I got it on tap yeah and
I'm a sick it'd be a good night while
I'm on my giggling while I'm drinking
Bud Light huh can you get it when you
miss me like I'm with whiskey drinking
Jim Beam me baby do you do it do it that
way do you do that did you take a break
you know that I'm a beast when I kill it
on the beach like it
and there you have it folks I hope you
enjoy the sample they're from these
great artists and all their information
is in the about description below now
getting back on topic here as I state in
all of my audio videos music heard in
person is much more clear in definition
but hence my review here the pill Excel
offers huge sound and the most bass I
have heard from any Bluetooth speaker
I've reviewed so far and if you're a
bass lover
there's no distortion when I had this on
maximum who really can't go wrong now
the low to mid range where most vocals
resides and music was very good but at
times depending on the song though was a
bit droned out from the bass or just
didn't hit the notes as accurate it's
very minut though and the only way I
could really tell was placing the Bose
Soundlink 3 next to this which has great
mid-range levels in my opinion as an
example the Bose Soundlink 3 had a bit
more detail in its music fidelity that
is just crisp details like a cymbal
hitting and then resonating but the pill
XL provided much more warmth and that
resonates in your body you can say
imagine a person with a deep voice or a
heart pounding dramatic scene from a
movie but in general music fans out
there you'll still no question enjoy the
speaker and then for the average
consumer you'll possibly prefer this
sound over the other speakers on the
market again it's just a matter of
preference
either more bass which a lot of people
like or just a smidge of better clarity
with again the sound like three either
or it's subjective but at the end of the
day with the premium features like
pairing other pills in and out ports
speakerphone NFC support excellent
battery life just to name a few
plus what I consider is a very good
sounding speaker as good as the
Soundlink 3 but in just a different way
the pel XL is possibly the best bang for
your buck for a premium bluetooth
speaker so I hope this review helped you
