room Samsung has jumped onboard with
truly wireless in your earphones and
what I mean Wireless
there's nothing dangling whatsoever this
might be the future of earphones as we
know it or at least an alternative to
the wired options but besides the audio
performance which I'll test later in
this video several of these truly
wireless earphones have had very short
battery life because they're so small
there's only so much that you can cram
it to each earphone something I'll
review later in this video
and last am some is claiming these to be
a fitness tracker as well and we'll see
how that works in a minute
I personally paid extra think at these
early before their official release date
off of Amazon for the price of two
hundred and seventy dollars yes it's
hurting my pockets but they do however
retail for 199 probably by the time you
see this video I put my links in the
description below click on my links and
they'll give you the most updated prices
in real time so without further adieu
Mon channels here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room
go over the physical features these are
hard plastic with three different sized
ear tips and ear wings jumping right
into comfort they're very lightweight
and they stayed in the ear very well
turn runs and weight lifting and
purposely attempting to shake the
earphones off I was not able to do so is
it inside the ear canal providing a good
amount of passive noise isolation to
block out your environment but there's a
feature called ambient sound which I'll
detail later in the video now where you
can control your music with the
following commands on your screen and
from my testing the touch sensitivity is
nearly spot-on with a capacitative touch
experiences some devices take several
taps or they have a hard time
distinguishing one action from the other
with the icon X it's very forgiving for
the most part here and very minimal user
error
the controls are simply great now
there's four gigs of storage of which I
checked only three-and-a-half gigs are
available to use allowing you to store
music right on the earphones and by
doing so you can leave your phone behind
which some would really enjoy and if you
would prefer the eye contacts can still
of course be paired via bluetooth that
regarding Bluetooth signal I was able to
get from one side of my house to about
3/4 of the way until I heard some very
minor crackling when I paired this with
my samsung s7 not the best but I would
still put this in the good category also
keep in mind these are Fitness focus so
getting caught in the rain or sweating
during your runs shouldn't be an issue
there's a hydrophobic nano coating
making these splash resistant and with
my testing gently spring water on these
here prove the icon X we're still
working after getting wet and last
before jumping into the discussion about
audio performance and the fitness
tracking aspect got a look at the
included case whenever you drop your
earphones in here for stowing or
carrying the case charges the earphones
the case is aluminum and has been sturdy
I don't foresee the case being crushed
or damaged but if you do accidentally
drop them on concrete they do scratch up
pretty easily regarding battery life I
barely found any information from
Samsung and with my testing here leaving
these on at 50% file that way we get a
medium a middle-of-the-road gauge with
Bluetooth connected to my phone the
entire time the icon acts is averaging
an hour and 30 minutes for me and even
with a run the heart rate sensor and
music
of course I'm getting around the same
amount as well and sadly this is quite
common with these truly wireless
earphones they only last for workouts
maybe the train ride into the city but
if you are using this well at your desk
or while working for general enjoyment
even they simply won't last long at all
that's one of the biggest downfalls
about these now moving on to audio
performance now this is where I gotta
say these do sound very very good a very
balanced pair with an audio signature
that is loud enough for most people in
regards to bass response it is not
overdone at all but it's definitely a
nice deep rich tone that doesn't come
over into the mid-range it's perfect for
pop EDM hip hop it's simply perfect in
my opinion the mid-range is very
distinct and clear that's not bright but
provides great resolution and detail up
to the upper mid-range levels of
instruments and voices like going into
the upper range the higher frequencies
it can be sharp at times and noticing
the snare drums there is some detail
lost and it gets slightly jumbled but
again that's on the very high end of the
frequency range and with the volume at
the upper limits now one of the things
that just absolutely shines that I
absolutely love that the soundstage in
audio separation is impeccable not a
hundred percent apples to apples
comparison but I'm just switching over
to my $250 RH 80 20s I prefer these
Samsung's over my heart rate J's it's
amazing two distinctly hear audio behind
you let's say the left side has ur drums
the right side has in vocals and basses
in the rear it is just simply amazing of
how in-depth and immersive the sound
signature and the icon X has now
regarding the health aspect here it's
very intuitive right before you start
here gently hold the right side of your
ear but down and you'll hear a prompt
that indicates you're starting the heart
rate sensor will come on the track your
heart rate and at certain times and
intervals which you can adjust you hear
a prompt indicating your duration and
distance even if you don't bring your
phone with you regarding HR readings
sadly after several runs and testing
this against my polar h7 and a
underarmour chest strap the results were
not accurate these were the two closest
charts that I could achieve and you can
see both times the icon X and E chest
strap works for about a quarter of the
mile in the beginning here and then over
time it just starts losing its
consistency or accuracy
with a chest strap now there's no
built-in GPS but the estimated distance
has been fairly accurate since I film
and run the same park in most of my
videos so I'm pretty familiar with the
distance not the only issue for some
reason my app and the earphones can only
prompt me in kilometers and not miles
and I'm pretty sure that's a very quick
and easy fix I don't think that should
be detrimental now another great option
in theory for runners and cyclists
there's this thing called ambient sound
where you can turn on the microphones
and the earphones and while running you
could hear your surroundings while
you're still listening to music now
while stationary it works great it
nearly sounds like my hearing has been
amplified and I can hear things off in
the distance actually pretty well no
worries about cars or maybe someone in
the bushes sneaking up on me it does
promote a safer environment but in a big
but while running or cycling man it
sadly picks up so much wind noise it
eventually becomes a non enjoyable
listening experience so just the
heads-up on that and one last thing
about the health aspect this does
natively sync with Samsung's as health
of course and Samsung has provided a
decent health app over the years and
with this information collected from
your run it's pretty good to get a gauge
on your performance over time but if you
don't use s health the data collected
can be synced with RunKeeper Strava and
map my run just to name a few popular
apps out there so in the end here the
icon X has amazing sound quality I love
it I love how they feel as well they
stay in the ear very securely and the
truly Wireless look it just looks bad as
its new it's the next thing in earphone
technology and to reiterate sadly most
of these truly wireless earphones their
better life isn't too great so it's
really for commuting or maybe working
out even with the heart rate sensor
being a li a bit off as well at the end
day I would say if you're ok with the
hour to hour and a half long battery
life that's great but if not even with
awesome audio performance Havanese died
during your weightlifting session would
absolutely totally suck now let me know
in the comment section below if you did
have the money would these be practical
for your lifestyle I'm really curious
