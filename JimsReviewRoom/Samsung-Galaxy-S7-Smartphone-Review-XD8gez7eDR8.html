when formula for Coke changed back in
the day people were outraged and less
than three months later coke
reintroduced coke classic essentially
what we know of today now this is not an
identical story but Samsung's radical
change from the s6 from the s5 caused
consumers to voice their opinion simply
people weren't happy
no Samsung listen to their customers and
brought back much of what was desired
with the new s7 but is it everything
that we want though not 100% but we'll
see how close now I personally pay for
the s7 you see here in this video coming
in titanium gold and I'll place several
links in the video description as prices
will of course fluctuate throughout the
year that way you can check for the most
up-to-date prices so without further ado
my channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
Jay's review
going over the physical features this
looks almost identical to the s6 but
with some subtle changes this thing
looks gorgeous in my opinion and I've
always been okay with plastic phones I
love my v10 from LG
but the titanium look under the glass
front and back panels just makes this
phone stand out now of course looks are
subjective so you can beat a judge on
that the s7 comes with a 5.1 inch screen
while it's bigger brother comes in at a
medium size of 5.5 if you guys have been
following me for a while you know I like
big phones and my daily driver has been
the Nexus 6p since it was released and
before that was a note for now jumping
to a quote small phone now I was
completely shocked here that it did it
in mind the smaller size at all
matter of fact using this phone felt
natural then jumping back onto my 6p or
v10 those felt huge not an issue I still
love big screens but I'm just explaining
the s7 did it feel small to me
personally regarding the other side of
the coin though the phone did slightly
increase in thickness to accommodate the
new battery and other features which
I'll go over but I've always experienced
anything within a 7 millimeter range is
just the right size for my hands there's
enough meat to hold the phone
confidently but it's not too thin yet it
doesn't feel bulky
now getting a bit technical the front
panel comes equipment gorilla glass for
making this up to two times more drop
resistant than other glass panel
competitors what we also have that's new
and are technically making a return but
improved from the s5 the s7 is ip68
certified making this phone
water-resistant up to 30 minutes in a
maximum depth of 5 feet of water now
during my testing and unfortunately the
pools haven't opened yet to throw those
5 feet down and left this in shallow
water for 30 minutes and pulling it out
later it worked perfectly fine now
moving on to a quick walk around and
going over the new features the tap has
your SIM tray but if the 32 gigs built
into the phone is it enough making a
return is the use of a micro SD card and
Samsung allows expanding your memory up
to a maximum of 200 gigs rotating to the
right is your power button to the very
bottom there's your 3 and 1/2 millimeter
port no USB type-c which is perfectly
fine forming since the world is still
predominantly using the current standard
you see on the s7 and to the right is a
little speaker that sounds like a tiny
and tinny speaker head full volume phone
calls sounds like most other smartphones
these days so there wasn't really
anything to start or speak about and
finally to the left are your volume
controls not before talking about the
front of the display though the rear
also make some subtle changes a glass
back makes a return which for the most
part has been very durable from everyday
use but it's not impervious to scratches
I 100% owned up to this while putting my
phone down my pocket my makeshift money
clip sled against the back and has
caused a slight scratch but again my
fault on that one there but indeed
tossing this into my car's cup holder
tossing this on my desk just everyday
use it's been very durable also in the
rear and for those who are not too
familiar with Samsung products the LED
flash is also a heartrate reader using
Samsung's as health and comparing to my
chest strap which has always been very
accurate these Samson provides very
accurate results themselves by getting
back to the rear the camera has slimmed
down pretty dramatically almost becoming
flush which at first just seems like an
aesthetic fix but beyond Lux physically
tapping and typing on the s7 on a table
it does feel like a reduction in the
phone rocking jumping into camera
performance I'll put up some photos here
on screen for your review keep in mind
all photos are unedited and I did my
best to align with photos here now at
first it sounds like Samsung took a step
backwards with their spec sheet I'm
speaking of the megapixel count being
reduced from 6
tene - now 12 for the average consumer a
high megapixel count doesn't really mean
much though it's more so about the
sensor and its performance
now with the lower megapixel concept and
not being too technical with less pixels
to jam into one space or answer the
sensor basically the larger each pixel
can be in turn each pixel can capture
more light in the end this means better
low-light performance so first looking
at some outdoor photos not a direct
comparison but just having these phones
laying around these sampson provided the
richest and most contrasting photos
looking at this first photo these s7s
photo is sharp and just has this image
pop out at you before any editing is
performed the v10 from LG provided a
slightly more washed out look and the
Nexus 6p felt right in the middle with
providing some contrast but not as
applied as a Samsung now moving on to
the next photo I notice Samsung
sometimes has a little issue with blow
out essentially any area where it's
bright and dark at the same time the s7
tries to brighten the entire photo and
at times the brighter parts are just on
the edge of being blown out however
looking at the Nexus again it's a bit
dull although it's not over bright and
last if you look at LG similar results
but if you're nitpicky Samsung again
comes in with slightly more contrast
which makes the image just pop more than
the v10 but also find the Samsung is the
sharper image once again and just for
the hell of it also carried my samsung
note 5 thank you for minding note 5 has
a higher megapixel count but both
performed nearly identical with each
other now moving on to the next photo
the 6p proved or provided again this
dark image and it's just not as sharp
and looking at the s7 the Samsung auto
white balance went with a warmer tone
making the cement and the stone in the
wall that you see on the right here just
pop and then looking at the v10 the
sharpness in detail is about the same
but the white balance appears to be less
appealing in my opinion a lot of last
test years with low-light performance
starting with a photo indoors you can
see the s7 still reveals noise in low
light but pay close attention to the
details in the dark and the colors the
v10 and you'll see this pattern with the
next several photos LG overcompensates
and causes this white or slightly washed
out look there's more detail visible but
the entire image isn't as vibrant at
again with the Nexus on all the
low-light photos you'll see the Nexus
seems to keep the most accurate photos
without popping up brightness
but then there's errors where it's just
too dark looking at several other photos
real quick here you can see it's the
same in every scenario that I put these
cameras through now with the Samsung
cameras providing exceptional quality
another new feature here with the s7
lineup is what they call dual pixel
autofocus now a Samsung is claiming much
faster autofocus and performing a
similar test of what Samsung performed
at their press conference it is such a
dramatic difference than any other
camera that I've tested before you can
see how much faster the s7 is compared
to what's currently out there now the
last feature which I'm shocked Samsung
doesn't promote more is the pro mode
essentially it's manual mode just like
the LG G series of phones for the pro
photographer in you or if you want that
perfect shot in dark areas and auto mode
can't figure it out for you you can
manually control shutter speed ISO
levels I can control white balance and
manually focus on your subject now you
also get this the inner feature of
panorama selective focus and there's a
food mode that focuses on the center but
then everything around your plate or
dish here is blurred out in the last
feature I want to show real quick is the
virtual shop allowing you to spin around
an object and once done you can tilt
your phone set aside to get a nice walk
around pretty cool but once you share it
with somebody it's only a video file
your friend can't tilt the phone like
you can to control the camera angle and
the last bit here is the camera image
stabilization works really well in
keeping your shots from being shaky and
the options of 4k or quad HD is indeed
nice I noticed again LG does provide
slightly smoother image stabilization
over the Samsung however is Samsung dual
pixel technology the Samsung focuses
that much faster
alright enough about cameras let's start
looking at the display screen comes with
a flagship standard 2560 by 1440
resolution the same Super AMOLED display
makes a return offering that rich and
vibrant look though not every panel is
the same but to show you what my phones
look like with my color test the Samsung
Note 5 produced the best and widest
screen with the SN producing just a
slightly warmer tone for some reason and
the LG here produced that cooler tone
was subtle hints of blue and the Nexus
6p offered the warmest out of the 4 now
looking at blacks the Nexus in both
Samsung's produced the deepest blacks
available with the v10 offering a dark
yet glowing screen now what you want to
look for are the deepest blacks
available to help contrast other colors
being displayed and you have the display
look less artificial in a sense so
there's no obvious backlighting and
there's no screen bleeding now the same
results with blues all looked rich and
more vibrant than the LG v10 with greens
the s7 and no.5 looked the best with the
Nexus coming in slightly dimmer but
still a nice contrasting shade though
and the LG would be worse I believe with
a more faded green and last to finish
the RGB colors reds on samsung has
always looked more orange to me and the
LG gave a nice shade though for a change
that looked more accurate from my
assessment now what is also important
and worth taking into consideration is
Samsung's performed great in direct
sunlight and was for the most part
visible the Nexus did struggle the worst
here and trying to see the screen when
compared to the s7 either way both
Samsung phones provided some of the best
viewing experiences to date compared to
many other phones on the market now
moving on to performance I'll throw up
some specs on the screen here the most
notable is the latest processor from
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 making a debut
claiming a 40% increase in performance
over the last year's 810 and about a 30%
increase in being energy efficient
sounds great but in the real world
really is that a significant improvement
that the average consumer can actually
see or especially feel now regarding
gaming this is where you'll see the
biggest improvement over last year's
model games load that much faster
consistently time and time again across
most gaming applications now while
playing them is not much of a difference
most games already run well with last
year's phones and this year is really no
exception
there's no frames being skipped and
there's really no lagging experience
for everyday applications twitter
facebook instagram loading netflix music
files etc they felt very similar to my
older phones and really didn't exhibit a
substantial difference in speed to make
it big impact or even really notice now
as we're using the phone in general
samsung's touchwiz overlay of course
makes it return here and it isn't much
different from last year I do admit last
year's was much better than the year
before
so it could be if it's not broken don't
fix it right but I gotta say there's
still room for optimization overall for
the average consumer it's still a great
experience don't get me wrong especially
if you decide to use the abundant amount
of features Samsung usually offers but
there are times though when opening up
apps or switching from the camera to an
app there's a minor stutter evident not
every time but when it does happen
though you'd take a slight pause and
subconsciously
find it unusual not for the most part it
won't be an issue at all but if you're
coming from let's say these six P or the
LG G series of phones because that's
what I experience you'll find that those
two phones at least would be
consistently zippy over time containing
the last round of important features the
fingerprint scanner makes a return and
works very well once you register your
fingers the only thing I didn't find a
way to unlock the screen from the new
always-on display so I had to press the
home or power button first before using
the fingerprint scanner now there's
something that I'm missing here please
let me know in the comment section below
but regarding the new always-on display
I loved it
you have several options to display
either just a clock or one with the time
and the calendar here and it is always
on and I'm shocked it doesn't appear to
turn off when you place the phone in
your pocket
now it doesn't seem to use the proximity
sensor to turn off the display when the
phone is stowed away but Samsung claims
it takes very minimal battery life away
now for my test overnight leaving it on
I drained about 12% of battery over six
and a half hours of sleep which is worse
than my LG v10 which only got a 5%
reduction of power overnight regarding
battery life Samsung has included a
bigger battery bumping it up to a 3000
milliamp battery from 2500 on the s6 my
screen on time has been averaging around
3 hours and 15 minutes with my worst
performance around 3 hours and best
under normal use that is about 3 hours
and 30 minutes so overall I'm needing to
recharge the phone every day and a half
quick charger remains the same and takes
an hour and a half to get back up to
full from a dead bed
from my test here my video proves that
and Samsung does keep the wireless
charging intact but to wrap up this
review the SM has dramatically improved
the physical side of things and the
camera performance is still one of the
best that's clear the software side has
been taming improvements but the new
features like always on the
waterproofing ashlee card really makes
up for some of the biggest gripes of
last year's model I do admit having a
removable bedroom would have been nice
but the styling on this is really a
head-turner to lose my only hope though
if the phone ever needs to be opened up
hopefully the internal waterproofing
won't be affected now I would have loved
the IR blaster to make a return but
again in my personal opinion everything
else almost makes up for its
shortcomings to make this one the best
phones on the market currently hopefully
next year
TouchWiz will once again be refined and
you never know maybe USB type-c will be
more mainstream and then will be
featured on more phones for the time
being and as I said earlier or in the
beginning of this video it's not 100%
but the overall experience for the
average consumer the peace of mind of
waterproofing the elimination of
worrying about storage space and of
course you'd get one good-looking phone
I think Samsung did very well by
offering just a overall well rounded
package so that's it for this review be
