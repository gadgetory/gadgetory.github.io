pairs of their sonic pro earbuds the ckr
9s and the ck are tens with a ladder
offering high resolution audio
performance nonetheless the CK r9s that
I have here are still considered high
performance and high-end earbuds in
addition audio technica is claiming that
these are the world's first dual phase
push-pull drivers found in in-ear
monitors now in simplistic terms here
two drivers in each ear but faces each
other
firing an opposite polarity in turn
minimizing overall sound distortion yet
increasing sound accuracy now I know my
channel is catered towards the average
consumer but I wanted to hear what
possibly is great ear buds so that way I
can compare them as I'll be reviewing
more ear buds down the road so these I
sadly pay the two hundred and $69 MSRP
pricier but Amazon and I believe many
other places now have them for one
hundred and seventy so click on the link
below in the video description for
updated pricing so without further adieu
I'm here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to jim's
review
passes you by
starting with its build first these are
crafted using aluminum while the CK art
ends uses titanium but it's still a nice
smooth finish here and still a pleasure
to look at when worn now the rest is all
plastic which has been very durable and
even down to the extra long wire guards
exemplifies a long lasting quality belt
now these are not tangle free or lay
flat cords which is understandable for
these type of earbuds nonetheless
tossing these into my bag they don't
tangle much if anything it's only
isolated at the split of the cables but
to help with tangles and provide
protection Audio Technica does provide a
small carrying case with no additional
pockets to hold in the three other ear
tips now the wire itself does extend
these standard 1.2 meters or almost 4
feet long here so having your phone or
source of music shouldn't be an issue
but moving on to the comfort here these
ear tips are those that fit snug but
gently into your ear canal causing a
seal and passive noise isolation it does
quite well in blocking outside noises
when combined with music playing and I
gotta say these ear tips are one of the
best that I have tested beating my
experiences with other in-ear monitors
granted they're mostly sport earbuds no
discomfort or pain when wearing these
for extended periods of time now they're
light enough for me as well for casual
wearing around the house and also
walking about in the city with more
vigorous activities like running they
surprisingly stay in for the most part
and once in a while I just had to push
them into it basically get them read up
now some with more experience with other
higher-end earbuds may say it's slightly
on the heavier side and big but for me
personally these are fine a comfort and
staying in the ear wouldn't seem to be
an issue for most people now the only
group that I had with these when wearing
this cord on the outside of your shirts
you can hear a good amount of the cord
rustling around and bumping into your
chest now more so than other earbuds
that I've tested in general now it does
help a good bit though if you have the
wire under your shirt or behind your
jacket so just a heads up on that but
for the moment that you've been waiting
for how do these earbuds sound now
surprisingly these earbuds had to be
broken in a bit at first I noticed the
highs were a bit sharp and harsh but
testing these up to day four and
thereafter I noticed it was gone and the
tones are much more imbalanced
now the dynamics and the wide open
soundstage is simply amazing
listening to lossless FLAC audio of
September from Earth Wind
fire I can hear such subtle details of
its instruments left and right audio
separation but just a sense of that open
soundstage and again it's just simply
amazing but the bass and these are
pretty darn good as well when called
upon for songs of Nicki Minaj and Drake
it hits deep enough to be enjoyable not
as deep as the recent beats products
I've tried but it's still full and
rounded but when genres who are not as
bass focused going back to classics like
the Beatles Rolling Stones etc it's as
though the earbuds adjust for those John
Rose and the songs presented sounds
natural
now as for vocals in the mid-range these
just have the right amount of being
bright for the mid-range offering crisp
voices and clarity for instruments you
can hear such subtle details from this
like the guitar flicks to the singers
taking breaths
especially with classic music back in
the day now as for the highs every bit
is retained and not distorted and I
listened to snare drums and cymbal
crashes with the helis a old-school
greatest hits Mariah Carey here hitting
those high notes that she used to do it
was just impeccable and overall
listening to these earbuds and never had
listening fatigue majority of these
earbuds I listen to are usually at about
70% volume to hear all the details and
nuances and with these CK r9s here
leaving these at just 50% and once in a
while bumping it up to 60% volume was
plenty loud for me and detailed enough
for me to hear even these nuances now
listening to free streaming services
like Pandora and Slacker Radio are good
but to really appreciate and hear the
difference consider looking into higher
quality or purchasable music where they
do play at a higher bitrate that's where
these earbuds really shine so overall I
would say if you can get these for $200
or less because of its audio quality
alone I am sure these will be considered
a deal for you so hope this review
helped you in some way be sure to become
a fan by adding me Jim's review room to
either Facebook Twitter or Instagram for
more reviews and behind-the-scenes
postings again I'm Jimmy with Jim's

see you the next one
