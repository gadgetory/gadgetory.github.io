sometimes my smartphone camera can only
do so much in the end I want
better-looking photos now canon and
nikon are the two that really comes to
mind for those who are not familiar with
DSLRs in general but today here I have
canons latest model through their
consumer grade camera lineup it's the
Canon t6 I now - retails for $900 with
the 18 to 55 millimeter kit lens but I
personally bought this for eight hundred
and fifty dollars at the time of this
video now keep in mind this review is
geared towards the average consumer so
I'll attempt to not make this too thank
you for you guys and as always visit my
website for reviews on other cameras and
more consumer products I'm Jimmy with
jims review room comm and I'm here to
help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
before going into the photo samples
we'll take a quick walk around and go
over its features as well
now the t6i remains small and compact
with its durable polycarbonate plastics
subtle grips are provided throughout the
camera here but one area that I wish the
head texture was on the card door itself
where your palm plants against the
camera it's not too bad since Canon does
provide a decent deep grip here for
holding alleviating any slippage the
overall quality feels great though the
camera itself weighs just a little over
a pound at 18 ounces now with the
battery and kit lens attached my scale
comes in at 1 pound in about 10 ounces
now the tap buttons and dials provide
very much good feedback with a nice firm
press but the rear here it's a bit
softer and more flush against the body
when compared to the aforementioned
buttons but the actions are still
executed perfectly fine now a hot shoe
makes a return for connecting
accessories like a speedlight or an
external microphone which I have here
and moving to the left side of the
camera are ports for that microphone and
a remote control a mini HDMI is also
provided for connecting this to a
monitor or TV and last is a port labeled
AV out which I use to connect my camera
directly to my computer for file
transfers now it's unfortunately not a
microUSB port but it's a mini USB port
so the more common cables you use to
charge your phones tablets and other
devices won't work here the cables are
indeed affordable now but keep in mind
it uses a different USB connection but
going to the rear here
like most consumer grade DSLRs there's a
swivel touchscreen perfect for those who
intend on blogging yet perfect for those
timed grouped photos to ensure
everyone's in the picture the screen
itself is a 3 inch TFT LCD screen that's
not plastic feeling but a smooth and
solid piece of glass now and some
consumer grade cameras there it does
feel more plastic II I guess you can say
and it just feels cheap but the LCD here
is simply amazing it's not an OLED
screen but the colors still pop and the
richness and contrast looks very
accurate and honestly it's a pleasure to
look at now the very last set of
features are now more common on consumer
grade cameras NFC abbreviated for
near-field communication and why
if I are now available now you can just
tap your phone here on the bottom of the
camera and your t6 I will automatically
connect to it with the Canon Connect app
you can use your phone as a remote
monitor and then tap your phone to take
a photo it's highly convenient now it
unfortunately doesn't work in video mode
though and when testing other cameras
here the t6 I here performs very similar
it's not 100% smooth flowing but if you
are taking still photos it's still very
useful now in the app you can change
settings and possibly the best feature
for me here you can wirelessly download
photos from the camera to your
smartphone for posting onto social media
now the professional level canons and
Nikon's don't even offer that feature
built-in but overall when using the
camera it's easy to learn where all the
settings are and the layout is pretty
simple now this is not a how-to video
but turning on the camera here all of
your settings are displayed and if you
don't like using the buttons press the Q
button and your LCD becomes your
interactive menu for adjusting your
settings white balance ISO levels
exposure photo profiles you name it now
if you need to go into Live View press
the icon here and when in photo mode
like before all your on-screen menus are
now selectable for adjusting now one
step further here tap anywhere and your
screen you want the camera to focus on
basically it's alleviating going through
the viewfinder and pressing the
directional buttons on the back of the
camera
and for those moments or objects here
that are moving too quickly or if you
are a blogger here if you want the
camera to follow your face basically
either in video or photo mode when you
do tap on the subject your camera starts
tracking it now I'll talk more about the
autofocus system shortly but overall
it's been zippy and fast as well since
Canon has upgraded to the digit 6
processor helping with the cameras speed
and also helping with the the new sensor
that's onboard now the t6i features the
most megapixel of any crap sensor can
camera coming in at 24 point 2
megapixels in total no not to mention
there's an increase in autofocus
performance as well the t5 I came with 9
autofocus points versus the t6 I now
coming in with 19 and all 19 are cross--
focusing type as well now what this all
really means is the more area of
crossing points you have the
faster you'll be four focusing images
and with more precision as well
especially for those again moving
objects and people now a prime example
of how this could be tricky though the
nikon d50 500 a direct competitor that
is to the t6i has an impressive 39 focus
points but all those 39 only 11 or
actual cross-type the more cross-type
the more effective your autofocus system
is but for now it's getting really
technical here and let's get back to the
basics now on screen I'm going to show
you some photos samples here that I've
taken myself and keep in mind all these
photos that I've taken will be unedited
and right from the t6i unless I
otherwise noted that later in this video
but overall this is such a fantastic
camera for those who are not tech or
camera savvy right out the box this
camera provides just colorful and sharp
photos without any adjustments now these
following photos here are all in auto
mode actually out here at the local
whitewater rafting center for the Sun
coming down just looks really good the
colors of the people's shirts the warmth
of the Sun is being portrayed here and
the highlights in the clouds are not
overblown now moving to the next photo
regarding collars the Canon does very
well with making colors pop yet still
keeping all the colors still balanced
and not oversaturated and not overdone
and since I'm at the white water rafting
center I'm able to use the burst shot
mode here perfect for catching those
very fast-moving moments and after these
photos here I'm going to show you what
it really looks like in real time
and now moving on to the next photo one
image style that cameras usually have a
hard time with our bright backgrounds
and your subject is in the foreground
usually it creates a black silhouette
and with 86 I in just auto mode in no
manual settings here look at this
gorgeous image and I'm thoroughly
impressed by the consumer grade camera
that it's practically ready to use right
out the box here now moving on to macro
shots or very zoomed in close-up shots
did very well I believe details and
clarity are there with these flowers but
as important the color reproduction is
still vibrant no need to edit these
photos when you get home
and here is my last but very important
test is the low-light performance now
using this in auto mode which all the
previous photos were taken in the
low-light performance still does well
there are some spots where there is
light the objects there are blown up a
bit but you can be the judge for
yourself if this looks acceptable to you
or not now regardless I'm still
impressed though that there's not much
more noise from high ISO levels in the
dark areas of the photo though but
eventually I did switch over to manual
mode for the nighttime shots just to
achieve the best photos that I can get
and here's me backstage and again look
at the lack of noise I think it's simply
amazing and all this is handheld
actually without a tripod either now one
of the last low-light tests that I
perform was in this parking deck here
bringing ISO levels up to maximum of
12,800 now of course it does introduce
some noise here and that's such a clear
image but for a camera under $1,000 for
a camera considered as a consumer camera
and not semi-professional again I am
very impressed
now last year for those who are playing
and doing videography or blogging in
general this can't record up to 1080p
and Canon does advertised up to 60
frames per second however the smooth 60
frames per second is only reserved for
the 720p resolution the competition the
Nikon d50 500 does offer full 1080 with
60fps there but again I like the auto
focus very much on the t6i it's smooth
and it's virtually silent when compared
to mine icons that I've been using the
only thing that I see missing though
really for videographers is audio
monitoring you can't tell if this
microphone is either too loud or too low
there's really no headphone port but
other than that I
highly highly recommend this camera for
the average consumer or those really who
wants a darn good at DSLR for $1,000 or
less again all those photos are unedited
and the day time shots were all set to
automatic nothing special that I
personally am high-end here there's more
photos at Jim's review room calm and a
link will be in the description below
here visit the website to see additional
details about the specific camera again
