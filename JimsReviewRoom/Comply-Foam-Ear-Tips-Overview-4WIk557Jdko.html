review room a few months ago I had
uploaded a review and the jaybird
Bluebird ex
a phenomenal sounding set of your buds
but one issue that many viewers had
mentioned including myself was they lose
sound isolation or worst case scenario
that your buds would fall out while
running now viewers of my channel and
reading up on amazon.com user reviews
many suggest them using new ear tips
from comply foam comm so I went ahead
and obtain their entire lineup and in
this video today I'll go over each one
and tell you how they fit and how they
differentiate in feeling to help you
make a possible purchase decision now
keep in mind this is not limited to just
the blue boxes the foam tip series do
span across many earbud brands and
manufacturers on the market and you just
have to find the right model that fits
your specific earbuds on comply foams
website so without further ado we'll get
started
these tips are basically memory-foam you
press them into a thinner size and then
place them inside your ear canal holding
them there for about 15 to 30 seconds
per the instructions and over time the
foam expands and should cause a seal
offering sound isolation and better
fitment and this video is more of a
overview as in my previous reviews of
earbuds I have confirmed and tested
these and they do work in perform very
well starting with the isolation tips
these to me have been the most
comfortable of the three ear tips to
wear it's very plush very soft and very
smooth it's also the smallest of the ear
tips so this for sure fitted inside my
ear canal the best it's also providing
the best sound isolation and the best
seal for the best sound performance now
these do reestablish its shape the
fastest and I found putting one side in
at a time works best now from walking to
running to weight lifting these have
stayed in the entire time but speaking
of working out the next set are the
active ear tips these are the most ideal
for those physically moving and sweating
and when compared to the other foam
compositions these are the most rugged
feeling offering a slightly slower time
in reestablishing its shape but it does
feel like this is the most durable and
consulting with a comply foam wrap they
did state that these will last the
longest and unlike other foam tip makers
on the market comply foam tips do not
expand to sweat or water exposure
something I wouldn't have known to look
out for until they mentioned this well
the rep also stated after an excessive
workout using water to rinse the sweat
and salt contents will extend the life
of these ear tips with up to three to
five months of optimum use overall these
are the second most comfortable pair
I've tried out of the three but
considering I do workout hour and sweat
obviously these seem to be the most
ideal for me the third and last set here
are the comfort series with a more
rounded shape ear tip these were right
in the middle of being the softest on
also being the most firm they're also
the largest as well and considering I
tried all three sizes that comes in the
package I unfortunately was not able to
have his ear tips go into my ear but
instead they set on the outside of the
ear canal now of course everyone's ears
are different in size and shape and
these might work out for you but keep in
mind if you have
ear canals like mine the comfort might
not fit and both the comfort and
isolation offers the comfort and
isolation cloth series and from my
experience they're the same exact foam
feel and function but there's a small
thin screen to prevent ear wax from
entering into the earphones and I will
assume this is for those who do produce
a little bit more ear wax than others
but again it was the same exact
performance that I could tell with no
change in sound quality so that's
basically it it's a very simple product
a very simple concept but it does help
in keeping those earbuds in your ears
and thanks to those who did recommend
the comply foam tips to me on my
previous reviews as now I can personally
keep my blueblood X's and hope this
video helped you as well in some way if
