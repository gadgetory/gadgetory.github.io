her I finally picked up the Amazon tap
to give it a shot here and I also bought
the Amazon echo and that video should be
coming up pretty soon but with the tap
it's a portable bluetooth speaker with
Alexa capabilities helping you at home
or wherever you have Wi-Fi that is
enhancer in questions signing up lists
purchasing items and the list goes on
but more detail on that in the review
shortly
I personally paid $99 for the tap but
this does retail for a hundred and
twenty nine dollars at the time of this
video I'll place my links in the
description below click on my links to
check for updated prices as they could
fluctuate from time to time you can
purchase this direct from Amazon if you
choose to do so so without further adieu
welcome everyone to Jim's review room
going over the physical features looks
are of course subjective but I'm really
loving the style here it's subtle modern
and just enough originality as we're
functionality although you do have the
braided fabric like the UE boom and
other rugged Bluetooth speakers on the
markets unfortunately it's not
waterproof but overall though this feels
like a quality product the speaker only
stands up for sound and up top you have
your vibe controls and to skip songs
pause and play as you choose to do so
pressing volume up and down at the same
time will give you tapped battery life
the battery is that about 50% moving
down there is the Alexa button and this
has to be the only area where I felt was
somewhat lacking the bun wasn't as
tactile and was a bit squishy making the
experience not as solid as I was hoping
for compared to the rest of the speaker
which is top-notch nonetheless the
button still works though the ads for
audio outputs this does offer 360
resound and the tap does well here in
even audio distribution but more my
sound test shortly rotating to the rear
powers on top a 3.5 millimeter input is
available for physical connections a
microUSB port for charging your speaker
and last is the Bluetooth / Wi-Fi
pairing button now with the tap you can
charge the speaker with that USB port
however the tap does come with a
charging base enabling you to pick up
your speaker in a much more streamlined
and intuitive method purses need to plug
it in or pull out the cable each time
now on the bottom of the speaker the
charging contact allows your speaker to
charge in any direction when on that
charging base regarding battery life
Amazon claims up to nine hours of life
which is on par with other small
bluetooth speakers that I've reviewed so
far from my test that 50% volume and
having me to play all day the tap died
in 10 hours and 23 minutes now into the
moment that you've been waiting for hear
the audio test I'll play several samples
and then I'll give you my verdict
afterwards
and there you have it folks the Amazon
tap does get pretty loud here for a
small speaker in small areas is not as
loud as the JBL flip 3 but for sure
louder than the ue roll - and several
other small bluetooth speakers on the
market the bass is okay and it's not
underwhelming like the ue roll - which
is a good sign but it's not close to
being a bass e speaker just enough for
casual listening now regarding the mid
this works great for podcast and speech
in general like Talk Radio NPR and the
likes here speech is very clear and it's
very distinct as for music though at
moderate vibes the mid-level frequencies
does absolutely fine for again casual
listening it sounds good but it did
notice when I turned this up to much
higher volumes - a jam out here that
mids to highs and then becomes distorted
and a little bit jumbled now you do lose
that sense of clarity and cleanness you
can say in the audio which is somewhat
of a downer now like all small bluetooth
speakers a spatial sound doesn't exist
here and although this claims to have a
stereo sound left and right audio
channels are not to present either again
very similar to other small Bluetooth
speakers so I'm not knocking on the tap
for that Generale's I see fitting is
popping EDM depending on how much bass
you normally enjoy hip-hop could work
but if bass is a must
you've got to look elsewhere now music
with more instrumental emphasis this is
where it loses some detail though the
speaker isn't as articulate at those
higher volumes and when listening to
string instruments reach their max
that's when you really do notice it then
overall it's a good casual listening
audio experience at medium volume but if
you're intending to put this mostly loud
while getting ready in the morning or
audio quality is a top priority here
maybe the JBL flip 3 and foogoo speakers
would be a better alternative but in the
end here we can't forget why you would
purchase the speaker Amazon's own voice
assistant is built-in and it works great
I'll have any more in-depth review of
Alexa in the Amazon echo video which
should be coming up soon so look that up
on my channel now with the Amazon tap
unfortunate you don't get the voice
commands like you deal with the echo you
do have to physically walk up to the
speaker and press that talk line to
bring up Alexa a tap someone makes up
for this with being very much portable
and the allure or reason why
we choose this over the echo you can
have these same intelligence and
assistance from Alexa just like the echo
again put in various parts of your home
just pick up the tap and have it in your
garage have it in your bedroom bring it
into the kitchen etc but in my humble
opinion providing the consumer the
option of using voice recognition would
have made the tap amazing as after using
the echo or for those who have used Siri
on their Apple products or okay Google
and their Android devices the voice
recognition and being totally hands-free
helps tremendously and because it lacks
it uses Wi-Fi to stream music and pull
up content you do have to make sure that
your phone is a hotspot or connect to
Wi-Fi networks when you are not at home
in the absence of Wi-Fi you can still
use the Amazon tap via Bluetooth and
stream content that way but it would
only be locally to store music and
content that is played off of your
physical device now once we're outdoors
and away from Wi-Fi let's assume that
you don't have Wi-Fi at all the Amazon
tap essentially becomes a dedicated
Bluetooth speaker rather than an
assistant so although it's portable the
lack of voice recognition for times when
your hands are not free or you're on the
other side of the room here does pose a
slight nuisance but if you can overcome
those hurdles and Alexa at least for now
is the best virtual assistant that you
can have and yes it could answer most
questions as other platforms but because
it's connected with the Amazon ecosystem
and Alexa has her own third-party apps
from companies like ESPN and PR ABC etc
Alexa can also read audio books make
shopping lists and order items from
Amazon for your convenience as your
Amazon account should be linked up now
she's not perfect I'll meet Beth but she
seems to be the most robust and
information-gathering at the moment
so overall the tap is a good device for
casual everyday use the audio experience
is good again for casual listening Alexa
works very well yet at the same time
some minor adjustments though could have
made a good speaker into a great speaker
in my opinion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
