video it's probably the first time you
guys ever seen me vlogging and I'll be
honest and vlogging stuff is crap really
don't know what to say I don't know what
the hell is say but um but yeah I just
want to give you guys an update right
now I am running to the bank here paying
some bills it is the end of the month
here is the 31st of July I'm probably
post this video up later pride the first
week of August somewhere somehow but um
but yeah paying some bills and actually
brought my bike with me all of you guys
can see that they're my trek bike fits
right into the trunk of a camry
surprisingly sorry for this lighting
here it's a little bad but um guys want
to give you guys an update and also make
this a thank you video 70,000 freaking
subscribers isn't that crazy um I guess
you can say the hundred thousand scriber
I mean I didn't think that would hit it
anytime soon when I first started this
so you can say at 70,000 you can kind of
see the the light so I am thrilled I'm a
static holy cow so thank you everyone
for making it this far I know some of
you guys have been with me since 10,000
subscribers 20,000 50,000 but me it is
just a blessing and to answer the
question I know a lot of people ask me
this you know i do do this full-time day
in day out and I do treat it like a
business so I put it tons of hours into
it but just like here and see the
comments I say it in every darn video
that I do when I see the comments that
you guys do like my work you know it it
just makes me happy it's helping people
it's really helping people make purchase
decisions I know some peoples have said
that they because of my videos they have
purchased several products of you guys
hope I'm not being you guys broke I mean
I'm broke as now to be honest with
you but um but thank you for everything
seriously that's by my heart and that's
the first and foremost i had me the same
as videos thank you today second most
important thing i guess you can say it
is a giveaway I didn't miss the 60,000
scrubber video so there's two products
I'm going to include in this video you
have to pick one or the
other so you have to let me know in the
comments below but basically you have to
follow me on either one of my social
media channels Facebook Twitter
Instagram or Google+ or follow me on all
four to be honest with you and in the
description below tell me which item you
want it's either the skullcandy grind
which is what I'm giving away or the
Yamaha eph em to hundreds earphones so
it's either a headphone or an earphone
pick one or the other and individual
description again let me know what your
user name is so that way I can message
you on social media and then eventually
get your address and if you could I
always asked as an emerald what I want
to ask this in every one of my videos
where are you guys from it's always so
cool to see people from all over the
world I always boggles my mind how
connected we are today so that'd be
pretty cool all the things that are
going on and trying to make this video
as quick as possible i am waiting at the
ax at the bank here i don't know if you
guys saw that next in line but the
channel is it's it's grown like crazy
the views are are hitting record highs
again I mean it is just a consistent
trend that is almost unbelievable i
didn't know youtube with this was this
popular or this powerful forget popular
just powerful and just getting
communication across across the people
but um i got the website up this is not
the official announcement yet since i'm
still working on it it is up right now
you guys can go see if you want Jim's
review room calm I do promote it I'm my
more recent reviews the only reason I'm
doing that is because christmas is you
know god what five months away or so and
you know that's when a lot of people
start watching and viewing and that's
when people would like you know to have
questions answered is a product good or
not so hopefully Jim's review room calm
will be another source for people to go
to as i try to promise my last video i
am trying to finish up the website so
that way can start reviewing bearings
and primer you know clothing and 1 i'm
actually testing out surprisingly
lululemon so to see how they go
and I know they're there make some
expensive ass crap but i just want to
see the price is justified or not this
prime my third or fourth time war in it
and I'm actually like I said I'm wearing
it out biking see how it does with me
sweating and whatnot and just comfort in
general and and that's about it man
plugging his harness how I don't know
what the hell to talk about and that's
just being honest with you guys and
sorry for talking so fast he said I it
looks like the finishing up here but on
that like I said the giveaway either one
of those two products pick one and again
your username on your social media and
which social media that you chose so
that way can contact you and again which
country or state where you're from babby
greats shout out to the people in
California I was just out there july 4th
week and and the weather was great and
there's like zero humidity I know you
guys getting like hundred-degree weather
right now but I'm still contemplating
and if I should move not anytime soon
you know I got the baby and whatnot and
my fiancee needs to go back to school
and she needs to get her God freakin the
pharmacy degree am that's going to take
a good bit so not anytime soon but
considering how expensive California's I
don't want to rent out there you know I
always want always want to pay off a
house by the time to retire and then not
have to worry about a mortgage that's
just one of my life goals and
considering that right now live down
south and it's like you know cheap real
estate I used to live up in New York
shout out to people up in Brooklyn and I
don't know California it's what 312,000
320 thousands of square foot so if you
can imagine a 2000 square-foot home
multiply that by three hundred and
twenty or so I'm i don't know i just
want to have just enough space you know
for for an office to do youtube and in
other you know ventures and i don't know
just have enough space for the family in
general so we'll see I mean that's just
a dream whatever are I think he's
finishing up here but anyways shout out
