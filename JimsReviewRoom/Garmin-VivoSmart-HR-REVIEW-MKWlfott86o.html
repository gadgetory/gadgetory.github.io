room Garmin has clearly stepped up their
game and is now offering an answer to
the Fitbit charge HR this time
completely redoing their vivosmart band
and now offering heart rate tracking
right on the wrist with a total revamp
of a garment app to supplement the
experience now I personally paid $149
retail for this band here and at this
price point this makes the band
attractive to casual to some mainstream
Fitness folks and those interested in
possibly getting an activity band for
the first time I'll put a link in the
video description below that gives you
the most current and updated pricing as
of today so without further adieu I'm
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to jim's
review room
going over the physical features first
there's two sizes available regular and
extra-large for your reference in this
video here I am wearing the regular size
but because of this watch like locking
system there's plenty of room for
adjustments on both small to medium
sized wrists the main straps are very
soft flexible and more importantly they
are breathable for me the main display
in the brains of the device is hard
plastic and although in photos or video
it looks to stick up a bit here but
while wearing and viewing in person it's
not gargantuan or unusually large now if
you seen the budget model the vivofit
from Garmin it's very similar in size
and style no overall from wearing this
24/7 most days it's been very
comfortable and easy to wear even though
there's a protruding piece here under
the band where the optical heart rate
sensor is located and yes you can wear
this in the shower as well as it's rated
at 5 atm in addition this is wearable
while swimming snorkeling and diving
into water / garments website but let's
take a look at the very fluid touch
sensitive screen here with a menu access
button to the right the band will always
show you the time and the date and below
this I've always loved this feature
about Garmin devices it's called a move
bar a nice feature a nice reminder when
you're sitting stationary for too long
after 1 hour this first big bar shows up
as every 15 minutes that would go buy a
smaller additional bar will reveal
itself until you've reached a total of 4
small ones
I'll total 2 hours basically of you not
really moving around and indeed the band
will give you a decent vibration here to
the wrist and alert you to get up and
move no swiping right will review your
total steps so far with your
automatically adjusted step goal for
that particular day swiping right again
offers how many flights of stairs you
have climbed next is the amount of
active minutes that you've had for the
week the following is calories burned
distance traveled media controls to
control your music of course on your
phone the weather which includes both
the highs and lows for that day
notifications for your phone like
incoming emails Facebook and text
messages and the great thing here now if
you tap swipe left or right to find a
summary but another tap will allow you
to read the entire message by swiping up
and down now heading back out you have
your current heart rate with the average
heart rate reading on the bottom right
and doing some research and reaching out
to some of the IT folks
Garman they did disclose and this is
similar to what Fitbit does as well when
you're not in running mode and casually
wearing the band throughout the day your
heart rate is read every five minutes
not every second only when you are in
running mode does the band read every
second then Garmin a Fitbit does this to
basic conserve the battery while you're
still giving you an idea of what your
casual or resting heart rate is that
many people are aware of this now
regarding my heart rate testing I use my
trusty polar h7 chest strap which
performs identically to garments very
own chest heart rate tracker both chest
straps are highly accurate with the
activity band the vivosmart HR and his
main competitor the Fitbit charge HR
after my testing I found both to perform
with similar characteristics both
mainstream bands do have some slight
variations where at times the deviation
can go up to as high as five heartbeats
however majority of the time this smart
HR performed very well as you can see in
these non-professional videos here I
would stop randomly during my runs and
check the band's readings versus my
chest strap and as you can see time and
time over the numbers are really close
now for more precise readings and being
transparent with my findings for you
guys I compared my charts on both my V
with smart HR and the chest strap and I
noticed in the beginning of every
exercise that I do there's just a bit of
noise or a slight your regularity where
you notice my HR jumping around a bit
when in reality the heart rate should
always be a linear progression up and a
smooth movement down while at rest
just like the chest strap chart that you
see there however after about the two
minute mark you can see for the most
part the vivosmart HR signal begins to
become more consistent and that's what
you saw in the videos earlier during my
run the HR was visually much more
accurate overall for HR performance this
does well for a mainstream band it's not
spot-on as the Meo global rest activity
trackers but comparing again to the
popular Fitbit charge HR they performed
very similar in my experience and one
last thing about heart rate tracking
features the V with smart HR does allow
for you to have heart rate zones to
display while working out now all this
can easily be set up through the app or
through Garmin connects websites now one
common question people ask me will there
be any notification from going into one
zone to the other now from my experience
there's no vibrations or any kind of
indications unfortunately now I'm not an
IT engineer but
hopefully with the firmware update they
can make this happen but going back to
the V with smart-hr banned one more
swipe will bring you back to your date
and your time now another quick and easy
test that I did here using this in
bright sunlight sometimes other bands
have this issue this you can see the
band is very visible in bright sunlight
and if you're in the dark as well tap
the screen and a backlight illuminates
the display an additional option that
Garmin includes if you're not fun of
looking at the band horizontally you can
change the display via the app to show
vertically which I'm sure some will
prefer now going into your menu options
tapping the action button offers you to
start a run that timer will begin in
while in running mode swiping right
offers calories burned then real time
heart rate tracking date and time and
with last your distance but backing out
here is the crescent moon offering a do
not disturb option when you are asleep
backing out again one more time the band
offers a silent vibrating alarm which I
felt was indeed more powerful than the
fitbit's in above average than other
bands on the market this will vibrate
your wrist to wake you up in the morning
without disturbing others in the room
now swiping to the next screen offers
Bluetooth on and off pairing your phone
to enable notifications on or off and
last is a connect alert to inform you if
the band has lost Bluetooth connection
with your pear phone now back to the
main menu once again you have a manual
sync button self-explanatory here and to
the right is something really cool if
you've misplaced your phone tapping this
icon will cause your phone to emit a
certain ringtone and the LED light on
your phone will start blinking even if
the ringer was completely off now on the
band there is an antenna signal strength
indicator and when there's more bars
that means you're getting closer to your
phone now of course the band still needs
to be within Bluetooth range for this to
work nonetheless a convenient feature to
have scrolling right one more time to
finish the menu options a folder that
shows your previously recorded runs
sprocket allows you to change the
language time being displayed either
miles or kilometers and then there is
Auto lap which is another feature from
Garmin at every mile or kilometer
whichever one that you choose here the
government app will indicate this as
being a lap in your app helpful in a
sense segmenting your won automatically
now you can turn on or off the activity
and the heart rate tracking as well and
last is basically to restore your band
to default settings very lastly in
icon is a battery indicator and just
other some miscellaneous information on
the band itself like version number and
whatnot
and before I forget to mention the view
of smart HR can store up to 14 days of
activity and heart rate tracking and up
to seven timed activities so yes you can
definitely leave your phone behind when
you go for a run and last this smart HR
comes with a proprietary charging cradle
that connects via USB and government
claims up to five days of use and so far
I've been hitting about four days in
about 18 to 20 hours until basically the
unit dies and recharging takes about an
hour and a half which feels very fast so
I know that has been a lot of
information for you guys let's look at
what is equally important as well it's
basically how you analyze offer data and
how easy it is to read here's the Garmin
Connect app available for both Apple and
Android devices
the previous version of the app was
really plain and not exciting to view
like the competition now I'm thrilled
the government finally here revamp their
app experience here starting with the
homepage is what they call a snapshot of
your day steps are on the left with Auto
adjusting step goals directly below and
on the right is the total amount of
sleep that you had last night but
tapping on steps shows you your
estimated distance calories floors
climbed and going down here with a bar
chart below giving you a quick and
simple visual of how active you were
throughout that particular day now going
back and then going into sleep then
before I forget to mention here the band
does record your sleep automatically so
you don't need to manually press any
buttons before knocking out it's highly
convenient but similar to jawbone
numerix detailing deep light and awake
moments and below is another visual
chart indicating the aforementioned
sleep patterns so far wearing this band
here it's been very accurate and knowing
when I do start sleeping and when I do
get up but more importantly here and
this really interesting clicking on
movements is really great showing
overall activity throughout the night
now backing up the main page has some of
the more general information but at the
forefront informing you your active
calories calories left to burn minutes
you have been really working out here
activities recorded calories consumed
which links to my Fitness Pal a
phenomenal app it is but oddly and my in
here when I try to open this it's given
me an error and last is floors climbed
swiping right is the steps page a line
that fills for today's performance here
is up top with the last 30 days of
performance down below now going to the
right one more time we see garments
sticks with a snapshot of today up top
again but also the last seven days of
sleeping performance on the bottom now
clicking on the four white squares here
on the top right allows you to view
additional data like running cycling
swimming golfing and whatnot and the app
does show these activities but I didn't
find an option on the physical band
itself to say I want to record a
weightlifting session or maybe a cycling
session so after each activity you would
have to manually go into the app or
maybe the desktop application and then
change it there afterwards so tapping on
the hamburger menu icon here in the top
left there's leaderboards to see where
you rank against any friends that you've
added a monthly 30-day calendar showing
your activities and last
a newsfeed basically a logger of all
your activities recorded backing out and
looking into activity stats this is
where you can find all of your specific
data collected for example opening up
stairs climbed you can see your last
seven days of performance with totals
and daily breakdowns below now the
following health information is very
much the same the same formatting that
is illustrating different ways to
analyze your own data now moving back to
the main area regarding workouts courses
and segments if you go into your Garmin
Connect account on your desktop you can
set up a custom plan as a simple example
you can create a workout profile to warm
up for 10 minutes then maybe run for
another hour and then end it with a
cool-down period
it's a predetermined calculated workout
that you set up ahead of time and later
use while you're running or exercising
the courses and segments are other areas
that you yourself have ran and have
saved on to your app or other routes
that others with Garmin products have
saved themselves with their own data and
information right there for you to view
so you can maybe attempt to beat their
performance or see where you stand with
the rest who has been out there already
and less finishing up this app
connections and groups are really for
social networking here which does help
to keep you competitive and I'm not a
goal for myself but you can download
golf courses in your local area and have
activity tracking while you play and
then the very last set of features here
on the app itself are just really
self-explanatory so overall from my
experience I gotta admit Garmin has
really stepped up their game and I would
say are more competitive this year
versus last year when comparing this to
the jawbone and Fitbit products I still
feel the jawbone and Fitbit app
experience is laid out better with
easier to read information and the app
just flows nicely but in my personal
experience with Garmin I felt the app
was laid out with more meat in your face
example the emphasis on active and
intense minutes or consistently having
today's performance up top while your
weekly progress is on the bottom all
without having to go to separate screens
to view it's always in front of you it's
always reminding you of basically where
you are and your fitness goals the band
on the other hand despite losing its
original slim and sleek body and now
looking more like the garbin vivofit I
still welcome the change considering all
the features that is available on the
band itself for $150 this displays our
notifications and text messages works
great in sunlight has
heart rate tracking and a few other
tricks up that sleeve now it's not
perfect but a serious alternative to the
Fitbit charge HR or even the jawbone up
