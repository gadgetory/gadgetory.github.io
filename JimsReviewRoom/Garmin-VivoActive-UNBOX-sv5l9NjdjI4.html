reviewer welcome back to another video
now today I got something very special
for you guys I haven't done an unboxing
in quite some time but with this new
product here I felt like I should do
something special for you guys it's the
brand new garmin vivoactive so here goes
let's take a look at the box real quick
here I'll show you guys what's included
or what's involved on the outside and
eventually on the inside here and on the
back not much information just basically
icons of what this can do now remember
if you guys did watch my fitness bands
for 2015 I did do a preview and eat
garmin vivoactive now one of the unique
things about this product here is it's
very specific to certain sports now for
example for golfing where this it has
GPS tracking right on the wrist bring
this to your golf course and it's able
to bring up that specific golf course
and it'll tell you what party on doglegs
distance through green etc very very
impressive
now Garmin didn't really is too much
more information besides that besides
just a teaser video but that's just one
of the things that you can actually do
with this and golfing is one of them
running of course
Swimming's on here biking hiking and a
few other media controls email
notifications and whatnot and like I
said earlier there is GPS built in again
not much information in the back here to
the right or to the left side of the box
here nothing but let's take a look
what's inside the box here and get this
going for you guys so here's the
charging cradle it looks like USB and
pretty straightforward here similar to
other Garmin products where it uses a
cradle where the watch just sits right
down there and basically a charges I
always wish that these watches would all
universally come with micro USB ports
some are making its way to the market
with that again this uses that charging
cradle for you guys now again I did
purchase the chest strap together with
this overall this is a if I recall here
I
retail wise 299 dollar package with the
garmin vivoactive and the chest strap as
well so let's see here so the tres chest
strap itself is very soft compared to
the last chest strap I used from Garmin
it had like a very solid plastic plate
going across
but this here completely flexible very
soft very nice to the touch and here
goes the module itself very similar to
the polar products as well of course and
you just basically snap this on here so
it puts a little bit of tension on the
back here that's why I couldn't get on
right away again the polar products you
just snap it in there's really no
tension it just flush but this does
protrude a little bit where the
batteries housed and just a little bit
of resistance not better at all I don't
think this should be an issue obviously
and let's look at the back here where
the sensors are pretty cool alright so
let me just move this out the way here
and take a look at the watch itself
let's flip to the back unbuckle it here
okay and peel off this a nice sticker
here and there we go let me see if I can
zoom in real quick here for you guys get
a better glimpse of what's going on here
I'm sorry this is kind of a guerilla
style recording but most of my unboxings
are like that now make sure you add me
on to facebook twitter or instagram ask
me any questions on there that you want
answered possibly in the review video
once i get that uploaded and again
subscribe to my channel as well Jim's
review room that way you guys can see
the product when it's officially out but
overall I'm very impressed it's super
thin this is like the thinnest activity
banner activity watch you can say that I
have held so far very delight
ridiculously lights very thin very
impressed all together so here with the
power button let me press that real
quick here and just another button here
let's see if it does anything maybe
there's a little bit of juice in here
all right there we go couple of seconds
to load here whoops little vibration I
felt a little bit of feedback all right
there it is of course you can select
different languages and whatnot but I
won't go to the settings here I do want
to take my time just make sure I go
through all these options and whatnot to
see what's going on so that's about it
let me put out my wrists real quick here
and regarding the band itself it is it's
soft its pliable it's not stiff but the
material feels more like plastic versus
rubber very smooth though I like the
feeling though it's not a bad thing it's
not bad that it's it's not like rubber
yeah see there's there's zero stretching
like on the fitbit products you do have
the band that stretches a little bit
this doesn't this doesn't feel like it
stretches at all but it's still very
thin very comfortable from just initial
impressions here and of course the latch
style with the buckle here so this
should obviously stay on secure no
problems and there you go that's what it
looks like it let me try to get it in
focus here not bad
Wow but it's so good I love that at the
low profile I mean this is where
technology should be heading where it
shouldn't be this thick cumbersome
product
I wish smartwatches eventually became or
you know was as this thin as well but
this feels really good actually I like
it doesn't flex but it feels it feels
just like a natural watch that I would
wear nothing nothing different it is
different of course like I said it
doesn't have that last elasticity like
some of the other bands out there but
that I don't feel like that's an issue
for me but overall here we go guys like
I said I'll test it out charge it here
and well you said it for me your
questions Facebook Twitter Instagram and
of course add me on YouTube as well if
you haven't done so and this was an
unboxing a very quick look at the garmin
vivoactive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
