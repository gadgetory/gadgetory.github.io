review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at this ice cream maker from
Cuisinart model IC e 21 and I purchased
mine for $59 at the time of this review
and I've also done the same review on
its bigger brother the model IC e 30 BC
and that's priced at $30 more at $89 you
can click on that pop up video here or
find it on my youtube channel at
youtube.com slash Jim's review room so
without further ado let's get started on
this particular model the IC e 21 is
indeed the smaller brother boasting a 1
and 1/2 quart freezing bowl versus the
more expensive model that features a 2
quart freezing bowl this model only
comes in white and the unit itself
consists of four main components just
like the 2 quart model with some minor
differences though you have the base
which houses the motor here the freezing
bowl mixing arm and also the locking lid
as well and that's it and it's very
simple it's a little bit lighter but the
product still feels durable with quality
plastics used instead of a turn dial
on/off switch the Cuisinart utilizes a
toggle switch instead the sprocket with
multi teeth design which spins the
freezing ball is about 50% smaller than
the bigger model now the overall feel of
this particular design suggests that
this unit is made for lighter news
nonetheless it still performed what it
needed to do though so what's great
about the Cuisinarts ice cream makers in
general is they don't require rock salt
or ice as finally more traditional
methods now some people like the
nostalgia factor however with this
machine the mixing bowl has its own
liquid inside which is double insulated
you do have to freeze the bowl for at
least eight hours and I prefer doing it
overnight to ensure it's rock-solid the
next day now the freezing Bowl is what
gives the mix eventually the ice cream
texture and consistency the mixing arm
and locking lid is plastic and clear
acrylic respectively now none of the
items per the owner's manual indicated
they were dishwasher safe so hand wash
everything and just wipe down the motor
with a damp cloth as a tip in this
review and for both models with the
acrylic lid make
when you hand wash the lid and use a
very soft sponge nothing abrasive
acrylic is very easy to stretch up and I
learned the hard way with some other
items so with this model it claims you
can make ice cream sorbet and frozen
yogurt and up to one and a half chords
at a time the instruction booklet didn't
mention if I can make gelato or not
though however what I'll make today is
butter pecan ice cream for my tests the
recipe calls for butter pecans milk
sugar salt heavy cream and vanilla
extract
so after toasting the pecans and butter
and mixing the rest of the ingredients
in a separate bowl refrigerate for an
hour or two now when ready place the
mixing bowl you froze overnight into the
Cuisinart space along with the mixing
arm and clear locking lid now turn on
the Cuisinart ice cream maker and pour
your ingredients in up for the
instructions it typically takes 15 to 20
minutes for the ice cream to churn and
thicken now 5 minutes before the mix is
done pour in the pecans and that's it
it's very simple and what you have now
is soft-serve ice cream and if you want
hard ice cream you do have to place it
in the freezer for several hours though
now regarding cleanup again none of the
items are dishwasher safe everything has
to be hand washed with soap and warm
water there are only three components
that needed to be washed and all three
were very easy to clean as claimed by
the manufacturer and the most important
part of this review and I'm sure you've
been waiting for this is the taste test
and in this video is literally my first
time tasting the ice cream from a
homemade machine and I love ice cream
and I'll tell you it came out very well
indeed the consistency was like
soft-serve ice cream and from the recipe
very surprisingly tasted very good for a
homemade product and I'll admit once you
freeze it to make it into hard ice cream
it tasted a bit better in my opinion and
the consistency was a bit more creamy as
it melted in your mouth
right after making the ice cream and
after hardening the ice cream no ice
crystals were found in a texture was
perfect and comparing to the bigger yet
more expensive unit the consistency and
this machine was basically the same so
after making several batches and testing
this product it's a great machine this
machine barely had any flaws but just
future wants from my personal experience
but I wouldn't see it as a deal-killer
though so after pouring in the
ingredients it only takes about 20
minutes for the machine to do its work
and finish so during that time the motor
itself does make in moderate winding
roads when powered on and it's just a
little loud rhythm it's bigger buddy in
addition I was hoping there would have
been some sort of a lid on top to
prevent any dust from falling into the
ice cream and probably lastly it would
be nice to have a built-in timer for the
machine to automatically shut off just
in case I forgot once the ice cream
thickened you can hear the machine
working harder to churn and the ice
cream itself expanded and was somewhat
coming out of the opening possibly or
would have resulted in an overflow so
again not detrimental and just basically
more wants than a flaw so that's
basically it for my review here be sure
to watch my other review and the ice
cream maker and the bigger brother the
Cuisinart ice-1 30 BC again that's $30
more a little bit of a bigger version
and hopefully that review will help you
justify if it's worth spending that
extra thirty dollars or not so I hope
