review by Jim's review room as the year
2013 has gone its way we're starting to
receive interesting data indicating on
what consumers are really buying now as
some of you may know Windows and Apple
laptops for 2013 saw a decrease in sales
and it's confirmed by reputable market
research company NPD Group but one of
the products that grew over 4,000
percent when comparing 2012 to 2013 and
basically accounted for 21% of laptops
sold in the latter year is the
Chromebook by Google so what is the
allure of these Chromebooks that
basically sold almost nothing in 2012 -
the fastest growing laptop product by
the end of 2013 so without further ado
we'll get started the product under
review is a Samsung Chromebook 11 inch
model priced at only 249 dollars at the
time of this review now with Chromebooks
they're known not only for their low
budget price point but also for their
very slim and simple profile now this
unit here the measurements are on your
screen but they also take note into how
thin this unit actually is and also the
weight coming in at only 2.4 pounds
making this able to be put it into your
bag conveniently and when holding on to
it does feel very light in your palms
now the entire body is made of plastic
with minor amounts of flex unfortunately
now although flexing the unit still
feels durable though when handling and
when opening and closing the lid note
once the screen is open though the base
of the notebook is very thin on the
front and right sided laptop doesn't
have any inputs while the left side
yields a three-and-a-half millimeter
microphone and headset combination port
and also a card reader as well but the
rear houses most of the connections with
two USB inputs with one being the latest
USB 3.0 which is a plus now finishing up
the rear is a full size HDMI connection
to connect to your TV or monitor and
then there's a tiny hole here to connect
to the supplied wall charger and lastly
is a built-in VJ webcam and despite a
workable webcam VGA is actually a very
old technology and as you can see on
your screen even with a perfect internet
connection the video quality is on low
in here
again the screen comes in at eleven
point six inches and has a resolution of
1366 by 768 now the resolution is
actually on par with other low to mid
grade laptops with the same resolution
now only when you start to hit the price
point of about 700 to 800 dollars is
when you do start seeing the higher
resolution being offered now before
talking about the internals and its
performance one of the biggest benefits
to having a Chromebook is everything is
synced and to your Google account
and I'm sure most of you who already
have an Android phone or tablet or folks
just using Gmail you can use that
existing account actually now by having
Chromebook of your favorites and or
bookmarks to your Google Calendar to
your Google Chrome's history and
multiple devices are all viewable across
any Google operating software now think
of Google as being the holistic approach
to both your online and offline content
and I'll get more into that a little bit
later once we start talking about apps
now one mentioning that is genuinely
unique but also may hinder Google is the
fact that you don't install any programs
you can't download programs for news and
to this Chromebook however Chromebook
focuses more on apps then apps are only
available through the Google store now
moving on internally Chromebooks in
general uses low power consumption
processors in this case Samsung uses as
an existing proprietary chip the Exynos
5 which is a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core
processor that's the same processor that
powered Google's tablet the Nexus 10 the
Samsung has two gigs of RAM on board and
a 16 gigabyte SSD hard drive and other
notable features are wireless internet
connections for a B G and n networks
with Bluetooth connectivity to connect
all your Bluetooth enabled devices and
the battery also claims up to 6.5 hours
of use however during my test of making
up documents playing on YouTube and
watching Netflix and with some of the
occasional gaming as well the actual
battery life I obtained was a little
over five and a half hours straight from
a full battery charge and it's not too
long considering this system is so light
on tasks and programs though now with
all that being said for the tech guys
out there the numbers are not astounding
at all however Chromebooks are aimed for
the casual and user
the interface like the physical layout
itself is a very simple and is laced
with nothing but Google Apps and use now
the far bottom left lays your app button
to access all your downloaded
applications Google Chrome in Gmail is
to follow while the next three are
identical to Microsoft Word Excel and an
even power point called Docs sheets and
slides respectively and although for
casual users these three productivity
apps are very well equipped and can
possibly do everything that Microsoft
can while altogether being free now
Google tax for example besides the
ability of typing your paper or even
something more involved such as a
newsletter or so they have the ability
to save it as a Word document though so
Microsoft can open it or you can save it
as a PDF file and email your work to
readers abroad that's a very small
illustration though of a Google based
application any document you create you
can seemingly work with non Google and
non Chromebook users as well now besides
the aforementioned apps that are
pre-installed the Google store is
available at your fingertips with
Chromebook almost exclusively having
Google based apps there are some
limitations though when you go into the
Google store apps like Skype are not
available again that's just one small
example
now Google's defense was suggesting
using the app Google Hangouts which is
already pre-installed in substitution
for the missing Skype application
basically Google's really drawing you
into and using their Google products
there's nothing wrong with hangouts I
actually personally use it but Skype
appears to be the major service used
around the world currently some games
like Need for Speed world although
available in the store doesn't work on
Chromebooks because Chrome but runs
neither on Windows or Android now lastly
regarding Samsung's performance my test
yielded perfectly fine for everyday
casual use though now pulling up email
going into Facebook browsing photos went
without a hitch
watching youtube videos in high
definition wasn't a problem as well and
also Netflix ran smooth now as for
gaming I don't recommend the Chromebook
at all though although some games can be
found in the Google store some are just
not compatible with Chromebook if there
was a game that was playable friendless
would occasionally drop and again impact
your ingenuity like Chromebook
in my opinion is clearly not for gaming
so to wrap things up the Samsung
Chromebooks price alone is a huge
selling point at only $250 and its
limits and for profile I would say next
if you already have a Google account
whether you have it for an
android-powered device or we have
something as simple as Gmail you'll
notice the integration with Chromebook
will be a smooth transition the
productivity suite is very robust and
has unique features that are quite
extensive when compared to Microsoft's
product line another huge benefit are
the documents you produce you can save
them in performance where you can easily
access them on other non Google based
devices and computers now some issues
that may hinder your considered purchase
are limited availability of apps and
games games that aren't playable the
frame rates do try pretty bad to the
point where it might not even be as
enjoyable as you think at least video
playback and popular sites like YouTube
and Netflix works without any issues
though the fact that you can't download
any programs to install and use does
limit what's on the market but if all
the affirmation offerings are all that
you'll use again email Facebook web
chatting video watching document
producing this is a good fit actually a
college student typing up papers or
business professionals Justin using it
for very simple tasks so at $250 it's
not a bad choice at all though so
hopefully with 2014 here we'll have some
new models with the more updated
processors built in to fix some of the
issues that are currently plaguing the
Samsung and hope with this review it
helped in some way and if you have not
