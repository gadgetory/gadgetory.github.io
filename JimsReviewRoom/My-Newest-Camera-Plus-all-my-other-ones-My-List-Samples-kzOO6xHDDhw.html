room welcome back to another one of my
videos today finally got the camera out
and did this video here this is going
through all of my cameras that have at
Jim's review room or probably most of
them that is and actually explain to you
why and it's gonna be a really quick
rundown because if I go into each
individual camera this bid is probably
like an hour long but what I want to do
is seriously ask you guys in the comment
section below let me know what you guys
think of this kind of video this
absolute straight away from my reviews
this is completely no narrative no
script this is me talking to you guys so
it's very raw it's probably a lot of
hard cuts a lot of me rambling on here
and see if it's something that we could
do moving forward so with that being
said right now as you're looking at this
for those who are familiar with a
channel you notice the background maybe
me the quality looks a little bit
different it's because I'm not using one
of my uh a player cameras here I'm using
a Sony a 65 hundred recording in 4k 30
frames a second being recorded out to my
external monitor onto an SSD and I know
I'm pointing over to this corner right
here but if you guys want to see a video
of that I might go into detail about
that it's a little bit more technical
but this is the a 6500 you guys can see
the quality's not bad at all
first thing I want to say if you guys
are thinking of starting YouTube even
into photography you don't need a nice
camera I know I have all the stuff in
front of me right here but when I first
started YouTube I started with a Nikon
d50 100 that D 50-100 did great at that
time it was a good foundation I used it
for about a year or so before I even
committed to YouTube full-time and it
serves his purpose so after I said you
know what let me go full-time let me
take this serious I was let me just go
even darker and I eventually I painted
my walls dark grey eventually sharp shot
and much darker lighting I said I needed
a new camera so that's when I went into
this bad boy right here and I know this
is older I'm sorry my phone is vibrated
there again is all raw this camera is
still one of my favorites if not I'm
reluctant to give it away or sell it
basically not given Tom
so this Nikon d810 full-frame sensor
paired with a 24 to 70 F 2.8 Tamron lens
both of this is weather sealed both of
this I can go into the rain and have
peace of mind am I gonna drench it or
anything like that me toss my phone back
here and the color signs on this thing
is probably one of my favorites here I
know I got the Canon right here I'm not
gonna say which model it is just yet I
have another camera right here but out
of everything I know the Canon I don't
know almost a fanboys I wanna disrespect
you guys but from my purposes this looks
phenomenal where they'll be recording
video or taking photos I think bring
into post-production it just looks great
every time at least from my type of
editing my type of workflow it looks
phenomenal I just want to emphasize that
also the fact that it's it's just so
easy to use it's economical it is a
large size it's a little bit heavier
than other mirrorless cameras obviously
at the time when I bought this I thought
this thing was a tank until I bought
this this has been now looking back at
it in hindsight it feels absolutely
great in the hands you know any problem
with this the reason why I moved on to
the next camera this did not have
in-body stabilization when I first
started youtube a lot of it was just me
and I had it on a tripod still look
great don't get me wrong but eventually
once I got this office and started
hiring people I had other people film me
and they have to hold the camera by hand
with this one is gonna get shaky jittery
even if you hold it as still as possible
you're gonna see the image just kind of
like bounce around a little bit looked a
little bit unprofessional also and the
biggest gripe is the auto focusing
system on Nikon as much as I love every
other aspect about Nikon the auto
focusing system it just sucked compared
to the other cameras that I have here at
the office
once I try to lock onto an image it does
this hunting thing we're just kind of
like jerks back and forth a little bit
not cool at all didn't like it for that
aspect so eventually I moved on to the
sony a7s to this camera loved it because
of the embody 5 axis in-body
stabilization we can shoot handheld this
thing looks great pair this with a
gimbal or some kind of spam eliezer I
paired it with a xun crane too I think
you pronouncing a lot of people don't
know how to pronounce it I don't know
either but anyway that soon cranes who
paired with the image stabilization
embody paired with the image
stabilization not on this lens but that
we have another wide-angle lens here
holy freak the cameras like it's on
Rails perfectly smooth it goes along a
linear path loved it did some commercial
work with it again
that worked out phenomenal the auto
focusing system on here is very good
much better than a Nikon but compared to
my Canon Canon wins hands down the auto
focusing system on canons great with the
Sony it did very good but once in a
while just for some reason unlock on my
face and start focusing on the
background or start focusing on another
object
it was quite weird so not perfect but
much better as one be best actually on
the market third thing that I loved
about that sony a7s 2 besides the
low-light performance I had low-light
performance and the d810 as well which
is phenomenal but it was the 120 frames
per second slow motion basically for
2017 and this is in general my filming
career I guess this was the first time
where we really shot in slow motion and
I tried to utilize that in a lot of the
reviews in 2017 it looked amazing
I loved it loved it loved it you can see
some of the shots on your screen right
now just buttery smooth and just kind of
evokes a certain aesthetic and emotion
each in each one of those clips now the
negative side of this thing better life
sucks I mean it is horrible that's why I
recorded in 1080 even though I had a 4k
camera I only recorded in 1080 of 2017
cuz I was going through batteries left
and right these batteries do not last
long at all now second the back of the
screen I've been grateful that it tilts
up like this so that women can shoot
kind of low like this and kind of shoot
up here and such but it was just so dim
and sometimes it wasn't as accurate and
when were shooting outdoors it just
wasn't as accurate so once we bring it
in post-production it be either too
bright or too underexposed the screen
itself needs tremendous amount of work
so I just moved on from here I still
have it I'm probably mostly gonna sell
this one that v8
and man I love this camera but it is I'm
not using it as much I'm using it more
for photography and photos it looks
great it's more of my backup camera if I
need to bring it out and shoot and I
know I'm I don't need the stabilization
I'm gonna keep it fixed on the ground or
on a tripod I usually bring up the Nikon
but now since I switched to this bad boy
right here this is the Canon 1dx mark -
this is 4k when using shooting in 4k
obviously as you guys have seen banner
life is phenomenal on this thing this
thing is massive look how big this thing
is but look at this battery holy cow
this lasts me an entire shoot if I shot
this in 4k this lasts me 30 minutes
maybe if that this ima have like 6 of
these batteries on hand every time which
is they said it does alleviate the
problem but the same time just another
thing that I got thinking about I love
having this in here closing it up and
done move on basically so anyways with
the 1dx i love the skin color science my
skin looks phenomenal
on this thing here i still prefer the
nikons but compared to the sony this
blows the sony out of the water
basically
and obviously it's this is the top of
line canon camera photography camera
that is so it's not apples to apples but
just in regards to workflow and such
just going through what I have here the
colors on the skin Canon does phenomenal
4k looks phenomenal here super sharp
super clean you guys have seen couple of
videos that have posted recently that's
been shot on the Canon this camera is
only about a month also I'm still kind
of getting used to it trying to learn
its pros and cons limitations nuances
etc I'm shocked and this is the first
time I did this when I was first using
the camera I shot a image that was super
dark put into Lightroom holy cow
I'm able to bring out like almost a
pitch-black photo bring up the
brightness bring up the exposure and
still have a very much very no question
usable image that's how versatile that's
the margin of error you can completely
eff up a photo basically and still be
able to use it by
host production now the one advantage
over from the cannon over to the Nikon I
was like hey so both cameras doesn't
have the image stabilization so why you
know why am I not you know pumping up
Nikon it's because the auto focus on
here is hands-down the best probably in
the world it's a touch screen in the
back touch focus I tap on the object and
I can move the camera around like
violently and it still tracks I can tap
on this my video African tap on my face
and it can focus on my face and when I
do like those 360 turns in my headphone
reveals or narratives
it lacks on my face never once doesn't
drop out into the background sometimes
that the Sony does it never loses focus
basically in in tracking in general the
only downside with this I'm not saying
like this is like the Holy Grail or
anything like that it doesn't have the
image stabilization it's identical to
the Nikon where if I hold this camera up
it's gonna be shaky basically
unfortunately a 120 frames per second
it's only in 1080 which was a bummer to
me I can bump up the sharpness we can
bring it back up to par back up to at a
reasonable good level but when you
compare it side-by-side with a 4k image
the 4k obviously just outshines at 1080
no matter what but the 4k arms are the
high speed movements that's recorded by
kin and I believe it's much more
smoother and much more elegantly done
versus even the sony a7s - I prefer the
Canon over that and last the only other
flaw that I could say with the Canon 1dx
is its huge huge huge file size it's one
of these cards right here and I
basically blow this car like it's like
it's nothing basically so about a minute
recording time in 4k is about 4 gigs I
believe on the memory card so you can
imagine it just chomps through this
thing like like it's nothing basically
so with that being said oh and the last
thing and I have no idea why as you guys
see this is the a 6,500 recording me
right now recording to an external
monitor there's 4k output onto my
monitor for some reason this
top-of-the-line
and best of the best can in photography
camera only outputs 1080 not 4k so I
can't do I can't have the advantage of
external recording onto this monitor and
recording 4k so everything I have to if
I want to retain 4k after recorded to
the CF card which it's not a really big
deal the memory cards are extremely
expensive one of these memory cards this
128 gigabyte memory card is like 350
bucks I believe versus one of the
original C if cars this was like a
hundred bucks so one hundred and ten
dollars on being a chore so I can't
remember off my head but you can see the
price difference so those are not only
gripes again I'm still new at the Canon
so far I do see the pros and cons behind
it it might be a better camera in
general overall workflow I don't know
for the time being this is gonna be it
into the next camera am I gonna get a
red I'll be honest with you I don't
think so I'm not doing any kind of
high-end production company videography
and such so I don't think I'm gonna get
anything even more expensive than this I
don't think we'll see let's see the only
reason why I would buy another camera is
if it increased my workflow and just
made everything simpler not harder I
don't care if it makes the image that
much better I think the images already
looks pretty darn good if anything it's
more on me I'm being a better colorist
color grater and just post production
management and efficiency so yeah that's
it for this video guys hope you guys
enjoyed it let me know in the comment
section below if you guys want to see
more of this again I'm Jimmy o'james
review room you guys take care I'll see
you guys in the next one
