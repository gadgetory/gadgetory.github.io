room
I reviewed Sony's extra bass Bluetooth
speakers last year and although they
were decent the audio quality was a bit
raspy and groaning because of that extra
bass this time Sony makes a return and
with the new generation we get a refined
audio signature which I'll test for you
guys but also some sick new LED lights
I personally paid for this at the retail
price of $200 as always I'll place my
affiliate links down in the video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time so sit back relax
and hopefully my videos help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room
going over the physical build this thing
is quite heavy and if you're looking for
portability this is not what you should
be looking at there's so many other
options out there but on the flip side
though you get extra base you get a huge
battery and again you get those LED
lights that not many other speakers on
the market currently offers now if size
is not an issue the XP 40 looks and
feels good with rubberized plastic all
around here the front metal grille is
tough enough to protect your speaker and
that same water resistance is back
protecting it from splashes and spills
of course you can't submerge this
underwater now one thing I do wish for
though although it has great build
quality having drop resistance making
this more rugged
what happened great now looking at the
tactile buttons up top you have the
standard pause play on and off etcetera
but unique features include Google
assistance and Siri activation with one
quick press on the speakerphone button
now I tested this speakerphone and it
sounded very good with no echoes and
standing further away for a speakerphone
it was still very much audible going
back to those buttons with the add
feature you can pair another compatible
Sony speaker and have left and right
audio separation for true stereo sound
or you can synch up to 10 compatible
speakers and enable what Sony calls
party chain and have all those speakers
play at the same time now UAE and JBL on
the other hand allows you to sync a
hundred speakers or more if you'd like
but giving Sony credits I don't think
most people would pair more than a
hundred speakers let alone ten again
maybe for some commercial user so
anyways NFC or near field communication
makes a return and lasts to the left is
the extra base option which I'll
demonstrate later in this video now one
thing I wish Sony would include is some
sort of visual battery indicator you do
have the ability to walk up to the
speaker and hold that call button for a
prompt but something more intuitive
again something more visual would have
worked much better rotating the speaker
to its rear you have some additional
base being pushed especially when you
put it against the wall on the right
there is a flap here that is
water-resistant which I felt could have
been a bit healthier for peace of mind
but it does work that with blocking out
liquids but behind here we have a 3.5
millimeter audio input the power port
which is not a micro USB connection you
have to carry Sony's power break here if
you're ever going on extended vacations
to the far right is charge outs which
allows the speaker to work as a power
bank and it's able to charge your phones
or other random devices with a USB cord
now talking about all this battery life
here Sony is claiming an impressive up
to 24 hours of use like all of my
bluetooth speaker reviews I left this at
50% environment up it playing overnight
here into the battery died I'm a virgin
hours and five minutes worth of use
after several attempts now bluetooth 4.0
is offered and although it's not the
latest Bluetooth 5.0 the range is still
phenomenal I tested this both on my
samsung s A+ and pixel XL I got 50
linear feet with no issues so right
before I demo the audio test the newest
and coolest feature are of course the
light if you don't like them you can
always turn them off with the compatible
Sony app you get rave like club scene
hues of color in addition you get
pulsating strobe lights and all this
responds to your music have slow music
the lights fade in and out here with
fast music you might actually give some
folks seizures put all seriousness they
are bright but the strobes are not to
the point where it's blinding people to
death now within the app unlike the JBL
pulse products where it offers you tons
of customisation options you are
unfortunately stuck with Sony's presets
now the colors do look great nonetheless
and as an example
switching to Col magenta it does give a
nice lounge effect here while switching
to quote hot gives a warmth to the room
overall if you're in a dorm room maybe
like to have a quote fun speaker or even
value accent lighting for your place
here is sony xba-40 lighting system or
lighting features will not disappoint so
- the moment you've been waiting for
here I'll play several songs for you
guys and then I'll give you my verdict
afterwards but one thing I want to ask
from you guys my awesome viewers if you
guys can comment down below tell me what
other speakers you want me to compare
this to
I might make a dedicated versus video if
I get enough responses so thank you guys
in advance
and very having folks hands down this is
a great improvement over last year's
even with extra base on that droning
Andres penis is gone the quality of bass
has improved and I very much enjoyed the
listening experience for a bass focused
Bluetooth speaker because of its lower
bass levels plus the lighting here this
speaker hits its target audience right
on the head basically me I personally
love EDM hip-hop and pop music myself
and the speaker accentuates the beat and
those colors again makes the room pop
the speaker really gets you in the mood
to jam now as for the mid-range it
stands out and it's not recessed of
whatsoever it's not money it actually
complements the bass it's clear detailed
and one thing I think was shocking to me
that I've noticed the soundstage is very
apparent you can hear vocalist in the
mid-range stand out in the forefront
while music is slightly recessed in the
back now we're still limited on left and
right audio channels but for a Bluetooth
speaker the XP 40 does it better than
most now as for the highs there's no
rasp in singing there's no listening
fatigue whatsoever now if you were to
get the speaker it is perfect for small
to medium sized rooms those rooms will
definitely be filled it does push large
room territory I'm talking about 40
linear feet of open space but I would
probably get two of these speakers have
them play in sync for a guaranteed audio
filled room so overall considering how
balanced the sony xba-40 is for a bass
focused speaker i can confidently say
the speaker will be enjoyable for most
people even if you don't like extra bass
you can always turn it off in the end I
highly recommend this I think it nails
quality all around and I'm certain this
will be in my best Bluetooth speaker
