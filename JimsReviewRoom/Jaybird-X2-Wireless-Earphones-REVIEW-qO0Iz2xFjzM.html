Salt Lake City Utah that has really set
the standard for sport earbuds on the
market when I tested the original
blueblood X they were the best sounding
sport earbuds I've heard to date and
it's known rings true today when
compared to other brands I've tested
over the years now I do admit it still
was not the perfect pair of earbuds in
regards to fitment for my particular
ears but just last month jaybird sent me
their newest jaybird x2 the follow-up to
the previous generation of course go
over these slightly new fitment and no
question discuss the sound quality but
let's start with what features are
included so without further ado I'm
Jimmy with Jim's review room comm and
I'm here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
video
going over the physical features jaybird
returns with a very similar design but
this time coming in matte paint finishes
of blue red green and what I
particularly like the all-black can be
all white paint colors the same lay flat
cables makes a return which is very
durable
it feels meeting the hands and from
prior experience with two other blue but
exterior phones the wires do hold up
from throwing these around throw these
in your bag and into your car etc I also
go one step further and testing the ends
of the earphones where the wire exits
and this area is notorious for poorly
made designs and cheaper products
flexing the cable left and right did not
expose any design flaws no wires
disconnecting or the ends actually
becoming loose and for those who are
unfamiliar with the previous model the
new x2 here are also sweat proof the
earphones have a hydrophobic coating
from Liquipel designed to protect
against sweat and the elements as
claimed by j-bird during my test which
of course is not recommended for you to
try at home
as it is excessive and technically not
sweat drenching these and waterproof the
earphones still function perfectly fine
afterwards now getting a bit deeper into
the x2 behind one of the earphones I cap
conceals the microUSB port through
charge the device Jay Berg claims up to
eight hours of use which is an
industry-leading standard and from my
personal testing at 50% volume to get a
middle of the ground tester you can say
I was able to achieve about seven hours
and 15 minutes and apologies for taking
the video in the car here how to run an
errand real quick so I couldn't leave
the earphones at home but charging this
from a dead battery to full had taken me
personally 2 hours and 23 minutes to be
exact over all the time claimed and
achieved is still quite impressive
longer better life than the power beats
and the jabbers for pulse to name some
of the other notable competitors out
there and moving down is your inline
controller for adjusting volume and an
inline microphone with the now older
blueblood X every adjustment with you
the beep and the music would sound like
it would skip that is now gone with the
x2 it is now completely seamless as
where the inline microphone here is a
live quick test just for you guys to
listen to
hello hey it's me
all right I'm going to do a quick jog
and well I'm going to just let me know
how it's done all right we're good copy
wind I don't not explain the depends on
weird dolls are running again so when
the first time here I'm running against
the wind one more time I mean it's not
even winded not even our voice you're
talking it sounds like I can hear maybe
a car in the background or something but
other than that it's not much of any
noise at all okay all right now now I
can hear something but other than that
yeah a car just drove by and right
before I get into fitment let me show
you what accessories you get compared to
the last generation the clamshell hard
case was a nice case in general using
the new soft case it works for the most
part but closing the lid it was somewhat
cumbersome too much pressure would push
the lid in while too light just didn't
get it to seal now yet inside j-bird
does offer three wingtips that go into
the ball of your ear which I'll
demonstrate shortly three separate clips
to loop the wire for behind the ear
wearing and less which addresses some of
the fitment issues from the last
generation j-bird appears to have
partnered with comply foam now I tested
compliant last year and found they make
an assortment of expanding foam ear tips
to offer better noise isolation and a
better fit versus these standard silicon
tips thankfully j-bird does offer both
sets here to try again with a physical
design there's not much that has been
changed however one redesign I noticed
are the ear fins or what they used to
call the ear wings there is slightly
wider and rounded at the end compared to
the old models this subtle change does
help and add in the comply foam tips it
does overall makes for a slightly more
secure fit over the blue but X now
there's two ways of wearing this one is
the traditional way of letting the wire
dangle on your neck this way you have
the fin tips face away from each other
select your size ear tips then and then
press each side into the ear now keep in
mind the controller stays on the right
side of your face the other option is
going over the ear which I felt
surprisingly more secure and it stayed
in
here a bit better this time the inline
controller will be on the left side of
your face with the ear fins pointed
inward and down you use the clips to
show in the cable bit and when you place
this in your ear the wire goes up and
over now I do have to disclose and it's
obvious everyone's ears are a little bit
different but these do fit better than
the old ones I believe with these subtle
changes from my personal experience that
did take a good bit of trial and error
to find the right combination of ear
fins and ear tip sizes to make this work
personally for me and once you've found
the right size they stay in for the most
part in the more stationary movements
like relaxing at home to weightlifting
worked perfectly fine for me running
yielded good as the earphones did stay
attached to my ear the entire time but I
would lose once in a while the in-ear
sound characteristics if you want sound
isolation more vigorous exercises may
cause the ear tips to sit more on the
outside of the ear canal versus in some
runners may prefer this since it's safer
to hear your surroundings while running
but you have great audio quality it's
imperative to have a good seal unless
regarding sound leaking the x2 holds in
sound very well with minimal to no sound
leaking whatsoever
so your neighbor sitting next to you
won't hear your music at all but this
really brings us to the sound test the
characteristics really hasn't changed
much from the blue but X but to be
honest jaybird didn't mess with
tried-and-true these things still gets
loud and listening to the x2 it just
fifty percent volume was definitely
enough basis deep full bodied and offers
much meat to rap pop and EDM those
listening to kid ink hey what happened
cascade sounded amazing it's not
overkill the bass Department either as
listening to bass heavy music for a good
hour so straight wasn't fatiguing to my
ears the vocals and mid-range of
instruments are pushed just far enough
Ford to offer such clarity and subtle
brightness and this does complement the
low frequencies as well
the highs do have some rollover so many
of these snares and cymbal crashes are
not too sharp and this prevents your
ringing Antoninus testing this on some
classic ac/dc and Red Hot Chili Peppers
sounded amazing as well again the
mid-range is just pushed forward enough
hearing the lead singers emphasize their
vocals again all very well done and to
really appreciate these earphones of
course use local paid and downloaded
music the streaming services are
okay for casual listening but to really
appreciate these you gotta go with
higher quality higher bitrate files and
last overall from use the signal
strength for me is within reason walking
away from my cell phone here leaving
this on one side of the house and
walking to the other maybe forty linear
feet starting I started to hear a little
bit of crackling at thirty feet or less
sounded perfectly fine with no loss in
connection from my note for phone so
overall to conclude this long review
here it's still my favorite sounding
sport Bluetooth earphones the sound is
just immersive and the sound signature
is still the best again of any sport
Bluetooth earphones I've tested and I
know some of my fans and viewers counted
on my facebook they just bought a pair
of being blue but X's don't be bummed as
I switched the old versus the new at the
same volume in with the same song of
course I couldn't really tell a
difference if anything it's practically
the same great audio quality as for
fitment they did improve but I can
foresee with that small handful again
that may have some trouble nonetheless I
would still give these at least a try as
I wouldn't pass up on the audio quality
being offered so hope this review helped
you in some way if you do like my work
you gotta add me on Facebook Twitter or
Instagram I'm always posting updates and
behind-the-scenes content on there and
as always bookmarked gyms review rom-com
for future news and reviews again I'm
