review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the nutribullet food
extractor made by the same company that
brought you the magic bullet and I'm
sure you might have the same question as
I did what's the difference between this
and a blender or a juicer now as you
know the pulp within any fruit or
vegetable contains fiber which is vital
for our digestion
now with juicers only the juice is
obtained while the fibrous pulp is
separated into a container for disposal
now as for seeds such as those found in
watermelon contain plentiful amounts of
zinc and magnesium while blackberry
seeds contains Omega threes now
typically these are not able to be
pulverized and consumed in most at-home
blenders unless spending several hundred
dollars for a high-end high-speed
machine and from what nutribullet claims
using their machine can pulverize and
finally blend nearly all parts of a
fruit or vegetable to take advantage of
the key nutrients normally not eaten
through food preparation and normal
cooking now blending juicing and chewing
alone does not release all nutrients
that are found in seeds skins and stems
of the food that we eat now when the
cell walls of natural food is broken we
receive three times the nutrition from
eating the very same foods and lastly as
stated by nutribullet over time with our
aging bodies we don't absorb nutrients
as we once did with their machine food
is broken down in our digestion system
does not have to work as hard to absorb
these foods our body needs so without
further ado we'll see if this machine
works so this is a 12 piece ensemble
priced at $99 retail and can be found at
Target Macy's or Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and I
prefer Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond since they
always have those 20% coupons in the
mail now what you receive them box is
one base that houses the motor one
extractor blade one milling blade one
tall cup to shore cups one handled lip
ring one regular lip ring two lids one
user manual and cookbook and one
nutrition guide which I found very
interesting to read though
now per the instruction manual the
plastic cups are dishwasher safe but can
only be placed in the top rack and
cleaned on the normal cycle now if you
have a sanitizing mode that will damage
the plastic the heat will the cups are
not microwavable or freezable and are
though bpa free from any toxic plastics
now the operation of the unit is very
simple the recipe booklet provides much
nutritional education and a decent
amount of recipes for you to try the
main idea of the mix is placing 50%
leafy greens while the other half you
will fill fruits I always love spinach
and considering its super high in
antioxidants this is my go-to green and
regarding the fruit you can place in
stems seeds and skin to your liking
lastly you fill the cup with water to
the maximum line and of course you can
adjust the thickness or thinness by
adding more or less and in this case I
added a little bit too much water now as
an optional booster in the form of nuts
is doable in this case I added elements
which overtime helps prevent heart
disease with high contents of magnesium
and blood pressure regulating potassium
lastly I place the extracted lid on and
extract away then I typically let the
Machine run for about a minute now when
finished and with most of these recipes
the colors won't be as appealing however
every cop will be packed with natural
foods with its it's essential vitamins
and as you can see everything is blended
very well with no chunks of carrots or
almonds to be found now from my taste
test and I'll be honest and this was a
little bit bland because of your just
having too much water
I can taste hints of sweet carrot in
there but the flavour was more siding
with Apple of course now really didn't
taste any bitterness from the spinach
surprisingly and I typically prefer a
thicker drink so for my next
demonstration I went with much less
water so my other tests included this
time spinach again slices of apples and
this time I use fresh whole pomegranate
seeds with several frozen chunks of
pineapple this time I wanted to go with
a more flavorful and sweeter drink that
placed minimal amounts of water
considering that the pomegranate seeds
are filled with juice again with all
those seeds with a normal blender
they'll leave big chunks behind but with
this the nutribullet the seeds are
broken down so much it's almost like a
smoothie like consistence
when you're drinking and consuming this
and from my drink taste test it's much
better for my liking this taste test I
did taste a hint of pineapple which is
pleasing but also the sweetness of the
palm juice
now this drink I did and can consume
with no hesitation of course if you do
plan on purchasing this there's so many
other varieties and recipes in the
booklet that you can choose from and
more than likely are actually healthier
than the path that I chose now lastly I
tested the machine on milling seeds down
and in this instance I had peanuts only
on hand
however with peanuts compared to the
magic bullet the peanuts were finely
chopped and milled down with no leftover
chunks or half pieces the nutribullet
does blend much more evenly and
everything inside the cup so overall
from all my quick tests I'm very pleased
with the nutribullet and its results and
I have reviewed other appliances in the
past and some just didn't chop or blend
everything as it claimed now this
product does exactly what it advertises
to do and it does it with ease the
machine is a durable well built product
from our review and with the information
that comes with the nutribullet you
receive a bit of education and ideas on
what's healthy for you and what to make
now if you're intending on making
smoothies or drinks from frozen fruit or
fresh fruit I just stick with the magic
bullet priced at $50 but if you're
intending on using carrots seeds or just
in general more dense fruits and
vegetables the nutribullet is a must so
I hope you enjoyed this review of the
nutribullet if you have not please take
your time to like and subscribe to this
video for future alerts to new products
