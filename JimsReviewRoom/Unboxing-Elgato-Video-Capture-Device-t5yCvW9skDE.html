review by Jim's review room after today
we're doing the unboxing of a gaming
capture device the new el gato a little
bit better than HD PVR but again there's
just an unboxing today be sure to
subscribe and my next video coming up
pretty shortly er we're going to do the
details and also my installation on my
laptop and just running through the
motions and see how this device performs
so here I'm just unraveling it got it
off of Amazon Prime about a week ago I
just haven't had a chance quit my old
job and started a new job finally so I
don't start until next week so I got
some free time here but this game
capture device a lot of positive reviews
so far people saying it works better
than the HD PVR just so much more
simplistic and just jumping to the
unboxing here as you can see it's a
pretty fancy nifty device the packaging
is beautiful I wasn't expecting it to be
to me this fancy
now just gonna be a you know regular
cheapo square box bundled up together
what now so um here the elgato does come
in a very glossy glossy beautiful liquid
finish you can say but definitely it is
fingerprint prone but again a beautiful
device it fits in the palm of my hand
it's very tiny surprise surprisingly I
knew it was small but didn't know it was
that small as you can see here that you
got the audio video in and I left the
HDMI input as well now believe the audio
video in is utilized for the ps3 if I
believe or if you're using component
cables but again I haven't even
personally tried this yet unboxing it
probably just couple minutes ago so I'm
just doing a quick run right now
HDMI out of course to your TV and the
USB goes straight to your laptop or
desktop computer and as you can see here
there's no external electrical port
which means it's self power through USB
which is awesome one less wire and I
guess you can say hopefully it to saves
a little bit electricity there for you
oh inside a box it comes with all the
cables that you need which is fantastic
I don't have to go out and buy some new
cables even down to
USB wire here you got your component
cables and I got their ghost it connects
to the AV in port there you got your
HDMI cable and I think coming up next
here is the ps3 cable as well and that
goes to yep the audio and video input as
well and the very last cable coming up
shortly here should be the USB cable
which is a pretty decent length again
like I said I haven't unraveled any of
this yet as of this video I'm just doing
a quick unboxing uploading this as quick
can and there you have it the album
g√¢teau with all the wires and
necessities I'm going to show you the
box itself and the left cover it has you
can say the Quick Start Guide and I'm
going to flip it over pretty soon if you
let you can pause this so you can see
the directions yourself on how to
connect the ps3 and also your Xbox 360
so have a look pause it if you need to
now I used to have a ps3 Xbox 360 and a
Nintendo Wii a couple years ago and do
some some financial trouble there you
can say or just switching jobs I had
unfortunately get rid of some of those
systems
oh here's the back of the box here and
again pause it if you need to comes with
all those wires and the system
requirements just make sure it fits your
needs and that's about it like I said
please subscribe doing the actual review
shortly here I'm installing onto my
laptop writing the cables to my ps3 as
we speak and hopefully my review should
be up shortly so I appreciate your time
and appreciate the likes please they do
definitely help me and look forward to
seeing you guys again take care have fun
and I'll be back
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
