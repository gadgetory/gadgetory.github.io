wireless headphones earphones and of
course Bluetooth speakers right here on
this channel today's new piece of tech
truly looks unique here I haven't
touched or tested anything like this
before and I'll be honest I was
skeptical as heck when I first saw this
JBL is classifying this as a wearable
bluetooth speaker there's audio drivers
that basically blast audio from your
neck up to your ears we'll see how these
go as always being transparent jayvon
didn't send us this review unit to test
our assessment was not altered in any
way please watch the entire video for
both pros and cons the JBL sound gear
retails for $199 the bt model goes for a
bit more at 249 although they look
identical
the bt a simply has an extra wireless
transmitter that plugs into your TV or
audio device giving you the ability to
watch your TV or movies wirelessly that
everyone has bluetooth enter TVs these
days at least not yet
as always I'll place my affiliate links
down in that video description below
click on those links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
they never know when these things might
go on sale so without further ado again
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review starting off with the physical
features on top there's a soft speaker
fabric protecting the speaker themselves
quickly rotating to the bottom it's a
rubberized texture feeling quite premium
here and it's also there to prevent the
sound here from sliding around while
you're wearing it so it doesn't slide
around your clothing the sound gear does
remain stable while wearing your and
during the past month of testing this
none of the materials have caused any
kind of skin irritation or discomfort
the weight and the sound gear comes in
at 350 grams surely less than a pound
making this very comfortable around the
neck also the sound gear is
ergonomically following the curvature of
my neck shoulders and resting gently on
my clavicle bone on the front the areas
of critique the fabric does collect a
bit of fine hair or I know this sounds
quite nasty here but dead skin cells
over time your fancy like me have a lint
roller that helps up big-time and using
some tape it does lift off that
unsightly stuff with ease as well now
also I personally didn't have any
if you have a large neck the opening is
quite small despite the sound you're
being able to slightly expand here some
may find it ever so slightly rubbing
against their neck while putting it on
you might be able to see that now finish
up the physical features the left side
has pause play and vibe up and down
Google assistant and series available
holding down either volume will skip or
go back on songs and then flipping to
the right side of the speaker there's
power on and off bluetooth pairing and
an LED indicator which honestly doesn't
do much discipling red when it's in low
power and unfortunately there's no voice
prompts on better levels either the more
my better test a little bit later now as
I was looking for competitors to compare
and reference I did notice that both
does cost more but it offers water
resistance in case you get caught in the
rain you sweat on it or if you're
carrying your kid or so maybe he or she
might spill something now keep that in
mind if you want water resistance or not
JBO doesn't offer it here now if you're
planning on using this for hands-free
calling there are two microphones built
into this sound gear you want to each
side of the collar so no matter which
way you're turning your head your voice
will still be audible I tested out the
calling feature and had decent results
my voice was very clear with no real
rasp enos the speaker did pick up a fair
amount of background noises though
rustling etc typing on my keyboard but
it never overpowered or overwhelmed in
my voice now the sound gear is able to
simultaneously pair with two devices
allowing you to quickly switch between
two different sources without taking the
neckband off and for those of you that
plan to move around a lot with the
speaker the sound gear has Bluetooth 4.0
and in our test I was able to reach
about 84 linear feet width before the
signal basically cut out and I reached
about 35 feet with several walls in
between me wearing this and my phone now
as for movies in gaming the $200 sound
gear that I'm reviewing didn't mention
in the spec sheet if it had app decks
low latency likely $250 sound gear BTA
now low latency simply helps with
syncing the video with audio and having
both play at the same time but it did
test this with my LG TV and just use
this with Netflix and YouTube audio was
Saints perfectly testing this with my
Dell XPS laptop
same thing no syncing issues whatsoever
so no problems at all now speaking of
better life
I mentioned earlier before I jump into
the audio test JBL claims up to six
hours which I was hoping for a bit more
if you look at the competitors like
boast they're claiming twelve hours
which is awesome
I ran the speaker here in the office
several times here from Fulton dead and
on average I'm reaching five hours and
45 minutes playing at about 50% volume
now charging does takes about two hours
they get back to 100% so that's it folks
be sure to use your headphones and
earphones for this audio test here to
get the best audio listening experience
I am using professional binaural
microphones to give you a 3d audio sound
please be sure to LIKE and subscribe if
you haven't already to show your support
also comment down below with some fire
emojis welcome to 2018 folks here we go
just do it really quick microphone check
all right let's do it
and there you have it folks hopefully
you enjoyed that 3d audio test be sure
to LIKE and subscribe to show you
support
of course these tests you take a lot of
time and effort here now first off this
thing does get loud 60% vomit is very
comfortable and loud enough for me but
one reason why I'm both excited and
surprised the sound gear at 60% and
higher volumes blocks out my outside
environment it's crazy because obviously
I don't have anything over my ears
there's no passive noise isolation and
my ears are exposed but when someone
nearby tries to speak with me at times
that don't even realize that they're
there it's not a bad feature and
experience i person prefer to be more
immersed into my music or movies anyways
now second although I could have this
blasting at say 70% by much louder that
is those around me of course can hear
what I'm listening to but this is one of
the unique experiences a lot of the
audio although loud to me is very much
tolerable with those nearby again the
music is not blaring into their ears by
any chance now it's as though I have
this dome or it's sound or invisible
sound helmet that I'm wearing it's
pretty cool and something I've never
experienced on a channel before now as
for actual sound quality the low
frequencies bass was definitely present
but I felt it was slightly lacking in
the lower reaches or lower end of the
range the deepest notes are flattened a
bit and upper bass levels were more
present extra instruments like bass
guitar still sounded good but more bass
boosted lows and modern hip-hop did
struggle a bit here because of this
there was some bass droning and bass
heavy tracks now moving on to the
mid-range frequencies where you hear
most details and instruments and vocals
the sound gear had its best performance
in this audio range of frequency vocals
were Ford the speaker had a lot of
immediacy or excitement not overly
aggressive but certainly a somewhat on
the brighter side which I do personally
prefer because bass was pushed up
towards the mid-range I thought there
might be some spillover effect
sound here but that wasn't the case
anymore delicate acoustic or piano songs
bounce well within the spectrum no
fidelity wise this won't replace a nice
dedicated pair of headphones but these
do surely sound much better than any
polluted speak in regards to quality and
detail in my tests now finally at the
top end the sound gear erred on the side
of precision well unless for them the
mid and base ranges their treble was
mostly accurate and given a nice balance
to the overall experience
only at tons when you do blast this I
mean seriously blast is that 80% Viman
higher that's when you notice a little
bit of distortion up there but never
there have any kind of ear ringing or
ear Timmy now one of the best parts
about the audio experience with the
sound gear was the audio separation
because of the placement of the four
speakers to slightly for your ears right
here and then there's two more speakers
just ever so slightly behind my ears you
achieve this surround sound experience
music has much more depth and soundstage
but with movies and video games man you
can distinctly hear audio in all sorts
of directions gaming movies is you were
these sound gear really shines so in the
end I'll save my honest reaction was
being surprised I wasn't sure of this
style of wearable tech was just a fad of
nots but from all my testing I really
enjoyed this experience now me my team
at Jim's room we're here to help you
make that purchase decision you guys
take care now see you have the next one
