today if the only line of defense in
case of an accident that may prove
you're innocent or prove the other party
is guilty without the hassle of going
through the he said and she said
situation and believe me I know
firsthand from my very own accident
several years ago another company Papago
which manufactures many variations and -
camps they are nice enough to send me a
review unit to test out their 2k
resolution camera now at the price of a
hundred and seventy nine dollars it is
on the steep side but listening out what
features are offered you can decide if
it's well worth it now I'm here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to gems review room going over
its physical built first this thing is
built sturdy it's not hollow feeling but
still very lightweight all buttons are
very clicky with good feedback and
overall from general use it doesn't feel
fragile and let's say if you're to be
involved in an accident it wouldn't
break on you and it's not yet summer but
it has hit high 80s recently in the
South and inside my car has been
blistering hot when coming back from
shopping but so far the dashcam is still
working without issues despite being in
those already high temperatures now
starting at the top left plain microUSB
port for connecting this to the supply
power cord is located there the right
has your on/off switch and last is an
emergency button and to answer a common
question when your memory card does get
full this will delete the oldest files
and overwrite them with the latest
footage
it's called loop recording but while the
dashcam is recording if you press that
emergency button the camera locks that
file and prevents it from being
overwritten now going through the left
side of that go safe here has a mini
HDMI out and a micro SD card slot and as
a heads up a lot of these - camps
including this one here does recommend
buying a class 10 card with at least 8
gigabytes of data the maximum the Gosei
520 can read is up to 32 gigs so no need
to buy the 64 and just checking prices
on Amazon today just to give you guys a
heads up there about $15 online you can
click on my Amazon referral link in the
video description or at the top of this
article for updated pricing now last
year going
the right side are all your menu and
navigation buttons and before going into
the actual video test let me show you
how I personally install this at the top
of the unit and the supplied suction
cups slides in and interconnects with
each other there's not a locking
mechanism by testing this am I still in
use in g1 WH camera which has the same
connection this style works fine for my
needs and never did either brands slide
off when turning or even when
accidentally bumped the Papa Co model
actually holds a bit firmer than my old
dash cam did now there's a knob on the
right side to allow the camera to be
pivoted front and back and a very stiff
rotation left to right but after
plugging the mini-usb in the 12-volt
power cord provided is very long now you
can leave this hanging or you may be
able to run this through the headliner
then the a-pillar on the side here and
last under the glovebox my every car is
a little bit different and an attempt at
your own discretion I'm not responsible
for any of your damages but as you can
see a very clean installation on my end
here but once everything is plugged in
in the SD card is formatted it's
basically ready to go
this will start recording when you turn
on your car and stop recording when you
turn it off pretty simple set it and
forget it it's pretty standard on most
if not all dash cams now let's take a
look at the menus and see what extra
features this has and if they're worth
paying the price now there's three
different modes which are video
recording camera mode to take pictures
and playback now next are the menu
options now B 520 has the ability to
record in 2k resolution as described
earlier specifically using a 21 by 9 or
a 16 by 9 aspect ratio now showing on
screen here is a sample of a 21 by 9
first with the resolution of 2560 by
1080 now it's one of the highest if not
the highest in the industry in regards
to resolution now you do get the black
bands on the top and bottom which isn't
too relevant since most collisions
happens directly in front or from the
sides anyways and now dropping to the 16
by 9 here with a unconventional
resolution of 23:04 by 12 96 it
regardless both samples I believe will
even with a slight resolution difference
are still sharp in both instances you
can still see the license plates very
clear
and street signs here for the most part
are distinguishable now here's a quick
sample of the GoSafe at 2k resolution
vs. my g1 wh at 1080p and this would
give you an idea of what the image
quality looks like and you can determine
if there's a substantial difference or
not but you also notice the image
quality is slightly wider and the GoSafe
the 520 does offer a class-leading
146 degrees enviable width
offering visibility of any cars possibly
merging into your lane on the highway
now the last thing you want is having
the other parties say you've merged into
them and this is just me being nitpicky
as well and I don't expect dash cams to
have picture qualities like a DSLR
camera but it didn't notice the GoSafe
looks to have a bit more noise in his
image and that could very well be due to
the over sharpness in processing of the
video and keep in mind all these videos
that I'm showing you right now are
unedited now the g1 WH still provides a
great picture I think for its price but
things are smoother in texture and the
lettering I'll admit is slightly more
blurry now you can be the judge if the
1080 is enough or the 2k resolution to
be GoSafe is a must-have now show more
videos later in this review now going
back to the main menu screen here these
are self-explanatory the time setup a
voice setup just means if you want the
video to record audio while driving or
not and a built-in microphone for the
most part picks up most audio inside the
car but it's usually very faint now
here's a quick sample
and back onto the main menu here button
beep and LCD screen on or off is easy to
explain but g-sensor is a feature where
if the camera senses a sudden shock be
it a car accident or a nasty road bump
the dashcam will lock that file and
prevent it from being overwritten when
the memory card becomes full and you can
adjust the sensitivity from low to high
as well now evey exposure adjust
brightness to be recorded frequency or
refresh rates to sleeve it as where it
is language just shows to be limited to
English Chinese and French sorry no
Russian I know the Russians love their
dash cams out there motion detection is
set to OFF on default here but if you do
decide to turn this on while part any
motion that goes by the camera will
record until there's no more movement
for 60 seconds
perfect for parking lot situations just
make sure that you reverse and park in
now delayed powered off is used when you
turn off the car the camera will
continue recording for a minutes three
minutes or five minutes whichever you
choose then it turns off afterwards
now video out is either ntsc for america
and pal for most other parts of the
world and auto hide offers to hide menu
icons on the screen and last we're
brought to driving safety now these
features I normally don't see on
lower-end models but the first one up
here is calibrating now calibrating your
camera is a great tool to ensure your
video recording or image is leveled and
centered instead of guessing and moving
it on your windshield from time to time
now stopping go-sees when you have
stopped for 10 seconds say at a red
light or so and when the car in front of
you goes or pulls away that dash cam
will make an audible beep alerting you
to go now admit it's a pretty nifty
feature to have especially when I'm
checking my phone and a red light and
yeah sometimes that guy
now driving fatigue is another alarm
that reminds you to take and rest at
every half an hour or several hours
whichever you decide to choose
especially for a long trips it comes in
handy and last is a light reminder now
when the camera is in a dark area the
screen does go black and you'll hear a
beep and a string shows the headlight
icon and I'll admit I wasn't big on this
specific feature and it kept beeping and
parking decks from dark to bright areas
regardless if I had my headlights on or
not - it came up kind of bit of an
annoyance but finishing up the menu
features here the rest is just a
reminder to reformat your memory card
every so often with the filing options
who actually reformat it and very last
is finding your version info so I'm
going to leave video playing here while
discuss some final thoughts and show you
night driving now I know I did bring up
the g1 WH several times in this video I
actually made that the best dash cam
last year because of its price and what
it had to offer
now that mid $50.00 dash cam also
included loop recording 140 degree lens
and very good video quality despite it
being 1080 but as evident in this video
has proven through my test here the
GoSafe 520 does i'll perform the g1 wh
in several areas specifically the
resolution and wideness now I'm sure the
price tag and the ghost save is largely
due to the technology offered to K
reporting and not to mention those
driving safety features as well now I
believe in the end the consumer can't go
wrong with this product from Papago it's
a good quality product but you do have
to ask yourself is the price of
admission worth it to you let me know
your thoughts in the comment section
below if this video did help you in any
way be sure to add me gems review room
