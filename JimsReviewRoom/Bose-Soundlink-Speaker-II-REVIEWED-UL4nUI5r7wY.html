review by Jim's review room hope
everyone's doing well out there and
thank God summer is back and hopefully
you're enjoying the return of warm
weather as much as I am here I've taken
some indoor and outdoor footage for you
and try to switch it up a bit for you
guys and hopefully you guys enjoy today
we will be looking at the Bose Soundlink
speaker 2 now portable bluetooth
speakers are starting to evolve with the
ease of portability and sound quality
now and the wireless Bose speaker system
here is no exception to quality at all
again I do want to reiterate as a
disclaimer as with my other speaker
reviews I'm not an audiophile and just
the average consumer I just love good
stuff so I hope this review is to your
fitting and that my experiences is
hopefully relatable to yours so I
personally purchased this for the sole
reason of having music or noise in
general when I get up in the morning as
you can see in this video here and I
place this in the bathroom to play
either The Morning News or Pandora
YouTube and 'likes
when I'm getting ready and just
yesterday I didn't use it at a backyard
barbecue and it was great just to have
outdoor music playing so let's get
started here I purchased this speaker
for $299 about a month ago and they had
been playing around with it since in
regards to price I've had a hard time
finding a cheaper deal from a reputable
retailer both online and in-store so
pretty much in both fashion it's kind of
hard to find a deal on this speaker so
if you can't find one best of luck to
you and props to you I purchased the
black finish with the dark gray nylon
covering the finish itself is a very
sleek clean and a really modern
sophisticated feel the speaker weighs in
a little under three pounds and it's a
very nice solid feel though this speaker
feels like it's well built and it's a
durable product the only thing I can
really compare the sense of weight to is
holding an iPhone 4s and then holding an
iPhone 5 the iPhone 4 just feels a
little bit more solid if that makes
sense but in the end it's very
manageable to lug around and place in a
bag if you have a book bag or in this
case have my girlfriend putting it into
her bag here or holding it in your hand
to carry connectivity is as easy as you
can get I've used an iPad and the Droid
RAZR MAXX and both were flawless during
setup and you only need to do it once
simply press and hold the Bluetooth
button and the speaker's tap pan off
for three seconds as you see here in the
video and it becomes or goes into
discovery mode and then you choose the
Soundlink mobile speaker - from your
source device I've already done so on my
iPad here but if you're doing it for the
first time you have to put in the
pairing code which is zero zero zero
zero and that's it next time you need to
sync the item just press the Bluetooth
button on the speaker again itself and
you'll connect it to your phone or
device now both claims to memorize up to
six devices and there's no need to
connect any wire to the speaker itself
for connectivity now the range of this
speaker is very good my house is
approximately about 2,400 square feet
again bose claims 30 feet of range in
connectivity and i went all the way
downstairs on the opposite aside of
opposite side of my house and it still
connects flawlessly and that's through
many walls or several walls and also
through the flooring of the second floor
itself and again no loss now I have to
admit prior to buying this Bose speaker
I was a little bit biased and I honestly
thought Bose was a little bit overrated
and I'm sorry for saying that however
this speaker blows the other speakers
out the water in quality and it does
change me in the direction that Bose is
a great product and maybe it is worth
the price I don't know about the other
speakers but this one is darn good so I
did listen to the big Jambox by jawbone
and these Sony Bluetooth speaker as well
now those two yielded a higher pitch
more of a whiny sound and distortion was
evident at high value compared to this
Bose speaker now to sound like itself
it's a warm sound it's much more
fulfilling in my opinion it feels as
though there's just more depth to the
sounds of from this speaker and
shockingly the bass is amazing from a
small package the post does come with
passive firing speakers on the back
panel and if you put this on the corner
of the room you'll be amazed at the bass
that you'd hear from again this small
little package the battery life is OK
for my uses I have the Morning News play
and I frequently news Pandor when
getting ready in the morning now I do
use this boast nearly every morning for
about an hour and hour and a half or so
and I'd noticed that I do have to
recharge the battery every five to six
days so it's not too bad but most claims
up to eight hours and of course
that's dependent on how loud and use the
system I do keep the VAM about 75
percent or so up and certainly that's
joining the battery faster the unit
itself does have a light that goes green
yellow then red to indicate how much
better life is remaining one of the
flaws I did notice that there was no
volume indicator again that detrimental
but it would be nice to have one of
those on the unit itself Yoona does come
with the power adapter and takes
approximately two and a half to three
hours to fully charge
lastly the unit does have an auxiliary
port to physically connect other devices
such as a mp3 player or portable DVD
player etc the unit does have also a
micro USB port however it is only used
for servicing so overall this speakers
performance and features is definitely
not good but great for general music
listening in a wide variety of settings
bringing to the park an outdoor barbecue
have music in a room that you don't have
speakers in bedroom bathroom wherever
and it all sounds great in those
settings I personally don't think you'll
be disappointed whatsoever the sound
quality so I hope you guys enjoyed this
