room boasts released two new models the
smaller revolve and what I have here in
this review is the revolve plus I
personally pay for this at the retail
price of 300 while the smaller version
it comes in at $200 as always I'll place
my Amazon affiliate links in the video
description below click on my links and
they'll give you the most updated prices
in real time you never know when these
things might go on sale so without
further ado my video is here to help you
make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's review room the first
thing that you'll notice is how compact
this speaker is considering this is
price in the range of large bluetooth
speakers at $300 it's smaller than the
competitors though the UE mega boom and
of course the JBL extreme so portability
would be more ideal here the revolved
plus model includes a carrying handle
which I would have expected it to be a
little bit more elastic but it still
serves its purpose though now you don't
get this on the smaller revolved model
so just be aware of that in addition
Bose has responded to the competition by
offering several rugged features their
evolve plus is bump resistant if you
accidentally knock this over let it fall
on the ground as I've tested myself the
speaker is perfectly fine in addition
the speaker is now ipx4 certified it
cannot be submerged underwater Provos
but the ipx4 rating does allow this to
be caught in the rain or splashed on so
definitely take that into consideration
before buying if you don't think you're
going to have this fall into the pool
you'll be perfectly fine now I'm taking
a look at the top you have your on and
off button and I absolutely love this
feature here when you do turn it on the
voice prompt gives you the percentage of
battery remaining battery 90% now moving
to the left is bluetooth pairing which
most claims up to 30 linear feet is
achievable I was able to get 40 liter
feet with no issues on the other side is
a volume up and down and in the middle
is the action button to answer phone
calls and use this just like a
speakerphone when a call comes in and
with that same action button when music
is going you can tap that to pause and
play or
skip and go back on your songs holding
this button down though will activate
Google now or Siri whichever device or
phone that you have connected through
this speaker now moving over to the far
right you have your input selection here
besides Bluetooth you can listen to
audio with a 3.5 millimeter wire or a
micro USB cord that's connected to your
PC and if it's connected to your
computer while listening to audio this
speaker will charge now as always with
all my bluetooth speaker battery test I
left this on at 50% BOM and was able to
achieve 10 hours and 12 minutes until
the battery died now it's nothing
stellar as one older bluetooth speakers
at this price range are getting around
already 15 to 16 hours and to my actual
test results wasn't close to the
possible 16 hours that Bose was claiming
now recharging from a dead battery to
full here did take about 4 hours to do
so the very last physical feature here
before I talk about these 360-degree
audio performance is NFC with a near
field communication enabled phone you
can tap right on that boast logo and the
phone will pair for you no need to go
through your Bluetooth settings so till
the moment that you've been waiting for
hear hears this sound test I'll play
several songs for you guys and then I'll
give you my verdict afterwards
are you talking to code no reason why
you got me on hold on me I knew
something wasn't right
you lift that one all I wanna do is get
to know you Easter Western or to suffer
all your but I did you get
and there you have it folks
audio recorded on my end and then play
through your speakers are not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence in
my review here now first things first
bass quality on this thing is thumping
it's booming at times and has Authority
more likely associated with a bass boost
it's sound signature it doesn't hit sub
bass it doesn't hit JBL extreme
territory but it's more impressive than
the UE mega boom it doesn't distort the
bass is very much within reason with the
rest of the audio frequencies and I'm
sure most average consumers will enjoy
this as for the mid-range where most of
the vocals and where you hear most
musical instruments they do well they're
evolved plus keeps it balanced with not
being bright or to Ford now I would
probably prefer a little bit more formas
in general my personal taste there but
overall the mid-range is still very
clean and very easy to listen to without
any listening fatigue the same for the
high frequencies as well or snare drums
and cymbal crashes would occur there is
roll-off to keep it from going overboard
yet both keeps it with a balanced sound
signature once again that's not too
recessed and not too sharp or tingey
overall the revolve plus provides in my
opinion a very good quality sound
signature now if you do turn this up to
maximum volume which is loud for sure
you do have some of the low range bass
frequencies drowning out or overcoming
some of the vocals though it's not bad
at all it is something that I did notice
but at the end of the day the average
consumer again would find us within
reason and again that's only at maximum
volume now if I were to compare this
directly with the Bose Soundlink 3 the
revolve plus does lose some soundstage
some fidelity and some audio separation
but because of this design the revolves
speakers do give off full 360 degrees
sound you place this in the middle of
the room and you're getting sound no
matter where you walk it's quite
satisfying now for a size of a mid-range
Bluetooth speaker this is still able to
fill up a large room and if you have 2
of these speakers with the Bose Connect
app or a combination of physical buttons
you can either enable a party mode or
stereo mode the former offers two of
these Bose speakers to play and sync and
the latter provides left and right audio
separation now they both app itself
comes in handy for enabling this feature
and checking your better levels manually
syncing to revolve to other device
is through the app here better than that
there's no equalizer or sound profiles
so in the end here comparing apples to
apples comparing this to other portable
360-degree sounding Bluetooth speakers
it sounds very good if not the best the
only negatives though and I would ask
myself this if I was on the fence of
buying do I need a speaker that is
submersible at the pool do I need a
speaker that is even more rugged in or
do I need something with better better
in life I would say answer those
questions and I'm sure you'll be in the
right direction so guys leave a comment
down below let me know what you guys
think would this be something that you
would buy or is JBL and ue the way to go
