review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the acer c720 and the one
i have here is the 199 dollar version
that comes with two gigs of ram while
the other model comes with four gigs and
priced $50 more and instead of
explaining in detail on every Chromebook
review that I do if you're not too
familiar with Chromebooks as just
watching my video
what's a Chromebook at my channel or
clicking this video if you're watching
this on your desktop so without further
adieu we'll get started
now Chromebooks are indeed known for
their low price but also for their
slimness and lightweight chassis now the
entire unit is made of plastic with hard
plastic on the bottom making this one
the more rigid Chromebooks available now
much more sturdy than my recent review
of a Samsung Chromebook itself now
opening closing the lid showed very
minimal to no signs of flex overall when
holding and working with the Acer it's
been a very well-built machine that
doesn't feel cheap the measurements are
on the screen right now with the unit
being 11.3 inches wide eight inches deep
and only 0.8 inches thick with the lid
closed and it weighs in at 2.76 pounds
bring this a lightweight notebook to
work with and carry no connectivity is
on par with Chromebooks on the market
there's no connections on the front or
the rear of the Chromebook but on the
right side does include a USB 2.0 port
with a built-in SD card reader while
rotating to the left here yields a
three-and-a-half millimeter microphone
headset combination port the newest USB
standard which is USB 3.0 and an HDMI
port is available to connect your TV or
monitor and lastly is the hole to plug
in the supply AC power cord the last
physical feature is the built-in webcam
which like most Chromebooks has VGA
quality not an older technology and as
you can see on the screen it isn't the
most crisp image available but do keep
in mind Chromebooks are a budget laptop
now in regards to screen size Acer like
most other Chromebooks comes with a 11
and a half inch screen with a resolution
of 1366 by 768 now the resolution is
actually on par with other low to mid
grade laptops with the same resolution
not only when you start to hit around
the $100 price point is when you do see
a higher resolution for more crisp and
detailed images and lettering now as for
contrast for a budget-conscious lat
the colors are fine and is enough to
have an enjoyable experience while
watching movies and lastly the screen
itself is a matte finish so there's
minimized glare and that's a plus there
now moving on internally Chromebooks in
general uses low power consumption
processors in this case a certain uses
the latest Intel Celeron processor
running at one point four gigahertz
dual-core processor with 2 gigs of RAM
on board but I do recommend spending
that additional $50 I mentioned earlier
to get the 4 gig version that's of
course if it's available in your area
now the 2 gig version runs perfectly
fine but for only $50 more you might as
well get a little bit more multitasking
performance with that extra RAM now also
available is a 16 gigabyte solid state
hard drive which means a very fast
performing hard drive in general with
minimal boot up time actually acer
claims a 7 second boot up time and i've
confirmed it with a stopwatch
then I personally use SSDs and all my
personal computers as well
now other notable features are wireless
a/b gmm connections with Bluetooth
connectivity for all your Bluetooth
enabled devices and the battery claims
up to eight and a half hours of use
however during my test applying Netflix
movies YouTube videos and a mixing use
of web browsing in between as well of
course I was able to obtain about seven
and a half hours seven hours seven half
hours of news now regarding the Asus
performance my tests yielded perfectly
fine for everyday casual use these new
processors do make normal actions feel
smooth and perform as it should
compared to the older generation
Chromebooks now pulling up email going
onto Facebook browsing photos went
without a hitch
watching youtube videos in high
definition wasn't a problem at all and
of course in that flex ran smooth not as
for gaming I do not recommend the
Chromebook at all although some games
can be found in the Google store some
were just not compatible with Chromebook
and required Windows and something
didn't work as well because they
required Java now games that were to be
found and playable were not any 3d
heavy-hitting blockbuster titles like
minecraft or asphalt 8 just a name to up
top my head now more two-dimensional
games were found and they ran perfectly
fine games like Angry Birds and cut the
rope maybe flappy wings or flappy bird
I'm sorry but even more power demanding
games that are still
two dimensional but they're you know
involve a little bit more physics like
happy wheels when you know pretty decent
at 30 frames per second I'm not sure if
you notice so far but every application
that I opened so far has been opened in
a web browser
now Google doesn't run on programs but
everything is web driven and this being
a Chromebook developed by Google there's
nearly if not all of Google services
available we're speaking of Google
Hangouts Google Docs Google Maps Gmail
Google Drive etc you name it now one of
the limitations that the operating
software is again not being able to use
programs that you would normally install
if you're not too familiar with
Chromebook and how it works I highly
suggest again watching my video called
what is Chromebook and it explains the
Chromebooks operating software and what
it offers so to wrap things up the Acer
c720 Chromebook price alone is a huge
selling point at only 199 dollars making
this the cheapest yet one of the newest
Chromebooks as of this review now slim
and simple profile compared to more
traditional laptops and ACS battery life
is on a top tier of Chromebooks and
laptops alike
the only downfalls I can see is of
course the gaming department or in
general anything too demanding but I
believe if you expect crumble to do the
basics Chromebook will work out for you
so hope this review helped you out in
