review room today we're looking at one
of the most underrated tools you can
have in your home or even at the gym now
specifically this product but have
wheels in general now I reviewed the
golden gym and will very simple and
price at just ten dollars the AB cover
from perfect and today I'm testing the
Iron Gym speed ABS now I personally paid
twenty nine dollars for this and you're
right it's really on the pricey side for
an AB wheel considering you can use a
barbell and a small weighted plate but
considering that many people have those
in their own homes this might be worth
it so without further ado welcome to
Jim's review before starting the review
one way to measure your core strength is
attempting to do a plank as long as you
can extend your legs and keep your body
straight with elbows bent at about 90
degrees and hold that position now per
fitness magazines and health websites
the average is about a minute above that
you're doing really great and two
minutes or more you're just an animal
and obviously you're watching this give
it a try yourself and post your times
below in the comment section really
curious to see what everyone's getting
now for me I was not able to beat my
time from the last video and was able to
get around that three and a half minute
mark once again a great number in my
opinion but I was god I was dying and
sore at the end there but what's great
about AB wheels and getting back on
topic here they work and strengthen your
core a vital muscle group that helps
with everyday movements like something
simple as opening a jar to improving
your deadlift posture in the gym now
these AB wheels in general will not get
you ripped but it will improve your
stability in some of the lower abs more
notably in the middle and upper ab areas
including your side ABS and serratus
muscles as well now compound movements
are also conducted with your arms being
used in legs balancing your body but the
area you'll be most sortin definitely
are the abs as shown in the introduction
these handles are detachable as well and
removed with a quick release button the
handle themselves are wide and offers
slight grip for an additional sense of
security but when compared to the ab
cover the competition is indeed just
plastic with no rubber grips but felt as
though the handle was
lighter and also more contoured the iron
Jim still felt very good in the hands
but the perfect brain offered slightly
more stability now you won't be able to
tell the difference unless you tried
both yourself
but again the iron Jim is perfectly fine
now this thing looks and feels more
rugged than what the pictures show it's
a nice fat rubber tire right down the
middle with tons of grip looking nearly
identical to a motorcycle tire but as
the warning label states it's only to be
used on non-slip surfaces and the
warning label states it's only to be
used for those who are 299 pounds or
less and from my experience and testing
this worked out very well and it feels
to work better than the ab cover now
inside the wheel itself these Springs
that winds up and provides slight
resistance when going down or forward
here when you go back up the springs
actually attempt to uncoil themselves
and in turn provides very slight or
subtle assistance again when going back
up but from real-world testing just like
the AB Carver I didn't feel any
assistance at all and it felt identical
when I went down as it was when going
back up but the iron gym in my opinion
just feels a slightly more rugged and
solid in general the way the Coles wound
up inside and whatnot but while
performing these exercises I can feel my
hamstrings attempting to keep my body
balanced my entire abdominal area
tightening in my forearms and triceps
stiffening to stay balanced now there's
several other exercises you can perform
with an AB wheel by being a little bit
more creative here here's one very
simple alternative just by going side to
side it really works your serratus
muscles very well offering a lot of
stretching and balancing on those muscle
groups now the following morning I did
feel it also on the side ABS as well as
being very sore so overall it's very
well built in my opinion slightly better
than the competition from my experience
feels more solid more grip on the rubber
but I'll mitt the amp covers handles
were wider and just molded to the hand a
bit better despite them being all
plastic now either or you can't go wrong
with either one and this ad will does
work it works well now compared to those
super cheap models around ten dollars or
so just like the Gold's Gym AB will
those work perfectly fine but if you
want a little bit more stability and
better grips less strain on the wrist as
these are more contoured these are the
way to go there's definitely a market
out there for these more expensive
designs so hope this video helped you in
some way if you like my work add me gyms
review
and to Facebook Twitter Instagram or
Google+ as I normally post updates on
items I'm currently testing actually
before and put them on the website again
