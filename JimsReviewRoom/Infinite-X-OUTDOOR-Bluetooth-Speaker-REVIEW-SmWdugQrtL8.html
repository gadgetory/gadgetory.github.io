room in my efforts to look for some of
the best bang for your buck speakers on
the market for you guys I ran across
this from orange bolt it's the infinite
X as an outdoor speaker being waterproof
dustproof and offering some additional
features that some other speakers simply
don't have there's a charge out port
built-in LED light for outdoor use and
lasts a microSD card slot
now I got this off Amazon for $70 but
you can always click on my links in the
video description below
once you click them they can give you
the most updated prices for today so
without further ado welcome everyone to
Jim's review room
you
going over the physical features this is
about the same size as the JBL flip 3
for portability purposes it's coming in
around 550 grams or 1.4 pounds making
the dimensions and the weight fall into
these small speaker category on the
outside here there's this rubber or
silicone like jacket for added grip and
also used to protect the speaker from
drops and shock now dropping this on the
asphalt several times here from my test
the speaker is surely protected here and
it does continue to work
the only issue though I wish this was
completely sealed as if you were at the
beach or some sand or maybe some dirt in
general can get behind the protective
jacket itself now this vicar is ipx4
rated meaning this is only splash proof
now it's not entirely waterproof you
can't submerge this as some consumers
may not be aware of the IP ratings now
moving on to the physical buttons
there's your power on top skipping and
going back on songs here and there's
also your volume buttons as well now the
only issue with this you have to hold it
down for volume to change and this
surely does throw some people off that
would accidentally skip a song instead
now pause and play is next and lastly
lightning bolt icon press this once you
can see how much better life is
remaining now a long press here will
turn on the LED lights and I've only had
a chance to experience an LED light and
one other outdoor speakers from our
cheer it was quite a horrible experience
as it was so dim though with the
infinite X it does shine brighter and
decent if you're in pitch-black
situations it's not the brightest I'll
admit that but I guess it is something
in the end now if you still have better
life on your phone your phone will for
sure
shine much brighter now rotating to the
back there is a sealed flap exposing a
USB port for charging your device's a 3
and 1/2 millimeter port on the right a
micro SD card slot to have music played
directly from the card instead of using
bluetooth here and last to the left is a
micro USB port for charging the infinite
X a better life is claimed to be up to a
crazy high 30 hours which is great I did
test this at full volume from the
morning till night time here and I was
able to get about 10 hours and 12
minutes of use which is good for a small
bluetooth speaker but getting close to
that 30 hour of playtime I'm assuming
this has to be a very low value and now
last but not least here regarding
Bluetooth range I did walk up to 40
linear feet with this signal going
through several walls here at the house
and the
floor ceiling that Pluto signal worked
perfectly fine so onto the sound test
here I play several songs for you guys
and then I'll give you my verdict
afterwards
here's Eleni um's fortress featuring
Johnny for Torah
and there you have it folks the infinite
axe does sound like a comparable small
bluetooth speaker and is able to do well
for personal and small room listening
for medium and larger sized rooms
there's still audio of course but it's
not as immersive or really meant for
entertaining keep in mind there's two
openings for audio to escape there's one
located to the top and there's a base
port on the bottom so you do have full
360 degrees sound for even distribution
of audio now in turn though there's no
left and right stereo separation so just
the heads I found that by going into
base here there's a little bit of bass
but not as evident or close to the JBL
flip 3 but it is more so than the ue
roll 2 though now it's not deep and
would be on the lighter side for even
the average consumer but the important
thing to me here
there's no distortion a little lower and
now the mids are decent with clear audio
and its presence being pushed forward
though on the other hand at higher
volumes only on a very few select songs
here you can hear the higher frequencies
you drone out the mid-range or the
vocals just a bit here and there's this
as ever-so-slightly s sounding from
snares cymbal crashes and from EDM where
those higher pitched synthesized notes
the high frequencies does drone out or
become distorted a little bit again when
volume
at maximum so in the end here indeed
it's rugged the better life is very good
and the features it's nice to have the
charge out port and some kind of light
for emergencies but I didn't like the
fact that I had to hold down the buttons
to adjust volume as most other speakers
are the other way around you just tap it
to basically have it go up or down and
the audio performance is good but on a
few occasions again at loud levels or
maximum they do lose a slight clarity
now for $70 and this thing only played
music I would say there's better quality
out there but with all the other
features this includes it does somewhat
justify the price and also its
shortcomings so that's it for this
review here and like and subscribe if
you haven't done so already and be sure
to follow me on Facebook Twitter or
Instagram all the addresses or on your
screen right now and also in the
description hope you guys are doing good
you guys take care and I'll see you in
the next one bye
