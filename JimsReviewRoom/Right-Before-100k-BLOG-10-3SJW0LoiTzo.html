performs that's been doing pretty good
actually regarding heart rate tracking
and i am wearing my chest strap here
from polar I don't not going to lift up
my shirt to show you guys obviously but
using that to test the wrist trackers
and see how accurate the heart rate
tracking is and some time these wrist
trackers there
they're hit or miss something some dude
does better than others obviously but
sometimes you get sum total goods but
and that's what I'll be doing for today

me to the point here about the giveaway

instructions are all in there but one
other thing here I want to give you guys
a heads up on like I said earlier i am
partnering with somebody sebastian
reached out to me a little over a year
ago and we've known each other since and
he never came across as trying to get to
know me for from for business purposes
and I totally respect that he has liked
my videos he has retweeted you know some
of my tweets and my videos he has shared
my videos and never asked for anything
in return um I never asked him to do any
of this either obviously but I I totally
respect that from person from another
person that runs his own business and
for him just to say just casually say
hey man you make good stuff and he liked
it and shared it on his own he didn't
have to do is what I'm saying so I want
to give it back to him honestly and he
does make good content I would not i
would not partner with somebody and
refer you guys there's somebody that I
didn't think made good
sent you know follow him and then just
see to see what he's all about but he
said total totally respectable guy and
I'm saying that surely from the part of
my heart like I don't collab with
anybody this is my first time doing so
but I'm doing so with him for a reason
is because he is a very very respectable
person at least to me that is but again
his name is Sebastian he's at text
century I'll put a link in the video
description below he is also doing a
giveaway he's giving another bluetooth
speaker and a backlit aluminum
illuminated keyboard I believe but he
said his channel has all the information

gleam i'll give away you would have to
subscribe to my channel his as well to
be you know to participate in the
giveaway so show a little bit love if
