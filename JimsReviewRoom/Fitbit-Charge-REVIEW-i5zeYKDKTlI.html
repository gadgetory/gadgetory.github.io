review room now last year I had the
opportunity to review the Fitbit force
and shortly doing so a good handful of
people reported an allergic reaction
causing Fitbit to do a voluntary recall
now whole year had gone by and fit that
really stayed quiet with no
announcements or even hints that they
were making a replacement actually until
recently
now Fitbit has announced three new bands
are coming to the market and a charge I
have here seems to be for sure their
replacements now out of the three the
charge is the base model but for most
people looking for a band this might be
just enough so without further ado
welcome to another review I'll be doing
a review on all three of their bands so
definitely check out my channel for the
charge HR in the surge which should be
available early of 2015 now like all my
reviews we'll start with the physical
aspects first instead of fitbit's
previous designs which were smooth
silicone bands Fitbit now introduced
this very welcoming texture design
giving a bit of resistance when you
touch it almost feeling like rubber but
the texture almost feels as though it's
massaging your fingers once you climb it
along and surprisingly it barely
collects any dust as the texture and
design suggests otherwise and wearing
the band has been as comfortable as
wearing a watch and coincidentally I was
able to test the locking quality by
wearing the small version here 24/7 and
never once did the band undo on me again
this is why wearing it very fitted that
a glass front doesn't appear to scratch
and has remained pretty durable and as
you can see for comparison purposes and
aside there are some scratches and scuff
marks it's not a huge flaw that would
affect the decision to buy but just want
to point that out that the front glass
or plastic here does pretty much stay
intact and last the band does come in
several different colors which can be
found in fitbit's websites but you can
beat a judge and how this band looks in
general it's been very comfortable for
both casual environments and during work
when placing your hands on a desk and of
course during workouts when you may bend
your hand back here for certain lifts
again no problems whatsoever something
you should look into and any band that
you may intend and by
we're now going into the band's display
first up is the time with the total
steps being next and estimated distance
to follow with calories burned next
flights of stairs climbed is next and
then you basically go back to showing
the time now if you hold down the action
button this starts a stopwatch feature
which may be useful to you with the
aforementioned data being shown now the
only thing I saw lacking with this is
after you do finish and stop the clock
in the app there isn't any data
distinguishing the information just
obtained there's no recording that I
could find on that timed activity the
data is just added to your total steps
calories burned estimated distance etc
but going into the app here now just to
show you what it looks like here
fitbit's familiar app returns which I
really enjoy using it's one of the
easiest apps and use visually seen your
data in a glance now starting with the
top just like the band here you have
your steps estimated distance calories
burned flights of stairs climbed and
whatnot and the band is active minutes
for moments you've been more vigorously
moving and before proceeding further
down all the items mentioned so far and
I'll show you here can be broken down
once you tap on each category a bar
graph showing your active and not so
active movements are shown but to get a
better visual tapping on the expand
button will show the time and offer data
and you can compare on a weekly monthly
and yearly basis which is great now
backing out here from the expanded
screen again you can see your numbers
compared on a day-to-day basis and as
stated this is visible on all the
categories I've listed so far now on the
right side in gray are your daily goals
which you can personally customize by
holding down each category then clicking
on edit goal now the only thing I see
missing here that I really wished Fitbit
included was Auto goal or smart goal is
what they call it in which over time the
band sees your activity level and
automatically adjusts to keep you
pushing or it lowers your goal actually
to make it more attainable all by
learning your habits over time and you
currently see this with the Garmin view
of smart band which I think eventually
all new bands is coming out there should
strive to implement again it's not a
deal breaker at all but it would have
been nice for Fitbit to include this
feature now moving down here below for
the avid runners out there you can track
your workouts by using your phone's GPS
when you go out for a jog enabling
tracking will have Fitbit recorded trail
on a map and all the data associated
with it but a feature I really enjoy is
if you have any ear buds you can turn on
audio cues from the menu and Fitbit will
advise your statistics at every minute
or mile that you choose now the voice
comes on on your phone or earbuds again
and advises you your distance time then
even pace preventing the need to stop
and pull out your phone to read the data
and then going back one screen here the
data over time can be kept on your
calendar and reviewed for comparative
purposes and then backing out to the
very main page here you can track your
weight by entering in your measurements
daily in addition if you are able to
measure your body fat as well your body
fat percentage that is Fitbit allows
this to be recorded as well and compared
with oneself
now moving on to the next feature here
sleep mode which tells you right away
how much sleep you've had the previous
night and tapping on it breaks it down a
bit further in the out part it doesn't
show you a daily breakdown numerically
below the graphic as it did with the
previous mentioned data but like the
other data you can click to expand and
break down the night's rest
with determining when you were Restless
or tossing around versus being awake now
backing all the way out again a food
lock is provided for calorie intake by
manually entering in your food and
although this feature is provided where
other bands don't it's not as deep or as
intuitive as Jawbone's now with jawbone
you can scan the back of a package UPC
code and it will automatically import
your food data into the app naming the
meal and answering all the data like
calories trans fats sugars and salts
using MyFitnessPal the very popular food
locking app would appear to be easier to
accurate than using fitbit's though and
doing a bit of research here it shows
Fitbit data is able to be transferred to
mine Fitness Pal app and a few other
apps as well but none of the apps can
transmit data to fitbit's and if that
makes sense you can't go backwards you
can say and the very last health aspect
here is water intake which is very
important as I barely drink enough in a
day you can get a mug or a water bottle
at a certain size and after finishing
each bottle click the log it button and
it will keep a record for you it's
pretty simple and highly beneficial and
now this leads us through the non health
aspects of the band which sometimes
makes or breaks a purchase decision for
some people click
on a tapleft provides summer options and
settings to take advantage of first up
is friends allowing you to add random
people that are also using fitbit
products and then when you can compete
and compare with others with
leaderboards and progress reports it's
one way to motivate people when they see
other people doing as well or better a
friends option clearly optional is
always a plus now next up here are
challenges activating one of these and
it basically initiates a challenge for
yourself and also that your group of
friends here and last are your devices
you have associated with this phone and
app again pretty much self-explanatory
and please feel free to pause the video
if I'm going through these parts a
little bit too fast here and if you're
interested in seeing them now moving on
to the next area here and into your
settings basically it's your profile
that you can change it well you can
change your name age weight height etc
with your units being able to change to
kilometers and also kilograms for
distance and weight respectively
now one feature that surprisingly many
people ask me are the alarms more people
use this than what I expected
now with this alarm this will silently
wake you up by offering a pretty strong
vibration to the wrist when it goes off
and for the basics you can set up a
one-time alarm but more beneficial here
for those who have a consistent work
schedule you can set up which days for
it to go off for example just Monday
through Fridays or just weekends only
it's a great feature to have when you
don't want to wake up your spouse or
someone around you and the very last
feature here is caller ID when someone
calls in the phone number will scroll
through and the rest prior to picking up
and unfortunately notifications or
messages do not show up on the band
so overall after testing and playing
around with this the battery life
claimed is up to seven days per Fitbit
and from my testing the band itself
lasted a full six days and approximately
18 hours of use and it's probably a
little bit less because I did
continually check and click on the band
here it's still better than the industry
average of just five days and I believe
with the app here it's really robust
compared to a lot of the competitors out
there at this price range though it's so
simple to use it's easy to read and
think it's one reason why Fitbit is the
number one company in regards to
activity trackers now again keep in mind
that price though a lot of other bands
do offer more features but their
starting price point usually is about
150 even up to 170 dollars and beyond
and a lot of the features that I
mentioned earlier in this review that
were not available here on the Fitbit
again those are on the more expensive
bands again but the very analytical data
the audio cue is while jogging and be
very comfortable and stylish band that
easily substitutes as a watch really
other strong selling points now if
you're looking for a general tracker for
sure this is the one that you should
strongly consider so if you like my
style be sure to add me on Facebook
Twitter or Google+ as every little bit
helps and bring you more content like
this and you also find some behind the
scenes pictures on what I do for a
living here and like I said I'll also be
purchasing the job on up 3 the Microsoft
band that's coming out basis peak so I
have a couple more bands coming out and
of course the remaining two Fitbit
products that are coming out early up
2015
