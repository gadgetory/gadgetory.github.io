amazing pomp trees to show you guys what
I've been testing the past several days
it's the Bose quiet comfort 25 the
follow-up to the very successful very
well praised QC 15 which were released
way back in August of 2009 accused e25
retails for two hundred and ninety nine
dollars at the time this video and
although some might think they're
expensive
well since 2009 premium headphones are
really hitting the market around this
price range and people are buying it's
almost the norm now with premium
headphones so sit back relax and hope
you enjoy this video represents you the
qc25 from Bose going over its physical
features first they're definitely a
departure to the more sophisticated look
on the old model the QC 15s the headband
and self now features Alcantara which is
synthetic suede normally found in exotic
supercars and some luxury automobiles as
well the very top is lined with a linen
almost like a very thin denim material
but a little bit of a cushion to not
make the qc25 feel so harsh when you
pick it up now we're looking at all
plastic construction except for the
metal hinges and the headband itself
very similar to the older model the QC
15s came in silver with chrome accents
in which I believe made it only look
aesthetically more solid from the
factory the qc25 s comes in matte black
with the ear cups being a dark grey with
a slate blue like color accent and from
the factory they also come in white with
tan padding similar to that of these
Samsung over headphones I reviewed a few
weeks back and of course styling is
subjective and you can be the ones to
judge now keep in mind this time Bose is
offering for an additional fee you can
customize the color of your headphones
if you choose to do so now for me
personally they still look good in my
opinion and they are still very sturdy
rugged and very well built with no
creaks or unwanted flex but with that
being said I feel Bose has stepped down
a notch in making this look less premium
more high-end you can say and it might
be a smart move on
is behalf attracting a bigger audience
and not too much of a focus on the
business professionals that in regards
to adjustments and wearability which is
very important these are the lightest
premium headphones that I've tested so
far they weigh in at just a hundred and
ninety two grams or six point eight
ounces and it's one of the first things
that you'll notice when picking these up
but wearing these have been a dream as
most other headphones or headsets that
have tested so far are in the mid to
high 200 gram range but more my comfort
test a little bit later
now the ear cups themselves do swivel at
90 degrees forward and only about five
degrees back but it's ranges just enough
for most people if not everyone the band
itself again shows how much quality is
put into these as I can almost flex
these perfectly horizontal adjusting the
headphones it has been very easy to do
and it holds very well I wouldn't expect
the band to accidentally shorten or
lengthen if accidentally bumped which
can be an issue on some of the brand's
so be sure to test that out as most
people forget that when they're shopping
for a new pair and last are the ear cup
pads themselves which at first I thought
was too thin and wouldn't be able to
support anyone wearing these for
extended periods of time but for my
comfort test after wearing these for
four hours straight testing audio and
never once felt wearing fatigue around
the ears or on the crown of my head at
times I almost forget that I'm wearing
these all together there's not too much
pressure at the jawline either
and despite moving away from the leather
in the old model this new design and
material actually feels more comfortable
surprisingly especially when wearing
these long turn over all these are
ridiculously comfortable and very ideal
for long flights train rides into the
city or down to catching movies in your
own home and before going into the sound
test some minor features to discuss both
does provide inline volume controls and
a microphone built in for your audio
listening needs but also for answering
and taking phone calls which performs
perfectly fine and as well as a headset
should but just as an FYI the wire is
only attachable to the left ear cup it's
not a big issue or anything like that
but just something to be aware about as
some other headsets you can connect on
either side now with the qc25
both engineer the ear cups who now fold
in allowing for both to offer a smaller
case for stowing and traveling and on
the outside it's made of this leather
material with the back having a neoprene
sleeve for storing items and accessories
now unzipping and opening the inside its
felt lined with the headphones embossed
right into the backing which is a nice
touch a triple-a battery is provided
which is used to power the active
noise-cancelling feature which will test
shortly and also included is a flight
adapter for those in-flight
entertainment chairs that requires two
prongs
the only thing missing on this compared
to the old model there used to be a
pocket inside to hold my wires or any
other miscellaneous items but that's
okay as I very much prefer these smaller
footprints but now going into its sound
quality first and then it's noise
canceling performance the audio quality
is very good now perfect or the best
that I've heard but the qc25 s do sit
very high in the pedestal you can say
these headphones don't give off any
distortion in all ranges where there'd
be bass mids and highs all levels of
audio is very balanced and there's
barely any audio fields dominating the
other vocals are clear and the beats hit
very clean when you have turned on the
built-in active EQ or equalizer both
automatically adjust these levels
seamlessly through external and internal
microphones to improve acoustics which
is noticeable when you do turn it on and
the switch is on the right side ear cup
over all these I believe are great for
artists like Sam Smith John Legend
Justin Timberlake or Bastille but just
so you guys know where I'm coming from I
favor a bit more balanced over dominant
bass but I personally wish there was
just a little bit more bass though in
general for the qc25 now when switching
back and forth with the current
generation in the old model I noticed
the QC 15s was just slightly more deep
and resonating a bit more based on the
qc25 s I think would have other genres
be more appreciated as well and I'm
talking about genres in hip hop rap and
some pop songs to the likes of currently
hot in the billboards Biggie Azalea
Nicki Minaj and other beat heavy artists
it's not bad and I want to emphasize
that it's
bad at all but a slight bumping bass I
don't think would have hurt or impacted
other genres electronic dance music
house techno setter which is my favorite
category does well the crisp clear
synthesized sounds but since EDM isn't
to sub bass heavy it still does well in
my opinion and last I usually listen at
about 60 to 65% volume on other headsets
and that's a comfortable level for me
with the qc25 s I notice I had to bump
it up a little bit to around 75% volume
for enjoyable and comfortable experience
even at 100% it was still listenable and
I wouldn't say I was tolerating the loud
audio overall it's clear accurate in my
opinion very easy to listen to without
my ears ringing or droning after several
hours of straight news and in the end
this makes for a very enjoyable
experience and I also notice after the
fourth hour of breaking these in the
bass did become a little bit better but
by the end if you're looking for a bit
more bass I would have to say listen to
these there might just be enough but I
think if you're mainly listening to
hip-hop and rap you may want to find
something that may hit a little bit
harder but going to wear these
headphones really shine is the noise
canceling feature I have never had this
experience or this quality of noise
canceling performance except for being
at the racetrack with hearing protection
in ear muffs when the active
noise-cancelling is on and the music is
playing around 65 to 70 percent most
sounds are gone it's almost like a
feeling I never experienced before it's
not the same as wearing earplugs it's
not the same as plugging your ears with
your fingers it's something that's
beyond that and this does phenomenal for
low frequencies the bass frequencies
that is out blast my home speakers and
the bass would go through the room
rattling it and when these are on nearly
all the bass is gone in my ears
and I can only feel the bass in the
chair that I'm sitting in it's an odd
experience nonetheless but this works
well and I believe it works a bit better
than a QC 15 s not marginally different
but again a bit better there's no noise
cancelling or ear protection that would
make the world a hotter percent silent
but these has to be the clothes that you
can get with consumer-grade headphones
for entertainment purposes and when I
used to fly pretty often for work I
would see working professionals with
these on but I always thought that they
were so big and clunky and why not get
ear buds but the noise canceling
technology behind this is basically
makes it worth it before I forget the
triple a battery lasts for about 35
hours of news per Bose and unlike last
generation when the battery does die the
headphones still work so overall is this
worth it again the sound is very good
not the best but the very impressive
noise cancelling feature makes it up 10
times not to mention these are crazy
lights the qc25 s are now more portable
meaning foldable and all-around I had a
very enjoyable experience now is it
worth upgrading from the QC 15s well let
me just say the QC 15s I really think
set the bar pretty high the refinement
in the QC 25 does make things more
simpler compact the comfort level
improves a bit but that thing it
improves in almost all areas but they're
all slight improvements or refinements
you can say but once again once you add
them all up and all these little things
together it really depends if you want
to spend at 300 dollars again but if you
never had a pair or noise canceling is
one of the top three priorities for sure
