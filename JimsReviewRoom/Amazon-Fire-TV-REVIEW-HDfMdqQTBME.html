welcome to another review
today we will be looking at the amazon
firetv amazon's first attempt at their
entertainment streaming device now what
makes these devices shine that allows
your TV to become smart you can say by
allowing you to watch your streaming
services like Netflix or Amazon Instant
on a TV that doesn't have those built-in
features now if you don't have a smart
TV which at the present time most
consumers don't you're only watching
your paid subscription services through
either your phone or tablet and if it is
on your TV it may be through an Xbox or
Playstation and some people don't want
to buy a gaming system or move their
gaming system into a different room so
this is where these streaming devices
come in handy but Amazon has some very
unique features and offers a gaming
device as well based on Android which
looks very promising and now go over
those features shortly and price that
only $99 it's on par with other
competitors like in Roku 3 and Apple TV
and be sure to watch my review on the
other streaming devices on my channel or
by clicking the videos displayed so
without further ado we'll get started
going over its physical layout first the
fire TV is beautiful very slim and sleek
it's a perfect square at 4.5 inches wide
and also 4.5 inches deep in standing
just a little over a half an inch tall
now on the rear does offer a power port
for the supplied AC cord HDMI connection
which oddly enough Amazon did not
provide a cord for optical opt for
digital surround sound up to 7.1
channels to be specific a Ethernet port
just in case you don't have Wi-Fi and
lastly is a USB port altogether the unit
is a very solid built machine and my
favorite so far compared to the
competition now the unit does run a bit
hot though so I would not suggest
putting anything on top the same quality
can be said for the controller too very
slim and sleek with a slight silicon
texture for added grip it's very subtle
and doesn't leave behind fingerprints or
unsightly scratches you have up top your
microphone for voice commands which I'll
test later the mic button a directional
pad for up down left and right and it
wasn't a touch sensitive jog out which I
personally thought at first similar to
the very first iPads really
Appl then the very middle is your enter
button to execute commands back home and
menu buttons are to follow with the
standard back play pause and forward to
finish up the controller now the remote
does take to triple-a batteries which
are supplied by Amazon now if you'll be
purchasing this yourself through your
Amazon account once they ship it to you
your login credentials are already in
there there's no need to set up your
account which was very convenient for me
so we'll jump straight into the content
before going over some of the unique
features once around your home page as
shown here you have your menu on the
left and several rows have suggested and
featured content and the write pretty
self-explanatory for suggestions on
movies apps - TV shows and games now
just real brief here before I get into
the free content you can say amazon
firetv just like the other companies
offer movies and TV shows to rent or
purchase most rentals for movies are
around $4.99 while purchases are $14.99
and all the way up to $19.99 to me
somewhat on the expensive side but you
can say convenient if you're not willing
to run down the street to rent from
let's say red box for just 2 dollars but
what makes these devices worth buying
are they're free apps and also the paid
subscription services like Netflix or
Hulu now being accessible on your TV now
more importantly if you're already an
Amazon Prime holder you receive a decent
library of free movies to watch as well
and I'll casually flip through some of
the channels here so you can see what's
offered by Amazon and if I'm going a
little bit too fast
be sure to rerun the video now
everything is available through the app
menu here you can find your standard and
well-known apps like YouTube Vimeo
revision3 and stated earlier Netflix and
Hulu Plus just the name of you now one
of the most important channels missing
was HBO GO it's unfortunate for those
Game of Thrones out there but there
could be an update down the road amazon
also loads up on audio content as well
like pandora iheartradio and VEVO now
once you scroll down to categories you
can see other useful apps genre-specific
first example scrolling through
entertainment has decent amount apps
that provides a decent amount of free
content to watch example like frequency
which normally is a smartphone and
tablet app is available here frequency
rounds up all the most watched videos on
the internet and puts it all into this
one centralized location for viewing now
if you have cable or satellite already
at home and don't have a cable box for
that TV you can sign in with your cable
company's username and password to make
full use of ESPN the ESPN plays live
through your fire TV with only a minute
delay from the actual live feed from the
TV downstairs now having just reviewed
the Roku several days ago the Roku
provides full access to your TV lineup
not just what apps are available for
example what Time Warner you can watch
your cable shows on your tablet or
smartphone and this feature is also
present on the Roku but on Amazon TV
you're only limited to what apps are
available not Time Warner as a whole
Amazon in general does well with
providing many of the popular apps but
does have some missing content here and
there now looking in the sports genre
which there's other sports like the NFL
racing soccer whatever it may be
and I personally like watching the Food
Network but looking through the food
availability as you can see there's only
two now don't expect to see Bobby Flay
or shows like Iron Chef or chopped as
you won't see those on the competitors
like Apple TV or Roku but the other two
brands just mentioned do offer a bit
more content than what Amazon has
provided so far but to be fair after my
experience with testing Roku and Apple
TV the apps and content that Amazon
decides to make available are a great
content there isn't any channels where I
noticed it was low budget internet TV
type content which is a good thing
there's no fluff there's quality over
quantity if I can sum it up all together
if you're happy seeing those main
channel lineups you're perfectly fine
then and I would suggest watching my
Roku streaming stick review and you can
see how much content is on there now
getting back on topic here the next
great content feature is gaming what's
amazing about the fire TV it's based on
Android which means some games normally
found on smartphones and android power
tablets are playable here games like
minecraft asphalt dead trigger Riptide
etc which are very good titles now some
do require a Bluetooth gaming controller
and you cannot use the supplied remote
from the fire TV Amazon sells their
gaming pad for $40 and the peripheral is
top-notch and when playing these Android
games with a controller it's
almost like a completely new experience
and if you purchase the control at this
moment Amazon does provide ten dollars
worth of Amazon coins used to purchase
apps and games in the future again
that's free money and per Amazon the
average cost of the game is a dollar and
85 cents and rest assured Amazon States
there is a quad-core processor built-in
claiming this fire TV is three times
more powerful than the Apple TV Roku and
chromecast and with my test games ran
perfectly fine and to be honest the
entire interface from switching screens
to video playback it's very fluid very
smooth making the user experience
frustrating free and among streaming
devices this has been the most enjoyable
and most pleasant experience I have
encountered so far so to round up
Amazon's unique features the remote
control features a microphone hold down
and speak naturally into the controller
of any actor movie or genre it will pull
up all that's related and it works well
to saving time and effort rather than
typing everything out now one big bonus
on the chromecast was the ability to
watch your content on either your
smartphone or tablet then cast that
video onto the TV that chromecast is
plugged into Amazon has something
similar but only works with devices that
have this feature called second screen
the only tablet that I know of so far
that does this is the Amazon's own
Kindle Fire HDX which makes this feature
pretty limited now another feature with
your Amazon account you already have
five gigs worth of cloud data storage
videos up to 20 minutes and all of your
photos can be viewed on the fire TV
which makes sharing photos and screen or
watching again 20 minute long videos
pretty simple
and lastly Amazon has always taken
parental controls pretty serious on all
their devices it's nice to see it's
available here to prevent children from
accidentally or intentionally buying
content and your credit card you can
also restrict content type to ensure
they're watching something
age-appropriate as well so hands down
this for me has been the most enjoyable
experience with any streaming device
very smooth fluid and the gaming feature
is a plus then keep in mind this is
Android based so we will of course see
more apps and content the smartphone and
tablet world come over to the fire TV
and not to mention for the geeks out
there you can say you'll probably be
route this soon and customize the
experience even further so Auto limited
in some areas in regards to channels and
apps what's offered again is quality
content and again for me it's enough to
satisfy my needs so that's it I know
this video was somewhat long but I hope
this review helped you in some way be
sure to watch the Roku streaming stick
and group Google chromecast review here
