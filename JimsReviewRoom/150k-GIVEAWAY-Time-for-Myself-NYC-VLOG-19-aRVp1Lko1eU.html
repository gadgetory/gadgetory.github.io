another vlog here I'm Jimmy Wynn Jim's
review of course but this is a new
milestone video a hundred and fifty
thousand subscribers holy cow my mind is
blown once again because it feels like
literally it feels like almost like a
couple of weeks ago maybe two or three
weeks ago and maybe it's a little bit
longer than obviously but I had 140,000
scribes I remember doing that video and
Here I am today doing 150 thousand
followers on my channel holy cow so
thank you very much to all the new
members here welcome back to you all a
lot of the original old-school members
and if you are new to the channel these
are my personal vlog here they don't
look anything like my reviews so please
understand I just put these things
together it's just a way for you guys
and get to know me personally get some
insight up behind the scenes with Jim's
review room and a little bit again my
personal life as well and I know in the
beginning I showed it something of some
clips of New York out detail that
shortly in this vlog here but um I am
back home back in the house here I know
you guys see the ladder and my house is
kind of in disarray right now I took on
the challenge of repainting the entire
house all by myself so I'll update you
guys on the next vlog and see how far
actually progress literally the letter
might stay right there and these walls
my st. Brown for quite some time but
anyways that's the point of this blog
here I guess this is my main message is
I just been working so much not just you
know in the last two two and a half
years with this gyms ruby room but all
in my 20s as well and just this past
past month a lot of my friends have been
traveling and it's not jealousy or
anything like that i always want to
travel i have traveled in the past you
know often on periodically and i told
you guys in one of my more recent vlogs
that's one of my goals for this summer
and i finally finally did that I'm
originally from New York I lived in
western New York
rochester new york that is and I did
live in New York City for a brief moment
in time in my early 20s one of my axes
was in lives in New York and we used to
go up to New York once or twice maybe
three times a year to see her family and
friends and her friends are getting
married and kids so we would go up there
pretty often and New York City I Love I
Love New York it's my home away from
home it's the place that I I don't know
I aim I go back the most frequent so it
wasn't like I haven't been there before
but every time I go back up there man
and it's just it's always an amazing
experience there's always something new
that's always something going on but
anyways so what happened was let me just
set this down real quick here so today
is Monday it's Memorial Day happy
holidays two guys here in America out of
friday i finished up the video and
literally friday night i said you know
what let me just do something for myself
i haven't traveled quite some time and
that's just me person that's is
something that I personally enjoy I
don't really do much else that I find
that's really like the hits my cord I
guess you can say so I I booked the
ticket Friday night and I'm literally
the following morning I flew out to New
York and I'll play some videos in the
background here and just to give you
guys a heads up I was anticipating i'm
vlogging i brought the camera i bought
this camera that blogging on right now
and probably a quarter of the way
through it i just said to myself I
wasn't focused on enjoying myself I was
focusing on you know what to say what to
show you guys we're to walk next for the
video and I said you know what let me
just take this weekend or the next day
or two that I'm here in New York and
just focus on me and just let my mind
clear out him just get out of work mode
in general as much as I like talking to
you guys as much as I love producing
videos on James from your room I just
said you know what just let me do
something for myself and so that's why
I'm not narrating or talking while I'm
in New York and then try but and that's
why I'm showing some behind-the-scenes
not behind the scenes but i'm just
showing footage
me in your in general but as soon as I
got there I want to shake shack 8 you
know damn good burger got me a
strawberry shake and that just enjoyed
the atmosphere while I was there I did
see i'll do some I don't want some
touristy stuff but I went to some
touristy areas you know I just likes
being around people in general down
south it's a little bit quiet so I don't
mind the touristy stuff I don't mind you
know being crowded crowded heavy
hardcore place like that like Times
Square for example and it was just an
amazing experience but on that Lisa dent
that's really basically all I did buying
my message my focus for me at least
personally myself was just taking time
for myself and it's something I haven't
really done for a very long time not
talking about a couple years I'm talking
about the last 10 12 years of my life I
just be you know I have always been a
believer of you know you work hard and
you know hopefully one day it'll come
back to you in Danton and you know help
you basically you know I'm better
tomorrow and I in my twenties I've
always focus you know better tomorrow
better tomorrow it's always tomorrow I
never focused and living that day and
now I'm in my early 30s I love you guys
can tell I do look pretty young but I
I'm slowly making that transition I feel
a lot more content in my life youtube
has been a blessing I don't make boo
Koos of money everything like that but
it's just got to the point where I am
content with what i have and i just want
to enjoy my time but regarding the
channel here link says is growing really
quick I got a new car to unbox for you
guys real quick here so most likely by
the end of june i'm going to upgrade my
computer slowly starting get parts in
don't update my hard drives the computer
building if you guys have seen in my sky
like building you guys have
see that look it up on youtube just look
up Jim's Revere room skylight computer
building you guys would see it and I was
anticipating a substantial increase in
performance which wasn't the case it is
much better but not as much as I thought
so I think that SSDs are slowing me down
I am anticipating I'm gonna try someone
those m dot two hard drives but m dot 2
is going to be the next biggest upgrade
and ninety-nine percent confident I'm
going to someone 980 TI and get the 1080
you know brand new branches card and
just might as well upgrade that C so I
anticipate the end of june i'm going to
upgrade basic do a pretty substantial
upgrade to my computer i SPECT that
video but here's a new keyboard you guys
go so that's new I am NOT doing a review
on that but that will be in the computer
build video again towards the end of
June on that there's going to be a
giveaway for this video course for the
new mouse 150,000 subscribers that's
going to come up pretty shortly here
there's gonna be another huge giveaway I
believe that video is coming out jun 10
and it's the first video where I'm
collaborating with a bunch of other
youtubers and and it's a pretty big
substantial keep we're all pulling money
together to try to get something for you
guys so anticipate that as well new
price of course always coming out and
I'll try to be on top of it for you guys
on that there's something else I needed
to tell you guys I want to tell you guys

don't got some horrible lighting going
on right now but regarding that give
away I did make a new social media

post because I've been you know doing a
lot of personal post on like Jim's
