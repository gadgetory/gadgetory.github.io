room the JBL boombox is on the horizon I
think for the US we're getting it a bit
later than anticipated but for the fans
who have asked me thank you for letting
me know I have one on pre-order coming
this way but in the meantime back with
you any budget-friendly speaker some of
you asked me to test out the sound box
XL as it supposedly sounds pretty darn
good as always remaining transparent
with you guys dusted send me a review
unit per my request my assessment was
not altered in any way please watch the
entire video for both pros and cons as
priced at ninety dollars at the time
this review as always I'll place my
affiliate links in the video description
below click on those links and they'll
give you the most updated prices in real
time they never know when these things
might go on sale so without further ado
my channel is here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review
go over the physical features the
speaker genuinely looks good das in the
past have used plastics on their
products but it's always been tastefully
done without looking cheap the front
grille is aluminum and a top accent
piece made of brushed metal looks and
feels legitimate rotating to the rear
it's all plastic and although it looks
fine I notice it might not take abrasion
well heavenlies rub against other hard
surfaces as shown not scratches but
marks in general if your particular
about aesthetics keep this in mind now
buttons are on your screen please feel
free to pause the video if you need to
our buns are very tactile offering
clicky feedback as heard here and one
thing that absolutely threw me off why
on earth did they use the windows alert
sound
get with the program be original for god
sakes
but looking at the M button you can
toggle this speaker to use bluetooth a
physical 3.5 millimeter auxiliary cable
or a micro SD card which you can stick
in from the rear now regarding blue
through the range das uses Bluetooth 4.0
testing this with two of my phones here
I was able to achieve a crazy distance
of a hundred linear feet with the iPhone
8 plus and testing this on my older
phone the LG v10 I was able to get
eighty four linear feet before the
signal started to crackle and cut out so
that's basically it for this speaker
it's very simple straight to the point
no waterproofing no drop resistance no
NFC doubling up no extra base or a
speakerphone option and I'm perfectly
fine with that as long as it plays good
audio and of course comes in at a
reasonable price
now one feature that is missing is a
true battery level indicator the light
only glows blue when it has enough power
and flashes red when it's low I don't
know if there's 50% remaining 80% who
knows and regarding battery performance
das claims up to 10 hours of playtime
per their Amazon page with my test from
a full battery to dead playing at 50%
volume I got 8 hours and 31 minutes of
playback time to recharge the speaker
had taken me 2 hours in 45 minutes so -
the moment you've been waiting for the
audio test be sure to use headphones or
earphones as I'll be using behind knurl
microphones
my test will give you the best 3d audio
listening experience versus my other
professional microphones I have here at
the office
let me go
did you go
did you not know who to trust
and there we have it folks as seen in
the video I demonstrated the sony xba-40
which sound very similar to the JBL
extreme and representative of big
Bluetooth speakers and the other speaker
is the JBL charge 3 representing the mid
tier options and the 150 dollar price
range that did not demonstrate the JBL
extreme in the video but I have compared
all these speakers here in the studio
first these sound box excel-based
performance is impressive for you $100
or in this case less than $100 Bluetooth
speaker this performance is not
identical but someone close to what the
xB 40 at the same time just slightly
more bass than the JBL charge 3 it falls
in between that big speaker and the mid
tier speaker performance vase is punchy
and at times offering some resonating
bass which is quite impressive here now
the one thing I did notice right away it
doesn't get as loud as the big Bluetooth
speakers the JBL extreme and sony xba-40
s both provided more room filling music
and bass and depth that's deeper than
what these sound box Excel offers I
found turn this up to about 80 to 85%
volume will get me close to what the big
speakers can do at 50 to 60 percent fine
now when I compare this to the mid tier
charge 3 they sounded nearly equivalent
the mid-range vocal work and instruments
are clear with minimal to no impact from
the low frequencies the soundstage is
very much acceptable for the price range
offering some sense of depth here not so
much the left and right audio channels
like most other Bluetooth speakers and
it's because of course I compared in
this review and also the high
frequencies they're not sharp and tingey
as found on cheap speakers in my opinion
they performed it more neutral and
didn't sound to have too much roll-off
but nowhere is it ear-piercing now
overall I say this sandbox XL has a very
very good audio quality at the end of
day despite the DOS placing the word
excel in its name and having a speaker
nearly the same size as the big
bluetooth speaker class it performs
either equivalent and at times slightly
better than the charge 3 with that being
said again to emphasize it's less than
$100 and if you can forego all the bells
and whistles of being rugged and having
NFC hit over the windows startup chime
and lack of vibe and precise battery
levels essentially you want darn good
audio without the price the sound box
Excel is highly recommended so that's it
