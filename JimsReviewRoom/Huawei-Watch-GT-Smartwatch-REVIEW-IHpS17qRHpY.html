showing you this beautiful SmartWatch
this thing is sexy it's sophisticated
looking and everything about it and the
outside looks absolutely great but how
is it on the inside how are her feelings
how about that personality that's what
I'll get into and see if this watch is
worth it for you guys
folks this is the Huawei watch GT the
version I have here is the classic
priced at $229 at the time this video as
always I'll place my affiliate links
down in that video description below
click on my links for the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
these things might go on sale matter of
fact I think the black sport model is at
least cheaper right now so again check
out those links as well as being
transparent wow I did send us over for
review but my assessment was not altered
in any way I'll be going over both pros
and cons I'm Jimmy with Jim's review
room and I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another video
going over the physical features first I
very much love the look and the feel of
this watch you can beat a judge so
comment down below but here are my three
things that thing every consumer will
appreciate now first up is durability
and the quality of the materials the
stainless steel casing has a dlc coating
diamond like carbon coating making this
very much scratch resistant now with
some smart watches in the past the same
amount of time testing herself I would
have Nick's or scratches that would show
up within let's say even a week
this one doesn't full disclosure I've
had this for about a month now but we'll
see how long this will hold up but for a
month it looks pretty darn promising now
second the silicone strap itself is very
very comfortable very much flexible on
my wrist I haven't had any issues of
irritation or rashes and the level look
on the outside seems pretty good too the
color matches my shoes I do love the
look of that leather the stitching the
little details that pieces everything
together and if for some reason you
don't like it similar to most if not all
other smartwatches these days there is a
tool at for you to swap out that van
now the third physical aspect I love
about the Huawei I'm finally at a
fitness size that I'm absolutely happy
with I love my Samsung Galaxy watch but
I will admit though it is a little bit
bulky the Huawei comes in at ten point
five millimeters and it's just the right
size not too cumbersome to feel it
against my sleeves when I wear long
sleeves or when I do shoulder presses at
home or maybe doing push-ups and my
wrist or my hand is bent backwards like
this it's not getting in the way it's
not like you can see my muscles or
anything like that but it's also not too
thin to basically feel lackluster either
the fitness on this Smart Watch is
seriously what every SmartWatch should
strive for when you're at this thickness
this would be more appealing to
mainstream or if anything the average
consumer now getting into other standard
features this has a 5 ATM
water-resistant rating safe for splashes
rain snow fresh water swimming and such
we have the optical heartrate tracker on
the back as well physically connected
are used to charge to watch which I'm
okay with I would prefer the convenes of
a wireless charger but the pins do
function fine and produce less heat
which is the enemy of batteries
now one of the biggest pros and cons on
the history of this channel here or so I
think the battery life is phenomenal
that's the good part
while weighs climbing up to two weeks of
typical performance that does include
heart rate tracking on 24/7 and while we
claims that's with ninety minutes of
exercise per week now with my testing
I'm a virgin about a week worth of
battery life give or take a day or two
depending if I'm more active on certain
weeks or not but compared to the
competition that's still seriously good
Samsung in the amazing Apple watch for
my test we're averaging four to five
days of normal use take away a day or
two maybe two if you're going all out
with GPS and heart rate tracking and
such but with the Huawei experiencing
five to eight days
that's impressive especially considering
they watch gt's price points now here's
the con well the reasons how huawei
achieved such amazing battery life is
the development in their use of their
own operating system it's called light
OS know many huawei software is running
leaner less bloatware maybe their system
is that much better optimized but with a
new OS to help with a battery life there
comes limitations because the OS is just
simply soo so new now for the Huawei
watch GT there are no third-party apps
and keep in mind this watch is focused
on health so we can't install oddly
Strava RunKeeper and map my run all
three apps that I personally use and the
data from huawei health cannot be
exported to those tabs either at least
at the time this video to be fair the
while we watch GT is priced lower than
the flagship watches out there but there
are clearly non flagship smartwatches
that offers more than it wast GT even
last year's Huawei SmartWatch had more
but again it wasn't running light OS and
it doesn't have the same banner life
either
now one feature though I loved on the
older Huawei watch since I briefly
touched based on it the budget issues
Zen watch - also from back in the
that I reviewed - even the flagship
competitors today I can't take phone
calls on this I can't take phone calls
right from my wrist I don't get NFC
either to make credit card payments with
my wrist unless I would love to leave my
phone behind when I'm working out and
have music stored on my watch
connect my Bluetooth earphones or
headphones to it and then go for a run
leaving that phone behind that's not
possible
now there's sport oriented watch so
everything I've mentioned so far are
those limitations a deal breaker for you
let us know in the comment section below
like I've said before your comments do
help others coming in and trying to
decide if this is for them or not but
moving out here take a look at the
screen and then continuing with my
experiences the screen is great though
it's big 1.3 inch AMOLED display a
resolution of 454 by 454 which is on the
higher end samsung only has 360 by 360
tick watch a great budget brand with
comparable prices have a resolution of
400 by 400 it's also bright in sunlight
it's easy to read and due to the high
resolution I don't see any pixelation
now with the experience on the right
side the top button brings up all your
included apps like I said a lot of
health features and you can rewind this
video if I went a little too fast for
you now tapping on the button again
brings you back to your home screen
button on the bottom right here triggers
your workout profiles and tracking
parameters now taking a look here
running since it is the most popular
sport or activity that most people do
there is GPS built-in also GLONASS and
Galileo with all three every time I'm
attempting to personally connect it is
fast here and the tracking is accurate
to know right now I'm in of course an
office building medical steel and
concrete and there's what two more
floors above me so it might have a
little bit of trouble in real time but
also you get real-time heart rate
tracking once you start the activity you
have this color band up here that
indicates your heart rate zone which I
absolutely love in turn I can't tell if
I'm pushing myself too hard or not
also there's pace distance and time are
of course shown as well now pulling the
screen up you have your step count
cadence
total calories burned another swipe
shows how many feet climbed your current
elevation and neck swipe shows your
heart rate in real time unless this is
really cool here your trailing average
pace are you going slower or faster than
your average with a very cool animation
in play so for the moments that you're
running and tracking what is displayed
I'll be honest with you I think it's
great it's everything that I need and
it's all the data that I want while
running making this one excellent
running companion app or running
companion watch but like I said again I
wish there's built-in music with
Bluetooth for my earphones simply
sticking with other apps would have been
tremendously helped maybe in version 2.0
now let's get back to the main screen
here and going through some of the smart
features now from the home screen you
can hold it down you can hold down that
watch face and select from a variety of
others that Huawei provides to you now
keep in mind there are no third-party
apps which means there are no other
watch now faces available until why wait
updates their operating system like I
said at times video there is a huge
limitation some of them look good some
of them look ok it really honestly
depends on your preference here now from
the main screen swiping down shows your
Do Not Disturb feature find your phone
and settings pretty straightforward
going back to that main home page here
swiping up instead shows all of your
notifications now I can't clear out just
one notification unfortunately I have to
scroll all the way down whoops sorry
about that scroll all the way down here
and then click clear all to get rid of
them now while in notifications you also
notice I can't respond to any one of
them there's no text to speech you can't
scribble text out here and no
old-fashioned typing on the screen to
respond to those text messages messenger
and email that's again available on
other competitors last but not least
going back to the home screen here and
now swiping right you have your heart
rate monitoring which has been accurate
for a SmartWatch from my experience I
just wish there was just more data such
as my last 5 days may be an option to
see what's considered as fat burning
versus cardiovascular it's good data if
you want to see what your day is looking
like but looking at some history on the
watch itself I would think would make it
but more interactive useful and
practical swiping for the weather is
also available but unlikely competitors
with more mainstream operating systems I
wish I could see what the next five days
are maybe the hourly reports to see when
it will rain in my area we simply don't
get that
now besides weather the last screen
shows a ring of colors representing
steps active minutes and the amount of
time I've been sitting very similar to
the apples health display on their Smart
Watch other than that what's been
offered in y ways like OS the speed and
functionality has been good with minor
legs and hiccups here when I first
tested the watch after a week that lag
or stutter has been gone for the most
part I don't think I've noticed it
anymore it was really subtle now I do
wear this to sleep and it's been as
accurate as my Fitbit that I also wear
my right wrist here down to the minute
at a time so it's reassuring that these
two devices are confirming my sleep is
pretty accurate or it's reading pretty
accurate with each other now I do very
much battery the segmentation of light
sleep versus deep sleep versus REM sleep
very similar to fitbit's and the
breakdown as you can see I'm a very very
light sleeper now you do have the
ability to set up a vibrating alarm
through the app itself the watch does
vibrate when I receive notifications and
also of course a vibrating alarm to wake
me up in the morning I'll will admit
though it's on me very much lighter and
and keep in mind I am a light sleeper so
it does wake me up that is but I think
for most people it might not work also
and to supplement that as well when I
receive notifications
probably a moderate amount of time I do
miss the vibration altogether I just
don't sense it or feel it on my wrist so
in the end here in the Huawei watch GT
nailed some areas down gracefully the
fitness in wash display the battery life
the Bell quality and the look as well
it's all on par and again the thinness
on this thing is a huge seller for me
but the lack of experience of what a
SmartWatch should be the interconnect
ability the function we've clearly seen
available on older models that actually
uses Google's operating system it's been
amazing with those smartwatches and I
feel like now we're
missing out in my personal humble
opinion this feels more like a fitness
or a high-end activity tracker masking
itself as a SmartWatch
I love why away smartwatches from the
past but man be light OS it's holding me
back so much so that's it folks be sure
to subscribe and turn on those
notifications since I'm testing
attending gear to get to a million subs
fired mo G's down below I have the
Bhosle buds coming up in some sound bars
coming through so be on Lookout I'm
Jimmy with Jim's review and I'm here to
help you make that purchase decision see
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
