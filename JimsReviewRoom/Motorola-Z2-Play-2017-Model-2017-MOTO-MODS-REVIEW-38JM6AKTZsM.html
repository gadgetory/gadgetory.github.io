room it's that time of year again
starting off phone reviews for August
and into the fall season we're going to
start seeing phones being announced and
released pretty shortly
so first up Motorola sent over a loaner
unit for 30 days to tests and we're
looking at their new Moto G to play
accompanied with several moto mods for
their website this phone is going for
408 dollars and the Moto mod prices are
on your screen for your convenience so
without further adieu be sure to follow
me on facebook twitter and or instagram
again i'm jimmy with jim's review room
I'm here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
going over the physical features first
the z2 plate is crazy thin from the
factory well most of the phones are
coming in around 8 millimeters thick
we're talking about like these samsung
SI plus LG G 6 and iPhone 7 just the
name of you this is the thinnest film
that I've personally tested on the
channel coming in at just six
millimeters now I'm all for slim phones
as they're easier to manage in the
pockets but when holding the deed you
play it is a bit slippery as there's
less meat you can say to hold on to
there's moto mods you can attach that
does completely fix that matter but I'll
show you those later in this review the
phone is splash proof perfect and ideal
for those who likes using their phone
around the sink in the morning and with
my time testing spills the splashes they
all held up fun you just can't submerge
it going around the physical features
your sim and micro SD card reader is up
top rotating to the right there's Vaughn
rocker buttons with power below and all
three buttons were quite small and very
similar to each other having to take
more time than usual to build up muscle
memory I give it several days and you
should be fine and identifying where
everything is located on the bottom is a
3 1/2 millimeter connection for your
earphones in the middle is a USB type-c
port for charging what are claimed from
a dead battery you can have up to 8
hours of life with it and be charger for
just 15 minutes from my testing after
leaving it in the charger for a quarter
of an hour I achieved 15%
of battery-life reclaimed for general
better life I'm getting on average a day
and a half before needing to recharge
and six hours and 52 minutes on average
of screen on time the most I've ever
gone was 7 hours and 32 minutes four
days of heavy use rotating to the rear
this is where it gets really interesting
and the phone starts to differentiate
itself from the others the Moto Z line
of phones they're modular to an extent
you can buy various back plates to
attach for different functions now first
up is the JBL sound boost - it looks
great as a little kickstand here it's
also splash proof shaking this in midair
did it have the speaker move or shimmy
at all as well and from my testing the
audio performance sounds equivalent to a
small $50.00 stand-alone bluetooth
speaker it's great for a personal casual
listening even at maximum volume and
then on those rare occasions though
there is some slight rest fitness at
those high levels now the biggest
concern that I had though at maximum
volume the better does journey at about
8 to 10% every 5 minutes at 50% volume
the audio is low for very casual at the
best listening but I was able to achieve
16 and a half hours worth of use other
attachments that quickly glanced over
there's the additional power bank
backplate which I absolutely loved this
gives you an additional day of battery
life also there's tons more grip not
only because of its awesome texture but
it gives me thrown slightly more meat to
hold on to last Motorola sent me this
floral pattern design which is it really
my style but there are other designs out
there others gives me back put some
protection gives the phone a bit more
meat again to grab on to and less this
mod gives the phone the ability to
charge wirelessly now there's many other
moto mods out there like a projector for
displaying view on the wall do a camera
attachment that gives you better optical
performance just better looking images
but getting back to the phone continuing
with what is unique that moto options
include chopping the phone twice to
activate the flashlight
two more chops and turn off and twisting
the screen to turn on the camera even if
the phone is locked now both of these
actions required a pretty firm movement
though most likely to prevent accidental
actions when not intended the home
button can be used as your navigation
with swiping right to left to go back on
webpages and certain apps
left to right to access the menu
features and to lock the phone a slight
hold till your phone Viper
no sound the great in theory but from my
testing it's been hit or miss there's
moments where it works and some moments
where you're swiping multiple times just
to execute now looking at the camera we
have a 12 megapixel shooter and the rear
and this has to be the second fastest
autofocus system that I've experienced
to date
motorola says it's using dual autofocus
pixels and lasers to measure distance
and such and this is not Motorola $700
flagship phone either which is quite
impressive well who has the fastest
autofocus both the Samsung s7 and si
phones are instant and works at closer
distances again keep in mind it's not
apples to apples those are flagship
phones but with the Moto it does a
slight hunt for a millisecond that you
might see in this demonstration now
although not number one is still very
darn close and beats nearly every other
phone out there now the menus and
features are very straightforward here
you can adjust aspect ratios and
resolution size for photos which is
quite odd here but I think most won't
mind unless you absolutely need a wide
16 by 9 aspect ratio and the flipside
you do get pro mode where you can
manually control and adjust shutter
speeds iso levels focus etc now possibly
the biggest downfall from my experience
while using the camera is after each
photo that's taken there are no icons
that lets me preview my images I would
have to back out the camera then go into
Google Photos or some kind of photo app
now getting into some samples here
everything was set on auto mode as most
average consumers would use the photos
in general were good for a $400 phone
the images doesn't necessarily pop but
offered photos still worth using and
sharing on social media
one example here's a photo from the
Motorola this was in a dimly lit
restaurant this past Saturday as I said
nothing too special but again clearly
usable here and I know this is not
apples to apples comparison but only for
reference to see how far off the
Motorola is from a flagship film this
image is comparing to my samsung as a
plus $100 plus device now here's another
one real quick the Motorola shows up
first
again not bad and showing these Samsung
once again definitely some differences
now here are a few more photos from
Motorola itself and feel free to pause
the video if you guys need to if I'm
going too fast here you guys can see
it's not as sharp not as saturated in
colors and again if I can sum it all up
the images just doesn't really pop again
so usable for
really generic use I'd say throw on a
filter and you're good to go
last up is lonely performance the camera
does someone struggle here with
providing more noise in moderately dark
areas and objects so alright here enough
about the camera we've seen the unique
features from motorola like the
flashlight turning on twisting your
wrist to turn on the camera we've seen
the motor mods which is very unique here
and we went into the camera jumping over
to phone use I'll play the specs on your
screen for your convenience again please
pause the video if you like to see the
details but the display comes in at 5.5
inches with a 1080 resolution the bezels
are quite large however having the phone
in black it doesn't stick out like a
sore thumb here like my white pixel
Excel despite flagship phones offering
more pixels using the Moto Z to play on
a daily basis I couldn't really tell the
difference
colors are accurate sand straight away
from popping out at you with strong
contrast and saturation a Super AMOLED
displays though it gives off a pleasing
look here and more importantly doesn't
make skin tones look orange or red for
the average user experience it looks
perfectly fine
from my experience I asked for
performance easy to play is using the
latest mid tier processor available
that's the snapdragon 626 from my
experience the average consumer will be
perfectly fine it during my time using
the phone like my work phone as checking
Twitter Instagram emails uploading and
downloading photos opening up the camera
app the off performs as it would
normally I quickly tested playing a bit
more graphically intensive games like
Madden UFC and such enduring gameplay
never notice the hiccup or skip frame
rates etc for those kind of titles so
everything loaded up in a reasonable
amount of time the webpage is loaded
reasonably as well down to call
performance cell signal my office
building and such really no complaints
for everyday use to gaming as well in
the end for a mid to your performer
you're getting a lot of value
considering how thin this is the unique
and proprietary features plus the
options and expansion with moto mods if
you're in the $400 range and you have
the right expectations this phone is
surely a hit in my personal opinion in
the comment section below please let me
know your thoughts
is this an awesome phone are the Moto
mods cool are they worth it I would love
to hear your thoughts so again I'm Jimmy
with Jim's Revere room and I'm
or to help you make that purchase
