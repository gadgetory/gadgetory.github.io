here my name is Jimmy long I was born in
1984 in the city of Rochester New York
home of where Kodak once stood tall and
proud it's still there today but that's
pretty sparse now my parents both left
Vietnam and after the Vietnam War
conceived me and boy were they in deep
trouble here my parents didn't have much
money I grew up in the hood and went to
an inner-city school drug deals and
gunshots were literally happening across
the street here from a house and being
out late simply wasn't safe my dad was a
chef at a Chinese restaurant and my
mother worked in manufacturing nothing
glamorous nothing close to be well-off
here matter of fact day care like it is
today it was expensive in the 80s and
after my mother stayed home to raise me
for the first three years or so I was
then old enough to come to work with my
dad now obviously I couldn't be around
the cooks and the stoves so every day I
had the corner of the kitchen here where
I sat on either a bucket of soy sauce or
a bag of rice playing with my toy trucks
or coloring keeping myself entertained
my mother would get out of work and pick
me up at about 5:00 and my dad would
stay at the restaurants work until 10:00
at night six days a week now as a kid it
was pretty typical
I rode bikes with my best friend next
door pretending to be video game
characters shoot nerf guns I even
skateboard to for a year which I haven't
done since I was six or so but besides
hanging out with my best friend nearly
every day I loved drawing and it loved
building stuff with Legos now by the
fourth grade my teacher asked me what I
wanted to be when I grew up and I said I
wanted to be an artist you know when I
proudly told my parents that idea was
shut down pretty quick but by the fifth
grade this is probably 1995 my father
had seen all of his bosses at the
Chinese restaurants the ones who had
money basically behind their kids
computers and my dad said that was the
future I keep in mind we were still
pretty dirt poor so my father had taken
all of his credit cards and purchased at
the time an Apple Macintosh computer and
yes beckoned day was called in back in
Tosh it didn't have a clean-cut name
like MacBook Pro or so well in that
computer bundle one of the very early
versions of Adobe Photoshop
was included and you can imagine where
that led me to today but as time passed
I think I went through the teasing and
being made fun of phase during my middle
school years and I don't want to make
this such a sad story but being called
Chinese like it was that negative thing
on stereotypes behind it because I
didn't have money I only had one pair of
shoes for the entire year living in the
hood at the time wearing tight jeans or
faded jeans you would get picked on all
the time so in an effort to make some of
my own money to buy some clothes for
myself and again I was again in seventh
or eighth grade I started buying candy
at the corner store and someone called
the bodega and try to make a profit the
next day I would do pretty well selling
candy but by the end of the month you
can imagine making 10 cents and profit
on each piece of candy wasn't too
lucrative so that didn't go anywhere so
high school came around and with my best
friend Brandon and Brandon if you're
watching this what's up dude me and
Brandon would walk through the hallways
and throw stink bombs into classrooms we
would street race behind the school for
fun as a side hustle I used to bootleg
CDs it was honestly complete 180 to what
it was when I was a kid and probably Who
I am today as well but with my friends
it was seriously fun though but on the
down-low I was still a total nerd I took
up engineering and competed originally
and won first place with my team I
competed nationally at the u.s. first
engineering competition and we didn't
win first place but it was such a great
experience we were sponsored by RIT when
an all-expense-paid trip down to Orlando
Florida and where we competed was in
Disney World and it was my first time
ever there was my first time really out
of New York - it was far different from
growing up in the inner city
now while back home here and the very
beginning of my senior year I eventually
crashed my car but dad was furious and
said I should focus on school instead of
working like most Asian parents I would
think would save that who knows well at
17 or 18 if you're not making your own
money your mother is the one who picks
out the clothes for you and the last
thing I wanted to do was get picked that
again but because I wasn't allowed to
work I started focusing on what I'd love
at the time it was cars and The Fast and
the Furious movie the fur
every one that just came out my senior
year of high school and everyone was
interested in cars at that time while I
went to my local autozone I spoke with
the manager and bought some neon or
strobe lights in bulk at a discount and
started listing them on eBay and with
eBay I learned some basic HTML got
better with Photoshop to make my photos
and listings look good and this was my
first I guess real entrepreneur
experience the selling candy thing
wasn't really a big deal but towards the
end of that gig I was making about $200
a week which for a high school student
was a lot but then one day some
douchebag started listing the same
lights for cheaper than mine and I was
losing business the eBay gig eventually
shut down so I was back to focusing on
school and as much as I dreaded high
school I dreaded math I hated reading
yet I somehow graduated in the top 20 of
my class so everyone thinks I finished
with an engineering degree in college
loving cars and loving to build things I
also thought I was gonna get into
mechanical engineering but by the end of
college like I said I dreaded math I
always was fond of the creative side of
things and because of eBay and selling
other things back in middle and high
school and no I didn't sell weed or
anything like that considering I was
growing up in the hood and but I was
really interested in business so I
finished college with a degree in
communication with a focus in marketing
and advertising I loved learning why
storefronts or laid out the way they are
I love the psychology of what makes
people attracted to a product a logo etc
etc well fast-forward to right before I
started youtube I had a combination of
my own businesses and my fair share of
working for corporate America I've
worked for some of the biggest insurance
companies in the United States I've
worked for one of the top three banks in
the nation I stayed at home for a year
and day traded stocks and future
contracts at one point I flipped a home
I had a rental property and I also built
my own house before too so it's been
pretty trippy and don't get me wrong
pretty exhausting but April of 2012
YouTube was not really mainstream at all
and all I had seen was others posting
his homemade videos of themselves
nothing
spectacular highly polished as it is
today well soldier knows best or mark
Watson was one the very first technique
youtubers that I knew of and I was
really inspired by him so I decided to
post some of my very own crappy review
videos just for fun and have no idea how
but it did very well at the time I would
post several more videos sporadically
throughout the year never turning on
monetization again it was just purely a
hobby just for fun never thinking that
this could be a full-time job so while
working all these years in corporate
America in the office setting in almost
all of my twenties I honestly wasn't
happy working for people they just hated
corporate politics for God's sakes and
growing up or you would think money
would have solved all of your answers
but I wasn't even doing what I enjoyed
doing when I was growing up which was
creating building things and business in
general so September of 2013
I left my banking job cold turkey
I was making good money and I said you
know what I'm going to give you two the
shot I finally committed to YouTube
full-time that is on October 12 2013 and
the first month I was literally making
three dollars a day and keep in mind I
still have a mortgage at that time I
have you know grown up bills I guess you
can say I said I pushed through for an
entire year just to see how it goes and
despite not making much early on I very
much enjoyed what I was doing this was a
100% complete risk here but I said you
know what after year if it doesn't work
out I can always go back and go work for
someone else from once again dreading it
but in the end I love seeing people tell
me my videos help them I kept feeling me
to keep pushing more content and
continue to help people every day and
every aspect of their lives where the
beat at I didn't review that home
appliances I did reviews on some weirdo
random stuff too but anyways today a few
days away from October 12th today is
what October 3rd October 4th or so my
three years committed to this YouTube
thing it's been amazing to look back and
just say wow I'm doing what I love
I'm helping people everyday and getting
back to what I loved
since I was like 5 or 6 it's basically
I'm creating building things now I would
love to get back into real estate
eventually of course we had that real
estate crash recently that's why I got
out of it but I can that's another story
but honestly guys I was thrilled to make
this video not to show you my
accomplishments but to prove a kid that
grew up in the hood a kid that hated
math that kid that you read in school
there is hope after school there's hope
if you didn't do well in high school in
college it's okay and if I can leave you
with something to think about and this
goes for my younger audience out there
I've learned I want money to be a
byproduct of my happiness not happiness
derived from money itself so the last
thing I want to tell you guys and gals
out there
seriously is thank you for everything
there is nothing else that is keeping
Jim's room afloat that's you guys and if
I could I would love to shake everyone's
hands out there all 200,000 of you and
with this video of course I'm hoping
there's many more to come
but with this video seriously I'm hoping
that you guys have taken my life story
so far that is or some insight that you
guys can do it too
and I'm not saying to make youtube
videos and that everyone would be able
to make it I'm not saying that everyone
can be cut out for it I suck at sports I
would never get into the NBA but I'm
just saying do what makes you happy
put your best foot forward dedicate
yourself have high standards for
yourself and just give it a shot in the
end if I had never tried in all my
endeavors in all of my risks that I have
taken I'll be honest I would have never
had known and with Jim's review room I
would have never have known that it
would be what it is today so guys thank
you very much for everything seriously
from the bottom of my heart you guys
take care and I'll see you in the next
one bye
the whole and before I forget here guys
that giveaway video for the 200,000
subscriber mark before you guys comment
in the comment section furiously that
giveaway video should be coming down in
the next day or two
this video was long enough I didn't want
to squeeze it in here so that's it I'm
getting off now off to the next video
see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
