review you guys see my unboxing video
the benchmark test video which were
phenomenal and finally I have here is
the review of the Nvidia shield tablet
it's priced at 299 dollars for the 16
gigabyte model and with the specs and
features included you expect this to be
at least a 350 dollar flagship device
from other manufacturers so we'll get
started right away as I'm pleased to
announce the review of the Nvidia shield
tablet
starting off with this physical layout
and build you're looking at an 8 inch
screen with exterior dimensions of 8.8
inches tall
exactly 5 inches wide in point 3 6
inches thin with a weight of being less
than a pound at 13 points 7 ounces and
although is not the finished tablet in
the world it feels more like a slate is
the same exact fitness as the Microsoft
Surface pro 3 that I reviewed a little
bit earlier now it's good enough for
portability it fits in the hands nicely
and it feels like a very solid build
although still being light in the hands
it has practically edge to edge glass
with a bevel giving that premium feeling
similar to an Apple product
now bezels going down on each side are
thin however the upper and lower bands
are a little bit thick when compared to
the sides but they haven't been a
nuisance or a distraction once I started
using the device now on the very front
which I always loved on tablets and on
the HTC One cell phone or smartphone
that is are the front facing speakers
but not only that Nvidia decided to
stick speakers on the side as well with
these same exact quality from my tests
they all worked well to compliment loud
sound from a tablet but a huge feature
when holding the shield horizontally
blocking these speakers on the side
doesn't affect overall performance as
the front speakers are still doing
justice you don't get that muffled sound
from other 8-inch tablets on the market
it's a small feature to be honest with
you but something worth noting from
day-to-day usage now going over the rest
of the exterior the very top features a
3.5 millimeter input for your earphones
a mini HDMI output and a micro USB port
for charging with the supplied wall
charger now going to the right side
features your power and volume rocker
buttons which are a little bit too
recessed into the body making it not as
easy to adjust the volume or powering on
and off the device now not a big deal
again but something just to point out a
micro SD card slot which is huge as it
takes up to 128 gigs of additional
storage and from my testing the 16 gigs
that come stack is no question that
enough for gamers and media hunger
individuals and to answer your question
yes you can transfer some games and some
apps right onto the SD card and I could
do this with FIFA 2014 CSR racing and
VLC media player etc again is just some
games and certain apps it all depends on
the developer of the app that
allows this feature or Nats now getting
back on track here the shield tablet
comes with a stylus pen which I'll
discuss more in detail later and
rotating to the bottom offers that side
speaker that we spoke up a little bit
earlier and rotating to the left or
bottom depending on how you hold it
features two inserts for those
considering of purchasing and videos
carrying cases slash stand for another
forty dollars and after my testing I do
highly recommend it since you really
can't game looking straight down onto
the table you have to press up somehow
and on the back features a shield logo
with a slightly textured backing which I
like very much rather than just straight
up plastic where it's a little bit slick
or fingerprint prone etc and last is the
5 megapixel on both the front and rear
facing cameras
now moving to more of the internals the
screen features a 1920 by 1200
resolution display featuring 275 pixels
per inch which I still consider as being
good and sharp enough for news the
colors and saturation are still in
positive territory and colors are not
washed out but they aren't as vibrant or
something - stunning to speak of it's
not a negative but don't expect this
screen to a popping color you can say
now regarding performance Nvidia has
stuck in its newest chip it's the k1
processor which I believe sets the bar
pretty high for other mobile chip
manufacturers you can watch my benchmark
test a video here if you're into numbers
and details but for the average
consumers out there this thing runs like
a beast after testing so many tablets on
my channel using the Nvidia shield felt
zippy and just fast it's actually a
noticeable difference compared to other
tablets and having as many apps as I can
open while downloading more apps from
Google Play and web surfing all at the
same time this thing showed literally no
signs of slowing down I'm very impressed
for everyday news now the shield is
intended for hardcore gamers in games
that I've attempted to play has flowed
very smoothly playing the included game
trying to as you see on your screen it's
optimized for the k1 processor it's been
very colorful a very full in detail and
also the entire time of playing this it
was free and lag there was no hiccups at
all and I'll play some additional games
in the background so you can see how it
performs now considering the processor
is a beast the additional software
features from Nvidia again makes this
tablet stand out from the rest and video
offers a stylus pen as well for use
which is very well done for my
experiences the tip of the pen itself is
a rubber tip unlike plastic that you see
on the samsung note series and it's
perfect when using with the Nvidia
Gamble app now different pressures on
the screen feels more natural than the
Samsung tablets I have tested also now
as for the miscellaneous note-taking
apps out there it works well with just
app which is supplied on the tablet and
also the other app it's literally just
called right
and I tried Evernote as well briefly and
couldn't find an option to handwrite
notes instead of typing but overall I
really enjoyed using the pen and also
navigating
as well now the shield hub is where
you'll find all of your games through
Nvidia both atomize for the k1 processor
like half-life 2 2 games also found in
the Google Play Store now I wasn't able
to get the Nvidia shield controller on
time since the controller was released
at a later date but I highly recommend
purchasing that controller as it makes a
world of difference and I've really
missed that on that opportunity
now another Nvidia feature is the Nvidia
console which allows you to connect your
tablet to your TV at home now and video
doesn't provide a mini HDMI to an HDMI
cable but one that can be brought from
the likes of Amazon or monoprice comm
and again with this wire and with this
feature you can play your games on your
big-screen you can say now another huge
feature that was initially featured on
the original handheld shield is being
able to play your PC games right on the
tablet when streamed over Wi-Fi now with
your PC you do need a Nvidia video card
a 600 series or higher but for my
research a fairly beefy graphics card
and a strong internet connection is a
must but still I've read some folks even
with all that power yet as you can say
is still experiencing some lag at times
so the argument is to use this feature
no one would really go out and purchase
all this equipment just to play on your
countertop or go into the bathroom and
play there but again if you already have
the equipment it does work out pretty
well and of course the last possible
feature which I was best for not
mentioning at my previous Nvidia shield
review was emulation now I haven't tried
this myself considering my research
again deemed it was illegal for news and
there's really no such thing as a
24-hour rule I thought it'd be best did
not show it on my channel but again from
my previous viewers they have mentioned
emulation as being a possibility and
with a k1 processor I would only assume
this thing would be a beast in handling
Nintendo's Super Nintendo I think I'm
pretty sure all the way up to M 64 as
well so with everything mentioned so far
and through my testing I was able to
achieve a little over three hours of
straight hardcore gaming and then
recharging the battery back to fall now
I was able to achieve 6 hours and 49
minutes of video playback web surfing
and normal usage and brightness was on
at 50% the entire time
so overall just speaking of the tablet
itself priced at $300 I believe it's a
great tablet especially with this k1
processor as a gaming device though keep
in mind you need a controller to really
have an enjoyable experience and I'll
admit I was lacking that controller to
even further immerse myself with this
device not to mention the NVIDIA case
that keep this thing propped up then
does the price at that time get a little
bit closer to $400 now if you're a
hardcore gamer and will utilize all
these features that Nvidia is providing
this is currently the best experience of
a tablet a gaming tablet it is that
you'll get so let me know your thoughts
below will do so well in the gaming
community what do you think about the
pros and cons and I hope you enjoyed
