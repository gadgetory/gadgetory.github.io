broom I noticed after some wired
headphone reviews that I've done someone
mentioned they wished certain brands and
models would come Wireless well they
found this bluetooth receiver for wired
headphones called B Tunes at priced at
$99 retail and sometimes discounted on
Amazon so I placed a link in the video
description below for you to check the
most recent prices now they did send me
four different units and I will be
giving away all four units for you guys
to help drum up some exposure for this
small company out in California and if
you're new to the channel rest assured I
will still be doing my full test and
giving credit where credit is due and
for sure pointing out any issues or
flaws that I'd come across so without
further ado I'm here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room
going over the physical features first
there's four models in total fitting
headphones with either a two and half
millimeter or three and half millimeter
port and then there's the specific bose
qc25 and QC 15 models which essentially
are the same in dimensions and materials
used the only difference the QC models
features different stems to fit inside
its ear cups they all have this nice
glossy black finish with the extended
microphone in matte black and the rear
it's a very simple design with an on and
off button and while holding this down
does pair your unit with your phone
while paired you can pause and play your
music with just the tab the flap up top
is for charging the B Tunes to use and
from my personal testing it takes about
two hours to charge from a dead battery
and then regarding battery life be tuned
claims up to 10 hours of powering the
pair of headphones here at moderate
volume with my test I doing all my
batteries and audio devices leaving
volume at 50% to achieve a
middle-of-the-road result here turning
this on at 2:20 in the morning before
going to sleep and letting it play until
it died both headphones one last 11
hours and 22 minutes and the other 11
hours and 43 minutes not bad but back to
the physical design overall the main
part of device is tight and solid it's
no flexing of plastics here or any kind
of creaking when handling the unit
nothing is moving at all the only real
complaint that I had which isn't major
to be honest with you the USB port is
very very snug whether using the
supplied USB cable or your own but
everything about the build is honestly
well constructed now trying this with
the most popular headphones that people
are designed wireless features this fits
perfectly into my bose qc25 s and my
beats solo2 that i'm testing today
overall wearing this despite having a
battery inside the B Tunes is
lightweight without weighing one side of
your headphone down and then regarding
aesthetics while wearing this is
objective with some considering this
large on the side of your face well some
may be more accepting and you can be the
judge on that but keep in mind there's a
bluetooth 4.0 receiver inside a battery
that powers the B tunes and it provides
power to the speaker's there's a
built-in microphone and NFC now going
into performance here NFC works like a
dream with tapping the side of the B
Tunes to your NFC enabled phone and it
pairs right away regarding the
microphone here's a quick test to see
how they sound
I'm hey it's me yeah a few minutes sure
and doesn't this bluetooth receiver that
I have on my headphones just wondering
about the audio quality does it sound
clear on your end yeah it seems pretty
clear there's a little bit of a static
in the background it's really quiet not
noticeable but other than that you're
very clear does it sound like a speaking
kind of far away like on a speakerphone
by the Chancellor didn't sound more
natural it's not very natural okay all
right that's uh really uh that's really
it for the test thank you oaky
all right bye I am less than may be the
most important part here does the sound
quality stay intact and how is the
wireless range V Tunes does offer aptX
technology identical to what some of the
other big-name brands on the market are
offering insuring that the Bluetooth
encoding retains a CD quality signal
testing this again am i boasting Beats
headphones the sound quality compared to
using the wired was equal in my opinion
but found in every test and every phone
that I used switching from a wired
connection to the B Tunes resulted in
lower volume they were just not as loud
as using a wire system now this was
found on the bose qc25 as well where i
noticed loudness would drop a slight bit
regardless if it's Apple or Android and
regardless what smartphone that I'd use
this could very well be a Bluetooth
matter and not be Tunes themselves and
just I guess the nature of going
wireless as for the wireless range I had
taken this out to a big open area and
measure the distance in between each
support column with my laser tape
measure I also placed a microphone in
the video and you might be able to hear
some audio coming through from the
headphones that way you can see or hear
proof or evidence and when these
headphones start to disconnect the first
is with beats using the newest 6th
generation iPod touch and I was able to
achieve 30 feet in my first try in 35
linear feet on my second attempt as for
the qc25
walking backwards here into the
Bluetooth signal cuts off I was able to
achieve 30 feet on both attempts most
wireless ranges are about 30 feet
claimed by the manufacturers and based
on these tests these results were as
good so overall besides the volume
dropping a slight bit when using this
adapter and this could very well be
because we're using bluetooth and not a
direct wired connection and also the
size like I said the size is subjective
I'm pleased with the performance
general if you're absolutely designed
Wireless on an already bought wired
headphones this is a great solution now
for the giveaway I highly recommend
going to their website to ensure your
headphones would be compatible now I'm
not responsible if it doesn't fit your
headphones I'll put a link in the video
description again for your convenience
