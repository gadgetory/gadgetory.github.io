and just see how close a bunch of pair
of headphones compares to my beloved
bose qc25 2s and my sony 1000x and the
reason why not worry I reached out to
tell atronics and asked them to send
over their antsy headphones but as
always I'll be going over both pros and
cons if anything my test will prove
which one is better later in this video
you can experience what I'm experiencing
in those audio tests now these are
priced at $60 at the time this video as
always click on my links down in that
video description below for the most
updated prices in real time you never
know what this thing might go on sale
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review and I'm here
to help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone to another video
going over the physical features first
I wouldn't expect premium materials and
such but the tile Tronics does a pretty
decent job though for the $60 price
range from my stress test again I'm not
trying to break these but I'm simply
trying to feel if there's any kind of
flexing bending and of course any kind
of noises
they'll indicate any kind of weak areas
the tile atronics is all plastic
construction with a faux leather
headband up top I'm not again expecting
pre materials like e both QC 35 to s
with faux leather
I think imitation suede or Alcantara
plastic arms and the ear cups themselves
are made of metals cold to the touch but
yep
to be fair here sony is also all plastic
with that faux leather up top but the
difference between the premium and the
budget model is some sort of coating
that Sonia has you guys can feel and
also kind of hear it too here let me
give you guys a quick demo now although
the materials might not be premium for
non premium headphones again that's okay
that's the point they still function
very well and I don't sense that they're
so cheap to the point where they feel
hollow or they feel fragile but
eletronics feels more like sony's
$100.00 headphones to be honest with you
guys from my personal experience now one
thing that helps tremendously to
supplement the claim the arms are
reinforced with metal keeping helping to
keep the headbands rigidity and
durability if you're looking for cheap
headphones be careful of the ratcheting
system right here they at time don't
hold its shape with the TEL atronics
headphones they stay in place and had
never accidentally extended themselves
when I bend over move around and walk
around and such now jumping into comfort
on Amazon that claiming seven point six
ounces which translates to about 218
grams
now this was a bit weird since I weighed
my Bose QC 35 twos and my Sony's
headphones here on my trusty scale that
it has been accurate for the top tronics
once I put it on the scale I'm getting
about 280 grams now with that being said
wearing them for several
was straight I never had any kind of
pinching or sharp feeling at the top of
my head nor do I have any kind of
clamping force issues around that
jawline these are actually comfortable
to wear and despite them being heavier
out the two other premium models right
here they don't feel heavy the ear cups
themselves are decent though I wish they
encapsulated my ears a little bit better
I do feel like a little bit of a gap
right here right below my earlobe for
some reason but they still provide
passive noise isolation they do seal
just enough but a little bit more
confidence like these other ear cups on
these other premium headphones would
have been nice now the top of my ears do
rub against the inside lining which
isn't too bad the Sony 1000 XM threes
again to be fair has the same experience
as well they've both QC 35 twos they're
just so Hollow so recessed in that my
ears don't touch anything
Bose is the king for comfort though now
for the $350 Sony headphones and also
the Bose QC 35 twos and also the
taotronics I've never had any kind of
ear sweats and I've worn them all three
of them through three hours straight my
ears do warm up but none of the nasty
stickiness that comes out on a on a warm
in a warm room or so now let's get a
closer look very simple physical buttons
vibe up and down with a click if you
hold either one of them down this will
skip and go back in a song power on and
off is held down but if you press it
during music it will pause and play your
song for you there is a three-and-a-half
millimeter port for physical connections
and yes although the headphones are off
you can have active noise-cancelling on
power and ANC are independent from each
other the only thing missing from Bose
is voice assistance what's missing from
Sony or its touch sensitive controls and
audio features like transparency mode or
the ability to control how much agency
you want to be activated now on the far
left side the left ear cup that is we're
still stuck with USB 2.0 for charging
but for a budget pair of headphones cell
Tronics makes this a big time with
offering some of the fastest fast
charging that is speeds that I
personally experienced Tyrannis is
claiming something very similar to Sony
with five minutes on the charger giving
you two hours of playback
I know Sony's gonna be a little bit
better I'll just place it right here for
you guys but to fully charge the
headphones though how tronic claims they
can take 25 to 30 minutes from a dead
battery to full that's impressive
now this budget headphones also claims
up to 30 hours of playback which beats
the most QC 35 2s and some of the other
premium headphones headsets out there
but it is equal to the Sony 1000 X and 3
testing it on my end running the battery
down with 50% bond and a and C on the
same test that I do for these guys as
well I hope I have the results on the
screen for you now what is also newer
and surely nice to see Bluetooth 5.0 is
offered on these things this is the
latest technology in which all
headphones had this from now on but
testing the signal strength I walked
down the hallway here at the office with
one wall in between me here I got a
crazy distance of a hundred linear feet
on both my iPhone 10 and samsung si plus
and I couldn't go any further because
I've reached the end of the building now
testing both phones once again with
video there's been no syncing issues on
Netflix YouTube or twitch now the one
limitation that I saw on the budget
headphones and oddly the flagship Sony
headphones as well you're only able to
pair one device at a time if you want to
pair with another device you have to
terminate that Bluetooth connection
first and then pair it to another device
and then redo it again if you want to
repair back to that same device with
Bose you can compare it you can pay her
to multiple devices up to eight I
believe now last but not least sound
leaking is slight but within reason with
the taotronics speaker phone wise my
voice was not bad very much audible but
the taotronics headphones do pick up a
lot of background noises now jumping
into active noise-cancelling performance
make sure you put on your own headphones
your earphones that's the only way that
you can listen to my audio test and full
clarity and interpret 3d audio sound
keep in mind the video quality isn't the
best here but I focused more so on the
audio sample how to speak my camera in
here and before I start be sure to LIKE
and subscribe and throw some fire emojis
in the video description down below and
here we go
power on your phone is connected
all right folks so from my assessment
and test these Sony X threes are the
best hands down you can tell it's easy
to identify these are the king of a and
C headphones for the time being as for
the post QC 35 to s
and the taotronics they're close and I
gotta give credit to these pair of $60
headphones because it's so close to the
flagships but you can tell during my
test here it doesn't block up more than
the $350 boost QC 35 to s if anything
these taotronics performed closer to the
sennheiser 450 bt and C's which is no
slouch either but again very close
pretty close to much more expensive
headphones also with the taotronics I
don't feel the air cabin pressure
feeling like the Bose and I hear less
hissing and these when a and C is active
now getting into the audio performance
is going to be a little different that's
how I onyx are a little bit base here so
heads up on that please again put on
your earphones or headphones if you
haven't done so already to experience my
microphones here we go alright folks put
on your headphones or earphones to get
the best possible experience I'm gonna
play some amazing kappa' rate for your
music
all right so they're having folks of
course audio recorded on my microphones
and then play through your headphones or
earphones are not the most accurate
depiction of audio quality but this is
the closest that you can get here here
goes my audio analysis no I just want to
show you guys these do fold as well
now these headphones are able to get
loud and should satisfy most people you
might have been able to tell the test
here but these are slightly base your
headphones especially against the Bose
headphones there is some resonating bass
on the low end here compared to the bose
qc25 2s it's thumping but still clean in
this area without sounding cheap
fluttered and sloppy it's well put
together and well rounded the mid-range
however did sound boxy though or
slightly recessed that 50% vine the even
compared to these sony 1000x m3s once I
turn this up to 60 to 70% volume and
after maybe about an hour of burnin I
didn't notice that boxiness as much as
before and since this review is for
budget-conscious buyers yet you want the
best audio in the price range in other
words you're cheap like me I like the
way that the taotronics perform the only
thing really missing though is the
resolution of these headphones
Wow using Bose you can pick up little
details and not to mention a wider
soundstage you don't get that with the
taotronics unfortunately the Saudis are
a little bit busy as well so the
resolution or detail when I did the full
review on this I did also state it's not
as clear per se as the Bose but the
Sony's do sound great with EDM pop hip
hop same thing with the taotronics
you're just both on these headphones
you're losing a little bit of the
fidelity resolution but for a general
listening audio these are fine a touch
phonics are perfectly fine it does give
them some time to break in and give you
ears a chance to acclimate to the sound
as for the high notes they're not ear
piercing they don't ting and those very
high frequencies however after about
three hours again of straight use at
about 65 to 70% Bom you know I'm kind of
bumping it you don't mean the hum or the
harmony and the upper mid to high
frequencies of vocals that does cause a
little bit of listening fatigue a little
bit of droning to the ears compared to
these other two right here so overall
again keep in mind for 60
dollars in generic use if you're not an
audiophile but just looking for a
quality product I think these did well
no gimmicks no extra special features
good audio quality for the price and
with active noise-cancelling performs
closer to a hundred to $200 headphones
there's some value for therefore right
there basically your call are these were
the consideration on your end let me
know down in that comment section below
let me know if I should review more
budget stuff as well because this one
actually took me by surprise Wow alright
folks that's it guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
