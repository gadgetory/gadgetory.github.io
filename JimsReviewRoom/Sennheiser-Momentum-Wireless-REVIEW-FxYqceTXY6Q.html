Jim's review room after testing the bose
qc25 s they were the best noise
cancelling headphones i've tried at the
time now with Sennheiser reaching out
and letting me borrow their whopping
$500 pair of noise cancelling headphones
I had to give them a shot and see how
good these are what I have here are the
Sennheiser momentum Wireless so I'm here
helping the average consumer make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room going over the
physical features first looks are of
course objective and you can be to judge
for yourself the closed back and over
your model have here features real
leather with stainless steel arms and
the ear cups themselves are painted
ivory now they do come in black leather
with yellow stitching which looks good
as well but these do exude a vintage
look now looking at the quality and
craftsmanship of its build it's quite
impressive considering its straying away
from this super glossy paint scheme or
excessive use of plastics like other
brands and models on the market
currently now starting with the headband
first there's cushion but it feels more
dense or more stiff compared to the
original wired Momentum's that I
reviewed a few months back but more my
comfort test a little bit later now
moving down to the pivots here it's
all-metal construction with four flush
socket screws and I don't see anything
plastic they would wear out over time
right at the hinge in general performing
my stress test everything held up well
with no cracks creaks or squeaks in all
materials staying intact and now going
down to the ear cups here this is one
design that now after testing so many
other headphones I really do appreciate
instead of having that traditional
headband that offers an extendable
clicking arm the Momentum's slide up and
down on this metal rail place your thumb
on this and with enough force it moves
up and down
very
naturally now there's just enough
tension that keeps the ear cups in place
as well and even stress testing these
ear cups repeatedly moving it back and
forth to determine its quality the ear
cups does slightly become easier to move
over time but still provided enough
firmness to hold the ear cups in place
now going over the ear pads themselves
these are very plush now this doesn't
feel like traditional foam but more on
the memory foam side of things if you've
ever felt the ear pads on the beats
solo2 tour maybe these Samsung level
overs that's how they feel but with
these they're just a bit thicker in my
opinion over time of wearing these they
are very comfortable now sitting in the
average 70 degree room and listening to
these for a good while they do get warm
after about 30 minutes I'm wearing but I
never sweated and there was nothing out
the ordinary that was a nuisance
compared to other headphones despite
them being leather now moving on to
wireless performance I test this leaving
my phone upstairs and walk to the other
side of the house downstairs and I've
never lost the signal on the Momentum's
an additional features slowly making its
way to headphones are NFC or what they
call a near field communication if you
have NFC on your phone tap the side of
the left ear cup and pairing basically
is automatic but let's say you don't
want to go wireless or if you're running
out of batteries Sennheiser does include
a one point four meter or about a four
and a half foot long super-lightweight
cable if you want or need to connect
this physically no one Den is of course
the three half millimeter connection
while the other end goes into the ear
cup with a two and half millimeter plug
with a secure locking mechanism and it
holds out very well to now power and
pairing button located further up here
with the vine rocker buttons directly
below now pushing in two consecutive
time skips your song forward and
pressing three times in a row move the
song back one and this works both on my
iPad air 2 and the samsung galaxy note 4
phone confirming that this works both on
iOS and Android powered devices now
there's one last way to connect this and
this is personally a first for me
if you have a micro USB cord laying
around or the core they supply to charge
your headphones plug this into the
computer let it install the drivers and
set your headphones then as the default
speakers and you can listen to your
headphones through the USB cord pretty
cool have options like that but since
we're talking about the USB charge
Kable here sennheiser claimed up to 22
hours of battery-life
now i tested this living it on the
entire day and night and was able to
achieve a crazy 25 hours and nine
minutes to be exact of straight music
playing at 50% volume just to give you a
good medium to gauge your expected use
so with all these accessories the
headphones USB charging cable 3 and 1/2
millimeter wire and not mention earlier
the airplane audio adapter sent as it
does provide a soft and decent hard
carrying case on the outside it's soft
to the touch while the inside its felt
line with a convenient pocket to store
all of your cables provided and unlike
the original Momentum's the wireless
version does fold in and compare to the
original this does save a good amount of
space now let's get into my comfort test
then noise cancelling performance and
last are these sound characteristics
now I'm usually sensitive at the jawline
with some headphones putting too much
pressure right at the jawbone now this
was not the case at all now if you look
closely at the ear cups the headband is
able to adjust back and forth
eliminating the need to sit right at the
crown of the head virtually no
discomfort was felt because of this
design in addition if you compare the
weight of these two other headphones
they're still slightly lighter than most
out there at 265 grams now compared to
the original over ear Momentum's they
only weighed a hundred and ninety grams
which is crazy light nonetheless the
comfort and ease though are still very
much enjoyable now as for the active
noise cancelling features it works well
and I can for sure say it works better
than the Samsung level overs I tested a
few months back now there's barely any
hits from the active noise canceling
that could tell but when compared to the
best of the best the noise canceling
performance the bose qc25 has this beat
these Momentum's does block most noises
and is for sure one of the better
performers but I was still able to pick
up some small conversations when my
volume set was on medium now the qc25
nearly shuts up the entire world when
you put them on they're on a whole
different level now onto the bread and
butter here for those who have been
following me they know I like clean
sound with a slight amount of paste
they're turning these up to at least 80
percent was when I noticed I can
here all the characteristics and without
any hearing fatigue basically without
rubbing your ears after you're done
listening now starting with bass these
headphones gives just the right touch to
really make John rus' of EDM and today's
pop music really shine cascade our
modern music to Bruno Mars ed Sheeran
and maroon 5 to name a few it's deep
enough that's not overdone and
complements the mid-range and high
ranges as well very much for a long time
listening my ears are not droned out or
numb from hearing fatigue now if you're
using this for Jay Z Rick Ross Nicki
Minaj and likes Sennheiser provides just
enough bass to make these genres still
very enjoyable but still keeping that
mid-range strong with its clarity now
these don't go as deep as the beats by
Jerry products for some people say
because of its base it makes the
mid-range a bit muddy but again with
these Sennheiser's these are base
forward enough to really make a lot of
these other genres and genres of rap and
hip-hop etc sound very good and as
briefly mentioned the mid-range sounds
great they're not bright but they're not
dull sounding either voices don't sound
boxy or nasal like what actually sounded
natural and although a bass boost
signature is provided mids still retains
clarity now for a $500 pair of
headphones though I really wish that
they had a more open soundstage like
these Sennheiser HD 8 DJ's that I tested
a while back and as for the high notes
and treble where you hear snares pops
cymbal crashes etc they don't sound
harsh at all there's no tinging and ear
ringing tones
there's no sharpness that's ear piercing
whatsoever now this includes rock music
as well which I forgot to mention
earlier but all these genres sounds
really really well done but just to make
it easier here the ones on row idly
enough that didn't seem to do as well
what's classical music hearing piano
notes the lower mid-range felt as though
it was more dominant than the upper band
of notes and then with the higher notes
of piano keys it sounded a bit
resonating fuzzy and almost like a
slight echo as well again these
headphones seems to be more designed for
today's mainstream music and with all of
this audio performance for my last test
here is the sound leaking now I place
these on maximum volume and at a
distance of someone sitting right next
to me
you can just barely hear them on so
overall these are one of the best
headphones that I've tested recently the
build quality the aesthetics and fashion
is no question at the forefront with
sound being a very good balance all
around with a sound signature that I
think most modern-day listeners will
enjoy the only issue I can really see at
the moment is its price tag of $500 so I
hope this video helped you in some way
if you like my work add me
