welcome back to another one of my vlogs
here I'm just making one it sporadically
for no apparent reason just wanna keep
you guys in the Lucas tons of stuff
coming down on the channel next couple
of weeks here is when I give you guys a
sneak peek of what's coming down so
let's talk about tech
hey everyone let's get started right now
the first piece of news is not so great
though you guys probably have already
heard about it all over the media
samsung note 7 i am returning that thing
no matter what a lot of you guys have
showed a lot of care and concern i show
much love thank you guys very much um
but yes i still have it to answer your
question a lot of people ask me about
that and yes i will be returning it and
the reason being last night Monday night
on october 10 2016 samsung officially
announced turn off all of your note
sentences turn them off altogether even
the replacement phones some of them not
all obviously but some of them have been
catching on fire and a report from last
night which was for me the strongly
camel's back even when it's not plugged
in the phone still caught fire so I
forget it forget it forget i don't wanna
get injured i don't wanna burn down my
studio but not my car hurt somebody hurt
myself whatever it may be I can always
read by the phone just let Samsung do
its thing and just get the issue fixed
for God's sakes of course safety is the
number one priority um so in the
meantime uh what am I gonna do I might
get the LGV 20 that I'm still debating
about that no promises just yet I love
the v10 the note 7 was one of the best
ones ever used the v10 was one of the
best ones ever used despite it being
chunky and just heavy duty on that
besides that the LGV 20 which I might be
getting other new cameras that are
coming out is he Sony a 6500 the five
axis image stabilization alone is
something that I I definitely definitely
want I don't think I'm gonna buy the
camera though so we'll see we'll see I
got tons out of the stuff lined up for
Christmas for the holiday season so I'm
kinda where of buying another camera at
the moment and also there's a new sony
rx100 mark 5 right now you're watching
the mark for in us and all of its glory
great camera the mark for that is for a
point and shoot it is the best point and
shoot but again you're paying a thousand
dollars for it it does have a little bit
of some of its quirks like when I do a
video recording if I do it for an
extended period of time let's say 30
minutes straight
having that much I think it does
overheat it does need to shut down at
times the the new one the mark five will
have probably one of the fastest
autofocus systems out there which is
great i'm still happy with the mark for
to BSU that camera still debating on the
fence if i'm going to get it or not so
we'll see other things coming down the
road here or today i'm at the my
favorite park here that i always record
at finishing up the review as you just
finish up recording the apple watch
series to love you guys been asking me
about that fabulous watch I'm not biased
or anything like that if it works great
good and seriously guys just a sneak
peek this is a really really good
product I really enjoyed using it of
course there's some corks with it it's
nothing's perfect basically but overall
use I never only Apple watch one but
with this experience I'm really really
impressed so that review should be
coming out shortly again just filming is
finishing up that hopefully today
tonight and then that review should be
either tomorrow which is wednesday if
not tomorrow then probably thursday the
latest other things coming down the road
a lot of you guys have been asking about
these new sony headphones i am trying to
work with my guy here trying to get it
before the street release date um can
hook me up but it's really tough right
now so if worst case center i might
preorder it myself and uh of course not
that review alfred guys do that thorough
testing that you guys always enjoy I so
that's it for this episode here let me
know if it's something that you guys
enjoy let's talk tech and if you guys do
enjoy shoot me that like let me know in
a comment section below give me some
feedback again these videos are quick
fast paced in crappy editing just for
you guys so let me know uh and that's
about it you guys take care I'll see you
in the next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
