review room now creative labs the makers
of this portable Bluetooth speaker has
been known for at least more in the late
90s and 2000's of making some amazing
sound cards for desktop PCs now creative
labs in general are sound engineers
researchers and developers in this audio
industry and when some of my followers
told me about this speaker had to get a
pair for myself to test press that just
149 dollars it's already a great price
point with all the included features so
without further ado welcome to another
review
going over its physical features first
this thing is nicely compact with
measurements of just seven point nine
inches wide
4.5 inches deep in stands at just 2.2
inches tall and this compact size feels
like it has some meat to it when you're
holding it but it only weighs in at 2.5
pounds overall the construction is very
well done with no flexing whatsoever
the majority unit is made of an all
aluminum mesh grill with the rest a
grippy silicone finish buttons are
clicky and responsive with buttons on
the back though a bit too squishy for my
taste but no question they all function
perfectly fine the speaker boasts two
speakers on the front two radiators on
the side and one subwoofer on the top
with creative suggesting amazing sound
and deep bass but before getting into
possibly your fork sound here what makes
this speaker stand out is the packed
features included now going over the
buttons first we have of course your
power on/off button and next to that is
the roar button which creative states
increases sound fields and bass but more
on that during my audio test now volume
buttons are to follow and last on top
here is the pairing and answering phone
calls button as this doesn't work as a
speakerphone now to the far left here
has your battery indicator which I wish
was more than just three lights in an
area to tap your NFC capable or
compatible device for easy pairing now
rotating to the back here you have the
AC adapter input and although this is a
wireless speaker you can use a 3.5
millimeter cable to physically connect
your device to the axillary port and
third is a new feature I'm seeing on
more higher-end Bluetooth speakers which
is a charge
port connect your USB cable here and you
can charge your phone tablet etc and
when you need a little bit of juice on a
go let's say at the park or at the beach
anywhere you don't have a wall outlet
and continuing on a micro USB port is
available for connecting this to your
computer for listening to audio and
another feature which is a first for me
after reviewing so many Bluetooth
speakers here is a micro SD card slot
allowing you to play music right off the
card but I'm not sure how many people
will actually use this feature but
having it available I guess it's nice
you can say and finishing up its feature
and button list you have an option to do
self recording which works good in my
opinion when sitting about two feet away
speaking naturally and using a tape
measure sitting about three and a half
feet away the recording is still good
but you can tell in the audio playback
that I'm somewhat sitting back or away
from the speaker itself just a bit but
what's even more interesting you can
switch the mic to mute on the back and
you can record any audio that's coming
in from your three and 1/2 millimeter
port or your Bluetooth source kind of
like how we use to record songs off the
radio with cassette tapes back in the
day now all seriousness the sound
quality does diminish though somewhat
when you go back and re-listen and all
these audio recordings are saved
directly to your micro SD card with no
real option though of deleting unwanted
files now next are self-explanatory
pause / play and shuffle buttons after
that is the LS button indicating link
security you can limit or prevent
unwanted people from pairing to your
device and the very last feature here is
an available alarm which just blares a
siren when you have the alarm switch to
arm and then pare down the alarm button
down for 30 seconds it's more of an
attention-getter than a security
deterrence that I thought it was and to
activate creatives proclaimed terror
base just press the alarm button once
and then it's activated or deactivated
again more on this sound test shortly so
there's no question the build quality is
amazing and the features are great but
how does it sound I'll play a sample
song and give you my verdict afterwards
here's Robo takis remix of inside of me
you
a base on a base
and there you have it folks now sound of
course is best heard in person and when
playing this through your speakers it's
not the best depiction of audio quality
now hence my review here this thing does
have amazing bass for a Bluetooth
speaker it is more balanced bass unlike
the beats by dre products where it's
really based dominant but compared to
many others out there there's enough and
with the roars terror bass on it takes
it up just a slight notch making sure
those who want just a bit more bass
without droning out other audio field
satisfied it's quite impressive if
you're looking for a balanced speaker
overall sounds and vocals do sound
accurate and distinct as the best of the
best speakers on the market today with
enough body to make the low and
mid-range fields fulfilling and
regarding the high notes although the
speaker is loud for a Bluetooth speaker
the high notes are not tingey
again just overall really impressed with
a speaker and its output now for my test
in movies I played star trek into
darkness and I believe this is where the
roar really shines the audio quality is
immersive and more forward than my Bose
Soundlink to that I have here actor
voices are more forward all while in the
background you can still hear the minut
details again I'm very impressed
mr. Spock I'm aware that I have no right
to ask this of you but please
you cannot know that I'm
Engineering manually dropped us out of
warp sir this should check off did you
break my ship so during all my testing
and using the roar I was able to achieve
7 hours and 38 minutes of news about 20
minutes lower than what creative claimed
which is just slightly lower than the
newer and higher end speakers on the
market but that's ok considering again
this speaker is only $149 now the audio
is phenomenal for a Bluetooth speaker
and if you're in the market for one this
has to be the best bang for the buck at
the moment and I can safely say this
beats my current favorite speaker they
both sound like three which is priced at
$300 so hope this review helped you in
