review room now if you're still using
those built-in speakers on your laptop
or even speakers built into your
computer monitor please it's time to
upgrade just speaking in general any
pair of speakers would do justice over
those that comes with your devices and
they don't have to be expensive either
now a few followers on my facebook and
twitter surprisingly at the same time
asked me to review the JBL pebbles about
a week or two ago now I've always been a
believer you get what you pay for but
I'm always happy to find budget-priced
items that performs well now I
personally paid $50 for these and you
can find a link in the video description
for updated pricing but at $50 I really
want to see how this performs since
they're getting some attention on the
web currently so without further ado I'm
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to Jim's
review
right off the bat these are bigger than
what I thought from the photos they're
about five and a quarter inches tall and
five and three-quarters inches in depth
and about three inches wide now these
are not Bluetooth sadly they're not
Wireless but they do offer a very easy
yet aesthetically pleasing cable
management system for example the left
speaker holding the three half
millimeter wire to connect to the right
channel is wrapped around the base it
unwraps to a maximum of 34 inches from
end to end
perfect for laptops and single monitor
computer setups
now as for a to monitor desk make sure
you measure your area to make sure you
those speakers don't block your monitors
while going to the right speaker here
another cord is fixed to the housing and
it's a 34 inch USB cord that powers the
speakers and slowly coming on to the
scene here that you same USB cord also
provides audio as well now JBL does
include a small three half millimeter
wire just in case you need to connect
this to your phone or other devices for
sound now a benefit yet a negative as
well yes it is one less wire and the USB
connection is convenient for laptop and
desktop users but if you want to plug in
your phone or tablet one you have to
have your computer on at all times or
have a computer with a USB port that's
always powered and strong enough to
power these speakers to and then maybe
you can have your laptop or desktop off
now sadly my laptop's two USB ports were
unable to do anything
the Pebbles doesn't have a port for a
wall adapter and of course none are
supplied however now this is kind of
stirring away from what the factory
offers I utilized a phone USB charging
adapter and it works perfectly fine then
it's a quick and easy fix
now overall the build quality is great
JBL features hard plastics on the rear
with a very strong metal mesh grille on
the front and part of the sides
now there's brushed aluminum textured
plates that's fixed on the Left channel
but on the right speaker does feature a
nice feeling volume adjusting dial now
on the opposite ends here of each
speaker are color accents but are
actually a rubber base for when you
choose to place this speaker horizontal
now more on that little bit later and
are rotating to the rear here there's
small base ports with the bottom of each
speaker offering very grippy rubber
feet so with all that being said how's
the sound test afterwards Oh
and there you have it folks now sound
recorded on my end then played through
your speakers are not the best depiction
of audio quality so hence my review here
for $50 the sound from this is quite
impressive now keep in mind it's still a
2.0 system with no subwoofer but if
you're looking for something small
compact no need to mess around with the
subwoofer these provide a balanced tone
with the rest of the sound
characteristics of these speakers you
won't get deep bass nor your speakers
will shake or rattle but again for $50 I
label these as being good they're also
loud enough to fill a small room with
music while watching Netflix or movies
basically I did tone it down to about
50% when sitting in front of the laptop
these do get loud but with being loud is
there any distortion well I gotta say
hardly both music and movie sounds crisp
clean and clear in my opinion only on
extreme notes in songs with volume all
the way up then you hear the high notes
start to become raspy a little bit there
and that clarity and music in general is
a bit lost but overall for general and
personal listening for the price of just
being 50 dollars the audio quality is
good now one thing before I let you go
here there speakers when standing up
seems to fire all that sound almost at a
45-degree angle kind of up at your
ceiling you can say as stated earlier
you can place this horizontally as an
option in turn 2 JBL low goes slightly
inward and you do receive more
directional sound it's a bit more
immersion into what you're listening to
overall I'm really happy with these
despite lacking a power adapter I can
always overcome this with a phone
charger of course in short it will power
your speaker's properly though and
seconds not really a downfall again
since it justifies the price but
bluetooth on these would have been great
for my smart phone but the build quality
and more importantly for a 2.0 $50
speaker setup I really like the sound
quality on these so hope this review
helped you in some way if you like my
work remember to add me gyms review room
onto Facebook Twitter and Instagram to
see what I do behind the scenes that's a
good way to stay in contact with me too
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room you
guys take care and I'll see you in the
next one
