James review room now no a lot of
readers and viewers have been asking me
about this activity band and for the
past week or so I receive at least
several messages a day and when this
review is coming out well the head of
her testing for some time now and I'm
pleased to present to you the jaybird
reign now it's priced at 199 dollars
which is somewhat on the pricey side but
we'll go over its features and functions
and see if it's worth the price tag so
without further ado welcome to another
review
going over the physical features first
jaybird includes all the accessories
that allows the band to function
there's the hypoallergenic super soft
daily wearing silicone band it doesn't
have any overlapping parts and it's
magnetically interlocking and
surprisingly this works very well in
wearing this almost 24/7 never did it
once unsnap on me now also in the Box
our sport bands silicone stretch bands
that hugs your wrist when you're in more
intensive activities and land and when
swimming and with this particular design
like some other activity band makers the
brains of the tracker is removable and
it snaps into place and that's one of
the things I really tested since it's
just magnetized now as the rain has no
locking mechanism it left me a bit
questionable but the design recesses
into each band pretty deep and there's
no stretching the band itself so I
haven't had the computer fall out or
felt really insecure about it which is a
huge relief now the last wearable
accessory is the bike strap that wraps
around your ankle and secured by the
velcro strap which is are pretty
self-explanatory for using when biking
now either one of these bands are very
comfortable to wear very lightweight and
especially the silicone bands they are
very soft to the touch
and I'll let the aesthetics be your
judgment if it seats your style by going
back to the tracker here tapping on the
band four times
glows green indicating your progress for
that day and more than that once I get
into the app and after a very quick
second maybe a bit too quick the time is
then displayed and at first for anyone
including myself I was a bit confused to
understand but after a bit of practice
in a few days it became somewhat more
natural there's 12 LEDs lined and right
in the center is the halfway point or
one would indicate 6:00 a.m. or 6:00
p.m. and you can use that to gauge the
solid red light is the hour-hand
and the blinking light would then
indicate the minute-hand and although
this is an activity band first and a
watch ii providing this feature i don't
think is as intuitive or fluid to read
some people may grasp it pretty quick
while some may take a little bit longer
but there's no on/off switch or a sleep
button either on this device and one of
the benefits and similar to other
competitors out there like polar loop
and misfit shine it can sense when
you're walking running cycling - even
swimming all automatically
and before going into the app jaybird
has released this for Apple devices
first and just a month later after
launch this will be available for
Android as well so both parties will be
able to use this band now at the current
time since this is a very new device and
jaybird is admittedly a small company
compared to the likes of like say Nike
or jawbone and other Fitness companies
there will be a few features that are
not available just yet but getting back
on track here there's three main screen
to the app there's activity sleep and go
zone now with activity as you enter in
your height weight age and a few other
answers when you set up initially the
app will then estimate an activity score
for you to attempt this activity score
is automatically adjusted every day
based on your previous day's performance
in your go zone number which I'll
discuss how that works shortly now
throughout your day the rain
differentiates again just general
movement walking running sports related
activities basically more intensive
general movements the ring can't
technically differentiate playing
basketball versus tennis for example but
the band can differentiate and record
swimming and cycling which I know a lot
of viewers have been asking me about now
not many bands on the market today can
actually do that and being used in a
pool or even worn around the ankle in on
each category you can click on the
bottom gray bar here to expand more
information on that particular day and
as you can see calories burn steps taken
a progress bar and a few others are
shown up top and below is a vertical
timeline to inform you on your progress
and at first it didn't seem like much I
personally would have preferred a
horizontal timeline instead but clicking
on each icon on the vertical line gives
you a bit more data to work with it's
great information but for the average
consumer and like many other bands on
the market a graphical chart and the
day's progress would have been a little
bit much a little bit more easier to see
and interpret and people liked numbers
but they loved an accompanying chart now
the only illustration offered is on the
main home page again and on the very
bottom which cannot be expanded or large
in the last feature which I liked and
which more activity bands offered our
suggestions on how to reach your goal
and at the end of day let's say you're
very close to hitting your number here
take a walk or run for the time
suggested and sure enough you'll succeed
the one item for sure missing at the
moment is a history graph
comparing my performance from the past
day a week or even a year ago and after
discussing this with j-bird
they did announce by January of 2015
this should be an available feature now
next up is sleep with showing what my
previous night was like it's pretty
straight forward to be honest with you
but it's pretty useful and I'm sure most
of us have very busy lives now and sleep
can be all over the place at least mine
is here and like many bands if not all
once you open up the data you can see
what time you've slept what time you had
woken up and this tells you how much
time you've slept with again the
vertical graph with blue lines
indicating times you were Restless or
moved around and going back to the main
homepage here like very much with the
app so far that provides recommendations
on how much sleep you need to basically
catch up and once again after my testing
like many other bands it only discloses
how much sleep you've had I would have
loved to seen light sleep versus deep
sleep to see how restful my night
actually was but again jaybird at least
confirmed sleep details to improve is in
their next update and for the very last
item here is go zone and this is where
it gets a bit technical and a bit unique
that makes this band stand out from the
rest
boom zone measures your heart rate
variability and heart rate variability
and our abbreviated HRV is the variation
of the heart beats interval it's an
indication on how our body is for that
day regardless of what we may think we
feel Jaber tries to explain it as by
saying although you may not feel as
motivated when you get up in the morning
if your heart rate variability is good
you should definitely consider going
running again despite how you feel and
when you do go run you'll be surprised
at how the body performs and when it's
not such a good level it's a day that's
recommended for rest but you can always
do a google search for more information
on HRV so how does it all work basically
every morning within the first 30
minutes of being up you open the app and
tell it to take your HRV measurement you
do have to sit there stationary for two
minutes which for some people may be
accepted while others in practice may
not but you receive a number in between
0 and 100 and a score of 33 or higher
means you're good to go and a number
between 40 and 60 regardless of your
what your body feels that morning your
body during exercise should feel pretty
good and with the go zone number it
supplement the rest of the app providing
a customized activity goal now as an
average consumer and not a scientist I
don't know if this is a placebo effect
or if HRV really works but it does make
me more conscious on what I want to do
for that particular day so all other
ring does have some strong selling
points like being able to swim and bike
as many bands can't even do that and for
those more Fitness focus individuals
heart rate variability may be ideal and
to be honest at the review in so many
bands rain seems like the band that
learns the body the most and provides
feedback and suggestions on how to
improve but for a 200-dollar tracker at
the moment it's still missing some key
features that keeps it up with the
competition
again that's performance and activity
history deeper sleep recognition any
vibrating alarms or alerts when you're
not active for too long and what I think
in general are better visual aids are
still missing instead of just numbers I
think having graphs or bars to show for
example active time versus inactive time
would have been a more impactful way of
looking and comparing the data and
granted some of these features will be
coming down the road but at the time of
this video it's not here and with
several companies now supplementing
their bands with heart rate monitors
polar loop Garmin vivofit and then
vivosmart
LG life band and future bands for $200
or less having heart rate monitoring
built it right into the wrist like basis
peak and Fitbit surge it really puts
jaybird in a tight spot and keep in mind
all these companies mentioned have those
features that are yet available on on
the reign or features that we probably
won't see on the reign in general I
still think jaybird has a great product
and yes does have some strong selling
points and I truly believe their
strategy is and doing very well with
niche features rather than offer an
assortment of features like the others
so tell me below what do you think about
the rain hopefully this video helped you
