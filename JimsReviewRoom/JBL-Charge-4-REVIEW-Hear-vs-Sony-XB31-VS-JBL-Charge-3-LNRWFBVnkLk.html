the years have been buzzing with all
sorts of requests from reviewing
smartwatches to speakers to specific
brands and such one of the most
requested from you the fans have been
specifically JBL folks this is the
charge for you personally asked me to
test I bought this at the retail price
of $149 but as always I'll leave my
affiliate links down in that video
description below click on those links
for the most updated prices in real time
you never know when these things might
go on sale
I'm Jimmy wouldn't Jim's reviewer appear
to help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
now going over the physical features
first it looks nearly identical to the
previous charge 3 which I have here in
red it's ever so slightly bigger we're
talking two centimeter or two and it's a
little bit heavier and the two buttons
on top here have basically just moved
around we'll get a closer look pretty
soon now we still have these seem very
durable abrasion resistant fabric cover
the ip67 certification makes it return
here meaning that you can submerge this
underwater for up to 30 minutes and with
my testing the charge is able to float
making this ideal for the pool or the
lake and we have the same passive base
radiators on the side that moves with
your output now in general compared to
the competition the charge 4 is still a
great design in my personal opinion
still highly durable still highly
functional practical it still looks very
modern - the only critique though it is
starting to push that boundary of being
portable or more specifically that is it
starting to get on the heavier side for
the midsize speaker but let's get a
closer look the buttons on your screen
pretty straightforward the notable
feature for those who are unfamiliar
with JBL is the JBL connect plus feature
you can pair multiple JBL connect plus
speakers at the same time even the older
charge 3 even mix-and-match speakers if
you'd like keep in mind to get stereo
sound you need 2 of the same model
speakers you can't mix and match now I'm
sorry it's to keep the same audio
quality as it would wouldn't sound great
if you had one channel stronger and the
other one weak or you can say not in the
volume button audio characteristics now
a couple of things to look out for one
thing that is no longer available is the
speakerphone option which is very odd
considering every other Bluetooth
speaker offers this you basically can't
take phone calls second the charge for
oddly did away with the voice assistant
on most competitors pressing down a some
sort of multifunction button would
activate Siri or Google assistance but
we don't have that option available in
the app to enable anymore maybe a
firmware updates down the road would fix
that now rotating to the rear behind
this water-resistant flap JBL graciously
made the switch to USBC which is awesome
thank you for future proofing this
speaker here a pin a millimeter port for
physical connections and JBL keeps the
charge name
with an USB out to charge your devices
usually the speaker like a power bank
you can charge your phone speaking of
power the charge for it retains an up to
20 hour better life which is still up
top or on top of most competitors by
testing this at 50% in vine I was able
to achieve only 9 hours and 14 minutes
into the unit died well this is common
among Bluetooth speakers as that's their
up to value that could have been tested
at bear little vine but compared to the
major competitor like these sony xba-1
to get a apples to apples comparison I
was able to get 10 hours and 15 minutes
on that particular speaker as with the
UE boom 3 be sure to subscribe to the
channel and turn on notifications to see
when that is released or if I'm done
testing that I'll have that link down in
that video description below
either or despite a slightly larger
battery inside whoops
despite a larger battery inside the
charge for it doesn't necessarily be out
the competition all right so enough
about power here
how about signal performance the charge
for has Bluetooth 4.2 which I'm okay
with
I would have preferred Bluetooth 5.0 to
future-proof this thing again but the 4
to the 4.2 that is I was able to achieve
a range of 89 linear feet outdoors which
for the average consumer should be
enough if anything to charge for signal
is equal to the competitors out there
now testing this with movies on my
samsung phone no syncing issues no
delays in the audio as for Apple Netflix
works fine if there was a delay it's
probably a nanosecond or so but man
YouTube that was completely jacked up
horrible delays here alright folks let's
get into the audio test so please put on
your headphones or earphones as I'll be
using binder microphones for the 3d
audio test for those who are new it's an
awesome experience and for Team Jin's
review members let's light up that
comment session let's see those fire
emojis
let's see you guys show up in force
alright guys here we go alright folks
put on those headphones or earphones
they get the best audio experience here
was the first song
how you feel as long as you can show me
a good time
I don't need promises honestly no big
deal as long as you can show me a good
Oh
they want you to how you feel as long as
you can show me a good time
I don't need promises honestly no big
deal as long as you can show me good
and there you have it folks now one
thing I want to point out while most
front-facing speakers have dual drivers
even on the charge three it has dual
drivers Aelita charge for decide to now
go with just one speaker fixed to the
right side is that even in the center
for some reason but you can't really
tell him person unless you literally
stand like two feet in front of the
speaker and then you hear the audio
coming more so in your right ear but
again it's very minimal for my testing
if anything now knowing for sure it's
mono audio though I was taken aback by
that but to be fair please as an
unbiased review as an unbiased consumer
how does it perform in the real world
how will your ears interpret this first
doing a very quick comparison with each
charge 3 the audio difference is very
minuttes but a difference nonetheless
and a charge 3 is still an exceptional
speaker with the missing features on the
charge for that honestly didn't see why
you would want to upgrade to the charge
for coming from the charge 3 unless you
want USBC or so the audio difference
from my assessment switching back and
forth over and over again your charge 3
has ever so slight deeper bass while the
audio frequencies were still very close
together you can save the charge for was
ever so slightly lesson based though but
the frequency separation was much more
appearance making bass hurt in its own
realm or you can say frequencies and
then vocals this creates a bit more
depth in the audio allowing you the
consumer to experience a wider variety
of audio also on the charge port I
noticed the vocals were cleaner not
brighter not more Ford per se but the
clarity is slightly more pronounced also
I interpreted the charge for being
slightly airier or having a wider
soundstage and vocals hits a slightly
higher note now if I can give you an
analogy a very loose analogy but being
dead serious of the overall comparison
between the charge through any charge
for think of your burger at your
favorite fast-food joint now hang in
here hang with me here you can take a
bite
this it tastes good you move on that's
the charge three the charge for to take
a bite you first taste the Angus beef
then the freshly cut onions then these
sourness and brightness of the fresh
crunchy pickles that's the difference
there's a bit more dimension in the
audio the charge for is slightly better
but honestly if you didn't have them
side by side for most average consumers
you're not going to realize it save your
money folks I'm looking out for you guys
you guys already have the charge three
really no big deal to have an upgrade
well compared to the competition now the
charge for is hands-down still one of
the best before a midsize bluetooth
speakers out there even though the audio
hasn't changed much it's a little bit
more refined for the Passover years of
testing though even newer speakers at
the studio the charge still has cleaner
punchy bass the vocals are more
pronounced and detailed it's lively and
the high notes worth still hits but it's
never sharp on top and ever since that
being dull born or even severely rolled
off the biggest difference between the
other main competitors Yui and Sony and
all the budget speakers that I recently
reviewed on the channel a charge for
still has a very recognizable depth to
its audio adding much more character
through the experience instead of simply
just being a loud and in-your-face
speaker that's the difference in the
charge for against the competitors so
folks I hope this helped you in some way
let me know if this is still a great
speaker despite some of the changes or
even some of the takeaways please be
sure to show your support by following
