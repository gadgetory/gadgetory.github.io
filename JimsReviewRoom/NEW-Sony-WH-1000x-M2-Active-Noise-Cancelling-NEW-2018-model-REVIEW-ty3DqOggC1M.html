twos they're great pair of headphones
but they were very similar practically
identical to the previous generation
that it wasn't much of an upgrade but
hey if it's not broken why fix it right
now could it be the same with the sony
MDR 1000x from last year and ewh 1000x
that was just recently released i
personally paid for both of these the
new model retails for 349 dollars at the
time this video however I'll place my
Amazon affiliate links in the video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
these things might go on sale so without
further adieu I'm Jimmy with jims review
room and I'm here to help you to make
that purchase decision welcome everyone
to another review
jumping through the physical features
they look nearly identical to the MDRS
there's the same great leather headliner
up top durable metal frame the arms are
cliquey and it holds its shape now what
is different though I love my MDR
ear-cups as it has this faux leather
backing or so it's smooth and soft like
a nice pair of leather shoes but on the
new WH they went with a harder more
plastic feel with less of that leather
or rubberized material either or it's a
very matter difference and maybe the
only difference that I could really tell
doing my stress test and I'm aware it's
over the top here but I'll look for any
weak spots so that way you guys don't
have to now I haven't had a pair of
headphones break on my channel but what
I am looking for though or any seams
popping cracks or creaks anything that
may be of a concern that we can find
immediately now with my assessment
there's no concerning noises the
headband up top looks and feels to hold
up fine and the issue around the arm
didn't seem to pose an issue with the
MDRS
many on reddit's and viras forums shown
the left ear cup near the joint were a
little bit brittle here or breaking
within several days to even only just
several months the MDRS I own are the
same ones that I've had since my review
from many months ago and thankfully I
don't see that issue now with the new WH
the new model feels to use slightly
different plastics that it feels
smoother but construction wise they look
identical to the original ones now keep
an eye out for this if you're watching
this video a month or two after the
release comment down below and tell us
if the WH 1000x are still holding up
fine now regarding comfort and weights
I've placed these on my scale and both
the old model and new ones are
practically identical although not the
lightest pair of headphones you've had
but the weight distribution is very much
even and honestly they felt comfortable
for long-term wearing and there's no
pinning or pinching at the crown of the
head and my jaw line there's no fatigue
there as well while wearing these for
extended periods of time overall they
are comfortable to wear
now speaking of long-term work the ear
pads do feel good however I do notice my
ears heating up a bit after 30 minutes
of wearing they're not as airy or
spacious feeling as well inside the ear
cup as some of the other flagship anc
headphones out there but the 1000x were
still within reason of being comfortable
and aside
yes the earpads are removable and
replaceable now moving on and taking a
closer look on the Left Sony removed and
then combined the noise cancelling
button with ambient aware I believe I
mentioned this in my original 1000 X
video the buns are somewhat hard to find
on day one since the raised nubs here or
subtle but on day two they're slightly
easier to fun directly below the on/off
and pairing button is an input for a
three and a half millimeter chord for
physical connections on the right ear
cup you simply have Micro USB 2.0 and
oddly again here another flagship
postponing the newest USB type-c and
honestly we have to wait until 2018 now
since we're touching base on this sony
has increased and claimed up to 30 hours
of use on the new model and up to 40
hours if you use the wired cable with
active noise-cancelling on this is
class-leading and ties with the
sennheiser PXE 550 s as they offer the
same up to 30 hours of use when going
wireless and with my test at 50% Vaman
from a full battery to dead I achieved
27 hours and 23 minutes to be exact
now another feature that many overlooked
here if you need feel right away plug
this in for about 10 minutes and they'll
give you 70 minutes worth of playback
time essentially about an hour now
touching based on what features this has
Sony and Sennheiser shined last year
with a barrage of smart and practical
functions now these things are really
high-tech here's a quick rundown and my
thoughts
so first up ambient aware the built-in
microphone turns on while active
noise-cancelling turns off and the
experiences as though there's no passive
noise isolation from the physical ear
cups themselves you basically can hear
your surroundings as if you were wearing
nothing second we have the very easy to
use physical touch controls on the right
ear cup do you swipe up and down to
increase and decrease volume so Iping
forward or back to skip or go back on
songs DoubleTap to pause and play and if
you hold it down this does bring up the
cool assistance and Siri on your phone
now all you need to do is a very subtle
gentle swipe and it will activate the
action and I love this feature here
third let's say someone walks up to you
at the office or on the streets instead
of taking the headphones off just palm
the right ear cup and cover it this
drastically lowers the volume of your
music turns off ANC but turns on ambient
to where
can hear your environment as soon as you
let go everything reverts back
immediately and you can continue with
your music no need to take off your
headphones is a very very convenient
feature that I personally used before
now fourth the app isn't pretty by any
means here but it's one of the most
robust that I've used info and more
importantly adjustments to active
noise-cancelling performance are done
automatically and visually represented
here or you can optimize the anc
performance to your environment by
calibrating it now Sound position is
self-explanatory
the Nexus surround sound profiles that
simulate different environments which I
felt had to take it away from the great
audio experience right out of the box
but more on that a little bit later but
below there is an equalizer to tune your
audio manually unless you can switch
between el deck and apdex versus the
standard lower quality SBC and as a side
note el deck was only once available on
Sony phones but moving forward phones
with Android or EO who have L deck
available so that's really cool combine
a device and in this case a pair of
headphones with the L deck support and
you're getting much higher audio
resolution than the current commonplace
apt X so alright enough of that getting
out of this technical jargon here and
touching base on wireless performance
range
Sony is offering Bluetooth 4.1 wireless
range wise I was able to get 64 linear
feet before the audio started to crackle
now regarding phone call performance it
was very good with my voice coming
across very clear inaudible however it
does pick up background noises quite
easily now this is quite common on
headphones that I've tested such an
based on active noise-cancelling in my
previous review of the MDR 1000x I said
Sony had outperformed Bose by a small
fractional measure this time around and
after recently reviewing the bose QC 35
twos the new WH 1000 X distinctly over
Bose can black out more noises this time
at least for me it's much more
noticeable assessing this in these same
areas as all of my ANSI headphones
that's walking through the city and
taking in all the noises here she's
sitting at the coffee shop at 2:00 p.m.
when most people need that fourth cup of
coffee it's loud and busy there now Sony
simply does a better job than cutting
out voice chatter to the airiness when
walking outside cars driving by items
moving around etc but enough of me
talking here's a quick sample please put
on your head
founder earphones and have a listen I do
speak in the video clip assuming that my
voice would have been audible so I do
apologize for that but my voice is
muffled so please keep that in mind
either way you can still hear the
background noise and experience this for
yourself
power on bluetooth connected power on
hopefully you guys can hear the
difference all right folks now jumping
into audio quality getting this out the
way both the old and the new 1000x
sounds the same or nearly identical at
most
again I'll play a few samples for you
guys once again put on your headphones
and earphones if you haven't already
done so and listen to this experience
and there you have it folks hopefully
you guys enjoyed that audio experience
this is probably the most accurate test
that we can perform here on YouTube for
you guys hopefully you guys did use the
headphones and earphones to get the most
accurate representation of how these
head forms perform without actually
owning or having one of them right in
front of you please show you support by
liking and subscribing if you haven't
already but getting it to base I would
not consider these as bassy headphones
but more the level of bass boosted you
get this lovely thump and punchiness for
EDM pop and hip-hop genres begging those
genres specifically shine now this isn't
a comparison video but considering I
just recently reviewed the boast QC 35
twos those are brand new these do have
ever so slightly more bass and although
more and not sounding flats the Saudis
in general still provides a clean and
accurate audio representation of your
music jumping into the mid-range
frequencies we're talking about vocal
performance where most instruments are
heard by the human ear and also the area
where if the audio sounds crappy most
people can distinguish it here it's very
clear it's articulate full of resolution
and detail not overly brent afford to
stand up against those lower frequencies
I personally absolutely love this audio
characteristic now the soundstage feels
airy and open with audio direction being
very distinct and I didn't turn on any
additional surround sound features or
adjusted the equaliser within the app
getting into high frequencies this is
where you hear Tom's the upper end of
kick drums snare cymbal crashes it is
sharper than they both qc25 twos and
thankfully that is sharp as the v-moda
crossfade twos that I just recently
reviewed in the channel the 1000x gets
up there right before it blows out and
causes that ear ringing in
that you might get when it's too strong
so overall the audio experience is
immersive and has a lot of color and
personality it has a lot of attacks you
can say and gets me moving it makes me
bomb my head to the beat so folks be
ready for my head-to-head comparison
video coming soon I love my post QC 35s
and they do have their own pros and
definitely some cons as well but for now
these sony's are amazing at the moment
coming down below are you guys team sony
or team boats be really interesting to
see what you guys think thanks for
watching like sub and share do you
support my work I'll catch you guys on
the next one take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
