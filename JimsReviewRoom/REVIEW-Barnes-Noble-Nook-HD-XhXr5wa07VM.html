review by Jim's review room just want to
say thank you to all the supporters out
there subscribers and all those likes
that you've been providing that my
channel slowly growing slowly but surely
but I do appreciate all the effort and
support that you've been providing to me
so we'll get right into it right now
today we'll be looking at the Nook HD
Plus by Barnes &amp;amp; Noble now there's some
minor differences between the HD version
and the HD plus version and hopefully
with some of these specifications and
explanations of each one it may help you
decide in what you may purchase in the
future now the Nook HD Plus only comes
in the 9 inch form factor which I have
here and it weighs in at 18 ounces now
the regular nuke HD comes in at 7 inches
and it weighs a little bit under pound
at about 11 ounces so let's take a tour
of the exterior so what we have here is
your home button and here below that is
the charging port that connects to a USB
wall charger if you go back over to the
top here you have the sleep button which
if you just tap once or go to sleep and
tap it again awaken itself you can say
and if you hold down that button
actually powers down in powers up your
unit as well on top is the
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
port and the volume buttons are found
close by as well now lastly and very
importantly you can increase the amount
of space on your nook with this micro SD
slot as well now surprisingly I like the
feel the nook it feels actually way
better than the iPad itself and the back
of the look there's this plastic that I
want to say has a thin layer of silicone
or rubber or I don't know what's going
on there but it's actually a kind of a
sticky friction kind of material if I
can explain it if you can feel secure in
my hand that it doesn't feel like it
wants a slip because of its backing now
quickly comparing that to the popular
iPad here the iPad has this literally
cold or impersonal feel with its
aluminum back case and the edge to edge
class now this may just be personal
preference but the Nook also feels
that's a little bit more sophisticated
to hold as well so let's get deeper into
this review here the main difference is
price at the time of this review the HD
is $129 in the HD plus which I'm
reviewing today is 149 the next
important form factor is the resolution
and battery performance to put this in
simplistic
resolution is measured or better
measured I'm sorry on the e-readers and
tablets by pixels per inch now the
reason why the iPad is so popular with
what they call their Retina display was
because Apple was able to squeeze in so
many pixels into one square inch of the
screen so let me say this the iPad has
264 pixels per inch the HD plus which I
have here has 256 per inch and the Nook
HD has 2 243 so when comparing the $300
iPad with a nick HD plus as an e-reader
the letters and the words are on the
same or maybe similar level where each
letter is clean crisp and clear so the
difference in pixels per inch is very
minimal or minimal enough to justify not
spending more than what you have to if
your main purchase is for an e-reader
now for gaming it appears on par I tried
popular games like candy crush and it
performed as normal I tried more faster
intense paced games
I don't like tetris or so I didn't
notice any hiccups as well and the most
important thing here I believe this is
where it really shines is the video now
I play a clip here and you can see
there's such a difference in contrast
completely shocked that the Nook was
much better in color contrast and
vibrancy now that's not bad for
something about 50% cheaper than a
competitor so moving on here the battery
itself lasts about 10 hours for reading
in 9 hours for a video for both the HD
and the HD plus as well charging from a
dead battery to full takes approximately
4 to 5 hours
now one of the items I really dislike
that I that I want to notate was I
couldn't charge the Nook from my
computer via the USB wire so the next
big question is is it easy to use
especially for those who never had a
tablet before or nonetheless never had
an e-reader or Nook let me see this it's
very easy and simple to use so don't be
afraid of it you mainly stay in your
home page which will have all your books
and magazines that you've bought so far
now customizing this page is easy as
well if you need to all you do is just
hold down an icon and drag it to the
area where they call the table tap as
you can see here
now on the very bottom of the homepage
you have your main sub menus as well the
first one is your library which will
house all the items that you have and
your nook itself the next button is the
app button which houses all of your apps
that you have so far downloaded there's
of course your Reb web browser and the
email function as well - of course surf
the internet and check your email where
we have Wi-Fi and lastly is the shop
button from Barnes &amp;amp; Noble here you can
look up the books and magazines etc that
you want to consider purchasing and you
can do a free trial as well and I
believe on almost every item on there
and if you don't want to purchase it you
can always cancel as indicated I mean up
before you're actually charged and if
you're ever lost you can always press
the home button located on the bottom of
the Nook and they'll take you right back
to the home page it's easy for someone
to pick up and start now with the Nook
HD in the HD plus models as of May 2013
you'll now have access to Google Play
which is Google's version of the App
Store it's great to have this feature
since you're not limited to just Barnes
and Nobles interface not only with
downloadable books games but also music
and movies for purchase as well another
Pro that is definitely worth mentioning
is the Nook is not limited to just
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble books you can purchase
books from a wide variety of vendors so
if your price shopping you do have
options now unlike the Kindle Fire they
can fire you're just limited to Amazon
ebooks only for purchase now there's two
additional items I wanted to mention the
first one was with many tablets that has
this glass or glossy screen it does
create a glare when you are in direct
sunlight or in very very bright areas so
if you bring in to the beach or the park
let's say and you're sitting under
direct sunlight or in a very bright area
it does make the screen very difficult
to see so that is someone of select
nuisance but I get most tablets with
this kind of glass surface you'll have
that problem the last time I want to
mention although it's not detrimental
but I think it's not worthy it doesn't
come with a camera so you can't Skype or
web chat or take pictures so that's
something to throw out there for you as
well and just to wrap things up with my
summary so the iPad
in fact feel a bit more refined and
smoother to operate but overall the nuke
does what I believe the average consumer
is looking for the nook HD the HD plus
are a great alternative for those who
were intending just and use it for the
basics such as reading web surfing email
YouTube videos movies etc and don't let
apples marketing make you believe the
video and discrete is better on the iPad
you saw my test and you see my review
and the Nook is as good or actually was
better than the side-by-side video
comparison so with all that being said
and all of its features this is a great
alternative to a full-blown tablet and
it's definitely cheaper than most of the
full-blown tablets out there it's
definitely worth a buy for in this kind
of market so I hope you enjoyed this
review for the Nook HD plus from Barnes
&amp;amp; Noble now it did take a bit of time to
produce this video and I hope to show
you support please like this video and
share it and if you can subscribe to my
channel as well for future alerts to new
products so this is Jimmy from Jim's
review room take care everyone bye-bye
