room now here I am with some new
technology for you guys and for the
first time ever we're exploring virtual
reality that's making its way into
consumers hands I got the gear VR free
when i pre-ordered my samsung s7 but if
you guys were to buy this today it's $99
at the time this video now place links
in the video description below click on
that you can see if prices have dropped
or not now also keep in mind here before
I get started I haven't tested the
oculus rift or HTC vive nor have I tried
at Google cardboard so take this review
as someone experiencing VR for the first
time here hit that as it compares it so
without further ado my channels here to
help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to Jegs reviewing
going over the physical features the
entire thing is well put together it's
basically using simple plastic air with
foam padding around the eyes for comfort
and they are detachable for cleaning or
replacing which is always a huge plus
and surprisingly secure fabric straps
here they are only held down by Velcro
but never that the headset fall off of
me even during vigorous gaming the front
cover unsnaps do slide on your phone and
just real quick for those who don't know
this is not a standalone unit like the
oculus rift but it does use supported
Samsung phones here for the VR
experience on the box says you can use
your note 5 a s6 edge or the s6 edge+
it all fits in here but the latest gear
VR this also fits the s7 and the s7 edge
as well now once you put this on your
head on top is a focusing ring on the
right side is a touch sensitive touchpad
with the enter button in the middle and
the return slash home button here up top
vayam record buttons are a bit forward
for adjusting your audio of course but
you can always use your own earphones or
if you're a wireless type of guy you can
use your own Bluetooth earphones that
works just as well and looking on the
inside here two of your optics to help
put your phone or display into
perspective here any proximity sensor
whenever you take off your headset the
phone screen will dim immediately now
getting into comfort it's not bad with
stay on your face here and staying put
during heavy use from my experience if
you are wearing this for a movie let's
say close to an hour maybe an hour and a
half or so and more you'll
subconsciously start to push that
headset up from time to time I also
notice the headset has to be a near
perfect height basically on your head to
ensure that you have a sharp image all
pretty much common sense though but
things I want to ensure that you will be
aware of and take into consideration if
you're planning on by now getting deeper
into how the VR works for me here
I will admit I do get motion sickness on
the plane or sitting in the backseat of
a car and your friends basically
feathering the gas pedal from time to
time for most of the photographic 360
degree photos watching movies or videos
on here basically there was really no
issues at all some games did work fine
here but games where the images are
moving very fast moving open
environments here
did give me a headache this isn't
affecting my review but I'm again I'm
just letting people know out there if
you are like me motion sickness might
come about during gaming and people are
talking about content and the user
experience the controls on the site are
sensitive and responsive enough but it
did take a little bit of muscle memory
here to form and remember where the
buttons were I highly recommend if you
are gaming on this get yourself in gear
VR controller that I would think would
help just give you better immersion and
control rather than tapping and sliding
the side of the gear VR every time on
the side of your head but other than
that that's everything regarding the
physical features and that's everything
regarding its physical features now take
a look at content keep in mind this is
ever-changing and expanding of course
but what I want to focus on is the user
experience first I'm putting these on it
is very impressive and immersive you do
get a sense of depth and openness from
360 degrees but you also achieve 3d
images popping out at you with
compatible content now a perfect example
is Netflix offering the big-screen
experience when you do rotate to the
left or the right here when the screen
changes colors when your movies changing
colors basically the ambient lighting
hitting the furniture the lamps it
reflects the same it's really immersive
now while using the headset for most
other situations the movements are very
smooth with occasional stutters here and
there but nothing to hinder gameplay or
your entertainment but for my job here I
do have to wait until the initial wow
factor dies down a bit to really see if
VR is something that you would keep
using or is it going to sit on a shelf
after the novelty dies down now after
some time with it it's still a surreal
experience and pretty cool every time
you put it on and it's because you're
always seeing something new every time
you look around or just trying to find
something new in general now the only
air is that I do have to critique all of
these phones do have some of the most
pixel density of any device because it's
magnified you still see some pixelation
you'll start noticing an effort the
novelty wears off on Netflix for my
research here only plays at 480p it's
not full 1080 s not even 720p and over
time I noticed I would rather watch
Netflix on my phone rather than
strapping this thing on now second I
notice the outer edge of my peripheral
vision it's slightly blurry
I won't affect the
Aran's and maybe it's meant to be blurry
for the consumer to focus in on the
center image but I would imagine better
results here if the entire image was
super clear
I don't know how dedicated VR headsets
performed but the quality of the images
I mean gear VR I still feel it works
though but to move beyond just a novelty
stage there's still room for improvement
now other experiences gaming and this is
new it's refreshing does provide a very
unique experience again we're still in
the early stages and what I call a
titles like gun Jack isn't as abundant
as it gets where I can see myself
spending almost as much time as I do on
PC or consoles but at this moment most
games do feel like smartphone games
where they're just really simple to kill
time and not a deeper not tugging at
your emotions and not putting your body
into extreme excitement again some
titles offer that most titles though
offer the latter now last your phone
will get hot there's no question about
and unfortunately it does drain the
batteries pretty quick too now there has
been instances where the gear VR stops
displaying its content and prompts me to
let the phone cool down before using
again so just a heads up on that now in
the end here very awesome experience
there's no question about it like any
peripheral or device the content needs
to be there specifically talking about
Samsung now at this point I do see this
being very niche Samsung is a huge
company however and if one day if they
can offer say basketball games at the
front row or a little camera at every
event front and center
that would be huge and I think that
would work very well that should be the
next step but right now I feel it's it's
just basically a supplement to a smart
phone it's not a true must-have
standalone product and I don't see
myself using this as one of my primary
forms of entertainment or even my
secondary unfortunately now until
mainstream entertainment is offered
again my best mode game as one example
there then I think the gear VR would be
more widely adopted so let me know your
thoughts down below guys remember to
follow me here on YouTube and follow me
on Facebook Twitter or Instagram again
I'm Jimmy with James review room you
guys take care and I'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
