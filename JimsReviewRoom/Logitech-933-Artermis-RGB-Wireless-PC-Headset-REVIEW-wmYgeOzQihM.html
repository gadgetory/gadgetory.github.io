room checking out Logitech's best of the
best headset available at the time of
this video and it's perfect considering
battlefield 1 is here and call of duty
is right around the corner now Logitech
then sent me the 933 Artemus it's priced
at 199 dollars retail but I'll place my
links in the video description below
click on my links and it will give you
the most updated prices in real time so
without further ado let's get started
getting the physical connections out of
the way here there's tons of them here
with a passive setup meaning your
headset is off you can still get audio
through the physical three-and-a-half
millimeter wire with inline volume
controls and mute functions for
PlayStation 4 Xbox your smartphones and
of course your PC
there's RCA cables for those connecting
the more traditional way here in
addition the included USB wireless
adapter can connect to those RCA cables
giving you wireless audio and it's
perfect for those intending on using
these with their at home audio / video
receivers or simply using these headsets
and some one of your more older systems
and the last chord here is a nice long
microUSB cable to charge your headset
but let's start talking about the
wireless options on the left ear cup
hidden behind a magnetized cover holds
that USB adapter which I showed you
earlier and it's perfect for traveling
everything's just compact and stowed in
there it's virtually plug-and-play
connecting this into my PlayStation 4
the headset is immediately recognized
here you just have to switch it over to
headphones and same with my PC plug it
in the drivers download automatically
now overall my wireless connection was
stable and periodically getting up to
walk to the fridge here to get some food
in between breaks the signal has never
cut out on me personally the 930 threes
do typically come in black but what I
have here is the limited edition
artemus snow spectrum basically in white
and of course looks are subjective but
in my opinion this thing looks like
something out of the movie Tron these
things look futuristic and with that
boom light hidden in the ear cup itself
once you pull it out it looks pretty
slick comfort wise and this is clearly
subjective as well but they do have some
weight coming in a little above 360
grams or twelve point nine ounces now
overall there's a slight feeling of some
weight here after
Gaming for an hour or more but because
of these media cups that surrounds your
entire ear overall there wasn't much in
discomfort at the crown of the head yet
over time you do feel somewhat of that
weight pushing down on you now overall
construction despite being very much
plastic here it's very tough and rugged
for transport their cups do lay flat
perfect for resting on your shoulders
but sadly though there's no carrying
case now continuing with how these look
there's full RGB color options the site
Logitech G logo can be customized in
independent of their real lights with
various controls like ambient glow
fading in and out to full RGB cycling of
colors to simply a fixed color profile
the only thing that I wish was more
expensive in the lighting effects
department here and besides all three
colors I just mentioned earlier the
three color profiles it would have been
sick if the lights would light up
vertically or maybe light up like an
audio level meter when audio is coming
through that would be seriously cool now
since we're back here the buttons on the
headset it's easy to reach but somewhat
hard to identify but the buttons are
very convenient
volume and mute works smoothly here and
very tactile the G programming buttons
offer cycling through either the colors
you have saved on your headset I'm the
g1 button here now the g2 button offer
allows you to turn on or off the default
surround sound g3 cycles through your EQ
settings and all the way at the very top
a switch to turn Wireless on or off and
very less I mean right ear cup which is
a huge bonus for me here another
removable backplate which exposes a
replaceable battery of these batteries
ever go dead you can always swap them
out now battery life performed at about
7 hours for me here with the lights
going on in about 80% in volume and as
me trying to get some real-world
experience here
now while logitech is claiming eight
hours of use with those same exact
settings now without the lights on the
headsets can go up to 12 hours if needed
but let's get into the moment you've
been waiting for hear the audio the 933
s have some very good passive noise
isolation blocking out unwanted noises
around me though there is minor to
moderate amounts of sound leaking but
only someone sitting next to you in a
quiet room will be able to hear what
your person listening to the microphone
which I'm using right now is completely
unedited this is the microphone right
off of the headset itself and while
in-game it asking other players how a
sound if I'm voiced clear in V
very good with minor background noise
being picked up here specifically when
I'm typing on my mechanical keyboard you
do hear that I'm typing right now
nonetheless it's still faint in the
background but getting back to my
original microphone here the audio can
be tweaked using the Logitech Gaming
software that you seen earlier you can
turn off all these simulated surround
sound to get standard stereo performance
which still sounds good but having Dolby
Digital or DTS offers an additional
sound profiles and very good spatial
awareness which I'll discuss next and
less if you want to fine tune this thing
there's an equaliser offered which -
quite well now in game the details are
very clean and precise the headset is
someone basically probably for music
listeners but for movie watching I
thought it was absolutely perfect now if
you think it's slightly muddy you can
always alleviate that with the equalizer
in tune it to your liking now in my
personal opinion it's still a very well
balanced sound signature for gaming
specifically that is with such a great
detail playing h1z1 where I do need a
lot of spatial awareness these headsets
have the acuity of direction and
emphasizes and the details specifically
footsteps and movement of nearby enemies
a very much competitive advantage no
gunshots on headsets at times can be
overemphasized and causing very
high-pitched tone causing a lot of
listening fatigue over time but here the
Artemis has Authority and again clarity
fidelity without that screech that's
what really impressed me
now h1z1 or battlefield one that I've
been playing the sound effects of
hearing bullets whizzed by your head
hear the explosions are heard off in the
distance again overall the entire
experience was very much immersive so
overall yeah there are chunky Hudson I
do admit that for me my head is more
sensitive than others so there is some
weight felt on my behalf and I do wish
the lighting profiles was a bit more
diverse but in my opinion everything
that I've mentioned so far those
negatives distanced us now they're not
deal-breakers at all especially when you
consider these sound quality and the
competitive advantage you have over
others with these not to mention for
movies I absolutely love them I really
enjoyed using these and to get the full
audio effect no audio performance wise
this has been probably the best so far
that I've used gaming headsets that is
but as for comfort the previous headsets
that have reviewed on this particular
channel has felt better but again
overall features the ledge tec-9
30:3 absolutely kills it if you're on
the market I would Satan definitely this
is worth looking into</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
