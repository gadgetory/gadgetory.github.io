left and right it seems with a tab pro
and no pro series but with a 10-4
Samsung is targeting the more
budget-conscious buyers matter-of-fact
research firm Gartner determined more
budget-friendly tablets are selling and
eroding Apple's sales because of quote
market demand was driven by the improved
quality of smaller low-cost tablets from
branded vendors and quotes hey everyone
this is Jimmy from Jim's review room and
welcome to another review so today we'll
be looking at the Samsung Galaxy Tab for
the follow-up to last year's 10 3 and
this review will cover all the temp
fours as most of the internal
specifications are identical the only
differences are its physical size screen
size which comes in 7 8 and 10 inches
and it's better in life will vary the
model I have here is an 8 inch 16
gigabyte Wi-Fi only version and pricing
is on your screen and if need be
be sure to pause the video to look it
over so we'll see if this Tab 4 is worth
the purchase if you're in the market
this is the 8-inch tab for measuring in
at four point eight eight inches wide
eight point two seven inches tall in
point three one inches thin and that's
seven point eight millimeters to be
exact the unit is also less than a pound
weighing in at only eleven ounces the
backing is clearly different from the
pro models as it doesn't have that
premium look of the leather and faux
stitching the back in my opinion was a
bit more slippery when compared to some
of the other brands on the market but
nonetheless it's still within reason
now this tablet is thinner than most
tablets available at the time making it
very easy to hold all around and
although this is a budget tablet the
construction in general is still very
solid from my tests with no flexing a
durable backing and tactile feedback
buttons now the layout on the tablet
reviews all buttons are plastic though
which works perfectly fine with no
issues you have your power button volume
rocker buttons next and last on the
right side here is an SD card slot the
memory card slot alone makes this tablet
and worthwhile purchase as instead of
buying a tablet with more memory an
alternative is buying a micro SD card
which is much cheaper and you can expand
memory and it 7 inch models by 32 gigs
while the 8 and 10 inch models you can
expand your memory by another 64 gigs
now the very bottom has your micro USB
port for charging the left side doesn't
have anything at all and back to the
very top here is a three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone port the front
facing part of the tablet here has your
standard recent apps button home button
and back button respectively while at
the very top holds a 1.3 megapixel
camera and on the back houses a 3
megapixel camera with no LED light as
seen in the pro models now photos on
your screen are actual photos taken
right from the tablet itself in various
lighting conditions there's no editing
or changes to the pictures themselves to
get a true view of the camera's
performance in general the camera didn't
take the best photos but consider this
is a budget tablet it did ok though it
could not select and focus on your
subject
there's no macro settings and you
couldn't set up close-up shots as well
and low-light performance and saturation
were slightly grainy and washed out
again please view the sample and you can
make judgment for yourself
in the last physical feature I wanted to
discuss was the speaker considering that
most of the world is right-handed and
you do hold your tablet with your left
hand at first I thought Samsung place
the speaker in the most horrific
location and I'm pretty sure some other
reviewers would say the same thing but
after using this and testing this for
several hours I found that the left hand
cups the speaker and also the tablet and
in turn along sound to be redirected at
the holder naturally this is designed by
Samsung or coincidental but it does work
and your hand does not muffle the sound
per se the speaker itself is good
overall as there's barely any distortion
but because it's a single small speaker
it's really only good for personal
listening but that's okay though as most
tablet speakers are not the best anyways
now as stated earlier all the tab form
models have some similar specifications
and that's accurate with its resolution
of 1280 by 800 across the board and I'll
be honest that's somewhat low
considering other phenomenal tablets
like the Nexus 7 or Kindle Fire HDX
which are comparable priced offers some
of the highest resolutions in its
segments now I've been testing a lot of
tablets with high resolution recently
and jumping back to this lower
resolution did make text and faces and
movies just slightly less detailed and
sharp but from my experience playing
around with this tablet for several
hours I noticed it's not too much of a
noticeable difference on day two of
testing and picking this tablet up I
didn't think or make note in my mind
that the screen was bad it's not bad at
all it's actually fine
I've been using it for a while and I
believe if you don't have a higher
resolution screen next to this one you
won't be able to tell a noticeable
difference unless you start really
staring at this thing and coming from a
budget tablet the colors look decent the
colors are not as vibrant as the pro
models in some of the other tablets but
still you have an enjoyable experience
now regarding performance last year's
model had only a dual-core processor
running at 1.7 gigahertz while this year
the tab for bumps it up to a quad-core
clocked at 1.2 gigahertz now
surprisingly enough Samsung decided to
go with only a gig and a half of RAM to
help for multitasking capabilities the
standard going into 2014 should be at
least 2 gigs in my opinion for the
budget-friendly models while the
higher-end units received 3 or 4 gigs as
being
standard now nonetheless and it seems to
be the trend so far with his tablet
specs or one thing and performance is
another now if you're planning on using
this for the basics email web surfing to
movies on Netflix HBO GO it runs with no
problems at all and loads in an
appropriate time
I even tried this feature called multi
window which is proprietary to Samsung
where you can have two applications run
at the same time on your screen and I
didn't encounter any issues while using
this feature and although having only
one and half gigs of RAM opening many
windows and having many apps open I
didn't find any issues surprisingly even
running most games went without hitch
and I've tested more graphically intense
games rather than candy crush and again
no issues I paid and downloaded Need for
Speed Most Wanted which is a gorgeous
game that's graphically demanding and
again shockingly
no slowdown in the end I'm really
impressed by what this can do for the
average consumer lastly with my testing
on battery life and use the tablet
throughout the day downloading apps and
other miscellaneous test items play
through some random games for about 10
minutes at a time and surf the web and
have Pandora playing in the background I
watched a movie which was almost two
hours long and the tablet died from a
full charge after 10 hours of use so
after testing what I believe the average
consumer would encounter the temp 4
Series is great in performance
surprisingly again considering the low
ram count the biggest downfall see here
is the screen resolution being so low
and compared to similar price
competitors you do lose a little bit of
sharpness especially in lettering in
text now if you step up to the pro
models I do admit myself they are a bit
pricey but you do receive the best of
the best
now if you're really wanting an
entry-level Samsung tablet and its
features this is a good tablet overall
that will perform everything that you'll
need so hope this review helped you in
