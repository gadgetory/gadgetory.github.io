boom from its mini boom speaker Ultimate
Ears earlier this week introduced the
replacement dubbed the Yui roll it's the
same price at $99 as of this video just
like the old model here but it's a total
redesign with an unconventional shape
more features and more uses already
comparing the speaker on paper it looks
to offer some key features that
separates it from the competition now of
course we'll get into everything shortly
as always visit my website for reviews
on other speakers and more consumer
products
I'm Jimmy with Jim's Ruby room comm and
I'm here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
you each strays away from that
traditional look of a speaker either
that cylinder look or a classic
rectangle now it doesn't look much like
it did a roll either but it's more of a
disc like shape it's smaller than what I
thought but it fits right into my
medium-sized palm measuring 5.3 inches
in diameter
now it's also very lightweight for
carrying as well it only weighs in at
330 grams now the front comes with that
same mesh fabric here like the bigger UE
boom speakers offering a very very
rugged texture and behind the fabric
seems to be an indestructible shell it's
really rock solid now matter of fact
like the bigger Bluetooth speakers here
the roll is also water resistant the
screen withstand up to one meter of
being fully submerged underwater up to
30 minutes
ideal for heaviness by the pool or bring
this to the lake now also on the back
here features an elastic bungee cord
that you can hang over your shower
handle or shower head when you cleanse
your potty let's say now it's also stain
resistant so if you do bring this out
into the woods drop this in mud and
whatnot you can just bring it home and
spray it down and this will work fine
again
very rugged build quality now moving
back here buying buttons are of course
located on the front and I notice the
down button does give good feedback here
reaffirming a press but they vine up was
much less tactile they both still work
though but the top button barely gives a
clicking feel or a clicking
found now if you press down both at the
same time here with a speaker on the UE
voice does prompt how much better is
remaining which is a huge plus 90
percent charge but now moving behind the
mesh skin here is a two inch driver with
two three-quarter inch tweeters offering
360 degree sound but before getting into
the sound test let's finish the back
here real quick now very simple this has
the power and pairing button up top with
the bottom offering a flap which then
exposes the three and half millimeter
port now one word of caution because of
the hump that holds the cord it does
make for a tight squeeze if you have a
thicker cord it might not go in all the
way here while a smaller diameter cord
will work fine
nothing microUSB port for charging the
UE roll wasn't a issue at all since most
USB cords are small anyways but since
we're on the topic of charging and
batteries here UE claims up to nine
hours of battery life and with my
standard test that I do on all of my
speakers leaving this at 50% volume the
entire time playing music I was able to
achieve an astonishing 11 hours in 12
minutes to be exact which is great again
that's just at 50% volume now we're to
recharge the role though it takes a
crazy five-and-a-half powers though to
get this fully charged per UE but now
the last part here that's very much
worth discussing is the features that we
can't physically see the UE app for both
Android and Apple offers the ability to
what ue calls double up the role can
pair with another role to have stereo
separation in addition the role can be
linked to the bigger UE boom or mega
boom if you have one laying around
although this it was stated on the
website though I didn't see this as
being an option in the app at the time
this review but backing out here and
equalizer is available to adjust the
sound characteristics to your liking and
the final feature is an alarm that plays
your last played song that's right on
your phone or play the last music app
that you had open like Pandora or
iHeartRadio the only thing that I saw
was an issue though it's either a one
time alarm or it's a daily alarm you
can't select for the alarm to go off on
certain days so that's it for the entire
speaker and what it has to offer both
the physical ruggedness to the app
experience now what I'll do I play
several songs for you to listen to and
I'll give you my verdict afterwards
now first up here's alcohol by time
flies
gee cuz I got it like that flow so
smooth like I got it on tap
yeah and I'm sick of being a good night
while I'm on my gangland while I'm
drinking Bud Light can you get it when
you miss me like I'm wit whiskey
drinking Jim Beam hey baby do you do it
do it that way do you do that do you
take a break you know that I'm a beast
when I kill it on the beach like a sex
on the beach
Hey
you
and there you have it folks
now of course sound recorded over my
microphone and then played through your
speakers are not the best depiction of
audio quality
hence my review here granted I'm
reviewing this as a $100 speaker and in
this category it does sound good this
does get as loud as surprisingly the
brand-new Bose Soundlink mini 2 but for
a $100 speaker the bass is decent and
enough really for casual listeners
there's enough I believe for listeners
of electronic dance music and pop music
to enjoy but those listening to hip hop
and rap who do value some bass I don't
see as being enough here but for the
mid-range of vocals and the upper range
of instruments it's clear and very easy
to listen to with really no listening
fatigue from my end and it's the same
with the high notes in cymbal crashes
very minimal distortion and many of the
snare drum hits are evident as well
there's really no ear ringing or team is
that even notice when listening to
violin samples where at times those
strings can get very high-pitched now
overall it's a good quality sounding
speaker here that's great for small and
medium sized rooms the only areas were
if I had to critique is wishing for a
bit more bass that would have been a
little bit more ideal but more
importantly it would have been great to
have a slightly more open soundstage on
water soundstage allow the music is
monotone and doesn't offer much depth
and either for vocals or a
differentiation with the sub bass it is
somewhat common though on smaller
Bluetooth speakers but again that's only
if I had to critique now if you want
more bass or spatial sound you're
looking at the 150 to $200 Bluetooth
small speaker range at that time again
for $100 and keeping that in mind I
still believe this is a fantastic
sounding speaker the quality the build
is one of the best if not the best for
being so rugged the battery life is
great and last the accompanying app
makes for this budget-friendly speaker
that much more appreciated so hope this
review helped you in some way here let
