room after testing the Apple watch
series - last year I loved it it was
hands down one of the best accessories
to buy if you owned an iPhone now this
year the nearly identical style comes
back with a few new features which we'll
go over
prices are on your screen and they do
start at $329 the one I personally
bought here is the LTE 42 millimeter in
metal gray accompanied with the support
band and it starts at 429 as always I'll
place my affiliate links in the video
description below click on my links and
they'll give you the most updated prices
in real time you never know when these
things might go on sale so without
further adieu my channel is here to help
you make that purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review going over
the physical features and what's new
over last year's model it's ever so
slightly thicker than this series - but
having both on for comparison I honestly
couldn't tell the difference epic rams
in the new w2 chip inside I'll play some
highlights about the processor on your
screen for you but for the very first
time LTE is an option so you can use
your Apple watch and have full data
functionality without your iPhone
there's a barometric altimeter that
measures how many flights of stairs
you've climbed Bluetooth jumps from 4.0
su 4.2 besides GPS there's also GLONASS
geo-positioning all of that and again
only a fractional increase in size the
Apple watch looks classy and modern once
again the aluminum casing the very
smooth crown detect out bun are all
quality overall the Apple watch exudes
one Apple experiences like it's
streamlines everything flows smoothly
its minimalist yet efficient no
scratches are on the ion ex glass during
the time of me testing and yes I have
bumped the casing and of course the
screen as well into the side of a table
and a cabinet's accidentally of course
but thankfully no nicks or evidence
bring this outdoors to test bright light
visibility the video doesn't do justice
but I was able to read the screen with
no issues like the previous generation
graciously offers interchangeable bands
and it's very straightforward to swap
them out simply hold the release button
on the back and slide the old out and
slip the new one on I recommend getting
the base model if you do decide to do
any sport activities and then purchasing
from third party vendors where you get
different styles for cheaper versus
purchasing direct from the Apple store
the bands I'm showing off now and
throughout the video are from mono where
they're based out of San Francisco very
reputable band makers there so that
targets Best Buy and on Amazon but it
did offer me a discount code for my
viewers to use go into my video
description the link and the code is
there for your convenience I only
recommend the best of the best on my
channel and seen in the video but better
in person here they make very good
quality supple genuine leather wrist
straps not to mention some high-end
metal bands as well thanks to mono wear
for sponsoring and making this video
happen I'll continue to show off some of
their stuff here to help you decide and
don't forget to use my code to save some
money getting into some of the LTE and
non cellular features you can take phone
calls with this and if you don't have
the LTE version the wash pairs with your
phone any functionality still works now
if you haven't tried it it might look
weird in theory but don't knock it it's
very convenient I love using this people
on the other end are able to hear me
very clear I don't need to yell it does
pick up some background noise though but
surprisingly it does a good job of
blocking out most of my environment
testing the LTE function turning off my
iPhone 8 plus all together and sitting
inside my commercial office building on
the first floor there's of course tons
of wires overhead air ducts metal and
brick i'm Shaklee surprised my Apple
watch series 3 retains a clear signal
while talking to people now others have
mentioned spotty LTE performance but
since the Apple watch update that was
recently released connection has been
working perfectly fun without a hitch
but like any reasonable review nothing's
perfect right the speakerphone is indeed
small so for times folks are speaking
into the phone loud and like my Asian
relatives hear their voice can get
slightly raspy hey Jenny what time is
taco night tonight
all right sounds good do you need me to
bring anything for you all right sounds
good I'll see you tonight the speaker
can be slightly difficult to hear in
busy areas or sometimes when you're
driving on the highway requiring you to
place your wrist closer to your ears to
have a listen no overall although there
are issues I believe they're minor and I
still find myself in frequent use of the
speakerphone feature especially while
driving or whenever my hands are not
free the other addition on why you might
go with the LTE model get yourself some
Bluetooth wireless earphones or
headphones as Apple music is available
right on your wrist no need for your
cell phone and all 40 million plus songs
are at your disposal
sounds great but per their website Apple
music was unavailable at the time this
video for the testing now listening some
services that you might use and is
available on the Apple watch are pandora
iheartradio and tune in now service is
not available at the time this video or
Spotify Amazon music and SoundCloud now
for those who don't have LTE you're
perfectly fun you're able to store music
right on the Apple watch
use some Bluetooth earphones and you
have music on the go this is perfect for
those who run or jog and do not want to
carry their phones on them notifications
comes through perfectly with options to
respond back to text message either by
quick responses provided at the boundary
screen voice recognition works very well
and it's possibly the fastest for
full-on sentences and scribbling which
has improved over the Apple watch series
- it seems finger recognition of letters
are much more accurate and I found
barely ever needing to go back and fix
my characters take a look at the home
screen thankfully you can do most of the
screen and setting changes right on the
watch if you need a new watch face you
simply swipe from left to right now
these can be customized and adjusted
within the app but for quick access like
I'm doing here it's simple and intuitive
pressing the crown dial on the side
brings up all your apps and something I
mentioned last year it would have been
nice to see a feature like this on their
iPhones or iPads now it may look
cluttered for those who are unfamiliar
but you'll develop muscle memory in
about a day or two also you can
customize the placement of each app
within the Apple watch
app now a long press on that same doubt
brings up Siri which works great when
you want to use voice commands and from
my experience I tell Siri to play music
it's so Syria to call someone tell her
to give me turn-by-turn directions for
navigation all through my wrist is a
handy feature here when you don't have
your phone or your hands or it's simply
tied up now as a side note you don't
have to press that button you can still
call her up here as you would with your
iPhone moving on the button below the
crown allows you to close apps and
select which ones to bring up and bring
forth here that are already opened
holding down this button has the ability
to auto call your emergency services I
love this for peace of mind if I'm ever
getting robbed or so or say my car flips
over my phone hasn't flown out the
cupholder I hold this down and the SOS
function shows up now I do wish like my
samsung gear s3 I reviewed some time ago
that activated SOS would have also sent
a text message to a person of contact
and provide them with my coordinates I
didn't see that option here touching
based on health features I reviewed tons
of fitness bands over the years from
fitbit's and Garmin job on when they
used to be relevant to a polar @vo
although the Apple watch falls more into
these SmartWatch category it's still a
very capable Fitness watch on the daily
it keeps track of your steps total
distance mentioned earlier in the video
this has an altimeter being added to
count how many flights of stairs that
you climbed and with apples famous
colored wheel this measures activeness
moments of exercise and how much time
you spent standing versus sitting you
can swipe down and see a timeline of
your day of when these activities
occurred and you have the ability to
start a recorded workout from running
cycling walking in elliptical workouts
they are stepping high-intensity
interval training which many of you ask
about down to swimming there's a lot but
showing off running and see how after
this thing is when you initiate a run
you of course have your timer average
pace although I do wish real-time pace
was showing beats per minute from your
heart rate tracker and your elevation
swiping right gives you options and
control your music and remember there's
onboard storage or Apple music via LTE
when available no swiping all the way
left here reveals your start and stop
options and when you're finished with
your run calories burn and other generic
health data are revealed
now with GPS and keeping my
glonass which should help with finding a
signal faster and provide better
accuracy and ran at a location which I'm
familiar with and the distance was
identical to my phone's GPS I also
tested the heart rate tracking against
my chest strap and I don't believe it
samples your heart rate every second as
shown on your screen as proof you see
these Jackie lines now it could be wrong
here but here's my chest strap as
comparison much more fluid dynamic and
it shows up-to-the-minute response now
although it might not be as dynamic it
is indeed accurate in overall readings
now here's another chart for reference
this time doing random interval runs
where I go and then stop the Apple watch
is reasonably close for a wrist heart
rate tracker now performing as good as
some of the best ones out there now like
every risk-based heart rate tracker I've
tested there's usually some deviation
and with the Apple watch most of the
time it's just one or two off which is
very reasonable here rarely it's off by
three or four when your heart rate
fluctuates as shown in the interval run
either or for a risk heart rate tracker
again very good results now four times
that you're not working out the heart
rate sensor does take a reading
throughout the day and Franz you with a
resting heart rate essentially a
measurement of your heart health moving
on although the Apple activity and Apple
health apps measures a pretty good
amount of data I don't say more than
what the average consumer will be aware
of for those who want something more
serious or something they currently are
using Strava RunKeeper
map my run and endomondo to name a few
are dedicated apps that are available
for the Apple watch so last but not
least here at touching based on battery
life Apple claimed up to 18 hours of use
which sounds like crap but with these
series too I was able to achieve one and
a half to two full days with these
series three and this is why my review
was a bit delayed I tested this with LTE
off and it did phenomenal I put this on
at 7 a.m. we're at the entire day until
11:00 at night and on average I usually
have about 67 to 73 percent of better
life remaining now over night the watch
drained 7% leave me about 40% better
drainage in a 24 hour cycle now on the
other hand with LTE on and not carrying
my iphone around I'm getting about a day
worth of life LTE drains a
I'm out more but I can't knock Apple
this since it's still within that 18
hour battery window therefore those who
are running I did a quick 30 minute run
which turns on continuous heart rate
tracking and GPS plus I left LTE on and
in those 30 minutes the Apple watch
series 3 drained by 10 to 15 percent
each time you could estimate the math
and see how much it would drain for you
and your personal workouts regarding
recharging I timed this and it takes 2
hours and 15 minutes from 1% better in
life for remaining so with everything
being discussed so far if you have the
Apple watch series - it's still a
stellar watch keep it do not get the
series 3 unless you want the LTE version
for those who don't own a SmartWatch
with your iPhone definitely buy this it
has all the bells and whistles it
performs great the features are robust
practical yet informative its intuitive
and with apples lineup of apps and the
Apple experience the SmartWatch isn't
gimmicky anymore
it's a serious extension of your
smartphone if I were you I highly
recommend this if you're in the Apple
ecosystem
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and the
work that we do here is here to help you
make that purchase decision you guys
take care hopefully this video was
helpful bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
