year ago to use in the baby room now so
far it's worked out great as an
alternative to a baby monitor and of
course going on vacation this does give
me some peace of mind as well now for
the average consumers who are not too
familiar with Dropcam they were bought
by the company nest earlier this year
which at the moment they manufacture and
make smoke detectors and thermostats
that are programmable and self-learning
make these traditional items
quote-unquote smart and of course
connected to each other and nest labs
parent company is none other the tech
giant here Google so today we're looking
at the new nest cam by Google I guess
you can say that I personally bought
here for $200 retail and I want to share
my experiences of what's needed what
works great and what doesn't based on a
whole year worth of experience here and
testing of the cameras and owning of
course the previous Dropcam Pro as
always stuff on my website jim's review
room calm for news and reviews and more
information on the nest cam itself i'm
jimmy would jim's review room calm
welcome everyone to another review
starting with the physical features it's
a very nice and very sleek metal build
the nest cam does feature a pivoting
neck here to adjust 180 degrees for
vertical angles and the neck is very
stiff holding its position now of course
you can always rotate the entire base
from left to right in addition the
camera head itself does rotate a full
360 degrees now from my experience there
are zero issues with getting the right
angle now furthermore and very few if
any other security cameras offers this
the camera itself is removable from the
aluminum base and you can discreetly
hide this little thing here for only
reasons that you can think of unless
regarding mounting nest like the
previous drop cam pro does offer a
mounting plate for wall installations
now the screws provided are long enough
but one thing I did notice though it did
not include drywall anchors there are
about maybe two or three dollars for a
four pack at Home Depot or even at
Walmart and it does give you some peace
of mind the screws do hold in fine
however the nest cam holds onto the base
by rare earth magnets and because of
those magnets it holds out
very strong and I mean very strong which
is a huge plus but if you're ever
pulling this off and moving the camera
around the house from time to time such
as going on vacation and relocating the
camera the anchors would support much
more where again over time so just a
heads up on that
but being magnetized you can also attach
this to any metal surface except for
computers and other electronics of
course and before I forget here this
does come with a 10-foot or three meter
micro USB cable that connects to the
supplied wall adapter and I honestly
wish though the supplied cable was black
to help with keeping things a little bit
less conspicuous especially at night
time but with all that being said
exceptional build quality and I don't
foresee this having any issues like the
previous model the camera still gets hot
though but just like the old one it
still works perfectly fine now before
showing you the video quality quickly I
want to run down the list of features
now once everything is connected
download the nest app for either Android
or iOS and then everything is really
controlled there keep in mind nest is
aiming to have other nest products work
with each other in your household
manually turning on and off your camera
is pretty much self-explanatory
but home and away would work if you had
a nest thermostat
now the thermostat based on your
settings would know when you're out and
the camera will turn on automatically
you can schedule your nest cam as well
to come on at certain times the
regardless of these settings I
personally like leaving the nest cam on
24/7 instead you never know when
something might happen regarding video
this is a boost to the product the
camera now takes sharper videos with a
1080p resolution which I'll show you
shortly but keep in mind those who are
checking their streaming video often on
their smart phones data will be taken up
more so than of course 720p but in
reality it really didn't affect me at
all
but it is something to point out for
those especially that may be streaming a
little bit more often than I would now
night-vision again I'll show you in the
video samples later rotating your images
next and last under the video settings
is video access now for some business
owners you can have your video feed
broadcast live to the world and have
people see what you're doing at the shop
or store or you can leave it default off
and only those that knows your username
and password can see what you're doing
next up the nest cam like the previous
model has a built-in microphone and
speaker phone that works equivalently
well voices can be heard clear
leann speaking at a normal tone within
the room voices and noises are picked up
again using this as an alternative to a
baby monitor or if ever and hope it
never happens
seeing a thief entering the home
verbally speaking may scare them away
from further intrusion a status light
glows here with various colors but you
can turn it off here again to have your
nest cam look a less obvious at night
last is sound sensitivity which I would
just turn all the way up the very last
section you can label which camera this
is and where it's located in the house
living room baby room ports etc and last
is the notifications which is a huge
plus when there's motion detected or
sound detected or both technically
you'll receive a notification on your
smartphone immediately that way you can
pull up your house and see if there is
anything that's going on one last
feature that is not in the settings
during use within the app here there is
8 times digital zoom to get close-ups of
what's going on but now to the moment
that I'm pretty sure that you've been
waiting for the video test now I know
many have commented on Amazon about
their experience and it hasn't been so
great so I for sure tested the camera
extensively here comparing this against
the Dropcam and also putting them
side-by-side and I can only speak on my
experience alone now the video shown
here is proof of what I encountered with
zero editing here's what 1080p looks
like and it does look great when
compared to some of the other security
cameras I've tested in the past it's not
1080 like a blu-ray movie but this is
still possibly the best video quality
that I've seen so far and just for
comparative purposes here's the old drop
cam Pro on the right with the nest cam
on the left the colors look much more
natural and accurate on the new nest cam
as well and regarding the clarity it's
more apparent on the desktop when you
pull it through a webpage but if you're
pulling this video primarily on your
smartphone on a smaller screen of course
it's really not a big difference and you
can be the judge for yourself and let us
know what - what you think in the
comments below in the day time for the
most part it runs fluid with what I
would say minor stutters and many have
commented specifically on that through
the Amazon reviews but from my
experience the Dropcam pro looked to
perform really the same not saying it's
a good thing but my experience it was
not worse if you intend or don't intend
on buying an S product also be sure to
find one with a
angle lens like the old model the nest
cam features a hundred and thirty
degrees of viewable distance from left
to right now later tested the night
vision on this thing and plays this in
the closet mainly pitch black and in
this experience the fluidness or
stutters and also the picture quality it
looked almost identical I really didn't
see a huge difference in this sample
image I believe this looks great to be
honest with you it actually performs
better than the Belkin and also the
d-link security cameras that I've tested
in the past but the following video here
recorded my garage the nest cam showed a
bit more artifacts or in simpler terms
least white little speckles and if you
look particularly a close attention to
the windshield here on each car you'll
see the older drop cam shows a much more
smoother look
as for fluidness not just nest cam but
both the Dropcam and nest cam both
showed signs of heavy stuttering when I
pretended to unlock the vehicles here
and for those who are curious I have a
six month old wireless AC router which
has been working phenomenal and I run 25
megabytes down and 2 megabytes upload
speeds from an internet provider which
is just slightly faster than what the
average household in America runs per
google searches so with all that being
said during the day time the video feed
I believe still looks better than the
competition during the night time it's
still better for my experience and to be
honest it looks nearly identical to the
old model the starting problems people
are voicing on MSN reviews mine is not
as severe as the garage example and I
normally don't have the camera in there
anyways but the fact that it did happen
does concern me and consumers claiming
those issues could be very well
warranted not everyone's home is built
the same now regarding the competition
again nest offers cloud recording for a
monthly fee you can continually store
your videos up to 10 days or 30 days at
$10 or $30 per month respectively all
video is then deleted and mesto where
will keep your most recent footage
basically creating a video loop but if
you don't subscribe there's no local
recording there's no saving files to a
microSD card which is a total letdown
since other brands are offering that
other manufacturers are also providing
the future if there's movement motion
detection basically the camera will
record locally to that micro SD card
someone surprised nest didn't implement
this considering the price that you pay
and the competition out there has been
doing this for a while now in the end I
really do like the video quality the
stuttering doesn't affect me as much
when I have this in via the baby Romain
downstairs so my experience has been bad
but there is a wing of caution
others for the price it's a better image
but I honestly wish they placed local
recording pod here and if anything that
should have improved the signal quality
or video streaming service a bit better
if you already own a drop cam like I do
the nest cam is still a good product but
it's not leaps and bounds or anything
new to be excited about over the old
model and if you're on the market for
our camera and never owned a drop cam
before the image is nice and the night
time shots does illuminate much further
back than the competition but you might
have to test several areas in your home
first to ensure you have a smooth video
connection despite having a great router
and internet speeds so that's it from my
review I know this was a bit longer than
others but hopefully with this
information it did help you if so please
share this if so be sure to add me on to
your social media either Facebook
Twitter Instagram or Google+ and as
