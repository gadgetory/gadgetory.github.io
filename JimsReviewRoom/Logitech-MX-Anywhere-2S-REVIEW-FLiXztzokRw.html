room Logitech recently announced the
newest MX Mouse lineup the MX master 2's
which I just reviewed and this one here
the anywhere 2's both flagship mice in
their own category one for productivity
the other for portability now both
packed with tons of features here which
I'll go over a lot I did send this to me
under embargo so I finally had a chance
to show it on my channel here retail
wise this travel mouse goes for $79 at
the time of this video as always I'll
leave my affiliate links in the video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
these things might go on sale so sit
back relax and hopefully my videos can
help you to make that purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's review guru of
the physical features i have the m 705
marathon mounts for comparison on your
left
while they super-tiny for beta mouse
sits on the right the verbatim is
definitely not economical at all the m
705 fills my palm the best and with the
flagship it's definitely in between now
for portability it has the low profile
and has just enough width from a
medium-size hands but keep in mind
though because it's great for
portability and again it's not thick it
won't provide you with a palm filling
experience so just keep that in mind now
the only real gripe that I had with the
smells versus other mice I've tested
before I wish the plastic rubberized
grip was just essentially grippier
giving a bit more of a stickier
rubberized texture would have helped
quite substantially from previous
experience now lastly Mouse is very much
uniform those who are left-handed can
use this mouse and in the Logitech
options software you can reverse the
buttons if you'd like which I'll show
you later not looking at the buttons
here you have a hyper scroll wheel that
allows you to go through documents
ridiculously fast then perfect for those
who are using large excel sheets premier
when going through your timeline and
webpages that are super long the hyper
score will is very convenient
now you can tap that same button on the
anywhere Mouse and it will go back to a
click - click somewhat of a traditional
rat style scroll instead the last
feature you can go is side to side on
your documents such as Excel or
Photoshop Lightroom etc the mouse does
make it convenient when you have that
bun right there your fingertips now that
tiny square bun allows for you to open
up your windows and view them all at a
glance with quick selecting another
press brings it back to a normal view on
the side are your traditional back and
four buttons perfect for web surfing and
the position is very good better than
the MX master 2's that I recently
reviewed now with all these buttons they
do seem pretty straightforward like a
standard Mouse but one of the biggest
reasons why you choose this pay 270
dollars here over a standard Mouse is
seriously at software you can change any
of these buttons they haven't do many
other various functions not only are all
of them customisable but they can be
customized specifically for any
application that's the big difference
right there one example if your web
surfing on Google Chrome you can use the
back and forward buttons on the mouse
like normal as soon as I jump into
Photoshop for example I can use those
two same buttons and copy and paste or
whatever you choose to set them up as
this happens seamlessly and the mouse is
intelligent enough to change its own
settings in between programs another
feature those heavy into work
productivity those who uses multiple
computers at the same time I can use the
mouse across three different computers
you don't need your computer systems to
physically be connected with each other
you can also copy and paste your
documents photos and files across any of
those three computers as well the only
issue that I found though I can't
physically drag a file over which is
unfortunate dragging a file will stop at
the edge of the screen here my mouse
would then continue on again only copy
and paste works there's also this
one-second delay going from one computer
to the next not a big deal but something
I noticed I just want to show you guys
so that way you guys are aware and
capping pasting is done over your home
or office network so speeds are not
limited to Bluetooth which is a huge
plus now transferring a 250 megabyte
file from one computer to another one
here took me about a minute and a half
to do small files and photos are
practically instant now moving to other
new and upgraded features and why you
would consider buying this is the dark
field mouse tracking the original Mouse
had an up to 1600 dpi reading or the MX
anywhere 2 s has an up to 4,000 dpi
reading making this a very sensitive and
reactive mouse to small movements in
your field of work you might need that
kind of precision the N word to us is
still capable of reading on practically
all surfaces that you throw at it I
tested this on various surfaces and
didn't have any issues and didn't even
have any issues on clear transparent
glass as well now we're getting to the
front end microUSB port is offer to
charge the mouse logitech is claiming up
to 70 days of use I of course haven't
owned the mouse for 70 days just yet but
in a bit of description once this mouse
dies I will let you know check it out
down there the last but not least
wireless range I was able to get about
35 linear feet with direct line-of-sight
no connection issues which is quite
impressive
so that's it for this review of the MX
anywhere 2 s is very responsive very
much compact but in the end why would
you spend $70 on this versus buying a 20
to $30 Mouse it's because you're very
much using this for some line of work
and absolutely need those software
functions that's the biggest selling
point is the Logitech software itself
now as for the MX master 2's that huge
curve tantrum Mouse here I can see
someone buying that for economics and
simply how it feels and it does feel
great but the anywhere 2's for the price
I would say this is a very niche Mouse
and it is perfect for only productivity
Wars let me know in the comment section
below for your budget for your taste is
this something that you would purchase
yourself and also include what kind of
line of work do you do as always I hope
