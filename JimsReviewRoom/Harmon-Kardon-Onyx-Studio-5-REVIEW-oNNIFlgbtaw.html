the studio floor I love to look on the
last one but the latest model it's
totally redesigned look at this more
elegant and sophisticated build this is
the Harman Kardon onyx studio five on
their website it's priced at a whopping
four hundred seventy nine dollars but at
the time this video use my affiliate
links down in the video description
below to check for the most updated
prices at least at the time this video
they're going for about a hundred and
eighty nine dollars and every one of my
videos
I'm transparent with you guys I did
personally buy this one with my own
money but as always I'll go over both
pros and cons I'm Jimmy with Jim's
review room and I'm here to help you
make that purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review
going over the physical features first
this is elegant slimmer and honestly if
placed on an end table this complements
the room as a piece of decor now do you
guys think that let me know that in that
comment section below but let's get into
the build quality
there's premium fabric all around here a
practical real metal handle up top
that's cold to the touch that
complements this high-end feel now keep
in mind this is not meant to be a rugged
outdoor speaker so we don't have a
reinforced metal grill there is some
slight flexing when you press this right
here isn't that waterproof either and
it's truly not drop resistant either
holy cow now this speaker was not
designed for that but if we are to treat
this as a speaker for the backyard
cookout the speaker for entertaining in
the living room or a great room some
audio in the bedroom or sunroom this is
ideal now one thing I truly was
skeptical about was because of its
narrow and tall design does it tip over
easily no rocking the table it doesn't
as there's moderate amount of weight to
this anchoring it down taking a look at
the buttons all are very clicky and
responsive the unique feature worth
mentioning are the pairing button once
you hold down this Bluetooth button for
five seconds you can pair this with
another Onix studio 5 speaker I'm gonna
turn this on right now but if you have
two of these speakers it provides a lot
more room filling music but pairing two
together does not play stereo left and
right audio separation I also confirmed
this can't be paired with the Onyx
studio 3 or the studio 4 or other JBL
speakers only to another onyx 5 is
allowed unless we've gotten these buns
up top here you can indeed pause and
play and skip a song you oddly can't go
back on a track with the physical
buttons up top here there are no voice
assistant capabilities connected with
your phone so you can't use Siri or
Google assistants and as always my pet
peeve here I wish these speakers offered
a more robust battery level indicator
instead of one light that turns red once
it's near dead which is on here maybe
five slick white LEDs would have been
great or maybe even voice prompts like
Bose that would have been super
convenient especially on more upscale or
sophisticated pieces of tech like this
you know other than that Rhodes
to the rear it's very straight for the
speaker competes more so with the likes
of these Sooners one Bose soundTouch and
maybe the marshal stand more speakers
where they are meant more so to be
stationary than portable so it's
connected directly in the wall using a
wire cable this can't be charged with a
USB cable battery life is rated at up to
eight hours and keeping this
apples-to-apples so this one Bose
soundTouch and Marshall stand more
multi-room wall don't have batteries
built-in in the middle is a 3.5
millimeter physical connection ideal for
video or TV and last is a USB port but
only used for servicing or updating the
firmware now as for Bluetooth this comes
with version 4.2 which I am okay with
bluetooth 5.0 is the latest technology
to be transparent but 4.2 a very good
standard based on my test over the years
it's still reliable testing the range
I'm able to get a hundred and ten feet
of range with the signal going through
one wall here all the way down to the
other side of the building unfortunately
this does not play well where the video
as they are bad delays on Apple devices
Android fared a little bit better but
voices are simply not in sync the Harman
Kardon does acknowledge that this is
more for music than for video but again
you can use the three-and-a-half
millimeter chord if you really want to
watch your YouTube videos on here not on
a positive note you can connect two
devices at the same time so you don't
need to unpair and repair when you're
switching phones or computers so alright
folks let's get into the audio test
again be sure to check out my links in
the video description for updated prices
and follow me on Facebook and Instagram
subscribe if you haven't already and for
those partly Jim's Ruby room family be
sure to light up that comments that shit
here we go folks
alright folks here is the first audio
test be sure to prune your headphones or
earphones because I'm using binaural
microphones to give you this 3d audio
experience
did you
my heart and soul
my
could you please make some rope and get
out of my face I can't prove I can blue
so get out of my face but will you give
based on me you try to be more well what
I need you don't know what
alright folks first up the biggest
difference from the annex 4 to the annex
5 there's one less wolf around this and
one less tweeter most likely to offer
this slimmer form now being transparent
I don't own the annex 4 anymore but
doing a little research folks were
saying the annex 4 offered slightly more
bass from mice panel own test of the
annex 5 this is definitely loud enough
for medium to large living areas for the
pool and such the audio is still heard
from afar and you still have music but
it's not as encompassing or filling as
say these so nice one now although the
annex 5 has one less woofer there's
still a very good amount of bass it's
deep rumbling and helps a lot with
experiencing your music better than
their sister brand JBL like the JBL
charge 3 or even the JBL X treatment I
love those speakers and better than the
Sony extra bass portable bluetooth
speakers the only critique in the bass
range was that maximum volume there
isn't much audio separation or depth
with the lower frequencies versus the
mid-range the bass gets slightly jumbled
and having it bit clearer more defined
would have helped supplement be higher
and feel of this particular speaker but
it's not bad at all and still sounds
great but I was expecting just a little
bit more clarity or definition that's
where the mid-range this did great in my
personal opinion especially the upper
mid-range levels where vocals are heard
where most instruments are experienced
by the human ear very clean very
articulate detailed it sounds great
without being recessed nor being overly
bright afford it's a very well balanced
audio signature kind of similar to boast
you can say now as for the high
frequencies will you hear snares those
taps string instruments touching this
range it's sharp but never ear piercing
and enjoyable experience overall never
did I'd hear horrible Distortion if
anything it's fine a very refined
experience if you do intend and blasting
this at maximum fine again it's not bad
but if audio quality is your first over
aesthetics I would look into the attics
for to be honest with you guys and
compared to the competitors and the
others are a bit beefier and audio purse
a little bit more encompassing
surrounding you but the annex 5 offers
you the best of both the worlds audio
performance
beautiful-looking speaker that you put
around your house alright folks please
light up that comment section subscribe
