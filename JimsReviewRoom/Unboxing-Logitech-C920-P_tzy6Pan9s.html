review by Jim's review room today I have
the Logitech c920 which is logitech's
flagship webcam today in this unboxing
video we'll do a box review open a
package and see what's enclosed and look
at the product itself a more in-depth
review of its features and functions
will be on the next video so please
subscribe or follow me on Facebook or
Twitter to receive updates on this and
other future products so let's get
started open er up and now you said I
just purchased this off of Amazon for
$80 and I believe during this making of
this video it is still currently $80
I mean free shipping let's take a look
at the box itself it goes the front and
the the left side here the right side
and the rear alright let's open her up
and see what's inside here and this is
the biggest knife I could find actually
this is the only you tense I could find
to open up this box here and
unfortunately that's my girlfriend's
Richard Ray's gusto knife so hopefully
she won't see this video won't be too
upset take her out here let's get the
camera and focus a little bit there this
instruction manual no CD so I'm assuming
that you download the drivers already
have software online take her off here
get this out the way oh sorry for the
blurry video in there let me get back
into focus and let's take a look at her
here feels like really good solid
construction here let's take off this
piece of tape
step aside and let's give you a little
close-up of what the product actually
looks like here and has a little mount
here interesting through microphone
ports excellent also has a tripod mount
which is great and a little glossy
finish right there a little bit
fingerprint prone that's all right this
will be sitting on top of my computer
monitor and possibly doing more video
recordings with this as well and of
course it's a USB plug in port as well
so that's about it in the Box on left
lay it up here I will see how this goes
and see if it's a good product here and
I'll give you the review in the next
video and how it performs maybe some
natural video is went from this webcam
and we'll see how it goes and if this is
the Logitech c920 and again this please
subscribe to get an update on when the
next video is coming out and hope you
enjoy thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
