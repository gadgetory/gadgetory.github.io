like Pino Pro and Tam pro series hasn't
been updated in over a year
now the only other tablet that may be
announced soon is the tab S but if
anything that's a speculation of this
video but if you need a tablet and don't
want to wait for the best of the best
Samsung just released their newest mid
tier model the Tab A now I personally
paid two hundred and twenty nine dollars
at the time this video for the eight
inch model a nine point seven inch
version comes in at 299 MSRP now of
course click on my Amazon affiliate link
in the video description below if you
want to see the updated pricing honestly
I think they were actually on sale right
now for a hundred and ninety-nine
dollars as I type this now as always
visit my website for reviews on other
tablets and more consumer products I'm
Jimmy wood Jim's review room comm and
I'm here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
going over its physical bill despite
being classified as a mid tier model
it's thin and light as any premium
tablet and just like the tap S on paper
it's a very minor difference being a
little over 1/4 inch thick at point 2 9
inches versus the tap s coming in at
point 2 6 now overall its 8.2 inches
tall while being 4.3 inches wide making
this just big enough to be enjoyable but
not too big where I couldn't hold it
with one hand now the entire unit is
made of plastic but being so thin and
built with a smooth texture on the back
there's no faux leather this time or it
dimpled back like previous models it
resembles and somewhat here feels like
an aluminum bill that you can see on the
Apple iPad now as thin and light as a
device it's not slippery as one may
think but it stays in the palm quite
well the only physical area that I
didn't like so much was the raised bezel
which does make the product feel a
little bit cheaper despite offering
protection to the screen it doesn't feel
like that seamless piece of glass that
would go all the way to the edge but
that's really being nitpicky on the
aesthetics but now going around its
physical features starting with the
right offers very clicky and good
feedback power and volume buttons
graciously a micro SD card slot makes a
return here offering up to 128 gigs of
expandable storage now going on to the
very bottom is a micro USB charging port
with a 3 and 1/2 millimeter headphone
input next by now to the left of that is
one speaker that serves its purpose here
for music it's a bit underwhelming units
probably equivalent to my samsung note 4
smart phone it's not too loud but with
movies it's not bad at all in hearing
actor voices and sound effects it's not
strong in the bass Department due to its
small size and if you are watching this
at landscape the sound is more right
justified with a monotone soundstage
again it is to be expected though on
nearly every tablet
then last year there's nothing on the
left side and nothing on the top either
now going to the front of the tab a it
features a front-facing 2-megapixel
camera and the rear features a 5
megapixel on screen our photos right
from the tablet itself that's unedited
and you can be the judge if this looks
good to you or not and there's more
photos on my website as well but now
going through the display here and then
we'll get into the performance shortly
after the screen has a resolution of
1024 by 768 which translates to a pretty
low here 160 pixel per inch density now
with that being said of course
everything can be read and no question
the screen is usable but being honest
and upfront to help consumers on paper
compared to older mid-tier models by
samsung and the competitors on the
market resolution or clarity is on the
low end
in addition last year's tab for tablets
had a higher resolution and a 16 by 10
wide aspect ratio now just like most if
not all Samsung products colors are
boosted with a bit of saturation red and
yellow tones or to better illustrate
here scenes of the Sun going down let's
say or those who have a decent tan on
screen will look a bit reddish or yellow
it happens sometimes not every time it's
minimal but it is bare though but
regarding what's on the inside here's a
quick rundown of what's offered we're
running Android 5.0 on a Qualcomm apq
8016 running at 1.2 gigahertz on a
quad-core processor now only one and a
half gigs of RAM is on board again and
16 gigabytes of internal memory now keep
in mind you can still have the you still
have the microSD card slot to use now on
the wireless connections available today
except for wireless AC GPS and Bluetooth
are available but no NFC from my
personal experience and those intending
on purchasing this for general use it's
perfectly fine running today's YouTube
Netflix Lite to general web surfing it
runs fine from my experience and most
games of the App Store still no problems
at all you can see me playing Batman
Arkham origins with no issues and
building sandcastles here in Minecraft
with smooth another processor despite
not being the best the best this can
handle the generic wants it to load it
up you can run it perfectly fine i
got'em it because of its low ram count a
1.5 on android just really doesn't cut
it from moderate users if you have a few
tabs
in a web-browser I did notice more web
pages needs to be refreshed often and
the entire tablet starts still bogged
down a little bit again that's more of a
ramp issue I believe but now let's take
a look at the interface here real quick
smooth transitions swiping all the way
to the left now features Flipboard where
you can see all of your news sources and
magazines that you accumulate Samsung
has dropped a magazine UX it seems now
one of the new features that's evident
on the higher-end Samsung tablets makes
its way down offering multi window which
enables the use of two compatible apps
to be split screen for multitasking the
efficiency then it works great and
flawlessly with the two apps that you
have again in front of you but I do
notice all other apps that you have
running in the background here would
pause and or need a refresh when you
return now as for overall battery use I
left this playing a video here at 50%
volume the entire time really just
leaving Hausa cards on the entire
night's episode after episode and the
tab a lasted nine hours and ten minutes
till it died that as for more casual use
that tablet survived five days and five
hours with a total of 8 hours and 49
minutes of screen on time
now that's periodically just using it
throughout the day here just checking on
social media email the weather let's say
and it's I'll be honest it's not too bad
at all just for casual use but
concluding this and trying to be fair
where it does count but putting some of
the numbers and experiences into
perspective here this really does feel
like a lower end model unfortunately it
has similar specs as the tab for from
last year but goes down on the
resolution the 1.5 gigs is very much
2013 maybe
2014 here spec requirements there and
I'm shocked as far as we're into
technology today we're not at the
standard of at least two gigs or three
gigs of RAM it's a to be answered you
starting to show and being fair it works
it's good for a light to generic use
here it's very portable the battery
seems decent but trying to look out for
you guys if you can the Samsung Tab pro
8.4 inch on Amazon right now at this
moment is 229 dollars a better processor
2 gigs of RAM 77 percent increase in
pixel density for sharper images and
I'll repeat it again it's the same price
basically as the Tab A when it is
not on sale if it's on sale you're
shelling out an additional $30 or so so
I hope this review helped you in some
way if so be sure to help me on Facebook
Twitter Instagram or Google+ and if you
want to see some benchmarks on this and
other consumer goods visit jim's review
rom-com i'll have a link in the video
description as well again I'm Jimmy with

care and I'll see you in the next one
