review room welcome to another review as
some of you may have heard of monoprice
calm and if you haven't this place
provides some of the best prices for all
of your audio and video needs and they
practically have everything now today
we'll be looking at my personal in
ceiling speakers I bought from the way
back in 2010 they still have the same
ones available today on the website for
a little under sixty four dollars for
repair now keep in mind I'm not an audio
professional and my channel is based on
the average consumers viewpoint so
without further ado I'll show you how I
installed my speakers and give you my
humble verdict afterwards monoprice does
have varying sizes coming in at five and
a quarter six and a half inches and the
1/2 here is an 8 inch Kevlar woven to
weigh in ceiling speaker with a dome
tweeter in the center now there are
several variations of what a typical
speaker in general can be made out of
either paper polypropylene metal
fiberglass and what I have here again
stated is Kevlar for the more audio
files out there they might be able to
tell the difference in sound when
different materials aren't used across
different speakers but for my sake I'm
focusing on what matters to the average
consumer does it provide clarity and
fidelity all while remaining
distortion-free now these speakers are
rated at 80 watts nominal are also known
as rms it's the amount of continuous
power measured in watts that it can
handle the peak power is at 160 watts in
general monoprice claims even with the
modest of AV receivers it should be okay
with this pair of speakers of course
consult and check with your audio
receiver manufacturer or professional
before risking blowing out these
speakers now I doubt that you would but
if you heard not sure it's better to ask
but in general it's a very simple design
and installation I'll demonstrate with
some spare material I have here
now modern price does provide a template
for you to trace and to cut the exact
size hole but before doing so I
personally took a metal coat hanger and
bent it to its exact radius I pinpoint
where the center speaker will be and I
poked the coat hanger in there I drilled
a coat hanger 360 degrees to ensure
where I do install the speaker it's not
going to hit the second floor floor
joist
or heating duct etc a stud finder is
also handy if you already have one of
those too now if it's all clear
I cut the sheet rock out with either a
Rotozip dremel or drywall knife and
after doing so I've fished from our
wires and monoprice advises to use
either 18 to 20 gauge wiring which you
can also buy from them very cheap plug
the black to black and the red wire to
the red clip here I slide this speaker
back in place and screw these screws to
turn the locking mechanism in now
there's no direct screwing to the
sheetrock but instead the flaps spread
and eventually sandwich or clamp the
drywall together creating a snug fit now
as I've stated before these were
installed back in 2010 and I haven't had
any drywall sagging or falling in that
case they've been good so far
now put the speaker grille back on and
connect the other end to your receiver
and you're basically done now what
inspired me to get these speakers was
the ambience or atmosphere provided when
I would visit model homes showrooms or
sometimes you see them in the bathrooms
at restaurants etc so in turn I
personally use these for casual music
listening and when guests or family
members are around again providing that
ambience or atmosphere while
entertaining now to start off there's
barely two no bass whatsoever but again
you don't buy these speakers for the
bass now I have these speakers installed
in my living room in which I also have
my clips are f82 twos and if I have the
tower speakers on they drown out the
ceiling speakers where the clips just
basically dominates the room so I would
not recommend this if you are intending
on supplementing this with a set of your
own home theater speakers because of the
difference of tonality and response
there's not a consistency of sound
that's why there's music that's being
taken over by of course louder speakers
but if all you have in the room are just
these speakers in the ceiling you'll be
perfectly fine if you tend on using
these speakers as what they're intended
for you won't be disappointed they are
very directional speakers and
considering they're just pointed down to
the floor you'll notice more direct
music when walking within that vicinity
under that particular speaker
they don't necessarily fill up a room
even at high value but they still
provide music throughout the room for
casual listening and the benefit of that
though it creates again an
of what you're playing but still being
able to talk to others at a reasonable
level now you can turn them up pretty
loud though and I haven't heard any
distortion to the mids and especially
the high notes
there's no tinging or hissing that would
eventually fatigue you and your guests
ears after prolonged listening so
overall for in-ceiling speakers at this
price range clear audio with no
distortion and with the ease of
installation this is in my opinion on
the best bang for your buck so be sure
to comment below and tell me what you
think about these speakers and for those
who are considering of purchasing I hope
that helped you out in some way and as
