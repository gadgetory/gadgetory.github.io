Samsung's other flagship phone a try
just to see if the s6 edge+ is actually
useful besides just looking good and
it's a worthy look - considering Samsung
has made some serious changes in
response to Apple's continued market
growth now Samsung has never sent me any
items for review on this channel here so
I did personally pay for this myself and
this is the 64 gigabyte model in black
sapphire although you'll see later the
phone looks more blue than anything else
now pricing is on your screen but for
more updated numbers click on a link in
the video description below for updated
pricing so without further adue add me

I'm Jimmy with jims review room welcome
everyone to another review
as I'm sure you're well aware now
Samsung has gone quote premium with the
latest phones now offering aluminum and
glass bodies currently is one of the
thinnest and lightest large phones in
the world beating the iPhone 6s plus in
the new LG v10 but let's go over the
exterior real quick here and I'll
explain to you my findings starting at
the top there's your nano SIM tray to
the right is one of the microphones and
one thing that I noticed real quickly
here the IR blaster is no longer here
now rotating to the side the power on
and off to the bottom a 3.5 millimeter
port for your headphones microphone is
next USB 2.0 port and last is the
speaker now with the speaker located on
the bottom now the sound is more direct
than the previous Galaxy phones you do
receive a slight sense of improved
clarity but overall sound quality these
still very much sound the same like tiny
speakers now to the left are your volume
rocker buttons and that's pretty
straightforward here and now rotating to
the rear the back is now sealed and
enclosed with glass and aluminum 16
megapixel rear-facing camera like most
if not all phones currently on the
market does protrude ever so slightly in
this case preventing the edge+ from
resting entirely on its glass rear now
more about the camera a little bit later
now for those who are unfamiliar with
galaxy products Samsung has been include
infrared heartrate reader which works
very accurate want to compare this with
another phone my activity band as well
and also a finger meter like the ones
that they use in hospitals for quick
readings but the infrared sensor can
also read stress levels based on heart
rate variability and oxygen levels in
the bloodstream now the last bit here
since we're still in the rear the back
is unfortunately not removable because
of the enclosed back this does leave me
to worry bit since my most recent note
for also my brother's no for edge in my
fiance's s5 all had battery issues
basically either not holding a charge or
prematurely shutting down before
reaching five percent left of battery
life now is the battery Samsung using
today more reliable unfortunately only
time will tell
the battery is indeed replaceable on
these models here but does involve
opening the phone up but for the average
consumer
I wouldn't think most would attempt to
tackle this matter now not bashing
Samsung at all but just pointing out my
experiences and although the microSD
card slot is no longer available the
alternative is to use the cloud like
Google Photos or Dropbox
now most consumers I think would be ok
with this but those heavy into file
transfers like myself since this is my
work phone using the USB 2.0 to transfer
large video files is a pain and if I'm
away from my fast internet at home the
Wi-Fi in hotels or coffee shops are not
too ideal either now rotating to the
front is a 5 megapixel camera for those
selfie moments a fingerprint scanner on
the bottom here works great just by
holding your finger here on the home
button and very conveniently this pulls
the camera up as well with two taps in
succession now the construction on this
the front of the screen is the latest
Gorilla Glass 4 and technically Samsung
is the first to announce that they were
using 7000 series aluminum before Apple
did basically offered 1.7 times stronger
metal and 1.3 times more scratch
resistance over the previous model but
even though being stronger and lighter
it's still not indestructible of course
I did accidentally drop this already and
you can see in the video here right on
the edge there is already a little ding
of course it's not scratch proof but
overall from my use of the phone here
there's no question it does feel more
quote premium as it's cold metal and
glass to the touch here and there's no
flexing of course very
solid with no seams that looks to be an
issue but it is crazy fingerprint prone
here so those having oily hand phobia
watch out and when the phone is new it
is very slippery and takes some getting
used to measuring in at 5.7 inches the
edge Plus has Samsung's signature Super
AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560
by 1440 no question the screen is sharp
and crisp to look at but the colors have
improved very much as well at least from
my note for smartphone looking at photos
- watching Netflix and YouTube videos
online here the average consumer will
more than likely notice the gorgeous
saturation in the pop of colors on the
screen now the edges here are definitely
not as curved as I thought here because
the display doesn't cascade further down
the novelty of the edge effect here wore
down a bit after owning the product for
a while now the bezels on the side as
well are still visible like any other
smartphone out there as well on the
other hand besides aesthetics some
usability is here but you can be the
judge if this seems purposeful to you or
not now while the phone is off swiping
left to right reviews whether date the
time and the battery remaining swiping
up and down or left right depending on
your orientation offers you a new
sticker for your chosen feed like
Flipboard Yahoo and notifications you
might have missed you can download a
digital edge widgets here like a Twitter
feed sports and a dedicated weather app
if you would like to do so night clock
is another option you can turn on when
you are sleep basically and for it to
automatically turn off in the morning in
night clock mode the edge will display
the time the alarm and the battery info
in a very dim light here a deal for
having this next to you and your
nightstand while you sleep now getting
to what I found to be more beneficial
you can swipe this small little tab here
and reveal pin shortcuts app edge is
what it's called where you can pin of
course your apps for quick selecting now
although I already have a quick select
section here on the bottom of the home
page having another row or technically a
column here is convenient in knowing
that they are there all the time but the
question is really again does it save
you a neat
now the better and maybe the best feet
edge is people's edge you can select up
to five people you want pinned here for
quick access but they're also a
designated color if you leave your phone
down face down here on the table and say
Jane Smith calls her people's edge color
let's say blue will glow the side of the
phone just giving a visual indication
now the phone up it doesn't glow at all
things that notice that the edge doesn't
do are having the media controls
therefore other Netflix or other
dedicated Samsung music and movie
players the media controls are still
right on the main screen the edge this
to be honest with you doesn't feel like
a true dedicated second screen for
information to display once you have the
main display on overall I really felt
for the premium that you do pay it's
more for the looks and even in the looks
department for the actual user again the
novelty dies down pretty quick let me
know what you think in the comment
section below
but discussing the other Samsung
dedicated features that may be useful to
consumers palm swipe makes a return here
for taking a screenshot of your screen
for an incoming call you can mute your
phone by either face palming the phone
here or flipping the phone onto the
table itself now direct call is
available and this seems pretty nifty
here if you're in messages not hang up
that is and you want to call that person
instead of fumbling and going into your
contacts just put the phone to your ear
right then and there and the phone douse
that person another similar feature is
smart alert if you missed a call from
earlier and you come back and let's say
you pick up your phone then the edge+
will vibrate to alert you just in case
you did pick up your phone and you
didn't check the screen although some of
these do seem kind of gimmicky these
features here but they all alternatives
that does help somewhat of course you
can choose to use them or not and but
the last video here has been on Samsung
phones for a while now you can perform
multi window and have to select apps
open at the same time for multitasking
convenient when you're watching a
YouTube video while surfing the internet
or pulling up info while you're a
messenger or hangouts
and no there's been a lot of information
so far for the big question how does
everything come together and how does it
perform the edge+ runs on Samsung's own
eight core processor with four gigs of
RAM android 5.1.1 has currently
installed with Samsung's toned-down
overlay the basic test that you may see
other reviewers do is just scrolling
back and forth on the main page rapidly
and this basic test showed signs of
lagging and the new Sony z5 smartphone
but for the edge plus here nothing
whatsoever thank goodness my biggest
issue was with the camera on the note 4
pulling up the camera was somewhat slow
but now this loads up instantly
what started for me most of the time
from previous Samsung experiences was
taking a photo and then opening up
gallery immediately have really
significant delay at least I might
device that I noticed now here as
evident the video is proof it works
perfectly fine now I further stress the
system with leading apps open and
browsing web pages later and again
nothing that I could see as being an
issue overall from general consumption
to gaming to what I personally use the
phone for which is heavy use on photo
video and social media consumption so
far it's been very well done as for the
camera and the camera quality I love the
simplicity when the camera is loaded
swipe left and you do get a slew of
features pro mode is offered similar to
manual mode and cameras but not quite
though everything is laid out in front
of you adjust the white balance you can
manually adjust ISO levels the focusing
and you can adjust the characteristics
of the camera like highlights contrast
and saturation now without several shots
here from another camera we really don't
know how good this camera can perform
now keep in mind this is not a direct
comparison of which camera is better but
I am testing the LG v10 and just want to
show some shots just for again something
I guess general comparative purposes
another flagship phone basically
compared to the edge plus now the
Samsung model here provides deeper
colors and a sharper image right off the
box
for those not interested in editing
photos and just want a point-and-shoot
camera a Samsung does great for the
average consumer providing outstanding
quality in auto
mode the LG v10 although shot in the
same megapixel in auto mode as well
the Samsung did do better the only thing
I noticed several times from the edge+
is this little blue glare here in
certain photos so just be aware of that
I didn't notice this or barely notice
this on the LG phone now as for
low-light performance these photos were
actually taken much later in the day
minimal lighting there wasn't any extra
lighting I put into the room and holy
cow very very minimal noise but you can
see the contrast the richness is all
there basically stuck right out of the
box but overall using the phone the
operating system feels to have improved
greatly and that's me coming from the
note 4 regarding better life
I still get about a day's worth of juice
on auto brightness and both Wi-Fi and 4G
on the quick charging worked miracles
powering the phone up quickly from near
dead but I do admit the phone does get
pretty hot from using the fast charge
and regarding heat the phone does get
warm from prolonged use while on phone
calls and of course with recording video
- again with that non-removable back I
just hope everything does remain intact
over time for the time being I believe
the premium you do pay for having those
curved edges on the screen is more for
bragging rights and aesthetics however
if you want functionality that Note 5
could be a much better choice cheaper -
but other than that so far the overall
Samsung experience has greatly improved
with more features than before despite
missing my much beloved IR blaster so
that's it for this review if you guys do
