room I have another video today that
several fans asked for I'm looking into
RHA in-ear earphones and the ones I have
here today are the flagship models the
t20 eyes priced at two hundred and fifty
dollars retail and these are
specifically made for Apple the t20 s
which are practically the same those
work on Android devices and if 250 is
kind of out on your budget here they do
make in ears as low as $30 now he'll
play several links in the video
description below you can click on those
and see what the most updated prices are
today and before getting started the
unboxing experience on these has been
phenomenal here somewhat of an
experience to open this and see the
abundance of accessories offered so
without further adieu I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room and my channel is here
to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
don't over the physical features at
first these did look a bit funky and
didn't look comfortable to wear yet
surprisingly they're perfectly fine in
the box you do receive an abundant
amount of ear tips from my favorite here
the flange designs through the regular
silicone tips if those don't work for
you memory foam tips are also provided
the earbuds themselves are made of
stainless steel and you do feel some
weight because of them in your hands but
because these are an over ear design it
feels to offer even weight distribution
the waters flex to perfectly fit around
your ears here and these do stay on well
and again your ears don't feel like
they're weighed down quality wise the
wires the inline controller for volume
and skipping songs and even down to the
3 and 1/2 millimeter plug uses some of
the best materials I felt on earbuds
there's soft almost rubber like feeling
wires there's polished steel and the
ends are just very original regarding
comfort they are very comfortable very
easy to wear for long periods of time
and they never fell out of my ears
during casual movement the earphones in
general did block out a good bit of
ambient noise and with music on it
blocks out nearly everything in my
environment the noise isolation
performed as well as most other in-ear
earphones now the very last item before
speaking about the sound test
roj offers this unique design wherein
the package three different tuning
filters are provided to change these
sound characteristics the tip screws on
and when in use I do admit there is a
difference it's not a huge difference
it's very subtle from my experience but
I think audio files would appreciate the
very very slight differences here then
last in the package is a faux leather
carrying case it's slightly rigid to
help keep things protected and intact
here and inside our tube and on the left
hand with the right side having some
space for several spare tips if you need
them so this brings us to the point here
in the point that you're probably
waiting for the sound test the RHS are
plenty loud from my assessment the base
provides a clean sound overall it's not
deep but it's slightly higher than
neutral I personally didn't mind I do
like a slight bit of bass in my music
and the bass in my opinion didn't spill
over to the trebles now the mid-range is
clear and does offer dimension and good
resolution I want to consider them being
bright but they do sound just ever so
slightly pushed forward for a bit of
clarity here and emphasis on voices
coming across
regarding highs I did have slight
listening fatigue here after an hour of
listening it's very minor the treble
over time does
become a little harsh needing me to turn
the volume down just a tad bit now the
sound stage for in-ear earphone does
very well here and compared to my
previous review on the similarly priced
clips x8i hybrids the t20 eyes here
provides slightly a bit more direction
and depth when you're listening to audio
knowing where it's coming from now would
say if you're either into rock pop EDM
and some general hip-hop definitely look
into these build quality the original
design the comfort has been great for my
needs
I know some may not likely memory wires
for possibly being clunky or getting in
the way but they really did serve their
purpose for me and keeping these on over
I really enjoyed the t20 eyes I very
much enjoyed their sound signatures well
so that's it for this review be sure to

decision you guys take care I'll see you
