it's no mystery
and you and I we got history it's Jimmy
with Jim to review room so what is
Google Fiber for the average consumer
it's crazy fast up to one gigabyte of
download and upload internet speeds in
America at the time this video there's
only nine cities in the entire US that
has Google Fiber up and running now
there's four other cities that are
currently up and coming per the Google
map here and another select few eleven
specifically there are potential
candidates for the expansion so it's a
humbling experience for me considering
I'm getting to try this out at such an
early stage as this will be the future
of our Internet so what about pricing I
place the packages on your screen right
now
I'm personally paying these $70 a month
option here and I won't get into details
about that TV bundle but for those who
thinks that maybe they don't need a gig
oospeed here there's fiber 100 which is
still phenomenal as you do get 100 down
but more importantly 100 up that package
is $50 a month compared to the world
listening to my viewers out there those
that say they're from like the Middle
East or India in general they are paying
very high prices for slow speeds on the
other hand my viewers from Japan and
other various parts of Europe that
actually has fiber it's actually cheaper
than what the u.s. is offering right now
if you guys can any comment section
below let me know what country you're
from how much you're paying and how fast
are your speeds this will be very
interesting to see and compare basically
now with that being said besides the
crazy speeds which I'll show later that
many are aware the benefits Fiber has to
offer now when they install this in my
neighborhood and taking some photos here
during the progress they explain fiber
cables runs directly from the hub to my
street here the wire then continues into
this side of my house into this little
box here that you can see nothing too
fancy but I just want to show you guys
what's inside out of curiosity here
they're wire wrapped around the house
and then enters into my living room on
the side so from the hub the street all
the way inside my home that data is
completely transferred by the light and
because it's fiber there's no electrical
interference that we seek
on traditional metal wiring only from
the wall to the provided modem through
my cat5e into my computer is where any
electrical interference may or can occur
great for businesses in the city up
corporate buildings where there's tons
of wireless signals or other electrical
interferences fiber cables are generally
immune to them now let's get into the
speed test here here's a quick video as
proof this thing is nuts
and I'll fast forward to the upload
speeds in which I'll be more
particularly interested in as you can
see hitting over 900 on both ends with a
two millisecond ping it's insane but
let's do some real-world test clicking
on a YouTube video 4k video loads
practically instantly with zero buffer
time if you click on an unbuffered area
just basically skip forward there is a
slight delay but seriously minimal
Netflix is particularly are practically
the same with instant video start ups
here in a slight or minor buffer if you
do skip ahead now let's jump over to
downloading games from Stig downloading
h1z1 a file that's roughly 6 and 1/2
gigs had taken a little over 4 minutes
to do getting on PlayStation 4 word I
think
PlayStation 4 owners can attest the
download speeds are never near what
you're getting from your internet
service providers doing an internet
speed test it's good compared to the
past
but nothing close to what fiber is
offering I also had a chance to download
Call of Duty infinite warfare during
their beta last weekend if I recall it
was about maybe 15 gigs or so and they
had taken about two hours to do but of
course when playing games even with a 20
megabit download speed games usually one
perfectly fine
so overall everyday tasks like webpage
loading it's a similar experience
nothing too crazy 4k and Netflix really
shines with near-instant sometimes
instant results downloading is indeed
faster but depending on their servers
from Steam or whoever it may be
it might not allow you to download as
fast you expect now my reasoning behind
that the average speed in the world is
nowhere close to what fibre is offering
some short corporate server owners
haven't caught up to fiber speeds which
is very much understandable so last as I
stated I'm actually more interested in
upload speeds that's the biggest
difference coming from 2 to 10 megabits
upload from my previous provider and now
we're jumping to 900
it's an upload speeds the first which is
my full-time job uploading YouTube
videos in this instance a huge
difference was noticed by the time
Google Fiber finished with that same 800
megabyte file time owners 10 megabit
upload was still at around 13% but my
ultimate test here and this would
possibly put the most strain on my
current set-up streaming on Twitch I
maxed out every setting that it could
that means 1080p at 60 frames per second
with the max bitrate that twitch I think
allows I went ahead and put it to 5,000
anyways and it had zero problems
whatsoever for a stream very minor
pixelation during fast moving scenes but
overall a great image 60 frames per
second Full HD and I have my laptop and
iPad viewing the stream at the same time
in the house the internet simply didn't
slow down so with all that being said I
do see some of the benefits at the
moment now and it can be overkill for
some things today but I'm excited to see
what the future holds and I'm certain
streaming 4k or setting massive amount
of data within a business to Cloud
Servers to simply offering more reliable
internet in various parts of the world
that's just some of the potential that
Google fiber or fiber Internet in
general has to offer so that's it for
this video nothing to detail or
scientific but a glimpse into what you
might experience when fiber comes into
your area hit the like button if you can
and subscribe if you haven't and found
me on either Facebook Twitter or
Instagram you guys take care and I'll
see you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
