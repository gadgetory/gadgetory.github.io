review room from time to time I like
giving a budget brand a try as you never
know you might come across some good
performance while saving a few dollars
Skullcandy just released their grind
headphones and they were nice enough to
provide a set to try they are priced at
just $59 retail as of this video and for
sure it's within a reasonable price
against its competitors but how do they
sound and how durable are they we'll
find out
I'm here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to Jim's
review room the concept or the idea of
these Grinde headphones reminds me of
these Sennheiser Momentum's I had just
reviewed not necessarily in looks but in
how they function the ban up top has
faux leather that's stitched on either
side while the inner band has a nylon
mesh fabric with light foam cushions now
more my comfort test a little bit later
now going down the band here our metal
arms that goes down into the ear cut
themselves and then each ear cup is
transparent and you'll find this on the
black and the white grind headphones
while the other colors offers a closed
back but because you can see through my
white ones here you'll see the
microphone for receiving and making
phone calls and on the other side is
what Skullcandy calls tap tech
essentially is just a button to answer
your phone calls and also utilize the
skip pause and play your music now one
thing I wish that was on the headphones
and if not on the headphones and at
least a 3.5 millimeter cord provided is
an inline volume controller
unfortunately there's no way to adjust
the volume besides pulling out your
phone and adjusting it bear now looking
at the earcup themselves I noticed they
didn't have much cushion but before I
put them on here I want to show how
adjustable these are now they don't tilt
too much and they don't swivel much
either but these metal arms they do
slide up and down a reasonable amount to
adjust its height it's held in place by
tension and it holds on very well
actually without any movement if
accidentally bumped now with that being
said the fitment from my head works out
fine despite its minimal amounts of
movement now one of the biggest benefits
here that makes these headphones
actually comfortable is how light they
are according to my scale these are one
of the lightest headphones I've tested
and the reason why these headphones
don't need
clamp on your jawbone and head as much
it's comfortable both on the jawline and
at the crown of the head now regarding
durability stretching the band almost
flat here showed no signs of issues but
twisting the headphones does cause
chatter from the free moving parts in
the ear cups but nothing appeared to be
compromised but it does give off a sound
of being flimsy now how long will these
last only time will tell but with my
excessive stress test here it looks like
it will hold up well though now one of
the things that's very underrated and
sometimes people forget is to test the
sound League people around you don't
want to hear what you're listening to
here's my test in a sub or me
so with all that being tested how is the
sound in general for a pair of
headphones costing just $60 now first
off these are loud enough for most
people playing these around 70% was
enough to have music enjoyable now
trying these on a variety of music pop
music was first here and it did actually
pretty well with bright notes and clear
vocals those listening to what's popular
today like Ed Sheeran Beyonce and let's
say Bruno Mars here both for sure enjoy
these as for bass dominant artists like
2 Chainz Drake and Nicki Minaj bass
levels hit decent but a little harder
would have been a bit more immersive
hardcore rap fans I feel will be
somewhat disappointed in the lack of
that deeper sub bass again bass is good
but sub bass is lacking now also tried
listening to some classic Aerosmith in
ac/dc the headphones again does well in
its mid-range very clear vocals again
but felt lacking a bit in soundstage
where classic rock relies heavily on its
guitars and drummers and a little bit of
distance and space in between each
instrument the sound didn't give that
level of immersion as actually being
there now as for the high notes at my
normal listening levels rarely put on
certain songs with strong asses or snare
drums it does get a little bit fuzzy it
loses a little bit of its clarity at
that top range but I want to emphasize
it's only rare though so overall for a
pair of $60 headphones
I gotta admit it's better than some
other headphones I've tested in the low
$100 price range
the grinds actually performs very well
and I'll be honest I was expecting a
little bit less in performance either
it's lower in volume or just a little
bit more distortion in general overall
if you're in this price range and like
to look at the grinds you should
definitely give these a consideration so
hope this video helped you in some way
