back to another video today we're
looking at the j-bird x3 and comparing
them with the jaybird freedoms but
getting right into this start talking
about pricing the x3 they retail for a
hundred and twenty nine dollars with the
f5 s they're retailing for 199 dollars
but click on my links in the video
description below my links will give you
the most updated prices in real time for
the past week or two the jaybird
freedoms have been on sale for a hundred
and forty nine dollars so save yourself
about fifty dollars or so but in the
future when you're watching this my
links again should give you the most
updated prices hopefully there is a sale
going on at that time anyways let's get
into the contents here same carrying
case on both particular models nothing
too fancy nothing too too much to talk
about there same small medium and large
silicone ear tips and they are
interchangeable they're the same size
the only difference here is the foam ear
tips from comply the jaybird x3 they
have a isolation from ear tip which is a
little bit softer and it feels a little
bit stickier as well it's not dirty or
anything like that but I noticed that it
does feel more comfortable and it does
stick or stay in your ear a little bit
better also on the x3 s it's a slightly
redesigned ear fin it has a much more of
an angled curve here that it does fit
into the crevices of the ears a bit
better versus the jaybird freedom the
jump of freedom's offers that fin that's
still pretty much straight on here and
also the foam ear tips it's a sport foam
ear tip it's a little bit more denser
it's a little bit more rugged for those
who are maybe sweating and getting it a
little bit more wet over time so that's
the biggest difference in that aspect
now in where world use how big is the
difference first off I got to say if you
guys are wearing this the over ear
method and having the wire have a little
bit of tension hug the back of your neck
here both models practically felt the
same there really wasn't much of a
difference and they both very secure the
more traditional method here with the
wire basically hanging on the back of
your neck
I've noticed that jaybird freedoms stays
in the ears a bit better despite not
having that Earvin despite not having
that's that isolation ear tip the reason
being is because look how small these
things are they are ridiculously light I
believe these are the smallest and
lightest pair of
sport earphones in the world currently
all the weight is actually held into the
inline controller with the j-bert X
threes the batteries are actually hold
or held in each ear buds so that's a
little bit of weight it's not too much
but there's a little bit of weight and
then the antenna is actually housed in
the inline controller but with that
being said in the x3 review a lot of
people are saying the new controller was
big and bulky it looked heavy and the
x-series yes it did get wider though
it's still very thin and the weight it's
still very very light it did not bother
me whatsoever again the only thing
that's in here is the control board for
the volume controls and the the antenna
for Bluetooth to connect to your phone
or your device basically but because the
x3 do stick out a little bit again it
has a little bit more weight I've
noticed the freedoms for vigorous
exercise vigorous activities running
some CrossFit maybe they're doing some
sled pulls in the gym the freedoms did
stay in but you're a little bit better
though if you are wearing this the
traditional method again with the wire
on the back of your neck here the inline
controller and the freedom does hold a
little bit more weight and because of
that when you are running it does pull
the earphones slightly to the right of
your shoulder and the wires the wire on
this left side here you'll feel a little
bit of a tug or pull once of all you do
have to pull it back to make it more
symmetrical and feel I get a little bit
more comfortable it bothers some people
it doesn't bother others so that depends
on you but that is something that didn't
notice though it was more evident on the
freedoms versus the x3 so just something
to pay attention to you now talking
about the inline controller this is
where the battery is housed on the
freedom and we're talking about
attachments now with the freedoms there
is a four hour battery life on the
earphones themselves but it does come
with an attachment and it works just
like a power bank here there's an
additional of four hours of life you
just have to attach it right onto the
inline controller just like so and that
way you have it being charged and if you
decide to use it with the attachment on
you can do so you can still have music
playing while it's charging with the
j-bert x3 it has a eight hour battery
life and it does come also with a
proprietary dongle it's a pretty short
USB cable right here and the attachments
right here and just clip it right on the
inline controller just like that
but there's no additional power there's
no
additional features with this particular
attachment you can't use the jaybird
freedom attachment as well and to the
x-series so that's out of the question
it is a completely different design so
with that being said you can kind of see
where the differences are
I think the for our better life on the
freedoms is not bad at all if you do
have a fully-charged most people who do
go for a run the average person that is
you'll probably run maybe I don't know
45 minutes an hour maybe hour-and-a-half
some more vigorous runners maybe could
run for two hours that's the four hours
should last you enough if you are
running out of power you do have that
attachment clip it on it recharges it
for you and pretty quick too so let's
talk about comfort here let's see how it
feels in the ear to be honest with you
it's the same exact feeling both ear
tubes that goes into the ear canal
they're practically the same exact size
you can actually use the ear tips
interchangeably here between both models
the only thing that you can't use is the
ear fins the earphones and the X threes
are a little bit bigger so they cannot
fit on the jaybird freedom so that just
to clarify that I've know some people
were asking about that as well but
overall they both stayed in the ear with
the same amount of comfort the X twos
were bit pretty big back in the day the
X threes again are the same size as the
X twos so they do fit better and if you
compare just these two models with each
other they fit perfectly the same
there's really no difference in regards
to comfort going into the ear canal now
jumping into audio quality I'll be
honest with you I didn't feel I didn't
sense a difference it's very many oh
it's very hard to tell
taking it on and off I don't know if
repeatedly listening to both of these at
75 percent volume was loud enough for me
for comfortable listening but very much
enjoyable listening they are both
performing at the same volume levels the
bass the the sound signature practically
almost sounds identically the same if I
would say the freedoms and this only may
be a special microphone can probably
attest to this you might have a wider
soundstage a DJ bird freedoms themselves
it might sound a little bit better in
regards to how open it is but other than
that most consumers even if you had both
of them side-by-side most average
consumers were not even
the difference I think you guys are
perfectly fine with with audio quality
you guys can't go wrong with either or
they still provide very good audio
quality sound I personally like the
sound signature very open base is very
bass boosted the mens are pretty bright
for me in most cases the highs are clean
and clear they're not singing but
overall I really really enjoyed both
listening experience again they're both
very much similar or identical but that
that's about it I hope this comparison
video helped you in some way here I know
you guys have been asking about this and
hopefully it gives you some insight and
which one may be the better one for you
let me know in the comment section below
are you guys down for jailbird x3s are
they better for you or j-bird freedoms
let me know which one you guys decide if
you guys did buy it let me know in the
comment section below which one do you
prefer better
alright I'm Jimmy with James review
