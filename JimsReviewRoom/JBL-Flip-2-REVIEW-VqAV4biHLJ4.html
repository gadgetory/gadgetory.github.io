review room welcome to another review
today we'll be looking at the
just-released
JBL flip 2 for 2014 now this speaker
falls into the budget-friendly price
range of Bluetooth speakers of $99 the
big question I get with this price range
how does it sound
and is it loud and Alma in the past the
$99 price range was pretty low in there
but these companies are refining and
building better quality today so without
further adieu we'll get started the flip
tube comes in five different colors all
are housed in a very strong and durable
mesh aluminum with silicone grips on
each side then with my testing and
applying pressure the metal grille
didn't flex or budge at all measuring
six and a quarter inches wide and about
two and a half inches high it's a very
portable and rugged speaker to have
around now the flip two really keeps it
simple by offering really basic buttons
and functionality of a Bluetooth speaker
now as you can see going over to button
layout on the left side you have power
on and off in the middle of course your
volume up and down buttons are included
with a bluetooth pairing button on one
side to connect your devices and a
speakerphone button on the other side to
answer phone calls if needed and the
speakerphone option does work in my
opinion like any other good speaker film
that is despite JBL promoting noise
cancellation and background noise
reduction which with my test there was
small ambient noise is still picked up
and they're receiving it it's still good
though but I thought you know with the
superb JBL technology it would have been
eliminated altogether now on the other
side is Near Field Communication pairing
for any phone or tablet with NFC
compatibility you can just tap on the
side of the speaker and it will pair
with your phone or tablet instantly
there's no need of going through the
bluetooth settings and lastly on the
back you have a micro USB port for the
supplied wall charger and a
three-and-a-half millimeter port for
manually connecting your flip to your
audio source and lastly you have these
white LED lights that indicate how much
better you have remaining when powering
on in regards to power I really hoped
with this year's model
battery power lasted a bit longer but
JBL claims the similar five hours of
news as last year's model now through my
testing for
the charging the speaker then leaving
the speaker on at exactly 50% valium
which was comfortable listening lasted 3
hours and 20 minutes to be precise
definitely on the shorter end when
compared to the competitors so in the
end how does this all sound so what I'll
do to critique and then with the unit
apply several songs and give you my
verdict afterwards oh not so hot just
like innovate just add a touch it is so
fun it's all my hey baby
we don't mind oh the watchin cuz if the
Sun in closed room and there you have it
folks all the artists information is
found in the video description below now
sound of course is best for in person
and when playing through your speakers
it's not the best depiction of audio
quality well hence my review here the
first thing I've noticed right off the
bat it's a very loud speaker for the $99
segment it's actually as loud as my Bose
Soundlink 2 from last year in the new
$200 Sony x5 speaker which I'm also
reviewing now my focus is filling a room
with sound and not necessarily having
sound damn it on one side of the room
because the room is too large now with
other speakers I've compared they were
good for small rooms like bedrooms and
dorm rooms with medium rooms
hit or miss you can say like living
rooms and dining room
the flip - no question can fill a medium
room size pretty easily so with sound
for larger rooms being okay it's pretty
decent for larger rooms now like most
small speakers they do lack that deep
Rumble from these sub based levels
however mid to high bass levels are
plenty and at a reasonable level where
it doesn't drown out the other notes and
that's comforting because from just a
$99 speaker it's not bad at all
the mids and high ranges are good as
well where they're heavy on vocals
listening to John Rose like pop and
hip-hop are perfectly fine and at
maximum volume there's barely any
droning or tinging at the very highs but
considering its price and its segment in
small portable Bluetooth speakers it's
not better gone actually still
listenable now with the flip - you get
what you pay for but you get the most
bang for your buck in regards to sound
quality in my opinion I'll say this
again it's good for a small bluetooth
speaker but a few ears are more peculiar
or particular to sound stepping up to
the $150 range will get you a bit more
clarity depth and immersion into your
music so if you can get past a little
better life this is truly a very good
sounding speaker compared to the ones
I've reviewed in the past so be sure to
comment below and tell me what you think
about this speaker and for those who are
considering purchasing I hope to help
you in some way and as always be sure to
