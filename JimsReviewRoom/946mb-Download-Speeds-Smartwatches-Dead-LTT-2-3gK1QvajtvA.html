welcome back to another episode this
week there's tons of stuff to talk about
and I gotta give you guys sneak peek
basically a tease on this new gigabyte
internet that I have in my house here
I've been testing for the past week or
so but let's see what this episode
started let's talk about tech
all right so things are about to get
unusual right now I am back in my house
it's late at night earlier today as
you've seen in the introduction I was
filming in my car well after I left that
particular area I got back on the road
of course I was doing maybe about 45
miles per hour the road speed limit that
is and my engine started sputtering and
for some reason my engine just
completely died I lost all power
steering all power braking so I couldn't
stop I'm time if I wanted to I was
mashing the brakes as hard as I could
and there was another vehicle all way
down the road the road was slightly
curving a little bit too so it's hurting
the vehicle got a little bit harder as
you can imagine that was a some slightly
terrifying experience here so eventually
I try to apply the emergency brake as
gentle as I could I didn't want to lock
up the rear wheels and just basically
come to a gradual stop and thankfully I
get no collisions and though access I'm
perfectly okay thank goodness I didn't
have a tow truck come by the vehicle in
my car is at the mechanics right now and
then I walked back home which isn't too
far so so that's why I look a little bit
rugged right now but I had to make this
video here just to keep the show going I
guess you can take this keep the channel
going there's so much stuff that needs
to do for this particular week so a
little bit bummed out hopefully that
energy is not completely gone here so
please forgive me if I look a little bit
underwhelmed for the time being but
let's get this going here let's get this
episode started so first up the last
let's talk video last week I did
announce that I would maybe get the LGB
20 a lot of you guys commented back with
some positive feedback a lot of you guys
said well what about the iPhone 7 and
the 7 plus put it to rest in to clean up
the air I do have the iPhone 7 with me
definitely purchase it for the Apple
watch series to review which I uploaded
last week so a lot of people are asking
me that I use my iPod or the iPhone
considering that the iPod one
a real true experience with the Apple
watch so yes I did get this does it
clean up the air just to ensure that you
guys understand that I wasn't dumb I
don't know half-assing my reviews or
anything like that
Apple makes a good product the Apple
watch series - that I reviewed last it
was an amazing product as well so that
brings me to this question this topic
here is SmartWatch is dead basically I
don't think it's completely dead but
while we announced announced in Motorola
announced that they're not producing
smartwatches for this particular season
this fall season is Christmas season
they don't have an anticipated time of
when they're going to come out with a
new particular model so with that being
said they the reason why they're next we
know what the new product is because
smartwatches
in general or I'm not selling me because
it's Android wear the watches itself
maybe they're too thick maybe the
battery life which is a day and a half
maybe two days it's just not enough for
some people you guys let me know down
below our SmartWatch is still enticing
to you I've known some people on my
particular channel who voiced and stated
smartwatches
aren't really it doesn't allure them as
much as they want them to so the only
thing that we have so far is the Apple
watch zeroes - which is a phenomenal
SmartWatch and we have these Samsung
gear s 3 which should be coming in at
the end of this month or early next
month that should be very very
interesting so we'll see about those -
but under that let me know in comment
section below what do you guys think
about smartwatches where do you stand as
of today and do see if there's a future
for them as well next up here is another
Google product it's Google Fiber and
holy cow I've been waiting I think I
year maybe over a year for this ever
since Google announced that it was
coming to Charlotte North Carolina which
is where I'm at and I don't want to show
you too much but here let me just show
you this really quick teaser video and
then I just leave it as that here it
goes
all right that's it that's it I'm cut
the video tomorrow like I said of this
I'm trying to push out this video today
let's talk tech that's really quick and
simple no fancy editing tomorrow I'm
gonna try to do a Google Fiber video
everything that I've experienced so far
how I feel about it and pricing and also
educate you guys on what Google Fiber is
I know there's many of you guys that are
overseas or just don't have access to
Google Fiber you guys don't know what
it's all about that video should be
dropping soon so watch out for that I
like i'm shrining aim for it tomorrow
we'll see about my car situation if I
have to go out there and see what the
hell's going on and basically initiate a
repair hopefully it's not too costly a
little bit bummed out by that but
anyways about enough about the car
that's basically about a I'm trying to
make these things short and sweet but
also basically initiate a conversation
with you guys and amongst each other as
well we are a community of average users
average consumers again also tech
enthusiasts out there so anyways leave a
comment section leave a comment down
below follow me on Facebook Twitter
and/or Instagram again a jimmy long
official which is my personal account
and then we have Jim's review which is
nothing but tech it's just the more
business side of things follow me on
either-or and I'll catch you guys at the
next section or next episode of let's
talk Tech and I'll see you guys on
future videos alright take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
