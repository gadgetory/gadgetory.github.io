heart for budget-friendly products that
just works well it doesn't have to have
all the bells and whistles it doesn't
have to do anything fancy but the bare
essentials are all I need it brings me
back to a simpler time when things were
just much less complicated but still had
very much quality behind them now this
phone isn't for everyone but for certain
needs it may fit that pocket well no
there's no no pun intended there but
what I have here is the Moto e from
Motorola now it's priced at $150 for the
4G LTE version at the time this video
and that's without a contract that is so
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room calm
and I'm here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
the Moto is a small smartphone compared
to today's standards it's easy to carry
and easy to manage now the physical size
is slightly smaller than the iPhone 6 a
Samsung s6 or HTC m9 for premium
comparative purposes it's measuring at
5.1 inches tall 2.6 3 inches wide and
this screen itself measures 4.5 inches
now it is slightly thicker than most
other premium phones today granted its
budget pricing but after using this for
a good month now it's not a nuisance it
doesn't feel like a brick matter of fact
it's just slightly bigger than the $600
off contract and g4 phone by LG and a g4
was suitable for me as well now the
construction I have to admit feels dirty
as hell it's solid this feels very
durable and I think it's because this
entire backing and the sides too are
coated with a very simple silicone like
material now when gripped this doesn't
feel like metal or plastic found in
premium phones but it feels ruggedized
it won't slip out of your hands matter
of fact this phone is also water
resistant against accidental spills
splashes and light rain and from my
testing spilling water on it and lo
still hold up pretty well and besides
feeling tough you can soften up look
here with changing the surrounding bezel
by snapping off the old one and snapping
on the new one which I'll show shortly
you might like the colors but as you
guys know through my reviews here black
and Gray's are the way to go
but real quick here on the very top is
your three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone port the sides offer very
solid and clicky buttons and on the
bottom here is a micro USB port for
charging your phone and transferring
data to your PC but about that bezel
here once that's removed you'll have
access to your micro SIM card and a
micro SD card slot allowing up to 32
gigs of expandable memory unfortunately
it's not up to 64 but with a general
phone like this it's not targeting data
heavy users 32 gigs is still very good
for the average consumer but as you can
see here on the back can they want an
only thing that I wish all phones had
there's no removable battery and it's
not the fact that I'll be swapping
batteries out during the day but the
fact users might keep the phone for a
year too
maybe even more and after so many
charging cycles the battery starts to
lose its ability to hold its charge over
time but with that being sentient for a
phone this cheap here without a contract
it's almost justified now in the front
again is your earpiece but it's also
your speakerphone as well it's clear and
moderately loud that was suffice for
most people
now last is your front-facing camera
which only has VGA resolution if you're
taking selfies or doing video calls it's
unfortunately not clear even when you're
outdoors with ample lighting but on
their rear and getting into the primary
camera it's a 5 megapixel sensor that
does surprisingly well for such a
budget-friendly device it is advertised
as a 5 megapixel camera but that's only
for a 4 by 3 ratio photo to achieve this
widescreen photo like the one I'm
showing you on screen which is 16 by 9
you do have to drop it down to a 3.7
megapixel image now although that was
the case if all you're doing is just
basic social media setting photos to
others who show them something real
quick the camera still works fine as
long as there's ample lighting now keep
in mind all photos on screen are
unedited for your personal review now
the only big downfall here on this
camera though the low-light performance
is not great in a parking deck with
parking lamps and artificial lighting
words are not clear and the surrounding
cars are somewhat pixelated and washed
out the same thing is also evident when
you're indoors despite having light
though so if you're into the night scene
other weekends you can almost forget
about this camera here but overall the
camera functions fast no stutters with
taking photos testing burst shots
surprisingly doesn't even seem to have a
buffer lag shooting a full 60 shots
back-to-back and then deciding to let go
basically it didn't even faze the phone
so keep in mind the camera from my test
here functions fine outdoors but it's
when you're indoors or taking photos at
nights here that's when it doesn't
perform gracefully but let's move on to
the screen again it's 4.5 inches bidding
with a resolution of 960 by 540
translating to 245 pixels per inch now
would be unfair to compare this to a
premium phone but I can say the screen
is very well done
it could use a little bit more color or
set
in here but again for its price it's
actually nice now playing netflix and
viewing iron chef's house of cards and
random movies all did well
viewing text on internet browsers are
fine images are clear enough to be
enjoyable and overall nothing appears to
saturated nothing appears so washed out
that it looks unnatural the only areas I
didn't see as clear were the icons on
the phone and that was maybe the most
noticeable still not a deal-breaker but
getting into the internals here the Moto
e is running an older Snapdragon 410
processor with one gigabyte of RAM on
board per the cpu-z app here five
gigabytes of internal storage is
available out of the 8 which makes the
micro SD card slot very handy now from
real world usage it does fine for normal
everyday tasks watching movies playing
most android games browsing the internet
and using social media apps all of them
felt perfectly fine there isn't much
happiness felt and if there was any it's
only noticeable when I have a
significant amount of apps already open
and what I mean significant I mean 15
plus apps and windows it's fast enough
for most needs it's not zippy just want
to make sure that's clear there as other
premium phones but it's a reasonable
time for apps to open and for actions to
be executed from a hundred and fifty
dollar phone so with all that being said
here the power of this CPU despite being
an older chip still can hold its ground
and despite being an older chip and less
power efficient here as the new chips
available the battery life on this thing
is ridiculous now the last time I
remember getting more than two days of
better life was with this quote-unquote
dumb phone which I still have here so
far this has lasted me two days 10 hours
and 42 minutes to reach 10% power
remaining and that's from a full charge
a screen on time has been 5 hours and 58
minutes to be exact practically 6 hours
those elements are Stellan numbers
compared to the recent phones that I
have been using so with all that being
said when I told followers on my social
media I was reviewing the Moto e several
commented their parents and some women
said that their kids were actually using
this particular device probably the
first generation that is now I can very
much see that I can all
see this for those with occupations and
construction or maybe home remodeling or
so on those kind of fields plumbing
electrical whatever it may be that may
find the water resistance and also the
good battery life and that ruggedized
feeling to work out well for them now
overall I really enjoy this phone it's a
quality build it is at a great price and
most importantly it simply works and it
works well so how this review helped you
in some way be sure to stop by and take
a look at Jim's review room comm for
more content and other reviews that I
don't put on YouTube here and add me on
to Facebook Twitter Instagram or Google+
and you get to see behind the scenes
information and you can always stop by
he can say hi again I'm Jimmy with Jim's
review room calm and you guys take care
