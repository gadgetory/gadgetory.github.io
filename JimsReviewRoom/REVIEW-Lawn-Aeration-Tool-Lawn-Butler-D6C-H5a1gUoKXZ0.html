review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the Yard Butler d6c lawn
corn aerator
we're looking through the air Raiders
construction and style specifications
and features and lastly my pros and cons
on its performance and usage before I
get started here I want to advise why
core aeration is important and how it
keeps a healthy lawn core aeration is
simply removing plugs of soil from your
lawn with either a manual hand tool
which I'm reviewing today or a rented
aerating machine each plug is about half
inch in diameter and is about 2 to 6
inches deep overtime with constant
walking and kids playing in your lawn it
causes compaction and in turn causes
grass roots to impeding growth water and
fertilizer absorption is also reduced as
you can see here the yellow and somewhat
bare air is received the most foot
traffic I water my plants or boxes daily
and the foot traffic costs that
compassion you see there your lawn needs
loose soil so your grass roots can
obtain water nutrients fertilizer
pesticides when you put them down and
yield better seeding results grass roots
will also have a better time extending
and spreading through the holes created
to build a strong root system so let's
get started here as you can see here's
the aerator now I purchased this aerator
from Amazon for $25 at a time of this
review those aerator is made of all
construction steel and gunmetal gray
that appears to have been dipped in
paint and then clear coated for that
glossy appearance this item is
lightweight and weighs in at about 4
pounds the handle features a green super
hard rubber that I'm certain will over
the years start to flake and break down
once the rubber dries and cracks I do
have to mention the handle after some
time causes pain in the hands and I
don't mind the callous that forms but
after an hour's straight air rating I
found both my problems having sizable
blisters I would highly suggest using
gloves and wrapping the handles in
either tennis racket tape or duct tape
if you don't mind aesthetics they'll
give you a bigger handle and much more
cushion while handling this air Raider
features two prongs on each end with a
horizontal footplate to assist in
driving the aerator into the ground
the plugs are six inches apart which is
standard distance by lawn care
professionals then the plugs are three
and a half inches deep so let's get
start on the protestant cons here the
pro is it actually works and as you can
see here in the in the video the plugs
do spit out after each push into the
ground it's easy to use and economical
for small yards rather than renting a
huge and heavy machine the design and
construction withstood me hitting rocks
and boulders that were found under my
sod the air wedding tips and handle
didn't bend you can error it as much as
you want throughout the year
professionals recommend at least twice
once in spring and once in fall and
lastly and like I said most importantly
it works and as you can see here now for
the cons now you do need a wet lawn is
having a dry lawn doesn't have it just
makes it much more harder just to get
the prongs into the ground as you can
see here my prong don't go all the way
into the ground and I'm putting much
more effort into each placement this
aerator works best in moist or wet
ground only now this can easily be
achieved by saturating your lawn with
prior of the watering or doing it the
next morning after a night of rain one
side of my yard was drier than the other
and had a tough time just getting the
problem deep into the soil and there was
not as many plugs of soil spitting out
so I guess that's more of a tip than a
con but all in all just make sure your
lawn is saturated another con is the
aerator plugs do clog after being used
that dirt dries and becomes a rock-hard
so be sure to clean them out thoroughly
F in usage and before storing what I do
personally as you can see here is spray
the plugs and flush as much as I can
then I take a twig and stick it right
into the hole we spring the hole will
get her clean again another con is the
Hamill's are absolutely horrible but
again to remedy this try to use gloves
and wrap the handles with some sort of
tape another con is this item is a pain
for large yards and you can see my back
yard there I spent a total of four hours
two hours in the front and two hours in
the back got the job done though but
case rental might have been a little bit
more ideal so that's it that concludes
my review for the yard Butler d6c long
core aerator which I purchased off of
Amazon I hope you enjoyed this review
