review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the AB wheel from Gold's
Gym found at your local Walmart for only
$8 now for folks outside the US
amazon.com has a bunch of these similar
wheels for sale as well now as a
disclaimer I'm not a fitness instructor
I'm just the average guy who's looking
for products that work so I'm not jacked
or cut at all it might not even have the
best posture in my videos the review is
on the product itself and not me now
getting that out the way one of the most
underestimated workouts our core
workouts for every movement that you do
throughout your day and throughout your
life you actually engage your core
muscles first so that way energy is
transferred to say your arms legs back
etc now for example try opening a
stubborn jar lid not only do you use
your arm muscles but your body uses its
core as a foundation for energy transfer
or imagine being on a roller coaster and
your body's being tossed and turned or
even something very simple like riding a
bike now relax your entire core at that
time and you'll be wobbling everywhere
now imagine this do an incline bench
press and right before you lift your
weights you can feel your entire core
tighten your core is your foundation to
keeping posture throughout the movements
and getting the most out of every lift
to even every job that you go through
now have you seen one of your friends do
a wonky push up like this before either
the butts too high or maybe it's too low
either way their Center isn't engaged
either because maybe a pure laziness or
a really weak core so without further
ado we'll get started
now one measure to determine your core
strength is by doing planks now per
men's fitness calm the average person
can stay in this position for about a
minute above that you're usually an
animal above the two-minute mark you're
actually a beast here I show you my
attempt at a plank and hold it as long
as I can until failure the key part is
to literally lay like a plank and keep
your body perfectly straight your elbows
Bend at 90 degrees and you're on your
toes with your legs together of course
the video is sped up so we can get to
the product now I want you to do this
yourself and post your times below in
the comments
now the Abril is a very simple design
and build consisting of a handlebar
with two foam grips on either side and
the twin plastic wheel is just literally
that it's just plastic nonetheless it's
very tough and durable for its intended
use although with no ball bearings or a
metal cylinder the wheel does free flow
once the handlebar is inserted and
rotates easily even once you apply
pressure and start using the tool now
starting with a simpler knee position
then going to aggressive standing up
exercises I felt my hamstrings
tightening and keeping balance on the
wheel I felt my entire abdominal area
from my lower abs to upper abs stretch
and tighten at the same time and even up
to my chest area where I've fully
extended above my head my arm muscles
were engaged as well to keep balance and
especially when pulling myself back up
over all this type of workout has many
compound movements meaning I'm working
several areas at the same time now also
perform side rolls and just feeling my
side stretch felt amazing this exercise
specifically worked around my rib areas
now it's one of the most unique and
amazing workout activities that you can
do and it actually feels good doing so
and although the wheel is narrow it's
great to attempt to keep your balance
engaging all of your muscles at the same
time now for those who have never done
this before or think their core isn't as
stable their first time doing this might
be a bit scary either falling face-first
wobbling maybe not strong enough to pull
yourself back up now it's a valid
concern but then what makes this wheel
great though it helps identify areas of
opportunity to strengthen either your
back your arms or your legs it makes you
stronger if you're coming from that
standpoint of course be careful and
slowly train and condition yourself to
achieve this I can say the next day I
was feeling pretty sore and I do try to
work out several days a week and I
actually still felt results the next day
so yes the AB wheel does work
non-reality this exercise alone won't
get you cut or ripped you can do all the
sit-ups in the world or even use this
wheel twice a day or even more but
without a clean diet your abs will
always have a layer of fat on top of
them remember to eat clean to get lean
so overall with its sturdy construction
the price only at $8 at Walmart in this
type of exercise or bring all of your
core muscles those are just some of the
pros this thing has to offer like I said
earlier this will alone won't get you
shredded but think of this as a tool to
supplement your regimen
Courtley as they did in the beginning of
this video working your core muscles is
hugely beneficial for everyday life and
especially if you're lifting weights
where they're male and female to achieve
greater gains when working on other
muscle groups so in my opinion the ab
little is definitely worth a buy
especially for this price so I hope you
