welcome to another review today we'll be
looking at the brand new Roku streaming
stick this device is intended and
competing with the Google chromecast
although a bit higher at 50 dollars now
with my review today I'll be focusing
more on content and the channel lineup
for those who are not familiar with Roku
and be sure to watch my review of the
Amazon fire TV in Google chromecast when
those videos are available if they're on
my channel or by clicking these videos
displayed so without further ado we'll
get started going over its physical
layout first it's a full size HDMI
dongle just like the chromecast and does
require its own power now if your TV has
a USB port you can connect it there and
if not Roku does provide a wall adapter
as well now once you plug everything in
and turn on the TV just follow the
instructions on how to connect your Roku
to your wireless home Internet and it's
pretty straightforward after that now
I'm not too fond of having another
controller laying around but the
controller does work well though and
it's a very simple layout and you have
the basic back button at the top left
home to the right purple directional pad
to navigate rewind play and forward and
lastly on the bottom our quick access
buttons that unfortunately you cannot
change now once everything is set up and
this is very important as this was not
part of the instructions go to your
settings then display type and if you
have a 1080p television or monitor
change it to that and for some reason
after installation that were made on
720p for me and I believe it did make a
slight difference in image quality now
getting back on topic here we'll get
going with the content now my channels
host your downloaded channels for
viewing and the bulk of your time is
spent here but before I get into that
I'll run down real quick on the other
features Roku offers now if your
interesting movies and you don't want to
Dreadnoks down the street the latest
movies are available that you normally
wouldn't find of course on Netflix or
Hulu type services a videos offer rent
or purchase and Retin usually is 399 up
to $5.99 in some cases for standard and
HD versions respectively
now most purchase prices are $14.99 and
can go up to $19.99
now prices are kind of the on the
expensive side just to rent a movie
considering I'm a Redbox kind of a
person where I can rent a movie for low
two dollars but when compared to other
at home rental services like renting a
movie on your Xbox Playstation or
renting through your cable provider it's
on par and at the same time similar
price making the Roku competitive when
comparing apples to apples as the same
thing for TV shows a lot of the latest
content up to the previous season are
available in for both movies and TV
listings they're broken down very well
based on type and genre you're
interested in through their menu list
now as for the news category it does
work well from a needs each video is
more like a one to three minute clip
that highlights on a subject at hand
making each news story easily digestible
and once I click on a video this will
play video after video until all are
played and they're continuously being
updated throughout the day it's just
real quick short clips just to get a
glimpse of what's going on out there in
the world again the news can be broken
down to each category as seen on your
screen now regarding the channel store
found on the main page of Roku this is
where it's all at this is where you add
all your channels to my channels as I
mentioned in the beginning of the video
now roku claims they have over 1000
channels which by comparison with a
chromecast is massive
Roku does a great job with practically
all of your popular subscription-based
channels like Netflix Amazon Instant and
HBO GO for those Game of Thrones videos
out there etc and more are shown on your
screen right now and pause the video if
you have to and for those who are not
familiar with Roku besides those
channels you get channels that
supplement your cable box now if you
have Time Warner Cable or let's say even
Dish Network download the channel sign
in with your accounts and you can watch
some of your cable channels on a TV
without paying for that actual cable box
as an example
ESPN provides free content once you sign
in again with your cable providers the
user ID and password and you'll have
access to ESPN live which after my test
ran about a minute behind the actual
live feed from my TV downstairs and
you'll also have on-demand video clips
just in case you want to go back and
replay some highlights through the
sports world and non cable channels like
Fox are providing this feature where you
can watch full episode
that were recently aired again this is
also free and only requires you to
verify you have a compatible device
although the screen says you need to
activate to watch it was simple as
putting in the screen code and two
fastest website to verify the device is
again compatible nothing is charged now
to be honest some channels have more
content than others the previously
mentioned channels offers live TV or at
least full episodes of contents some
others as an example like the Disney
Channel plays only trailers or clips of
movies while the major-league channel
requires you to have the MLB pass to
watch its content the paid subscription
basically so if you're at the store and
seen the back of the box or looked up
Roku on their website not all they're
shown or advertised channels aren't
necessarily free but the next section
which makes up for the rest of what Roku
offers are free to watch though and this
one makes up the bulk of the thousand
channels Roku claims though they're
similar if not mainly Internet TV
channels and there's tons of content you
have big names like revision3 IGN and
Vimeo which are nonetheless great then
I'll continue to scroll through the
screen to see what's available so you
may decide if Roku is right for you
again feel free to pause or go back if
I'm scrolling too fast now I personally
like watching the Food Network on cable
TV and scrolling through some of the
food channel offerings here you can see
there's a decent variety you won't see
Bobby Flay or shows like worst cooks in
America but again there's some decent
content that's worthwhile to watch now
being frank some of the content
providers are not as well known in not
hiding budgets so there are home pages
you can say it looks almost like a yahoo
web page pet from the 90s
now some content might look like you're
watching daytime television where the
content isn't as interesting or
appealing as you'd hope but because
there is so much content out there
there's still a good amount of channels
that you can watch as a similar
experience with cable TV then I
practically watch only a few channels
out of the 100 or two that are provided
by my cable provider and that's Time
Warner now in regards to performance it
works well but it for the most part it's
not the most fluid thing you've seen and
the chromecast isn't fast either nor is
Apple TV at this point it's almost okay
to say that's expected because these
dongle type devices
really
hold the power like their external boxes
example the Roku 3 and the new Amazon
fire TV now you do have some stutters
and hiccups from time to time and you
would have to wait several seconds for
the Roku to catch up now it's not a deal
breaker but it would have been nice or
you would have thought that would have
been a bit quicker the resolution on the
menus are not the best even after
changing a setting to 1080 but the
content image like on Netflix or as good
as the competition so in regards to
performance it feels on par with the
chromecast as an individual product
though and using tablets and smartphones
these days
yes it scrolls through the menus for the
most part fine but when loading content
or lots of images it does lag a bit now
moving on to the app that comes with the
Roku which you can download for either
your Apple or Android powered device I
downloaded mine to the iPad and it works
great you can use this app on your
smartphone and have it like a remote
control right in your pocket now in
regards to content is the same layout in
John Rob rake down where you can add and
delete channels through your device and
using this app was much faster and
smoother than going through the TV menus
and lastly through the app you can cast
similar to chromecast content that
you're watching now for example if
you're watching a video on your iPad
click the cast button up top and select
your Roku the Roku will eventually start
playing that video on its own on the
connected TV now this works with YouTube
Netflix and any other video photo or
music you have on your device so far
what's great about Roku you have all of
your subscription services so if you
have one service and not the other
you're not missing out Roku basically
provides almost all of them for you now
you have channels that supplement your
cable box experience and you get cable
on a TV where you haven't paid for an
additional cable box now if you don't
have cable and refuse to pay that
astronomical monthly fee there's tons of
free content for viewing and although
some channels might be a bit lackluster
there's a good amount of channels that I
can see using from time to time so
that's it
I know this video was somewhat long but
I hope this review helped you in some
way be sure to watch the Amazon fire TV
and Google chromecast review when
available if you have not please take
your time to like and subscribe to this
video for future alerts new products
