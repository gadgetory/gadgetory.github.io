good welcome back to another vlog here
you rode to 100,000 subscribers in the
side for the jitters and and whatnot
here but i'm dropping into the city i
need to do a quick sound test and I'm be
bose soundlink to headphones and just
see if I can hear some ambient noises
out in the air and whatnot but awesome
jam-packed day after this I'm going to
the whitewater rafting center there they
have tons of bike trails from you know
the but the bunny slopes you can say
down to with a very difficult and a
pretty extreme stuff but something i do
once in a while when I get you know some
time I guess you can say and it is a way
for me to get away from the city and
then one of my on the bike trails it is
tranquil there's no one out there I mean
these other bike riders here and there
but it is very quiet away from the city
and the man when you're biking from with
10 miles or so I don't know if I can do
the full 10 miles today but when you're
biking for that long I mean all you have
is just the thoughts to yourself and
this time of think and reflect and
whatnot but yeah looking for a spot
right now it's a park and anyways I'll
catch you guys later I'll show you guys
what I'm doing in a truck
hey folks on site right now working away
from the house got me on the field today
which I'm grateful for get some fresh
air but i just want to show you
something behind the scenes stuff i'm
reporting for the bose soundlink to
right now now i'm trying to get one of
these full shots right here in the
staircase or stairwell and looks down to
the city right here a part of the state
and I try to give some life let me turn
around real quick here try to get some
life into my videos and a little bit
something different like I said I once
in a lot like to be out in to get some
fresh air once in a while but I got the
camera here so really tall here and this
is the shot that I'm trying to get I can
put it right next to the camera here so
in the review that it might already be
out by the time you see this vlog this
part of the same this is where i'll be
standing so pretty cool I'm gonna go
down to the street later I'm going to
test I'm going to test the sound
isolation the passive noise isolation
and see if I can hear like the ambient
noise is the cars around me at whatnot
so through a lot of real-world testing
and on the field show you guys what I
basically do so that's it and here it is
folks the u.s. whitewater rafting center
it's got paid for parking park it's not
too bad parking spot for five bucks it's
got pay the yo booth attendant here dang
I didn't think he'll be busy today it's
Friday afternoon they're like 230
telling you man every time i go out i'm
always wondering don't keep that jobs
like i said and my made my very first
blog i think all these people are
bloggers themselves so we just don't
know their YouTube games and this is a
not the employee parking but this is
just like general parking for everyone
but yeah let me find a parking spot real
quick and I'll show you guys give you
guys a tour around real quick
so this entire place is actually
man-made all these Rapids are simulated
basically they're able to adjust the
degree of difficulty in the rapids and
make for a different course every time
and to my right here is the largest
outdoor climbing facility I believe in
I'll know if it down the east coast or
is it just a girl in America and usually
every Thursday night they have live
bands craft breweries dump they have
food trucks and whatnot there's two
stages here I got a nice restaurant up
here and behind that restaurant right
there in the center is a zip line that
spans all the way across I don't know
midea once I go by there we'll see
someone zipping along here but there's
class one two three and up to class-4
Rapids as you can see this is the more
intermediate loop but yeah man it's
pretty fun stuff I wish to loop with a
little bit bigger but I can imagine how
much it costs to build a man-made
wrapping center so looks pretty cool and
let me a sock around here real quick and
I'm actually heading towards 12 bike
trails as well the fake trails I mean
it's it's huge it used to be like 11
miles or so 12 miles long and they've
bought more land expanded the trails and
whatnot and there I swear to God
probably like seventeen miles long now I
I don't think I've ever done the whole
entire 17 miles before and just once
thin that is taxing on the body of
course but I think someone's going on
the zip line right now hold on let me
stop real quick here I mean it's not the
not the same as the ones that you
zipline over in the woods and whatnot or
up in the mountains you can get into the
facility just for five dollars five
dollars we just you know pays for
parking and you can use the bike trails
and
they gave walk the trail to obviously
and just hang out here live bands you
know music boos whatever you need but
then to do the all-day facilities like
the water rafting the ziplining there's
canopy tours and whatnots I believe
don't quote me you can always go on
their website I believe it's about fifty
five dollars for the entire
Oh
alright folks so I'm at a stopping point
right now / my polar watch here excuse
me I've been on the trails for about two
and a quarter miles and about thirty
little over 30 minutes so far on the
trail and two miles and 30 minutes i
guess doesn't seem like much but man
these trails they got roots Roxy I climb
over and logs and the trails are really
narrow I'm at more of like a stopping or
common area let me see if I can flip the
camera around here and show you my
stopping point here well this is where I
usually stop here obviously the shroud
comes up this way and then I got my bike
here the trail just keeps going up and
up it up and like all the way around up
there so pretty fun man but it's a good
workout though but what I want to show
you guys real quick was a camelbak for
those who are not too familiar with that
I want to show you guys when I first
started you know mountain biking I just
carry water bottles I secare like to and
I were down to pride within the first
hour so maybe even less to be honest
with you and sometimes even poured on my
head is to keep cool during the summer
months but a camelbak basically is that
pouch the whole gym liquid for you guys
it's a silicone or kind of some kind of
antimicrobial pouch I believe back
inside here and it holds a really decent
amount i can remember how many ounces
this whole i'll probably put up on the
screen right now but i mean it it it
does everything for me obviously holding
the keys wallet my cell phone obviously
and then here goes your hose here
basically put in your mouth drink out of
that's about it really cool i think it
was if i can't remember maybe 50 bucks
or so and for those who are interested
it goes my bike got this man probably
the four years ago three years ago it's
really a beginner bike I didn't know if
I was going to really enjoy the sport or
not I love biking when I was a kid but I
never ever biked like biking trails up
in the woods and whatnot and so I give
this shots of beginners bike prob about
maybe five hundred dollars or so
and at the white water rafting center
man you got I mean the business guys
they come here after work or on the
weekend and you can see them riding
around 3,000 4,000 even $5,000 bikes
minutes it's crazy but now it's just a
regular basic trek bike hardtail no rear
suspension I like it because it's just
ridiculously easy to maneuver around I
really like it a lot but but yeah I mean
that's a that's my equipment that I'm
rocking right now and again like I said
a the polar m400 I used to track my gps
and my distance and I didn't wear the
trustor out today and that's about it
all right folks so just got off of the
intermediate trail and the exit is right
over there actually to the parking lot
and to go back home and I'll know if you
guys can see this here down the polar
watch I've done 5.7 miles so far and
about an hour and 40 minutes in so call
me crazy but I want to finish it off and
I got a summer crippled bike I guess you
can say oh man just don't sound good the
I can remember what the it's not a
derail I can't mean the gear shifter
it's it's a little bit loose so I do
have to take it a little bit easy but
let me see if I can flip the camera
around here I'm gonna do this one I'm
gonna do this one last trail here I'm
here obviously and it's about three
miles or whatever I don't think I'm
gonna take the optional route alright
see you guys at the end again it's a 5.7
two miles I know it's not focusing but I
got one handed focus it right now all
right i'll see you guys on the other
side back over here yes that's the
that's the finish line and then I start
over here alright and there you go folks
8.2 miles in total two hours and seven
minutes of a total workout for today and
just approved that I'm back at the
beginning here try to focus it there we
go and that is a wrap folks quads are
burning I'm exhausted and it's probably
about five o'clock right now
and kind of head home shower and get
ready for some dinner all right it's
question time now what I want you guys
to do is ask me anything down in the
comments section below I will basically
try to answer them next week and next
week's vlog but got my list of questions
here and we'll start off with Wesley
urban and I do apologize and I pronounce
any of your name's been correctly er
down the road what did I major in and
how long was I in school for I majored
in communication with a focus in
marketing and advertising obviously I
didn't do that right out of school but I
you can say I'm doing it today how long
was in school for I was in college for
three and a half years and obviously
it's not the full four years I my last
several semesters I tried really hard to
discriminatory well my senior was like
half a year old with this one semester
and going to my counselor before the
semester started I asked them if I could
take more classes just to graduate early
and she said no at the time so what I
did was I went to my local state college
and applied there and did I think two
classes part-time a couple of business
classes so elective classes and whatnot
and I did that part time and i think i
was taking 18 credit hours at my main
university which was university of
buffalo and that semester I was taking a
total of I believe 23 24 credit hours so
it was a pretty tough year I guess you
can say but I'm glad I did it next
question is from love Joshi he asked
what software do I use to edit my videos
what camera do I use and what microphone
very common question software-wise I use
Adobe Premiere CC it's on the cloud
right now and take the at reduce not too
expensive it's about fifty dollars a
month if I recall what camera day I used
for the longest time I was using an
older nikon d 5100 it's my first ever
DSLR and those were the videos that
really launched my youtube channel it
was only until recently and probably my
now counting may be my last twenty video
out of my 200 and what sixty videos I
have right now only 20 of those videos
are on my newest camera that you guys
see in them in the more recent videos
it's a nikon d810 if you're curious I
don't use the kit lens if you guys are
investing into a decent camera usually
the kit lens are okay but I believe that
you can always spend about the same
amount money or maybe a little bit more
and get a much better line so I'm using
a tamron 24 to 70 does better than the
kit lens I'm telling you and the
microphone i use right now is the roadie
Mike pro I just use that because I saw
at a time I saw a lot of other youtubers
using it so I thought it was great it
does work it does do justice but I most
likely not anytime soon but i might get
this Shore microphone which i pry put up
right here it's a little bit more
expensive but there's volume controls on
there the roadie Mike doesn't have any
volume controls at all like I said and
it's just a little bit harder to tink
around it's not as much fine-tuning as I
could do with the other microphones that
I have experienced so far so hopefully
that helps you out Joshi next question
here is from miles he asked what camera
did I used to record my last vlog well
on my vlog so far including this one has
been on my samsung note for phone
alright that's it for this vlog I know
these answers like I said in the last
vlog they are very my answers are very
long but I do try to I mean I really try
to help people out there if I can
inspire someone to do great out there
man that that means the world to me so
hopefully I helped you in some way of
course again ask me questions down below
you can ask me anything it doesn't have
to be YouTube related and i'll try to
answer them next week on next week's
vlog aren't you guys take care remember
to add me on social media facebook
instagram and twitter talk to you guys
later bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
