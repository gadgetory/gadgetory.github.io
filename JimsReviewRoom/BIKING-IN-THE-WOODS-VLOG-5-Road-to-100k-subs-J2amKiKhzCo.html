hope you guys doing good welcome back to
another vlog here you road to 100,000
subscribers and sorry for the jitters
and and whatnot here but I'm dropping
into the city I need to do a quick sound
test and I'm be Bose Soundlink to
headphones and just see if I can hear
some ambient noises out in the air and
whatnot but awesome jam-packed day after
this I'm going to the whitewater rafting
center there they have tons of bike
trails from you know the but the bunny
slopes you can say down to with a very
difficult and a pretty extreme stuff
well that's something I do once in a
while when I get you know some time I
guess you could say and it is a way for
me to get away from the city and then
one of my on the bike trails
it is a tranquil there's no one out
there I mean these other bike riders
here and there but it is very quiet away
from the city and man when you're biking
from with ten miles or so I don't know
if I can do the full ten miles today but
when you're biking for that long I mean
all you have is just the thoughts to
yourself and there's time to think and
reflect and whatnot but yeah looking for
a spot right now it's a park and anyways
I'll catch you guys later I'll show you
guys what I'm doing in a truck
hey folks on the site right now working
away from the house got me on the field
today which I'm grateful for get some
fresh air but I just want to show you
something behind the scenes stuff I'm
recording for the Bose Soundlink two
right now I'm trying to get one of these
cool shots right here there's a
staircase or stairwell and looks down to
the city right here a part of the city
and I try to give some life let me turn
around real quick here try to get some
life into my videos and a little bit
something different like I said I once
in a lot like to be out pinned get some
fresh air once in a while but I got the
camera here so I'm really tall here and
this is the shot that I'm trying to get
I can put her mine next to the camera
here so in the review that you might
already be out by the time you see this
vlog this part of the scene this is
where I'll be standing so pretty cool
I'm gonna go down finish three later I'm
going to test I'm going to test the
sound isolation the passive noise
isolation and see if I can hear like the
ambient noise is the cars around me and
whatnot so through a lot of real-world
testing and out on the field show you
guys what I basically do so that's it
and here it is folks the u.s. whitewater
rafting Center has got paid for parking
parking is not too bad parking spot for
five bucks
it's got paid the yup booth attendant
here dang I didn't think he'll be busy
today it's Friday afternoon at like 2:30
telling you man every time we go out I'm
always wondering don't people got jobs
like I said in my made my very first
blog I think all these people are
bloggers themselves so we just don't
know their YouTube games and this is a
not the employee parking but this is
just like general parking for everyone
but yeah let me find a parking spot real
quick and I'll show you guys give you
guys a tour around real quick
so this entire place is actually
man-made all these Rapids are simulated
basically they're able to adjust the
degree of difficulty in the rapids and
make for a different course every time
and to my right here is the largest
outdoor climbing facility I believe in I
don't know if it's on the east coast or
is it just ago in America and usually
every Thursday night they have live
bands craft breweries done to have food
trucks and whatnot there's two stages
here
I got a nice restaurant up here and
behind that restaurant right there in
the center is a zipline that spins all
the way across I don't know midea once I
go by there we'll see someone zipping
along here but there's class one two
three and up to class 4 Rapids as you
can see this is the more intermediate
loop but yeah man it's pretty fun stuff
I wish the loop was a little bit bigger
but I can imagine how much it cost at
the build a man-made wrapping Center so
looks pretty cool and let me just circle
around here real quick and I'm actually
heading towards one's the bike trails as
well the fake trails I mean it's it's
huge it used to be like 11 miles or 12
miles long and they've bought more land
expanded the trails and whatnot and
they're I swear to God probably like 17
miles long now I I don't think I've ever
done the whole entire 17 miles before
and just one spin that is taxing on the
body of course but I think someone's
going on the zip line right now hold on
let me stop real quick here I mean it's
not the it's not the same as the ones
that you zipline over in the woods and
whatnot or up in the mountains you can
get into the facility just for five
dollars five dollars we just you know
pays for parking and you can use the
bike trails and
they give walk the trail to obviously
and just hang out here live bands you
know music booze whatever you need but
then to do the all-day facilities like
the water rafting the ziplining
there's canopy tours and whatnots I
believe don't quote me you can always go
on their website I believe it's about
$55 for the entire hair
all right folks so I'm at a stopping
point right now per my polar watch here
excuse me
I've been on the trails for about two
and a quarter miles and about thirty a
little over 30 minutes so far on the
trail and two miles and 30 minutes I
guess doesn't seem like much but man
these trails they got roots rocks you
gotta climb over and the logs and the
trails are really narrow I'm at more of
a like a stopping or common area let me
just see if I can flip the camera around
here and show you my stopping point here
well this is where I usually stop here
obviously the trail comes up this way
and then I got my bike here and the
trail just keeps going up and up it up
and like all the way around up there so
pretty fun man but it's a good workout
though but what I want to show you guys
real quick was a Camelback for those who
are not too familiar with that I want to
show you guys when I first started you
know mountain biking I used to carry
water bottles icy care like two and I
would down to pride within the first
hour or so maybe even less to be honest
with you I mean sometimes even portent
on my head just to keep cool during the
summer months but a Camelback basically
is that pouch the holds in liquid for
you guys
it's a silicone or kind of some kind of
antimicrobial pouch I believe back
inside here and it holds a really decent
amount I can remember how many ounces
this whole I'll probably put up on the
screen right now but I mean it it it
does everything for me obviously holding
the keys wallet my cell phone obviously
and then here goes your hose here
basically put in your mouth drink out of
that's about it really cool I think it
was if I can remember made 50 bucks or
so and for those who are interested it
goes my bike we've got this man probably
four years ago three years ago it's
really a beginner bike I I didn't know
if I was gonna really enjoy the sport or
not
I love biking when I was a kid but I
never ever biked like biking trails up
in the woods and whatnot and so I give
this shots of beginners bike probably
maybe for $500 or so and at the white
water rafting Center man you got I mean
the business guys they come here after
work or on the weekend and you can see
them riding around 3000 4000 even 5000
dollar bikes man it's it's crazy but now
it's just a regular basic trek bike
hardtail no rear suspension I like it
because it's just ridiculously easy to
maneuver around I really like it a lot
but but yeah I mean that's a that's my
equipment that I'm rocking right now and
again like I said a the polar m400 I
used to track my GPS and my distance and
I didn't wear the trustor out today and
that's about it alright folks so just
got off of the intermediate trails and
the exit is right over there actually to
the parking lot and to go back home and
I'll know if you guys can see this here
but on the Polar watch I've done five
point seven miles so far and about an
hour and 40 minutes in so call me crazy
but I want to finish it off and I got a
summer crippled bike I guess you can say
I can't remember what the it's not a
derail I can't I mean the gear shifter
it's it's a little bit loose so I do
have to take it a little bit easy but
let me see if I can flip the camera
around here I'm gonna do this one I'm
gonna do this one last rail here I'm
here obviously and it's about three
miles or whatever I don't think I'm
gonna take the optional route
alright see you guys at the end again
it's a 5.7 two miles I know it's not
focusing but I got one-handed
focus it right now alright I'll see you
guys on the other side back over here
yes that's the that's the finish line
and then I start over here alright and
there you go folks eight point two miles
in total two hours and seven minutes of
a total workout for today and just
approved that I'm back at the beginning
here try to focus it there we go and
that is a wrap folks quads are burning
I'm exhausted and it's probably about
five o'clock right now and kind of head
home shower and get ready for some
dinner alright it's question time now
what I want you guys to do is ask me
anything down in the comment section
below I will basically try to answer
them next week and next week's vlog but
got my list of questions here and we'll
start off with Wesley Irwin and I do
apologize and I pronounce any of your
names incorrectly er down the road what
did I major in and how long was I in
school for I majored in communication
with a focus in marketing and
advertising obviously I didn't do that
right out of school but I can say I'm
doing it today
how long was in school for I was in
college for three and a half years and
obviously it's not the full four years I
my last several semesters I tried really
hard to just cram in all those credit
hours I remember my senior year
well my senior year was like half a year
old but just one semester and going to
my counselor before the semester started
I asked them if I could take more
classes just to graduate early and she
said no at the time so what I did was I
went to my local State College and
applied there and did I think two
classes part-time a couple of business
classes or so elective classes and
whatnot and I did that part-time and I
think I was taking 18 credit hours at my
main University which was a University
of Buffalo and that semester I was
taking a total of I believe 23 24 credit
hours so it was a pretty tough year I
guess he can say but I'm glad I did it
next question is from love Joshi he
asked what software do I use to edit my
videos what camera do I use a what
microphone a very common question
software wise I use Adobe Premiere CC
it's on the cloud right now and to be
introduced not too expensive it's about
$50 a month if I recall what camera dad
used for the longest time I was using an
older Nikon d50 100 it's my first ever
DSLR and those were the videos that
really launched my youtube channel it
was only until recently and probably my
now counting maybe my last 20 videos out
of my 200 and what 60 videos I have
right now only 20 of those videos are on
my newest camera that you guys see in
them in the more recent videos it's a
Nikon d810 and if you're curious
I don't use the kit lens if you guys are
investing into a decent camera usually
the kit lens are okay but I believe that
you can always spend about the same
amount money or maybe a little bit more
and get a much better line so I'm using
a Tamron 24 to 70 does better than the
kit lens I'm telling you and the
microphone I use right now is the roadie
mic Pro I just use that because I saw at
a time I'll saw a lot of other youtubers
using it so I thought it was great
it does work it does do justice but I
most likely not anytime soon
but I might get this shorter microphone
which I put up right here it's a little
bit more expensive but there's volume
controls on there the roadie mic doesn't
have any volume controls at all like I
said and it's just a little bit harder
to tinker around it's not as much
fine-tuning as I could do with the other
microphones that I have experienced so
far so hopefully that helps you out
Joshy next question here is from Myles
he asked what camera that I used to
record my last vlog well all my vlogs so
far including this one has been on my
Samsung Note 4 phone alright that's it
for this vlog I know these answers like
I said in the last vlog they are very my
answers are very long but I do try to I
mean I really try to help people out
there if I can inspire someone to do
great out there man that that means the
world to me so hopefully I helped you in
some way of course again ask me
questions down below you can ask me
anything it doesn't have to be YouTube
related and I'll try to answer them next
week on next week's vlog all right you
guys take care remember to add me on
social media Facebook Instagram and
Twitter
talk to you guys later bye
