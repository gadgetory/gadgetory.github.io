review room welcome to another review
today we'll be looking at the brand new
samsung galaxy tabpro the model I have
here is the 8.4 inch 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi
only version and a tab Pro products at
the moment comes in 8.4 10.1 and 12.2
inches and Samsung has other similar
tablets called the Galaxy Note pro as
well which has almost the same identical
specifications but has features that
makes use of the supplied stylus pen
those come in 10.1 and 12.2 inches and
you can click on any one of these videos
playing to watch or find them on my
channel so the prices on the expensive
side but after reviewing so many tablets
Samsung does strive to be a premium
tablet maker and a Tab pro is no
exception
so without further adieu we'll get
started
this is the smallest tabpro measuring in
at five inches wide 8.6 inches high and
only 0.28 inches thin that's 7.1
millimeters to be exact making this tie
to be the thinnest tablet on the market
as of this review until the Sony Xperia
z2 is released later this month and
although not the lighters in the world
it's still very lightweight weighing in
at less than a pound now going over its
physical features my medium-sized hands
were able to grab this 8.4 inch tap pro
with no problems the imitation leather
backing and stitching is coated with a
silicone rubber like material which does
give it a little bit more friction and a
sense of security and going forward all
the pro and no products will have that
same backing now the layout is similar
as well with the power button located
top right with volume rocker buttons
next in the middle is the infrared
blaster to use with your TV to change
channels after you set that up now the
very bottom of the tablet features your
microUSB port for charging and
transferring data with two speakers
located on either side the sound does
get loud enough but the quality is
decent and not great you do receive a
bit of distortion when I maximum the
high notes become a bit droned out with
the rest of the music or sound again
they're not bad but for sure they're not
the best though and because they are on
one side and right where your palm rest
and landscape mode you're anticipating
muffled sound now to the very left side
features a micro SD card slot which is
always a huge plus and just in case you
needed extra storage space or
transferring your files again another
plus as some tablets don't even offer
this now with the front Samsung has
decided to add a recent apps button to
quickly swap between programs you were
previously using this is very helpful
and the button does make closing
applications very easy you have your
home button in the middle and the back
button to the right and finishing up the
physical features the front has a 2
megapixel camera while the rear has a 8
megapixel camera with a built-in LED
flash which is the same across all the
other pearl models including the note
Pro Line as well now Apple has been
known for taking some good photos and
I'm using an Apple iPad which is also a
premium tablet using it as a base to
compare this samsung pro
and cameras a Samsung photos are taken
with the Tab pro 8.4 and as you can see
more crisp images less noise and a bit
better color saturation in my opinion
and Samsung again really packs a lot
into its physical aspect but what about
the internals the display and any
notable feature that makes this a pearl
model so now we'll take a look deeper
into the world of Samsung as stated
earlier this is the 8.4 inch model with
the same resolution as the bigger pro
models available at 2560 by 1600 giving
a very crisp and sharp image because of
the smaller screen there's more pixels
and detail packed into the viewable area
giving this a pixel density of 359
pixels per inch and the more density of
pixels per inch the more crisp images
and the lettering will be now as of this
review this tablet has the highest pixel
density in the world the image quality
is still very well done with contrasting
colors and deep blacks and bright points
now in critiquing and using this on a
daily basis I really like the size it's
not too small but not too big it really
feels good for personal news bring this
to work and to the coffee shop on my
Sunday mornings and it feels just the
right for movie watching in bed as well
after using and testing so many tablets
the 8.4 inch at least to me feels like a
sweet spot so with all that being said
how is the performance especially
considering this is labeled as a pearl
model or is it just the name that
Samsung uses in its marketing the Galaxy
Tab pro 8.4 uses a quad-core Snapdragon
800 running at 2.3 gigahertz it's
developed by Qualcomm unlike the quad
and 8 core Exynos processors developed
by Samsung used in the other pro models
now my third-party benchmarking and
testing found this was as fast and
surprisingly better performance by hare
in some areas when compared to the
latest 8 core Galaxy Note pro 12.2
Edition I just reviewed a few weeks back
that's a mouthful there but in simplest
terms based on pure numbers and my
testing this thing flies and does all
the basic tasks to HD video to any games
that are available in the Google Play
Store currently this thing will run
without
problem and the Snapdragon 800 processor
is one the best on the market right now
now with that being said for some reason
in samsung fashion regardless of what
latest processor samsung puts in other
reviewers and myself would notice an
occasional lag or stutter on just
Samsung tablets I noticed this on the
latest Galaxy Note 12.2 which features
three gigs of RAM and eight cores in
total and also on the 10.1 inch 2014
edition it's not too bad but you do
notice it from time to time as for the
8.4 inch model I'm reviewing today this
is good news you can say from my
experience I rarely encountered this lag
or stutter when testing and playing
around with this tablet it's there
though but less frequent to almost
non-existent and I truly believe and
I'll say this and all of my sins some
reviews probably I highly doubt it's the
processor in the rim but just these
Samsung overlay or the coating that
Samsung puts on their tablet that may
make it not as efficient in processing
but either or the numbers speak for
themselves and this tablet again is
still a tank
now going to the interface here you have
the latest TouchWiz that many are
familiar with but what's new is magazine
UX it's a tile based interface in which
companies believe are becoming more
popular and demanding think windows 8
live tiles or the app Flipboard at
maximum each page can hold up to six
tiles and you can edit or change your
newsfeed by holding down the icon then
dragging your desired topic to your page
layout now once loaded you can click on
either tile and flip through just like a
page in a magazine or an article now one
issue I've found so far with magazine UX
it looks quite limited as you can see
these social realm of apps there's no
Facebook no Instagram Tumblr Google
Hangouts etc and apps I've downloaded so
far through the Google Play Store or the
Samsung Store does not show up here and
I would assume those apps have to be
compatible with magazine UX for them to
work it would have been real nice to see
a live feed in real time of all my
social networks email news etc all on
one screen now with that being said I
found myself using these standard
TouchWiz interface more since all my
information was on there and quickly
showcasing Flipboard I preferred using
this over magazine UX as it does update
automatically instead of having to click
refresh on magazine UX all the time and
just maybe down the road hopefully in
the near future magazine UX will grow it
would be something a little bit more
this tablet like the other Galaxy
products offers multitasking multi
window is available when you swipe to
the right to offer applications to drag
and drop onto your screen this tablet is
able to run two applications at the same
time without any issues I've found
playing a movie on top while browsing
the internet and the bottom is my
favorite feature while relaxing and you
can see on the right side of the screen
are some of the apps that you can do
this with and there's more apps that can
be added down the road and because this
is a pro model there is a suite of
business-focused type apps pre-installed
such as having control over your
computer off site with remote PC e
meeting lets you host and attend
meetings where people are on the same
network and having the e meeting
software as well and then there's the
hand comm viewer it's similar to your PC
office suite like Microsoft Word Excel
etc however none of these in particular
really interest
me as Google products provides similar
or same product offerings which are free
as well but more widely adapted across
all operating platforms so you just not
limited the Samsung products in with all
my testing and using the Tab pro 8.4 I
was able to achieve six and a half hours
with maximum brightness performing for
benchmark tests and playing basically
with it the rest of the day under casual
use throughout the day of watching a
movie checking the web the social
platforms etc and brightness at 50% I
was able to achieve about 7 hours and 22
minutes which was the average not the
best for heavier users like myself so
after testing what I believe the average
consumer would encounter the Tab pro
series is great in performance despite
the minor leg or stutters that would
occur indeed the biggest gripe is the
price at $400 while there's other great
Android tablets that basically start at
229 dollars examples would be the Nexus
7 or the Kindle Fire HDX but with the
$400 price tag you do receive features
that are not normally found like the
amazing multitasking capabilities the
ultra sharp screen very good performing
camera and so forth and correct this is
a high-end tablet and I can almost say a
commercial tablet as well and obviously
there's a market out there for that you
just have to ask yourself are these
high-end features worth the extra money
in the end it's still a great tablet it
but it's a matter of your financial
preference so I hope this review helped
