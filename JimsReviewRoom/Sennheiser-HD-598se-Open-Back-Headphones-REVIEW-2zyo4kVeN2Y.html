room Sennheiser has always been known
for making some exceptional products for
consumers I reviewed some of their
studio and DJ headphones too they're
more mainstream urbanites and momentum
line of products all with their own
characteristics and of course their own
pros and cons so Sennheiser was very
nice to send me a review unit to test
their open-back HD 598 special edition
headphones that are currently priced at
250 dollars retail and sometimes I do
see them on sale for $200 on Amazon I'll
put a link in the video description
below so you can see what the updated
prices are today so without further
adieu I'm here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room
go over the physical features first this
has been a pleasure to work with the
headband up top offers supple leather
when touched with fine details of being
stitched on the sides underneath
features a very plush padding for
comfort which I'll get into detail
shortly but going down the sides here
matte black is offered with a subtle
amount of gloss black accents regarding
adjustability the headband arms are very
stiff and holding its position and gives
nice feedback when ratcheting this in
and out the only thing that I would make
sure that you're aware of these are not
meant to be portable headphones so the
ear cups don't fold in nor do the ear
cups swivel 180 degrees stowing these
away will have to be in its full open
size that you see here but moving down
to the back of the ear cups these I
think look spectacular behind the very
durable grille as the Sennheiser logo
and surrounding the opening is not
chrome but it's painted on silver
looking at the very bottom of the left
ear cup is a two and a half millimeter
port with Sennheiser's own locking
mechanism which works perfectly fine you
can't accidentally or even intentionally
pull this wire out regarding the
supplied wires there's a 1.2 meter or 4
foot long cord which is very much
standard for mainstream consumers but a
second longer wire is also provided and
what these headphones were more designed
for is for connecting this to an amp or
a home theater receiver a longer cord
has a length of 3 meters or close to 10
feet for your reference further
illustration the 3 meter cable features
a quarter inch or 6.3 millimeter plug
typically use again for receivers and
amps and for someone out there that may
have only a 3.5 millimeter port said'
hazard does offer an adapter to convert
the sizes granted this will protrude a
bit here from your device but it's a
relief to see this offered and you can
at least start listening to these right
away the shorter cable again only has a
3.5 millimeter jack which is more
appropriate for your phone or maybe
sitting at the computer and using these
to listen with but less going back to
the ear cups these features velour
earpads here which are super soft and
smooth to the ears and surprisingly
didn't cause any sweating or discomfort
from wearing these for four hours
straight I do have a wished a second
pair of ear pads were offered as some
may prefer the leather
versus again this velour material
leading into comfort these are super
lightweight here putting this on my
trusty tried-and-true scale and measured
these in at two
144 grams one of the lightest headphones
that I've personally tested the plush
padding on top prevents any wearing
fatigue at the crown of my head and the
clamping force on these are very subtle
a jaw line where wouldn't notice any
kind of wearing fatigue was perfectly
fine I didn't notice anything at all
because of the huge opening inside and
I'm sure due to the open back design
that yours always remained cool and
breathable to me instead of enclosed and
confined wearing these in general has
felt very airy with minimal to no effort
and just real quick here regarding build
quality these do feel top-notch there's
no chatter no squeaks there's nothing
compromised from what I can tell when I
put this through my stress test the same
test that I do on all my headphones now
I've mentioned the word open back
several times so far and some may not be
too familiar with this concept since
most headphones are designed with a
closed back now with the latter sound is
confined in the ear cup with minimal to
no sound escaping to your environment
with many closed back reviews you want
minimal sound leaking as much as
possible so folks around you can't hear
what you're listening to now as for an
open back which is what I have here
sound leaking will be completely obvious
in while wearing these headphones
there's minimal to no noise isolation at
all you can hear what is going around
you as well that trade-off because the
sound is naturally not confined into the
ear cup and the sound is able to be
pushed out in a sense the sound
signature is intended to significantly
offer much more of an open soundstage as
if you were at the concert hall these
headphones are intended to be used in
the comfort of your own home away from
any noise sources to be fully enjoyed
not to be worn to the train station and
not a way to escape from your kids so
this brings me to the sound test in the
beginning I quickly stuck this into my
phone and gave it a go just to get some
initial impressions I'll be honest they
didn't provide the wow factor for me
unlike the first time I use these
Sennheiser HD 8 DJ's the following day I
gave these a proper burnin just to be
sure and once I plug this into my
Pioneer receiver
wow what a true difference when I tested
music using flat files essentially
lossless uncompressed audio files
provided much fidelity and clarity in
the mids and highs those listening to
rock country and/or classical music I
think
be absolutely pleased the details with
the Red Hot Chili Peppers and ac/dc
brings new life to their music minor
details are now heard almost
effortlessly from singers vocals two
minor cymbal crashes and even their
guitar flicks the resolution of these
headphones are truly truly impressive
as for pop and hip hop listeners
although bass is there to fulfill most
audio files for the average consumer
they would need just a tad bit more sub
bass to make those generous that much
more enjoyable now you can always add in
a little bit more bass boost with an
equalizer to help in that situation but
again listening to the powerful voice of
Adele right now the piano work of Alicia
Keys or even John Legend - one of the
hottest artists in the billboards right
now Taylor Swift they all did very well
regarding spatial sound it's very much
they're offering distinct directional
sound offering not only left and right
audio separation but very distances in
front and behind you now I'll be honest
there I wish there was just a little bit
more here but clearly the HD 598 are not
their flagships but at this price range
these are absolutely stellar now
regarding how loud these can get in my
opinion they're loud enough but it did
tend to listen at 72 at times 80% volume
typically with loud headphones I'm a
virgin around 60 to 70 percent instead
and listening at higher volumes I didn't
notice any distortion on the high notes
there's no ear ringing or irritating
this to cause any kind of listening
fatigue and besides music at home I gave
movies a shot and tested a good variety
from action movies like heat with Val
Kilmer and Robert De Niro played their
famous scene in downtown LA after their
bank heist and typically I always
consider this scene to really prove what
headphones can do the balls being shot
are usually very high-pitched and sharp
over time causing listening fatigue to
those listening at higher volumes for
the HD 598 you didn't notice this at all
trying animated movies which usually has
amazing sound quality for the first time
I noticed the balloons being released
making this rubber bumping squeakier and
the hollow air filled balloons bumping
into each other like in real life here
that is in the movie up now regarding
spatial sound I'll admit I wish there
was just a bit more movies testing this
with transformers gone in 60 seconds
Ironman did
have the more obvious and apparent
scenes at areas with spatial sound be
present but I was honestly hoping for
just a bit more considering the
background and praise on these
headphones and less them fully aware
these are not gaming headsets there's no
microphone on these but if you don't
socialize many you don't need a mic
while playing I think it's totally fine
but the spatial sound again was indeed
good in music and movies but for gaming
these were holy cow impeccable flying
story games like phantom pain your Metal
Gear Solid or the Last of Us was great
but called Duty and Battlefield I can
hear areas where I'm stepping on glass
as an example that I haven't noticed
before in multiplayer now I have such a
huge advantage over hearing the enemy
walking by that it can play more
strategically you can see in the video
here that I pause more often than I
normally do anticipating someone walking
around the corner and yes for me
personally I found these to give me a
pretty good advantage over in-ear
earbuds I've been using again thoroughly
impressed this aspect so to conclude for
the average consumer who listens to
music through Pandora or slacker radio
or even maybe YouTube videos which I
have 100% admit do sometimes play self
for casual convenience these headphones
will really sound tame and just not fun
in my opinion because of the low bit
rates the lower quality of the stream or
audio files you'll have now I don't
consider this a true negative or con but
I would highly recommend spending some
additional money here and start using
those flag files for your music I would
think this somewhat goes above what an
average consumer would purchase but this
does introduce you into somewhat of the
audiophile world so maybe it is a
positive in the end though as for my
channel again it's for the average
consumer the mainstream market does
prefer a bit more bass again the bass
here I would consider as being more
neutral which isn't bad but again it's a
matter of preference and I think
mainstream would prefer a little bit
more last I wish there was a case so I
can stow these away when I'm not using
them and offering a port and the right
ear cup to listen to audio would have
been nice too but again on the positive
side I believe which overtakes it
overcomes any kind of negative here
these are natural easy to listen to
sound stages absolutely great for the
price point it's comfortable
lush meds and
being detailed or probably just some of
the few things that I can say about this
if you can get these at the retail price
of $250 I would still recommend doing so
if you can get them on sale for 200 it's
a serious consideration so how this
