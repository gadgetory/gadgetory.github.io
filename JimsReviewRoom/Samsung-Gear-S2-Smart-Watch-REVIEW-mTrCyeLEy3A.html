room as most of my followers know I
reviewed tons and I mean tons of
activity bands over the past two years
today I'm pleased to announce a review
on a brand new SmartWatch
focusing more on how a SmartWatch can be
an extension of your smartphone I'm
pleased to show you guys the Samsung
gear s2 that I personally paid for at
the retail price of two hundred and
ninety nine dollars you can click on the
link in the video description below to
see the most recent and updated pricing
that's available so without further
adieu I'm here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's
review going over the physical features
in comfort first finding the right fit
will not be an issue Samsung provides
two bands in the package one small and
the other large the main part of the
watch is stainless steel offering a very
durable finish over the time of me
testing no Santa wear or any kind of
scuff marks were noticed on these sides
of the metal now I know that looks at
the watch are a bit subjective here so
I'll leave that up to you guys to answer
in the comment section below what do you
guys think but wearing this has been
very comfortable it's not intrusive it's
not too large either it's a thin enough
profile and not heavy on the wrist
perfect for wearing with long sleeve
shirts yet still fashionable for casual
wear now before discussing the
touchscreen the buttons on the right the
bottom one can be used to manually turn
on the screen and functions as the main
menu button allowing access to all of
your apps tapping twice will quickly
open your assigned app instead of going
through the menus once again here I have
my messaging app to open up immediately
now the top button here can be used to
turn on the screen too but mainly used
as the return or back action rotating
quickly to the rear there is a built-in
heart rate reader but I'll discuss more
of that in the fitness section of the
review also its accuracy to regarding
the screen this is a one point two inch
display using Samsung's Super AMOLED
technology providing a resolution of 360
by 360 and a pixel density of 302 but
what does this all mean to the average
consumer here this all translates to a
very sharp screen that's vibrant in
colors and from my experience a very
bright
that works fine in sunny outdoor
environments in general it's just a
pleasure to look at now while wearing
the Samsung conserves battery by turning
off the display when the wrist is at a
certain angle and turns on when you
raise your arm up and attempt to look at
it for the most part it does work but on
several occasions not having the proper
angle once again the screen doesn't turn
on and it is slightly frustrating an
example would be times when I'm bent
over tying my shoe here and a quick look
and a flick of the wrist here doesn't
show anything or times when I'm in my
car needing a quick glance I my wrist
here while my hands are on the steering
wheel again nothing shows up I know it
sounds minor
sounds petty but there are times plenty
of times throughout the day where our
arms are not necessarily parallel to our
chest but back to the face here as you
can see is perfectly round with no
cut-offs on the screen it's surrounded
by this very unique rotating bezel to
quickly cycle through all of your apps
and screens now at first I honestly
thought it was a bit gimmicky I'll be
honest about that since you can use the
touchscreen for everything else but in
real world use I actually found myself
using it being realistic and honest
there are some aspects that swiping or
tapping feels much more efficient like
selecting an app instead of turning the
dial all the way over but moments I'm on
the homescreen I naturally found myself
using the side of the dial to quickly
navigate for more subtle movements of
scrolling through a list of text
surprisingly I felt myself naturally
using this to casually scroll through
this information rather than swiping my
finger across the screen and I think
it's possibly due to the screen being so
small the doubt did help alleviate me
blocking my view nonetheless the dial is
super smooth yet clicky and again
surprisingly satisfying to rotate again
I don't use it on everything but when I
do it actually comes in handy now the
last bit here the gear s2 is dust proof
in water-resistant up to 1.5 meters for
up to 30 minutes so those caught in the
rain or dropping their watch somehow on
the tub you need not to worry since it
is IP 68 rated but let's move into how
this actually functions its features and
both my good and not so good experiences
first off the gear s2 I believe is the
first watch from Samsung that actually
works on non Samsung phones samsung
claims they require phone with at least
android 4.4 and more than 1.5 gigs
Ram on board and sorry fo folks this is
incompatible fewer devices now your main
screen will always be the clock this is
fully customizable by holding down the
display here and selecting which style
you want there's 19 that are available
from the factory and some watch faces
are actually customizable with some
other templates that are provided of
course you can always go into the
Samsung App Store to purchase more watch
faces and apps and find the other very
limited and not as desired free dials to
use as well now continue to show some
the other faces during the review here
for your assessment but let's go back to
the main screen for now and quickly show
here what apps are available from the
factory the clock will be your main
display again but scrolling rights a
quick menu for accessing all of your
apps buddy is basically quick contacts
save whoever your most frequent people
are and a tap will offer you to call
them on your paired phone or you can
actually text them right from your
SmartWatch itself going back is settings
and last is S voice which works quite
well with voice recognition speaking
naturally into the built-in microphone
you can say commands to set up alarm or
even initiate a text message to someone
as well a Samsung can set up an alarm
for tomorrow at 7 a.m.
going back to the apps screen and
showing what else this can do for you
messages offers the ability to read text
messages and again send them through
your watch
there's quick pre-made responses that
you can choose from or you can create
your own and then select it later
there's a mini t9 keyboard that predicts
what you're typing familiar to those who
are texting before the days of
touchscreens and the last and possibly
the best way from my experience you can
naturally speak and the built-in
microphone will transcribe your words
click send and let me basically you're
on your way now the only issue that I
really had with this it doesn't work
with Google Hangouts which personally
for me is my go-to messaging app but
backing out here you can initiate a
phone call through your SmartWatch but
communication is only through your phone
the mic and the watch will not pick up
your voice nor is there a speakerphone
to hear the other person on the other
line again you have to speak through
your phone itself s health which I'll
demonstrate shortly here but the Nike
run app comes standard settings calendar
s voice and the weather app is all here
all self-explanatory next page you can
set up a vibrating alarm for the event
to wake you up in the morning without
disturbing your roommate or your
significant other and I've tested again
many other activity bans with the same
or similar feature here and the gear s2
for comparison purposes is actually on
the weaker side unfortunately offering a
very subtle pulse
although the vibration setting is set on
high now if you're needing this to
basically wake you up in the morning
medium to deep sleepers I'll be honest
with you I don't even think you'll feel
it working moving on I know several
fitness trainers do ask me about a
stopwatch feature there's one here for
your needs also a timer to Bloomberg and
CNN apps are self-explanatory but next
and I think this is really neat the
watch does come with four gigabytes of
internal storage space you can transfer
music from your phone to the watch and
leave your phone completely behind very
much ideal for runners / Samsung with
those four gigabytes you can store up to
300 songs and yes you can customize a
playlist too now you do have to pair
this with some wireless earbuds or
headphones via bluetooth but in the end
I'll be honest with you I think it's
really worth it backing out and
finishing up here your photo gallery is
available but it will only show you what
photos you have saved on these
SmartWatch itself not on your
oan and because of the round display
this does clip some of your images last
page for apps you can check emails when
you're connected to your phone find your
phone
is the next option which conveniently
makes your phone ringer go off although
your phone may be on silent voice memo
is second to last and last but not least
Samsung's own milk music is
pre-installed here as well and for those
who are unfamiliar with milk music it's
a free music streaming service similar
to Pandora and slacker radio the one
unique feature i got'em it though you
can turn off your phone and again leave
your phone behind and as long as you
have a Wi-Fi connection that the gear s2
recognizes you can have streaming music
right to your watch again via Wi-Fi you
don't even need your phone pretty cool
now going all the way back to the main
page if I swiped right from the main
menu here as step counters offered
today's events that you have saved on
your calendar the local weather media
controls for the stored music again a
heart rate monitor and last is your
overall activity for the day broken down
by walking running and be inactive
pressing the home button brings you back
to the watch here and if I swiped left
this time all of my notifications are
present and this is generally where I
found the most value out of any Smart
Watch those who are into social media
Instagram Twitter Facebook you name it
all will show up here matter of fact you
can manually set up which apps on your
phone will send you a push notification
to your watch and it looks to be
practically any app even my nest cam
security camera tells me when there is
any movement I can write on the face of
the watch so with all those apps and
features mentioned it's a great
foundation I believe for anyone who is
getting into the SmartWatch collection I
guess you can say however when you do
compare to the likes of other brands on
the market specifically those who are
using Android wear and Apple iOS the
Samsung operating system is lacking a
good bit in third-party applications
personally skimming through the Samsung
gear apps store there weren't many apps
that really stood out right away that I
wanted to take advantage of Samsung's
operating system is called Tizen and
unfortunately it is considered as being
very limited for the time being however
I'll be honest with you the Tizen
experience so far has been great though
as you have seen most items are laid out
well for easy navigation and the
watchers general performance takes
parents of the user interface has been
very fast and very zippy though so the
very last aspect here that I wanted to
touch base on and this is huge it's the
fitness and activity tracking first this
will alert you when you have been to
inactive moments I'm sitting in my desk
for too long editing video this band
will turn on and vibrates to tell me to
get up and move a bit second this will
record all your general activity
including walking and running third
their heart rate sensor on the back this
is indeed accurate when compared to my
finger ACCI meter perfect for those who
are seeking what their resting heart
rate is now throughout the day the band
also randomly measures from time to time
your pulse in stores into Samsung's own
app the s health app for later viewing
but if you're looking for something
beyond just daily tracking that's to
provide some workout options to but it's
sadly and oddly buried in this page here
I'll tap this swipe right several times
and here this incognito green arrow tap
that and finally do you get to a screen
when you want to record your particular
exercise now running cycling elliptical
and even a stair climbers all here and
I'm going to click on running since it's
the most popular choice for most people
the filing screen offers you to set a
target either trying to hit a certain
time you're working out for a target for
distance or maybe calories burned or
just no target at all just basically a
free run now once you hit your numbers
that you have set the band will again
alert you at that time now once you
actually start the workout as shown here
there's plenty of information to be
displayed there's time distance calories
burned pace speed and real time heart
rate sampling all on here not bad for a
smart watch to be honest with you the
only gripes I guess you can say compared
to dedicated fitness trackers there's no
built-in GPS even at the price of $300
now the gear s2 doesn't monitor sleep
although the wearing this watch may be
uncomfortable for some during bed time
it would be nice to offer an option like
that to truly see how many hours of
sleep you're actually getting and how
restful it is and last and this might
throw some people off because this s2
SmartWatch is powered by Samsung's own
operating system as mentioned earlier
which isn't as popular as Android wear
or Apple iOS there's
compatibility with RunKeeper Strava
endomondo and similar apps I might be
wrong but I didn't see a pairing option
and I'll be as I looked everywhere in
Samsung support has been somewhat of a
dud with my inquiries unfortunately even
Google fit wasn't able to see my Samsung
gear s2 as well as of this video so
although this watch does work with other
phones other than Samsung if those
third-party fitness apps don't support
Samsung Tizen you might not have data to
compare and analyze over now if someone
knows the answer please let me know down
below so all this time wearing my s2 how
well did the battery do now the gear has
two features inductive charging Samson
provides a small base that connects to
the supplied wall charger it's
magnetized allowing for effortless
docking at night there's no need to
fiddle with a microUSB cable and the
watch itself now I couldn't find on
Samsung website on how long the
SmartWatch should last for however I
have heard others mentioned one to three
days now my test and the video has
proved here I took this off the charger
here at 8:03 a.m. in the morning and by
night time before bed at 11:25 the
battery had drained exactly 33 percent
overnight in about 9 hours later they
better drained 10 percent and last the
watch had reached 3 percent remaining a
total lifespan basically of exactly 2
days and 30 minutes not bad at all when
compared to other smartwatches the time
it takes to recharge from 2% to full
battery status I timed it at 2 hours and
8 minutes using the charging cradle and
no question from my experience if you're
doing maybe an hour run because of the
heart rate sensor it could be on all the
time the SmartWatch does drain the
battery much faster most likely
requiring you to recharge that battery
at night so I hope this review helped
you in some way write in the comment
section below what you think of the gear
s2 is it hot or is it not if you do like
my work please help support it by liking
sharing and commenting below every
little bit does help and don't forget to
add me on to your Facebook Twitter or
Instagram accounts and again I'm Jimmy
with jims review room here to help you
make your purchase decision you guys
