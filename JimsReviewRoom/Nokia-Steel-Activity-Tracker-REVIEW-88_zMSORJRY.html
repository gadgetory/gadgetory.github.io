Thanksgiving hopefully you guys got some
good deals earlier in this week from
Cyber Monday today I want to show you
the newest activity tracker from Nokia
it's the Nokia steal now is this thing
indestructible I don't know but it's one
of the more classier looking activity
trackers on the market this video was
sponsored by Nokia health the makers of
the new Kia Steele and they wanted me to
give you a rundown in my personal
opinions about the watch this one
retails for $130 featuring a traditional
stout and on display a lovely chrome
metal casing and the model that I have
here is black now click on the links in
the description for the most updated
pricing feel free to use my discount
code below to save an additional 15% off
or you can purchase through Amazon or
Best Buy it's alright folks without
further adieu I'm Jimmy with jims review
room and I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision
welcome everyone going over the Nokia
steel the 36 millimeter chasing in glass
and the chrome hands and look great
there are no digital screens to display
your health stats as this is an activity
watch masked as a traditional watch and
the bottom-right is an analog down that
fills up throughout the day measuring
your activity once midnight hits the
down does reset here I'll get more to
the health aspect later the silicone
band supply does collect a bit of dust
which wasn't too fond of but it's very
supple very stretchy and comfortable
there are other varying colors of the
silicone so that might help though but
they did supply me with this brown
leather band which it does look better
in my personal opinion they also have
woven bands too now flipping to the rear
its stainless steel you'll also notice
there's no microUSB port for charging
most activity trackers lasts about five
days on average some more some less but
the still comes with an up to eight
month better life using one of these
cell batteries also because it's sealed
the activity tracker has water resistant
up to 50 meters or a little over a
hundred and sixty feet of depth for
those in the US perfect if you're
intending to wear this while swimming
the still also has vibrating alarms
alarms are light and offers a slight
tingle on the wrist here I don't believe
it's strong enough to make or to wake up
deep sleepers but light sleepers are
using an alarm
as a reminder turning today should be
fine now I did wish they offered the
option that set up multiple alarms
though let's say one not wake me up in
the morning or another one to remind me
later in that day just pick up my kid in
the afternoon or so as for the health
aspect there's 24/7 activity tracking
that automatically reads and syncs
walking running swimming distance
calories burned and sleep speaking of
the app let me whip this out here with
my phone the main page is very simple
and straightforward daily steps sleep
and your activity are shown on the
timeline the dashboard though as you can
see here it shows your steps sleep and
weight the weight can be manually
entered in or you can use their smart
scale which I wish they sent to me here
that's super convenient very useful but
looking at the dashboard I wish they did
include distance and calories burn to
have a quick glance at you have to do an
additional step of clicking on steps to
see how far you walked in your day as
for activities you can manually add in
your own form of exercise such as
weightlifting tennis soccer etc you can
perform the activity first then go into
the app and then select the exercise
label it - the first time or the first
minute you started and then the last
minute of when you ended all this data
within that time frame that you selected
will be saved under that particular
workout then last but at least this does
sync with my finished pal if you're
hardcore about tracking your food which
I honestly need to do for 2018 and
that's really about it very
straightforward very simple here folks
for $130 this offers a good foundation
for the average consumer someone that
wants something simple to use if you
track basic everyday life I think if I'm
in the market for something that surely
doesn't look like an activity tracker I
know there is a market out there it's
still from Nokia is strongly in
consideration again check them out in
the video description you guys take care
and I'll see you guys on the next one
