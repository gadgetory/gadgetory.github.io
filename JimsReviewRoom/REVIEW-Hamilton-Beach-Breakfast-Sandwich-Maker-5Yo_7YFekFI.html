by Jim's review room today we'll be
looking at the Hamilton Beach breakfast
sandwich maker now you can find this at
your local Walmart Target and online at
amazon.com and other select retailers
though for $29.99 so we'll see in this
review how well it prepares your
delectable sandwich and how easy it is
to clean up now when purchased the unit
comes preassembled and can be used right
out of the box the unit itself is very
small and takes up minimal counter space
it only comes in this gray metal housing
and consists of several nonstick
compartments with one sliding tray here
reserved for your egg now cooking is
straightforward while be making here
today is a ham egg and cheese sandwich
with an English muffin now in
preparation the unit needs to be plugged
in and preheated for at least 5 minutes
now upon the green ready light glowing
you place your muffin bottom here then I
added a slice of cheese afterwards your
precooked meat necks
and next up is the egg and thankfully
nothing leaks through the egg
compartment the instructions state to
poke the yolk with a fork or toothpick
to let it slightly run and lastly place
the muffin top on now close the lid and
five minutes later you should have a
warm breakfast for the morning now of
course you can use other types of
breading such as biscuits and bagels as
it heads up if you're intending on using
a bagel though only use a mini bagel a
normal sized bagel would not fit so it
all depends on your desires of what you
want to make I would try you may be a
sausage egg biscuit or you want to go
super healthy go all egg whites and ham
or if you want to go slightly unhealthy
there go steak egg and cheese the only
caution to take you can only use
precooked meat for the instructions
other than that and that's about it as
you can see with the sandwich it came
out perfectly toasted hot and the egg
itself is fully cooked and don't worry
about cleaner fill the compartments are
actually detachable without any tools or
levers it floats in a hinge design
located here now in regards to cleaning
I prefer washing my nonstick pots and
pans
by hand by the instruction states this
item is dishwasher safe as long as it's
placed in the top iraq for cleaning and
lastly the fixed metal plate and the
machine itself is wiped down with a damp
cloth per the instructions so with my
experience with this machine it yielded
no issues and just your typical and
basic cleanup the only thing I wish I
had on here was an automated five-minute
timer just in case I left the machine to
get ready in the morning and forgot
about it with the breakfast maker being
so small you can only use items that
fits into its compartments the hem that
I purchased was slightly bigger but to
remedy this I place the cup and cut
around the cup and to make a more
circular or fitted meet there and as a
reminder only mini size of bagels is fit
but overall it's an excellent machine to
use and possibly a great gift to give
someone a friend the college students a
bachelor or bachelorette or even a gift
for yourself the price of $30 and the
novelty of owning the Hamilton Beach
breakfast maker is worth it in my
opinion so I hope you enjoyed this
review and if you have not please take
