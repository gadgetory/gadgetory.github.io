review room welcome to another review
jawbone Nike and of course Fitbit
dominated the fitness band industry for
2013 and moving into 2014
Fitbit had unfortunately a recall on
their popular forced model and Nike and
jawbone aren't due for a refresh until
mid-november and in the meantime almost
every other company's playing catch-up a
Kickstarter companies like Atlas fitness
amigo and move just the name of you
smaller but more established companies
like j-bird and even gaming equipment
manufacturer Razer is joining in and
then you have heavy giants like Samsung
with its gear fit Sony with its life
band and Garmin entering into the
activity monitoring side with the vive
fits and here I have the LG life band
touch available retail for 149 dollars
so without further ado we'll get started
this is one of the more stylish and
high-tech looking bands on the market
the end of the band is made with a firm
yet flexible piece of rubber that way
you can straighten it and slide it onto
your wrist one third of the band is then
a curved hard plastic and the remaining
1/3 is an OLED display and one that
later now you can find your fitment with
a plastic wrist measure right on the box
but what I have here is medium and
although I typically do wear medium when
testing out other bands the LifeVantage
is more fitted you might have to go up
one more size for those right in-between
fitments of medium and large an element
when first holding the life band touch
it does have some weight to it it feels
top-heavy where the screen is located
but after putting this on I didn't feel
any discomfort at all and it felt
natural unusually wear a watch and it
felt exactly like that though now
everyday normal wearing to weightlifting
and running didn't provide any serious
issues the wristband although open still
remained on my wrist and because of its
more fitted design it stays on without
much unreasonable play and I believe the
only minor issue I had here is if the
band sent more forward on my wrist and I
were to do push-ups or place my hand and
palm at a 90 degree angle the life band
touch does clench in between my wrist
and backhand causing discomfort at that
time this of course can be remedied by
moving the slightly back but it's
something at least for me I had to be
conscious about and overall it's been
very durable no marks and Nick's or
scratches on the rubber and not even one
mark in the OLED display and I've
accidentally smacked the OLED against
the table when I first bought this too
but as you can see no marks the button
is very clicky and going over it's
on-screen menu the first is your time
indicator and with a gentle swipe
reviews your date and remaining battery
the next is activity mode which details
how many calories you've burned so far
the distance walked how many steps
you've taken and last is to register the
start of your workout and what's really
unique that of course gives you your
duration as soon as you click the start
button here but by swiping right to left
you have some menus that's specific to
your current workouts in real time that
is you can measure how many calories
you've burned so far in that workout
alone the distance steps speed pace and
your heart rate if you have a heart rate
monitor worn which I'll get into detail
shortly now backing out on my workout
session here and still
an activity mode I can tap on calories
and it shows my calorie burning goals
and temp again and it shows a progress
bar indicating how close I am to
achieving this goal I set up through the
app and more in the app as well soon in
this review now exiting this and going
into the last mode is music control and
this is pretty simple and
straightforward but it's something most
if not all manufacturers currently don't
have
instead of taking your phone or tablet
out you can control your music volume
and skip or go back and songs on your
phone or tablet wirelessly and
unfortunately this doesn't work under
the much-loved Pandora or other music
apps the controls only work for songs on
your locally stored playlist at least
that's what I can tell from an iPad and
the last few features on the physical
aspect of the band before jumping into
the software app the life band touch is
splash resistant now / LG it's not meant
to be submerged in water or worn in the
shower and that's typical of most bands
currently today the band does have a
gesture function when you raise your
hand up like looking at a watch the
screen automatically turns on for
viewing now this is to me has been
pretty spotty at times and not 100%
accurate but clicking on the button on
the band will always work for you the LG
life band also provides notifications
for incoming calls text messages and
works as an alarm clock as well and
currently have this paired to an iPad
but reading the instructions iPhones
will only display a handset icon while
Android has the ability to display the
name of the registered caller in your
contacts or just the phone number if
it's an unregistered caller the left
band works for both Android and Apple
devices as long as these specifications
are met on the screen you should be fine
the biggest caveat is although it's
Android compatible LG has noted in their
instructions and website a list of known
compatible devices and for example I
don't see HTC One as being listed so be
cautious when purchasing this if your
phone is not displayed and through my
testing I was able to achieve two days
and 20 hours as being the average for
battery life almost three whole days but
regardless it's on the low end of
performance when compared to the
competitors and it's not hidden from LG
as well as it's listed in their
frequently asked questions and websites
better is expected to last two to three
days when I'm Bluetooth connectivity
now moving on to the app here
you have your home screen that displays
how many calories you have remaining
to burn off to reach your set goal a
ring to visually illustrate your
remaining goal and to the boundary is
your distance travel today with steps
counted now moving the screen further
down reviews a graph and progression of
your day the gray bars are just your
normal daily movements while the red
light color is x you've logged in
through a workout and the last box of
information is your current week which I
found beneficial sitting right on the
home page that way I can compare today's
performance with yesterday's or let's
say last weekend's etc to try to keep my
bars up to par or to beat my previous
performance records and like I said
earlier your daily burn calories all can
be changed right here the amount you
start with is the recommended amount LG
provides after you input your height
weight and age and the last thing I
wanted to touch base on was going back
to the very top here if you haven't
reached your goal yet the app quickly
indicates how much walking that needs to
be done to reach your set goal this
little feature is similar to the polar
loop as sometimes at the end of the day
a small brisk walk can help you reach
your burned calories now moving on to
the next tab here is activity indicating
again your burn calories and your
progress and set goal but what's more
important is further down showing the
amount of time you spent walking versus
running versus going up and down stairs
the LG life band does have an altimeter
that measures you going up and down
elevations unfortunately it doesn't
display how many flights of stairs
climbed like the now recalled Fitbit
force now scrolling to the next section
shows each workout you've activated from
your wrist and then recorded clicking on
each workout breaks it down even further
and you can see on your screen
this shows the time you've spent working
out with the expected distance and
calories burned displayed and insulated
earlier of what can be displayed on your
wrist here the app shows your speed pace
and again if you had a heart rate
monitor your heart rate per minute would
be shown here and since around the topic
of heart rate monitors I highly
recommend buying one it's another tool
to help obtain even more accurate
results to better your body and also
your heart over time and this is where
LG really shines the life band is a very
open device working with many
third-party apps
and products for heart rate monitors LG
shows that you can use their earphone HR
monitors or using a chest strap monitor
like the one from polar and since we're
already here
scrolling down reviews this Fitness app
works with many popular apps currently
like My Fitness Pal and RunKeeper and of
course you can connect this to your
Facebook or Twitter account for sharing
your progress now going back to the
activity tab here and continuing where
we last left off you can see your weekly
progress as well as your monthly
progress again it's a great way to
compare your performance over time to
self-improve and the very bottom of the
activity section are your workout
records for the month the workout tab is
next which is identical to the workout
menu and your wrist here you can start
your workout and in turn it will display
data in real time there is a map on the
bottom of the screen
however the LG life band doesn't have
any GPS capabilities unfortunately this
is the only test I could not perform but
I would only assume the app may be able
to use your GPS from your connected
smartphone to utilize the map I've
animal has this experience or know of
the answer please comment below and the
very last tab here to the right is
essentially your settings and help menu
where you can set up your user profile
which includes your height weight and
age now with this information the LG
fitness app can estimate your body mass
index abbreviated BMI the BMI is then
used to calculate your goal to
fat-burning the rest of the menu are
again settings you can change to
customize what you want displayed or
performed the frequently asked questions
tab is very helpful in answering some
interesting questions like how is my
heart rate read with these sold
separately LG earbuds or how often is my
data synced the answer is infrared light
shines and then reflects back measuring
blood flow and in turn measuring heart
rate and the answer to the second
question data is synced every 30 minutes
when within the Bluetooth range and data
can be stored up to 30 days before
needing to be synced in general and
never viewed a lot of fitness bands
since last year and it's always been one
band has something while the other one
doesn't an element this LG fitness band
I think hits a very nice balance
LG isn't trying to create and do all
about actually partners with quality
proven third-party apps like My Fitness
Pal after I tested the polar loop and
Garmin
I'm a strong believer and chest heart
rate monitors and this LG other provides
their own HR ear films that is you can
use again proven and reliable
third-party company chest straps but
this product is also called the life
band and features like reminders through
wrist notifications to get up and move
to being able to control your music or
screen phone calls does help with your
day to day activities in conclusion I'm
somewhat surprised this hasn't received
more press than it has and we'll see
what other bands haven't storm
throughout this year but for now I think
this LG is worthy to contend with the
likes of jawbone Nike and Fitbit so I
hope you enjoyed this review and it
helped you in some way please take your
time to like and subscribe to my channel
and find me on Facebook or Google+ this
is Jimmy with Jim's review room take
care everyone bye
