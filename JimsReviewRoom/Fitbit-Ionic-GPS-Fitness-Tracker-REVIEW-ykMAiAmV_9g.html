hybrid fitness tracker in SmartWatch in
one when I reviewed the Fitbit blaze a
while back it was a good concept but was
still far away from smartwatches like
these Samsung gear s 3 or the Apple
watch now with the new ionic this is
Fitbit second attempt in my personal
opinion to blend the two but this time
it's after the acquisition of the
SmartWatch company pebble I personally
paid for this at the retail price of
$300 when it was first released be sure
to click on my affiliate links down into
the description below
those links will give you the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
I'm Jimmy with jims review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
going over the physical features first
the watch looks hella better in person
than on camera top-down or looking
directly at it it looks modern and
almost futuristic for the side profile
it does look big I'll omit that and it
looks something like the movie Blade
Runner or so with its sharp lines but
again in person you can't see it or tell
that it has a big casing now two straps
come in the box both small and large on
the back of the ioniq there's quick
release buttons that works much better
and faster than most other watches out
there and the fact that the watch face
or display itself is one units
this makes the ioniq less cumbersome to
handle versus the old-school blaze now
the longest time they've had this or
worn this was six days straight
basically the time it took that during
the battery from full to dead with no
GPS or notifications on now I'm
averaging about five days with
notifications on this included text
messages emails and such coming through
and those initiating runs that kicks on
GPS and continues heart rate tracking
I'm draining about 10% of better life
per 30 minutes of running now I do take
it off during showers just to prevent
soap scum buildup and let my wrist
breathe a little bit you don't want that
patch of brown under your watch if you
don't wash it there but every other time
I worn this during today while I'm at
work and throughout the night to track
my sleep now no question it's been
comfortable and I haven't had any
irritation on my wrist either now let me
know in the comment section below if you
had that nasty red rash from other
activity bands before was it Fitbit or
was it another brand in general taking a
closer look
all buns were very tactile and clicky
also wearing this for the past several
weeks it hasn't shown any signs of wear
Nicks marks or scratches on the side of
the casing or the screen touching base
on the display I really enjoyed it the
colors are vibrant it's also bright
indoors but more importantly bright
outdoors as well the one issue I noticed
this is me coming from the Smart Watch
experience the animations are a little
choppy not a big deal but it takes away
from the experience a bit and especially
after paying $300 nonetheless it's still
very much functional with the display
Fitbit gives you 17 different watch
faces some more vibrant than others and
most I actually enjoyed big numbers
useful information like steps and heart
rate are shown and down to a good
selection of colors that help
differentiate the info
a finger response on the touchscreen
feels to be improved here a bit more
intuitive and I don't have to re swipe
several times to make sure the screen
moves tapping on the screen to give you
guys a quick walk through every watch
face is a little bit different but this
will give you some sort of an idea here
this is the watch face from the factory
there's time of course steps heart rate
which is measured every five seconds
when you're not in a workout and last is
calories burn other watch faces will
tell you distance walked and how many
stairs climbed and this one I know many
ask about the coronagraph watch face
works as a simple quickly accessed
stopwatch now tapping the right button
gives you steps steps per hour which is
new to me here current heart rates again
measured every five seconds plus resting
heart rate down below distance calories
burned floors climbed and active minutes
now backing out here pressing the bottom
right button gives you several
activities you can initiate to start
recording and segmenting here running
biking and swimming are some of the most
popular ones but check out the list on
the right side here on your screen for
my complete listing now before getting
deep into the fitness portion of the
video I want to touch base about the
software and features built in no yes
you do get automatically sleep recording
and this is possibly the big reason why
I love fitness trackers / smartwatches
they're just simply more comfortable to
sleep with on now with Fitbit for those
who are new or haven't used them they
provide some of the best sleep analysis
differentiating light sleep deep sleep
REM sleep even in times that you're
awake in my assessment the ioniq is
accurate as you can see I've been
working stupid hours here and sleeping
after midnight in some days now
piggybacking on sleep right on your
wrist you can set up silent vibrating
alarms you can customize up to eight
different alerts all with different days
of the week here from my use of waking
up in the morning I thought the
vibrations stronger than most others on
the market stronger than other
smartwatches which was a huge plus for
heavy sleepers
there's also an additional setting to
turn up vibrations to maximum now moving
on and getting back to the physical
watch I love this feature
yeah able to store music on the ioniq
and leave your phone behind there's up
to four gigs of on-board storage and you
can pair it via bluetooth to wireless
headphones or earphones to work now the
only issue transferring music over Wi-Fi
to the activity tracker didn't work for
me but instead use the physical wire and
downloaded the Fitbit app to my laptop
at first it was a bit cumbersome but
after the physical connection it was
very much straightforward to transfer
music back and forth now similar but
surely not the same as a SmartWatch your
people that received notifications on
your watch this is one of the biggest
reasons why I like smartwatches as it
makes incoming text messages alerts and
such much more convenient and ripping
out your phone the text messages show up
tapping on it does reveal the entire
message older hybrid fitness trackers
used to only show a summary but the only
thing I found missing for messaging
there's no way to respond back other
text on screen or by voice which was a
bummer now one word of caution when
emails come through the subject line is
truncated so you might miss out on some
info they're going into the apps that
are available for the ioniq this is
where it's severely lacking and I'll
flip through the watch quickly here you
can see there's a dedicated stopwatch
feature weather app which looks gorgeous
by the way
Pandora and Strava is offered and last
I'm assuming Fitbit has some kind of
partnership with Starbucks that's on
there too and that's basically it
although the ionic is more of a hybrid
the SmartWatch features we're very
limiting you know what happened great to
see some third-party apps a lot more
that is since this watch has built-in
GPS how about gules turn-by-turn
navigation now if that's too advanced
how about Yelp maybe an uber app how
about a calendar so I can see what's
planned for my day here all right
jumping over to the fitness side of
things really quick Fitbit has always
been one of the favorites if not my
favorites because of how simple they are
the screens and layouts are very much
easy to read and they're mid-tier to the
higher-end bands offers a lot of value
as stated earlier this has GPS which was
accurate and found my location
reasonably quick there's a heart rate
sensor on here which I've tested and
like most risk-based heart rate trackers
it was so slightly off but accurate
enough for the average consumer I'm
still a
Oh Chester Epps but I can see why some
would say those chest straps are
uncomfortable it's seriously a trade-off
now the ioniq is also water resistant up
to 50 meters or 165 feet which is
phenomenal and beats almost every
mainstream SmartWatch out there most
fitness bands - now I had dunked this
into water for a quick test and it still
functions perfectly fine going over
running since that's the most popular
activity you do receive step counts
calories burned real time heart rate
that samples every second now versus
five seconds average pace real time pays
which I like distance duration and last
is the actual time or clock now from the
workout screen you can hold down the top
right button here and access your audio
there to pause play shuffle and skip
songs so overall with my assessments the
ionic like most of fitbit's lineup has
amazing fitness tracking you want the
best sleep tracking features it's
comfortable looks unique and pretty
modern here but in the end it's very
much lacking these Smart Watch features
now my conclusion if you're wanting a
fitness tracker and want all the bells
and whistles also better battery life
than most smartwatches the ionic is
great but the notifications messages
showing up and even Fitbit wallet pay it
feels as though they're just bonuses the
reason being dedicated smartwatches
these days around that 330 to 350 dollar
price range can be had with heart rate
tracking very robust health apps more
smart features like controlling their
nest thermostat estate 1 and the
third-party app support is vastly
diverse in the end smartwatches simply
offers the best of both worlds and not
just one in my opinion like Fitbit here
save a few dollars and get something
Fitness focus with a few bonuses or
spend 30 to 50 dollars more and get it
