room today's video I'm going to address
possibly one of the best performance up
words you can do to your computer right
now majority of my audience are average
consumers and I'm certain a good handful
of you guys are either on an old desktop
or maybe an old laptop and in there you
might have an old platter hard drive and
for most three to five year old
computers those platter hard drives do
bottleneck your normal everyday tasks
well Kingston helped sponsor this video
and asked me to show you how easy it is
to swap out the old hard drive and put
in one of their solid-state drives using
their hard drive upgrade kit now if
you're not too familiar not a computer
tech savvy guru here the upgrade kit
comes with new wires a mounting bracket
and software to download to make a
system image or essentially a clone of
your old hard drive so everything can
transfer to the new hard drive in one
seamless process now briefly showing you
here all you have to do is put the
Kingston drive into it's concluded case
plug the case into your computer maybe
your desktop or laptop download the
included software and last simply clone
your old hard drive and a software
transfer everything and to that new
Kingston Drive for you and that's
basically it for your files now with my
personal laptop here I simply pop open
the back cover locate my hard drive
which is held down by four screws on
either end now next I gently pull out
the connection unscrew the hard drive
bracket and replace it with a new
Kingston UV 400 solid-state drive and
everything goes back in reverse order
now with desktops if you have one of
these behemoths here you can simply do
the same thing pull the same power and
wired connections unscrew and then
rescrew the new hard drive into place
and those same wires just plug them back
in and you're up and running now once
you fire your computer on you'll
immediately notice the difference the
kingston UV 400 SSD specifically is 10
times faster than the traditional
platter drives
not to mention solid-state drives in
general has no moving parts no noise and
requires less power draw from your
system so guys I know this was a very
quick video but again it's simply a
quick reminder that solid-state drives
has come down in price as you guys have
seen in the video it's very simple and
straightforward even the average
consumer can do it on their own so for
more information and exact instructions
check out Kingston I'll leave the
links in the video description below and
as always you guys take care and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
