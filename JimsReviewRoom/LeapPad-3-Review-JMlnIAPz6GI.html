review room welcome back to another
review
now leapfrog along with Nabby tablets
are the number one selling kid learning
devices available nevi does work off of
the Android operating system though
which can be found on most non apple
smartphones today while the LeapPad
works on its own develop software so the
two products do offer two unique
differences or experiences that you can
determine which one will benefit your
child the most the leappad3 that I have
retails for just $99 and other random
learning cartridges range on average
from the lower end of 13 dollars to the
higher end of 25 so without further
adieu we'll look at the leappad3
from leapfrog going over its
construction first the leappad3 still
comes in this iconic white and green
color but also pink as well
now both models and like the model
before it does offer an all plastic
housing which leapfrog has done drop
testing impact testing and compression
testing to ensure its longevity and for
sure it's really tough despite being all
plastic now starting with the top here
is a microUSB port for connecting this
to your computer or using the supplied
wall charger to charge the LeapPad in
the middle is the cartridge holder and
far right is the power button now to the
right side is the volume up and down
buttons which are easy enough for a
child to click and last on the right is
the included stylus pen which is tied to
the tablet itself making this very ideal
in preventing children from losing any
more toys you can say now more about the
stylus pen a little bit later but
continuing on the bottom does have a
three-and-a-half millimeter input so
your child can use their own earphones
and on the left side basically has
nothing there's no inputs now looking on
the back here you can see the panel is
screwed in meaning you don't need
double-a batteries to put in unlike last
year's model and right in the center
here is a 2 megapixel camera for your
kids to take photos which they all love
doing and rotating to the main area here
basically the Front's the Leapfrog
features that same 5-inch screen which
is shatterproof giving you peace of mind
from possible
cuts and best-case scenario if you were
to accidentally drop us the screen will
crack and a screen is a nice solid
screen - with some models in the past I
remember with that real plasticky and
flexing screen as well when touched now
this time again it's a very solid and
very responsive to touch as well now now
the camera is on the front here for
those selfie portraits and les is a home
button with directional pad if you're
not using the stylus pen and then
there's a speaker on the top left which
sounded decent for a kids tablets and
the entire unit is still the same way
it's still light that is coming in at
0.8 6 pounds or 13 ounces but overall
setup was very easy with just entering
the parents information and then the
child's information afterwards after
that the main page consists of some
basic apps and also some fun apps that
your child can use such as the pet app
being the first your child can choose an
animal where he or she can interact and
play with and there's many other options
for this app as well and I won't get
into too much detail about this one
since there's so many more educational
apps that we can need or can or need to
go over now going back to the main page
here the music tab doesn't have much
coming straight from the leapfrog
Factory five songs were included in
there random topics ranging from when in
use punctuation to learning your ABCs
now going back out here the next app
works when the LeapPad has wireless
internet available and basically it's
like a kid-friendly leapfrog version of
the Internet
there's approved kid-friendly content
for your child to view from videos to
pictures in a wide range of content to
keep your child interested now it's a
good alternative when your child is
finished using all the other non
Internet connected activities on the
LeapPad and again they're all
kid-friendly so there's no Facebook or
CNN comic cetera being available now
going back out anti-de main page again
and moving on to the next app this is
more for the parents offering further
apps that you can download for your
child it is password protected by a four
digit code that you create and while
you're in the App Center you can browse
games and other learning modules that
you can download right onto the template
itself and for the most part when
comparing the games that are available
digitally with the games in store
they're basically the same and also
similar or the same in price as well now
going back out again back onto the main
page the next one is
chat which is self-explanatory but photo
fun is where you can utilize the cameras
the camera I have to admit they're
pretty awful on even in bright lighting
conditions it still causes some blurred
effects from having to tablet move
during a shot nonetheless it's still a
children's tablet and they do include
other presets that you can click to have
fun with and basically explore their
creative side now banging onto the home
page again there is a clock which for
adults might not see much but for a
child learning to tell time it's
phenomenal
it does offer both the analog clock and
a digital one to the rights and not to
mention a stopwatch feature is also
included and young minds love to play
with those things and last year there is
a second page to the menu which consists
of a simple calculator which is handy
for any young child to learn and play a
voice memo a note pad that you can type
on not handwrite necessarily with the
stylus pen and calendar which all three
are self-explanatory and functions
perfectly fine again for a child now in
the very bottom of the LeapPad is the
camera button Gallery also to access
your taking photos badges that you earn
from completing learning modules in turn
allowing your child to redeem prizes
from the prize store and last but not
least is the settings menu which is
minimal with changes to brightness
settings turning off they continuously
looping music in other display settings
at your choosing so overall what comes
stuck or direct from the factory isn't
too much to be honest with you there's a
handful of basic items but no training
and education modules for your child to
follow through with so in turn with all
the leapfrog products you need to buy
these learning cartridges you can use
the learning cartridges made for the
LeapPad one and the LeapPad two as
they're all interchangeable now once you
insert the cartridge and icon will show
on the very bottom right click on that
and in every intro that we'll play
you'll hear the narrator telling you
what the game is about and what is there
to do basically here I have Disney Pixar
pals ages 4 through 7 or basically pre-k
through the first grade I click on the
Toy Story module first and it teaches
your child to guide the either woody or
Buzz Lightyear through the area to get
to the red and blue keys emphasizing on
its color and as a second example with
Finding Nemo it's the same concept with
the keys now once you obtain the keys
and finish
this part of the game a second game
opens the second game to follow was
matching with the narrator advising to
match all these seahorses and not to
match any other sea creatures the
narrative does guide your child as much
as it can and also tells you child the
unique names of the sea creatures like a
seahorse or an eel etc the only thing I
found that was a downfall was I noticed
after finishing this game there weren't
any others you can go back and play that
same game again and try to match
different sea creatures provided at
random but not another new activity so I
just paid $24 for this and in my
personal opinion it felt somewhat
minimal so overall from using this it
does feel smoother and faster than last
year's model although the screen is
basically the same resolution at a very
low 480 by 268 a far cry from the 1080p
HD screens that we have today it still
looks better than last year's for some
reason and it's perfectly fine for a
young child to use the only real gripe
about its performance is every time I
need to go back to the homepage it needs
to load and after using this often it
does feel a bit like a nuisance though
now overall better life it takes about
four hours to fully charge from a dead
battery and I've used it a little over 6
hours straight before the battery
actually drained but overall I think
there is some value to this if you're
looking for a kid's tablet but I believe
the LeapPad is geared more towards the
really young where they are more
accepting of the repetitiveness and also
the really simple concepts and again
with a younger child in mind it does
have the bare bones and just enough
features that is appropriate for that
age level and nothing more though and
that's why leap pads and I believe this
leappad3 here works so hope this review
