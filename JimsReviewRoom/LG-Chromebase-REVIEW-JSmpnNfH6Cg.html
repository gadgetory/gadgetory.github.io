review room welcome to another review
now Chromebooks have been gaining a lot
of popularity typically in a laptop form
the pricing is perfect for those looking
for simple and budget-friendly computers
analogy for the first time is getting
into the Chrome ecosystem it aims to
provide the best bang for your buck and
there's so much value in this thing that
I had to get one of these and test it
out it's the $349 retail LG chrome base
and before getting started here if
you're not familiar with Chromebooks I
suggest watching my video
what is a Chromebook as these systems
are very different from Windows and
Apple so without further adieu we'll get
started
the LG chromebase is a full desktop
system with monitor keyboard and mouse
now showing quickly in the front here
are your standard menu volume and power
buttons two additional features are a
reading button that changes the
brightness and contrast to reduce eye
fatigue while reading of course and a
chrome button to switch displays at your
choosing and switching displays is made
available as the chrome base has an HDMI
input right on the back a quick example
here I have my playstation 4 connected
and I'm able to play games now finishing
up the back since we're here there's
three USB 2.0 ports a protruding
Ethernet port and of course your power
AC input now watch there was a super
speed USB 3.0 on the back as well but
one can be found inside right above the
headset input here now going over the
last few physical features the unit does
come in a beautiful glossy white on the
back and its stand but the front offers
a silver bezel going around the display
unfortunately like to stand with its
minimalistic design and kind of
contemporary or modern you can say but
if you were to accidentally bump the
display it does bounce in rock a bit
though and last year the keyboard and
mouse are unfortunately on a cheap
feeling side the mouse has a really
light yet hollow feel to it and the
keyboard keys are not as tactile as I'd
like the keys feel somewhat plush or
squishy instead of a plastic click feel
when pressed and then depressed the
speakers are a bit droning or boxy at
higher volumes so the audio quality is
not the best nonetheless the three items
mentioned just now are still functional
and I didn't encounter any issues when
using and keep in mind this is still a
budget-friendly system now moving on to
the screen actual screen size comes in
at 21 and a half inches diagonal with a
1080p IPS display it's a matte finish
that barely reflects any glare and
display does not have touchscreen
capabilities which is fine in my
experience the 22 inch monitor size
works really well and it's a comfortable
size to use the screen is soft from my
test is very nice and definitely bright
and colors are not too saturated but
actually for a $350 set it looks pretty
good the webcam specifications are not
listed on LG's website but from looking
at the quality this looks to be 89
high-definition camera with pitch
quality not sharp or contrasting but
other features to mention before going
into performance there is built in Wi-Fi
that supports a B G and n Wi-Fi
connections with built-in bluetooth and
lasts a one-year warranty for parts and
labor in two years of 100 gigabytes
cloud storage free from Google Drive now
moving on internally LG is using an
Intel dual core Celeron processor
running at 1.4 gigahertz which uses the
latest house well architecture two gigs
of ram on board which I was hoping for
four gigs as being a standard and
internally has a 16 gigabyte solid state
hard drive now running benchmarks the
numbers are as follows on your screen as
for rural testing the chrome box has
been running well for general purpose
news as with most if not all Chromebooks
- chrome boxes and chrome bases these
machines aren't necessarily powerhouses
but for everyday casual use they do run
perfectly fine the LG chrome box loads
webpages in a reasonable amount of time
and using this for video playback on
Netflix to playing casual games found in
the Google store - something more like
Facebook Twitter Hulu and HBO GO it all
works well and again if you're not
familiar with how a Chromebook or in
this case how a chrome base works watch
the what is a Chromebook video that I
performed or done as it goes over a lot
of the benefits but also some of the
limitations to what a Chrome operating
system can do now as I reviewed many
Chromebooks now they're obviously geared
towards lighter news compared to a
full-fledged laptop or PC so for casual
news many Chromebooks that are running
or coming out I'm sorry in 2014 and some
in 2013 can do casual tasks perfectly
fine it's the physical features that
distinguishes a chrome product from
another and this chrome based providing
a 22 inch monitor not to mention an HDMI
in a 1080 display at least there's a USB
3.0 port for an external hard drive to
get your music and movies for the price
there's a lot of value from this LG the
only thing I would personally upgrade to
enhance the experience is a slightly
better keyboard
and mouse combo preferably wireless so
hope you enjoy this video here comment
