review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at this pull-up bar found at
Walmart called the doorjamb trader made
by Gold's Gym for only 20 dollars now
this is the lowest price bar I could
find so I wanted to compare it to the
popular Iron Gym pull-up bar and my
favorite the multi-gem from the company
perfect you can click on either one of
those videos playing right now to watch
their reviews as well so without further
ado we'll get started
now the exterior color is entirely black
and constructed with steel tubing
plastic and foam mounts now the unit
comes unassembled with a separate bag
consisting of screws nuts and washers
and they do include all the mounting
hardware as well and assembly took maybe
about 5-10 minutes maybe 15 minutes the
most that I really didn't time myself
just using their picture diagrams which
was a pretty straightforward now this
pull-up bar is securely held on by the
door frame and does not require any
drilling or screwing just like the iron
jim and the perfect pull-up bar now for
the instructions this unit fits standard
door frames from 27 1/2 inches wide to
32 inches wide then as for the thickness
of the door about four and a half to six
inches is ideal in my personal door here
and I'll show you the measurements it's
actually five and a half inches thick
and before I get started the pros as a
disclaimer I'm not a fitness instructor
or claiming to be some great fitness
advisor
I'm just the average Joe just looking
for good products to use so if I do have
bad posture or not so perfect form
please the review is on the product
itself and not me so I'll start with the
pros here right off the bat the Gold's
Gym bar feels almost identical to the
iron Jim's the warning sticker right on
the front the bar does indicate a
maximum of two hundred and fifty pounds
and I'm lightweight weighing in at about
160 pounds currently and it does its job
though and it's able to hold me up
perfectly fine and there is some
movement that feels like the bar is
flexing a little bit but most of that is
attributed to the foam pads on each side
and the flexing in the middle again it's
not too much but it's also on par with
the Iron Gym and the perfect bar
actually was the most stable out of the
three now in my iron gym video summer
fans mentioned it didn't fit their door
so be sure to rewind the video and
double-check in those measurements just
in case and now with this gold Jim's bar
just like the other two it does rest on
the front facing trim of the door and
also on
a tablet rim when mounted and that's
where it's going to take most of the
weights now the foam padding felt a bit
thicker than the iron jims which is
great but the design again is nearly
identical as you can see on the iron Jim
the foam breaks down and starts to leave
scuff marks on the door trim in the wall
now something to be cautious about if
you choose to purchase this one as well
now lastly because of the design of the
of these pull-up bars you can do several
types of workouts in general ok you can
have your hands face your body and do
standard pull-ups to work your biceps
you know face your hands the other way
and you can work on your forearms and
lats I mean I hold myself up and do leg
lifts to work my legs abs and core
muscle groups as well now place the ball
on the ground and you can use it as an
anchor to your door to do sit-ups or
elevated push-ups and doing dips so
there's a good variety of Nusa GUI t'm
easily dismount this and place it into
hiding or move into a different room in
seconds again it's not permanently
affixed to your doorframe
and with only this bar there is a
workout guide which gives you some ideas
on different workouts to do a food guide
is also provided that I thought was
pretty helpful providing you know some
ideas on what to eat rather than eating
the same stuff every week and lastly was
a 20-minute workout DVD which they
didn't need to put in the package to be
honest with you but it was nice that
they offered it though it's a pretty
intense workout that really focuses
around the use of the pull-up bar and
whatnot so if you're into that I mean
that's a huge plus there as well the
only con I really had was although the
foam is soft but over time again it will
start wearing away and start breaking
down technically it is wear and tear and
again it does leave some scuff marks on
your doorframe now if you want you can
put some washcloths behind that I'm sure
that it could protect your door but for
my sake it's too late but I had the Iron
Gym for almost two years now and
although it's worn it still works
perfectly fine and that's what I see for
the Gold's the Gold's Gym the pull-up
bar as well and considering this bar is
ten dollars cheaper at twenty dollars
it's a great alternative if you're on a
budget now if you want to beef your bar
with a little bit more support I'd say
thirty dollars total and you can get the
perfect multi gym so in my opinion is
this better than the engine
I'd say it's on the same level in
regards to build quality but I'd say
worth a buy though since it is obviously
a cheaper option
so I hope you enjoyed this quick review
of the pull-up bar made by Gold's Gym
for only $20 and if you have not please
