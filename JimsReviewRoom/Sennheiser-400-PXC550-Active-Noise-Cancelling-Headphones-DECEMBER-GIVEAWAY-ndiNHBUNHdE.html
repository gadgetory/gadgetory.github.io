welcome to December's giveaway making
this one quick and easy it's the end of
the year the channel is doing great
and if anything your support has been
absolutely amazing I've been seeing
those fire emojis and every one of my
videos so thank you guys for everything
without you this channel would be
nothing and it's been crazy to say the
least here but it's been a huge risk and
an adventure in the last four years I've
been doing this but man look at where we
are now so again thank you guys very
much
so for December cent has a dead sponsor
this giveaway and they're providing the
PXE 550's to one random winner it's not
the ones that are around my next want to
show you guys what they look like but
his brand new is sealed in the box I
also went ahead and bought the JBL flip
foreperson myself
to make this month a little extra
special and also just for the hell of it
I had the Logitech MX anywhere mouse
that are reviewed some time ago but
never used it so instead of having it go
to waste
I'll ship all these outs including this
one to one lucky random winner
all right folks these Auto rules same as
always one subscribe to follow my social
media and both Jimmy llama official and
Jim's review room on either Facebook
Instagram in or Twitter all three if
you'd like comment down below your name
which social media handle you used to
follow me and which city or country
you're located in this is how I can
purify you and forth just out of
curiosity if I did help you make that
purchase decision let me know which item
that you personally buy that'd be really
cool to see so this giveaway starts
today and will end on December 31st so
make sure you have your notifications on
I'll announce the winner on my social
media I'll probably remind you guys in
some future reviews as well that this
giveaway is going on so be on the
lookout and that's really about it
good luck and once again thank you guys

review room and I'm here to help you
