room
I reviewed the vivoactive last year and
the physical side of things it did look
great
it was super thin and GPS was a huge
plus however from my testing though the
screen was hard to see the display was
choppy and for the same price you can
get the Fitbit surge which included a
risk-based HR monitor well this year
Garmin makes it returned with the
vivoactive HR and this for sure looks
promising over its predecessor
I personally paid for this $250 retail
as of this video but I'll place several
links in the video description below
that way you can check for the most
updated prices so without further ado my
channels here to help you
make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's review ber
going over the physical features Garmin
went with now a thicker and bigger build
when you do put this against one of the
biggest competitors against the Fitbit
surge the band on the Fitbit does feel
smoother
but while wearing the garment actually
feels more comfortable out of the two
and the reason being the stiffness on
the surge extends much further than the
V will active while the Garmin uses
hinges to offer flexibility during wrist
movements and one of the biggest changes
on the new watch the physical band now
stretches perfect for those who do
CrossFit lift weights or any kind of
push-pull movements where your wrist or
forearm flexes now regarding looks of
course this is subjective Garmin sadly
left that square SmartWatch design back
but what you get is a bigger screen
easier to read numbers and a more narrow
profile when compared to the competition
now testing this in direct sunlight in
very bright situations the screen is
much more readable over last years and
the touch sensitivity feels improved as
well the screen is very much responsive
now I do admit though in low-light
situations it's readable but it's still
dim now one way to alleviate this is by
tapping on the front left physical
button and the display lights up the
button on the right here brings up your
activities that you can record offering
running cycling swimming and yes you can
swim the span on here golfing walking
rowing and the list goes on with all the
activities from the stock settings on
the right side of your screen currently
pause if you need to that rotating to
the back it's pretty straightforward
with an optical heart rate sensor which
I'll discuss shortly but as you notice
Garmin is using its own proprietary
charging cable and this thing stays on
ridiculously secure here now garments
climbing up to eight days of use with
the heartrate tracker on 24/7 and no use
of the GPS with my use in running a
total of four times here each a mile
long to give you a gauge of how much
this watch might last you and of course
GPS on my vivoactive
HR died in five days 14 hours and
roughly thirty minutes so if you're
running much further or more frequent
than I am you might push the upper for
day or lower five day range of use now
compared to other activity trackers here
on the market it's about average with
most general bands lasting around five
to six days but keep in mind the
vivoactive HR does offer that much more
features now on the main page on the
left hand side you have your move bar in
red when you're not up and moving for an
hour the watchable vibrates and the
biggest bar will show for every
additional 15 minutes that you are
not active another smaller bar will be
revealed all the way up to the top and
you have two hours worth of indications
now it's a beneficial feature even when
you don't heed the advice right at that
very moment but you do
subconsciously throughout the day feel
like someone is pushing you to be more
active now on the right are your basic
battery level indicators time and date
on the bottom here and if you don't like
the look Garmin from the factory does
provide five different watch faces
easily accessible through the watch now
the resolution and some though isn't the
most smoothest as you do see some jagged
lines nonetheless they do serve their
purpose now back on the original screen
if you swipe up you have your days info
with steps flights of stairs climbed and
calories burned swiping up one more time
offers your steps distance and floors
walked again but just in a more visual
way on the next screen intensity minutes
for that week to show you're more
intense moments here like running or
working out and not just walking in
general movement and moving up one more
time is the last sport or recorded
activity that you've done with your most
used basic info here tapping on the
screen does offer a very detailed
breakdown of your workout nearly
eliminating the need to pull out your
phone if you need info right away
now I'm backing out here Garmin does
offer a weather widget with the highs
and lows and a percentage for
precipitation
tapping on this offers the next four
hours of weather predictions and swiping
up offers the next four days it's very
convenient not only for runners and
bikers but if you work a lot outdoors
this comes in very handy the second to
last screen are notifications and the
vivoactive HR does display your incoming
phone calls missed phone calls text
messages in detail that is not just a
summary as some other bands on the
market and doesn't show everything an
email also appears here along with your
most social media apps like Facebook
Twitter Instagram even whatsapp is on
here now moving on to the next and final
screen here is your heart rate now I've
contacted Garmin support and everything
that is close to me is what about
disclosed to you now when you're on the
screen the top left will show what your
heart rate is at that very moment now
when you're on say the main page when
your clock is displayed the baseline
heart measurement is sampled once every
10 minutes the rep also stated to watch
senses that you're walking or moving
around rather than sitting stationary
the vivoactive HR will sample your heart
rate more often not at
ten minutes and on the watch itself you
can see your lowest heart rates and the
highest during the last four hours and
in the top right is your resting heart
rate now regarding a heart rate accuracy
the chart are on your screens here and
from my assessment that's pretty
accurate for a risk based heart rate
tracker now using my tried-and-true
polar h7 chest strap and compared to the
vivoactive HR it performs as well as
most other activity bands with slight
deviations here and there now with a
consistent running pace the deviation is
about three heart beats at times again
for a risk based heart rate tracker that
isn't too bad however now during an
interval run that we do see bigger
deviations or lagging performance when
the heart rate climbs or descends fast
I'm going to put up a third chart here
and another interval run as proof this
had the most deviation up to ten heart
beats per minute off from the chest
strap itself now however on the positive
side of things if you're okay with
wearing a chart chest straps and a NT
plus model or an Plus model will pair
with the vivoactive HR if you want more
accurate readings and one last thing
although you can wear this to swim as
it's rated at five atm
the HR sensor does turn off while
swimming so that's really everything on
the physical side we're going to take a
look at the app here and this is highly
beneficial for you guys to watch as I'm
going go into detail about sleep
performance and how all this data is
collected and presented to you here's
the Garmin Connect app available for
Windows Phones Android and iOS
going over the main home page you have
steps with an auto goal that adjusts
every day based on your previous day's
performance a great feature that helps
keep your striving for more tapping on
the icon offers your days performance
with distance floors climbed calories
burn and oddly floors descending at
times not equal to the floors climbed
especially when I work from home here
and I don't even have any uneven
elevation changes but going back to
sleep tapping on this review is a good
bit of info with your daily night's
goals with the total time slept light
sleep versus deep sleep and moments time
away I do admit though oddly it's not
accurate now I'm receiving these weird
deviations and numbers excessive amounts
of sleep being recorded and as proof
I've been wearing my underarm herb and
on my other arm here for the past two
months and you can see consistently I'm
usually getting about seven hours of
sleep but nowhere close to eight or more
and of course I do mentally and
physically take notice of what times I
wake up now the garment on the other
hand registered me as sleeping right
before bed when I'm actually sitting up
reading checking email watching Netflix
etc and if I decide to lounge in bed in
the morning it surprisingly thinks I'm
still sleeping at times now if you do
plan on buying this keep an eye on your
sleep count to ensure it's working on
your end my previous reviews and the
government vivosmart HR didn't have this
kind of issue but backing out here the
main page is really self-explanatory
with active calories burned calories
remaining to be consumed and this works
if you do sync your Garmin Connect app
with the food logger My Fitness Pal now
moving down intensity minutes are
offered how many activities you've done
for that day calories consumed and
floors climb now overall the app
experience is still in my top three but
the job on an fitbit apps still Trump's
Garmin from my experience for their ease
of use the flow of their app in general
and what information is displayed and
one big example here and this pertains
specifically with Fitbit and Garmin the
app doesn't reveal too much in regards
to everyday heart health and although
the band does a great job displaying
resting heart rate and heart rate
throughout the day it doesn't show much
on the app you can click on timeline but
it would have been nice to have some
heartrate numbers indicated with some
horizontal lines going across or an
average heart rate for the day even just
something other than these vertical
lines going up and down not running data
on the other hand does a great job with
almost everything that you need as a
runner
keep in mind the V will activate
does include gps and glonass on the
watch here which has been highly
accurate during runs the information
provided is very robust and the charts
on the last page here does provide some
insight into your performance so overall
like my other videos here I really try
to show proof for you guys on what does
work great and phenomenal and what
doesn't work for me and show you things
that I encountered to help you decide if
this band is worth it to you in the end
I think it's still worth a consideration
and an alternative over city polar m400
the Fitbit surge and the Fitbit blaze is
it the best not necessarily but what
features it does offer that works though
the physical feel the number size is
basically the font sizes on the screen
the HR tracking all day a continuous
screen that's on 24/7 the analytical
running data not to mention you can
submerge this underwater you can hook
this up with other Garmin accessories
those unique features all that I just
listed right there do make this band
stand out any better option but that's
only if you're going to use them so
