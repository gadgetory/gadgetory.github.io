so one thing I wanted to point out the
sony xba-40 2 is not available this year
I didn't see it on their website but I
have reviewed the XP 32 and today we're
reviewing the XP 22 I consider this as
in the small bluetooth speaker class
I personally paid for this at the retail
price of $99 and considering this video
does it have a sponsor feel free to
click on my affiliate links down in that
video description below when you click
on those links they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time like I said
a paid 99 for this and I think they're
going for about 79 right now damn it I
hate when that happens
anyways I'm Jimmy with Jin's review and
I'm here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
so going over the physical features
first out of the two speakers the XP 32
and the XP 22 the XP 22 has a fixed
color mine comes in white LEDs and it
blinks and fades to the music the lights
don't go all the way around or doesn't
extend all the way around the speaker
that might be a good thing that might be
a bad thing who knows but I just wish
they finally had the small speaker be a
little bit more colorful like the rest
of the series the construction is really
good just like the other models it's
also waterproof with an IP seven rating
testing this confirmed it's waterproof
and it does float as well the speaker is
also dust proof perfect for the beach
sandy areas and dusty dirty environments
and the XBee 22 is also drop resistant
the controls on top are pretty much very
straightforward with live sound on the
very far left which I'll demonstrate
shortly the pause in play button also
works as going back and forward on your
song which is a plus some speakers only
allow you to skip but you can't go back
and last is of course if I'm up and down
and the power in pairing button and the
far left and it thinks it's losing its
appeal as not many are really talking
about this anymore
but there's NFC or basically near-field
communication it's still present
tap your own on here and it should
enable the pairing mode on your phone
nearly instantly but maybe it's not as
impressive in more sense Bluetooth
performance and pairing has been getting
better over time now rotating to the
back behind this water-resistant flap I
wish these buttons were on the top of
the speaker outside instead of hidden
back here but you have the ability to
turn on and off the LEDs can check the
battery life which gives you a verbal
response which is also another huge plus
and then there's WPC which stands for
wireless party chain allowing you to
connect multiple Sony XP speakers
together now I did testing confirmed
last year's models sony xba-1 was able
to pair with this year's XP 22 so that's
huge that's really good news they're
compatible setup was easy and I didn't
have any kind of syncing issues the last
button is called add
which allows you to appear to of these
figures to play together in sync
and also in stereo now there's a
three-and-a-half millimeter port for
physical connections and very last sony
went with micro USB for some reason here
to charge the speaker i know some will
be let down by this if you're looking to
future-proof yourself
JBL sadly doesn't have this new
connection either the only two other
speakers that I can think of that is
poplar and mainstream is the LG PK
series and the recently reviewed
Marshall Stockwell - now jumping into
connection test bluetooth 4.2 is offered
which is still very good in my book but
it's not the best Bluetooth 5.0 is the
highest standard at the moment and most
new phones have this so testing this
distance wise I was able to get about
90% coverage here in my entire apartment
the apartment is about 1,100 square feet
for reference testing this with video on
my Android pixel 3 a phone here
YouTube was horribly off sync for some
reason I did test this with Netflix
Netflix did fare a little bit better I
also test this with my iPhone and it did
actually do better Netflix played with a
with no issues at all YouTube played
with a little bit of a delay though
unfortunately so video goers
I wouldn't highly recommend this speaker
because of the syncing issues in general
again look for speakers that are
Bluetooth 5.0 now moving on battery life
is rated at 12 hours with 0 LEDs that's
basically leaving 2 LEDs off and leaving
extra base off I tested the xB 22 with
everything and though just to see what
this product is capable of and I got six
hours in 54 minutes to be precise and
last but not least they speak from
option performed decent it's hard to
find a speaker that performs
exceptionally well the XP 32 had a good
bit of reverb from the other person
speaking but on this particular model
the XP 22 the other person didn't hear
their own voice at all on my end when
speaking the other person noticed that
they heard me with a slight echo pretty
common on speaker phones in general and
then standing about 3 feet to 5 feet
away my voice was audible but once I got
to about 8 to 10 feet it gets obviously
harder to hear me how to speak at a
louder volume of course so
that's it let's get into the audio test
please put on those headphones and
earphones to hear my by neuro microphone
to please show your support by liking
and throwing some fire emojis down there
and yes both active noise-cancelling
headphones are coming Siri here we go
folks
alright folks again make sure you have
your headphones or earphones on when the
place is right giving the center for you
guys and here we go
oh boy
Hey
all right folks audio recorded on my end
and then play through your speakers are
not the best depiction of audio quality
but hence my review here compared to
last year's Sony speakers it's as though
Sony went back and got their act
together the fix really helps here it
eliminated that boxy and distorted bass
that we heard
now it's cleaner it's still basically
for a small speaker and the general
quality of the extra bass function is
just that much better the speaker itself
can fill up small rooms and surely
enough for medium-sized open areas if
you're using this in a large open area
though say it likes a two-car garage
this will surely be enough for casual
listening the mid-range is where you
hear most of your musical instruments
and especially vocals the XP 22 is good
with having singers sound present
instruments are clear enough and
distinct and it's not necessarily boxy
or recessed but the mid-range isn't
standing forward and being really bright
the entire mid-range felt right in the
middle you can say the high notes for
snares cymbal crashes most high
frequencies could use a little bit more
detail or resolution up top but it
performed very similar to how the
mid-range did as well not underwhelming
but surely not bad either
now with Bluetooth speakers and how
small they are most don't even offer any
soundstage or audio separation more
specifically stereo left and right
channels the XP 22 and XP 32 does offer
this thing called live sound and on the
bigger 32 model I can tell the audio is
just slightly wider almost to the point
where the audio sounds like it's coming
from the side of that speaker versus the
front now with this model the XP 22 I
didn't get that unfortunately and it
could be very well the speaker is just
too small
I hear a change from extra bass to live
sound but the experience of that wider
soundstage wasn't as impactful it wasn't
as wide if performed very similar to
other Bluetooth speakers on the market
then last but not least Sony speakers do
offer l deck which allows you to play
high resolution audio files with the
least amount of degradation through a
wireless signal I honestly don't notice
a difference between or because the
audio characteristics on each speaker
are so different l deck is good in
general for audio
I wouldn't hold too much weight on this
to impact your purchasing decision I'll
probably focus more on that on
headphones and such so folks find me on
my personal Instagram Facebook or
Twitter I'll have my links down in the
video description below you guys take
care and I'll see you guys on the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
