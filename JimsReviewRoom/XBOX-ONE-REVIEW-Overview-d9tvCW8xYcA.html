review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the much-anticipated
Xbox one so without further adieu we'll
just jump straight into it as of this
review the Xbox one comes in only one
configuration it comes with a 500 gig
hard drive one collar which is black and
priced at $499 now it's $100 more than
the PlayStation 4 and it's not only
because of the Kinect camera being
included with the system but in this
review we'll see why this extra hundred
dollars is justified now as an
entertainment and Media Console the unit
fits in with most other audio video
equipment surprisingly now at first this
thing did look huge but after placing it
next to my cable box / DVR and receiver
it's about the same size so it doesn't
stick out like a sore thumb so whoever
is bashing the size yeah to be honest
with you it's fine with me now on screen
you'll have your dimensions as shown and
it weighs in at 8 pounds now you'll see
a side-by-side comparison of the
PlayStation 4 and indeed the PlayStation
4 is smaller all around now continuing
with its physical overview the power
sensor is where the Xbox logo resides
with the eject button next to the slot
loading game and blu-ray player now
nothing else is found on the front and
now rotating to the rear you have the
power input to the far left HDMI out
digital audio HDMI in 2 USB 3.0 ports in
which you can connect an external hard
drive to a port for the supplied Xbox
Kinect and to the far right here you
have an IR blaster and LAN cable
connection and as you've seen there are
just vents everywhere the top half of
the system even is just a big hooded
vent just to keep the system running
cool Xbox one comes with Wi-Fi access
and supports B G and n standards for
those choosing wireless internet
connectivity
now wireless AC which is a the new
upcoming wireless standard is not
supported as with the PlayStation 4 as
well now what you receive the box is the
system itself one Xbox controller two
double-a batteries for the controller a
mono over-the-head headset for voice
chat a power an HDMI cable the power
brick which is massive as well but
hopefully you can hide that somewhere
behind you
shelving and of course the brand new
Kinect and regarding to connect I'm
truly glad the wire is pretty long as
I'm intending on running the wires
behind the wall or eventually you know
through or behind the fireplace and
worth mentioning the Xbox ones internal
hard drive is actually replaceable what
the PlayStation 4 has a leg up in that
it is easily replaceable
now / iFixit coms Xbox one teardown you
have to open the case
remove the console speaker then the
Wi-Fi board and continue removing its
chassis just to expose the hard drive
again it's not as easy but it is doable
though and yes this will void the
warranty now once you turn on your
system setup was painless there's a lot
of wires though but it's easy enough now
what's unique about the Xbox one you
connect your cable box HDMI line through
the Xbox system then the HDMI out from
the system goes to your TV in turn the
Xbox one now supplements your TV viewing
experience by offering an in system TV
guide and controls now turning on your
system will have you go through a series
of security and set of questions which
is fairly easy enough just like a
cookbook recipe now Xbox tried to sing
with my caper provider and cable box
which is failed on every occasion
I even manually entered in my cable box
brand and model and still Xbox was
unable to accept this so I do have
access to the TV Guide which is great
but I can't change the channels or
change my valium through the voice
commands now this is clearly something
on my end but there have been cases
where it does work for others and not
work for some so just be aware of that
though now continuing with its setup
that's when you will see the offer for a
free 30-day trial of Xbox Live Gold just
the same as PlayStation 4 where they
offer the PlayStation Plus again a
30-day free trial and I'll go over the
xbox live in depth a little bit later
and from my experience the home screen
menu are strategically placed to offer
as much content on a screen at one time
now actually prefer two tiles microsoft
offers over the horizontal menu that the
PlayStation 4 has it's a similar concept
to the Windows 8 platform now on the
left are your pins to save your favorite
apps and then the middle section here is
the home section which houses your
recent actions
and current actions being performed now
to the right offers suggestions for
movies and additional apps for purchase
or download and there's some very
important apps for download and you know
worth mentioning
now some apps which no question up
shines the PlayStation 4 and makes the
Xbox worth getting now be sure to
download skype since you have a Kinect
now it's actually worth getting you
might as well and Skype is great with
its software produced zooming and
following features now as you can see
from me sitting down to getting up the
camera follows me as I get up and move
about that's amazing for family and
friends needing to call each other now
download Netflix and Hulu Plus or
whichever service that you are currently
subscribed to and you have to download
the blu-ray / DVD player app to watch
movies on your system it's odd Microsoft
didn't include this or have it
pre-installed but I guess some people
don't need certain apps which is
understandable download the YouTube app
in which PlayStation 4 does not have as
well as a bit bummed that is Sony did
include that and lastly the upload
studio app so you can record your
gameplay edit it and upload it to the
world now overall the main home screen
works well and it's fluid and consistent
almost across all of its actions and
apps as for the PlayStation 4 some parts
of its home page is instant and
lightning fast in some parts takes time
to load making it feel lagging in some
areas specifically loading trophies now
what really shines with the Xbox one is
its true multitasking capabilities and
voice commands now besides being able to
play a game then jump back onto the home
page to either check or send messages
you can utilize Xbox snap feature which
activates an app on one third of your
screen for news and you can surf the
internet while having other content on
the main screen the system doesn't
restrict you in just gaming only and you
can mix and match at will now have your
TV playing on the left and then surf the
internet on the right or play a game
pause it to record and edit clips then
jump back into the game all on the same
screen are just a few examples it's very
dynamic now some people will utilize
this feature more than others but at
least it's available for use and lastly
is the voice commands as mentioned no
question Xbox offers so much more than
its voice command such as options from
saying
Xbox on in your living room which
basically turns out the Xbox to starting
games accessing menus apps and even
telling when the Xbox want to record
your gameplay by saying Xbox record that
now at times it works great even when I
have surround sound on and a Kinect can
hear my voice through the gaming noise
now being an honest and upfront review
the voice commands works for the most
part but on occasion it doesn't register
my voice at all now it's a little bit
weird but this is where I found showing
the voice commands to my friends a
little bit embarrassing because I would
have to repeat myself or I'd have to
start over with the command prompt by
saying Xbox then then it's corresponding
action so in the end it's still a
convenient feature that's a bit more
intuitive and more you know has more
options available compared to the
PlayStation 4 now in regards to Xbox
Live Gold the membership is $60 for 12
months and $25 for 3 months then
comparing Xbox Live with PlayStation
Plus they're similar yet have minor
differences that set them truly apart
now both services allows access to
entertainment content like HD streaming
of music movies TV etc but the flaw with
that though without a paid subscription
you can't use certain apps like Skype
Netflix Hulu Plus etc and that's
actually free though on the PlayStation
Network regardless if you have a paid
subscription or not you're already
paying some odd dollar amount for the
Netflix subscription and now you have to
pay for the xbox live subscription as
well it kind of seems you know defeating
the purpose and now you have to have two
paid services just to utilize one or the
other now when you pay for either live
or Plus you can play games online the
difference I notice is with the paid
subscription Xbox offers more apps for
download and I got to mention Xbox
offers an NFL app for those football
crazed folks out there which is great
now you have to have gold to utilize
gameplay recording and uploading /
Xboxes website again with the
PlayStation you can do this for free
with the ps4 now what is available with
no subscription with Xbox you ask you
can still keep in contact with
friends and play your offline content
you can still purchase movies TV music
for streaming but again you can't have
access to the streaming services like
Netflix or Hulu Plus you get the web
browser which is Internet Explorer which
is much better than the PlayStation 4s
and lastly and I know with PlayStation
members this is at times their selling
point so far the lineup in my opinion
has been too great for either console
and I'm speaking of games Xbox has
killer instinct which is an awesome game
on day one but it's only limited to one
character now if you want to unlock the
full game you have to pay to unlock it
now PlayStation 4 has warframe which is
a full game but mainstream is not gonna
be playing this like Call of Duty or
battlefield and now worth mentioning is
the free games provided by PlayStation
in the past for the PlayStation 3 now
that had some very good games like
Uncharted 3 Far Cry 2 infamous to Saints
Row 2
hitman absolution Sleeping Dogs and the
list goes on and on so as a whole
PlayStation 4 looks like it has a leg up
on this department being cheaper and
offering free services plus a history of
great games for download free once
you're a member or a subscriber that's
not to say Xbox may change their
services down the road but only time
will tell though as for gaming itself if
you're watching this and it's still
November December 2013 there's only a
handful of exclusive titles to each
system that makes it worthwhile to
purchase now I believe the Xbox might
have beaten the PlayStation here
offering games like Forza 5 dead rasp 3
and in high-interest titanfall now
PlayStation notables are neck which
seems to be more family oriented you
know fun kid oriented which is fine in
some way so the next time was contrast
warframe and Killzone Shadowfall
are all out now for me it's Forza 5 and
titanfall that has my personal interest
other cross-platform games are available
for both consoles such as battlefield 4
which is my favorite for the time being
and of course the very popular called
duty now as a whole not to say they are
not fun but the launch titles in my
opinion are ok just to keep us busy into
2014 comes around and to make this quick
and short both systems look identically
the same in graphical detail the systems
are so new that the developers haven't
getting utilized each system to its
potential yet
so although the PlayStation 4 might have
a slight edge in its computing power is
not yet utilized and all games out so
far perform at the same or similar level
now what's new with both these consoles
involve a huge social aspect of sharing
content a PlayStation 4 does this pretty
well and intuitively with its share
button right on the controller the
PlayStation 4 continuously records your
last 15 minutes of gameplay and then you
can save it and upload that footage to
Facebook or on to your PlayStation
homepage now with Xbox it only records
only 5 minutes though when prompt to do
so with the upload studio app and with
Xboxes voice command remember record
that it only records the previous 30
seconds for those instances where have
you've done something let's say amazing
or epic that you just want to capture
right away and lastly I want to touch
base on the controller's now PlayStation
4 did a complete redesign and they're
offering basically having a bigger
controller better grips buttons a
trigger button that's actually a trigger
now and whatnot so several refinements
though have been made to the Xbox ones
controller an already outstanding remote
and all I have to say it's one great
feeling controller now I have the
PlayStation 4 and have them playing on
that for a while now but as soon as you
hold an Xbox one controller the handles
are much more angled and contoured
rather than a PlayStation 4 surround
handles not only that the trigger
buttons are huge on this thing allowing
for no-questions-asked a better response
time when you pull on that trigger the
joysticks alone are amazing
now PlayStation 4 tried to dimple them
in and offer their rubber for no or non
slippage gameplay but the Xbox one
offers a deeper dimple and a texture
surrounding the joystick feels so grippy
it's amazing in the control looks
amazing as well with chrome accents to
accentuate the matte black
the only downfall though that d-pad
itself feels and even sounds springy
like you hear it moving it doesn't feel
good and playing games like killer
instinct almost makes me feel like I'm
gonna break the d-pad for sure
but overall sorry PlayStation folks
actually prefer the Xbox controller more
the headset that comes with the system
and connects to the controller is good
and players can hear me fine on that I
just wish this time around for the
controller they would have a
rechargeable battery pack built in but
overall the controller the headset top
notch no questions asked
just that little d-pad is a little bit
of a nuisance button that it's great so
overall my experience with Xbox one and
just being reasonable it's a great
machine with small nuances too just like
the PlayStation 4 and design wise I
believe the PlayStation 4 wins but a
huge part why the Xbox is so big it does
have two HDMI connections to connect
with the cable box and I'm pretty sure
other internal offerings as well
Xbox offers more apps for download but
yet again they're not free to use like
the PlayStation 4 unless you're a
subscriber you have to have Xbox Live
Gold to use the PlayStation has
multitasking but not to the level Xbox
the controller feels much better on the
Xbox the Kinect camera is very nice to
utilize both for voice commands and
skyping I mean those are just a few
examples best shows there's pros and
cons to each system and they are both
great but for me although it's $100 more
with the features and apps currently
available with a day one release titles
currently available with the home page
interface I personally prefer any
controller that is outstanding to hold I
would actually go with the Xbox one now
although they try to rip me off several
months ago they try to rip us all off by
restricting buying used games and
restricting trading etc but let's put
that behind us I guess and enjoy gaming
right so I hope you enjoyed this video
hope it helped you in some way please
post this video to your friends who are
still debating on which system to buy if
you made it this far in this video
