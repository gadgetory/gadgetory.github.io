room after reviewing these Sony WF 1000x
truly wireless earphones they still
haven't fixed my syncing issue from the
left to right your bud and after reading
the comments from my fans out there
they're still having the same exact
problem so I went ahead and moved on and
bought these these are the Bose sound
sport freeze they're also truly wireless
earphones and I personally paid for them
I paid $250 at the time of this video as
always I place my affiliate links down
in that video description below click on
those links and they'll give you the
most updated prices in real time you'd
never know when these things might go
ahead sale so without further adieu I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
all right folks this sound sport freeze
looks practically identical to these
sound sports just without the wires in
between now both sides are covered with
a glossy plastic that fades from black
to a deep golden brown or bronze it's
subtle but it truly makes the earphones
look quite premium now on the sides
they're rubberized giving them a nice
grip eNOS when you're pulling these in
and out of your ears
they're also ipx4 rated meaning they can
withstand water splashes and rain if
you're caught out there and with our
testing of splashing water on this the
sound sports fries are still functioning
perfectly fine now the sound sports are
ultra comfortable because of the super
stuff stay here plus ear tips now this
has been bose is a unique design for a
while now and it works for most people
and I'll label them as being ultra
comfortable because they're not
technically in ear earphones that means
the ear tips doesn't go into your ear
canal now this is perfect if you have
sensitive ears and don't mind losing
passive noise isolation now you do get
the safety of hear your environment
while walking or running on the opposite
end though because they're not blocking
out noise again no passive noise
isolation you do lose a little bit of
audio immersion and at higher volumes
they do sound leak in good bits it's a
trade-off that you'll need to take into
consideration now they did say my ear is
quite well better than my j-bird runs
not the best is they do weigh a bit more
than most of the competition out there
it weighs in at 14 grams on each earbud
per Bose but the flange ear tips again
does very well preventing them from
falling out the only issue and I'm gonna
put these in my ear here they stick out
like a mofo when you look straight on
now this is completely subjective but at
least for me they do look a little too
funky for my taste again that's up to
you guys take it a closer look at these
sound support freeze boast skipped a
power button on these earphones when you
pull them from the case they
automatically turn on for media and call
control everything is out the right ear
phone volume up and down on either side
and then there's in the middle a boast
multi-function bun now with a single tap
you can pause and play music with double
and triple presses you can skip and go
forward on songs holding it down for one
second brings up either Siri or Google
assistant now if a phone call does come
in you can press that multi function
once again to answer its now we tested
the phone call quality at the office and
of course outdoors and they came across
very clear and I was actually quite
surprised at how good they were with
most of the competitors I've tested are
the headphones wired earphones and such
they do pick up a good bit of background
noise but they sound sport freeze did
very well it kept a lot of the ambient
noise around me to a minimum now on the
left earphone there is one button here
which allows you to quickly switch
between up to seven devices yes and I'll
repeat that again up to seven devices
all at the same time now the only issue
that I noticed the buns are quite hard
to press here especially when you have
it in your ears I can find them easily
though but pressing them takes a lot
more effort than the competitors out
there firm presses are needed to adjust
these things
now finally included with the earphones
is this exceptional case that I have
right here it's made of a durable matte
black plastic and keeps the earphones
safe now something that's really helpful
and really cool that connecting pins are
magnetic securing the earphones in place
without any buttons or snaps it also
helps align the ear buds here and most
importantly less chance of them falling
out of my case now the case itself also
doubles as a charger providing two
additional full charges when the
earphones are exact and pressing on the
button to open the case also shows you
five white LED indicator lights giving
you an idea of how much better life is
left on the earphones in or the case now
buzz claims you can get up to five hours
worth of use putting the sound support
freeze at the top end of the competition
matched only by the Apple earpods now in
my battery test play music at 50% bottom
from a full battery to dead the
earphones made it four hours and 42
minutes with a ten minutes low battery
warning pretty darn good for truly
wireless earphones now they also offer
quick charging within 15 minutes of
charging this thing here it provides for
45 minutes of use to fully charge it it
takes about two hours now both of the
range was also phenomenal with my iPhone
and the office pixel except I found them
to get around 68 to 72 linear feet of
distance before cutting out and that's
with a straight line of sight and last
but at least finally I planned across
some truly wireless earphones that has a
find my buds feature I know the Apple
earpods has theirs but it's rare that I
run across truly wireless earphones that
offers some peace of mind like this
simply logically both connect
tap the find my buds tab and you'll get
a specific map pin to each earphones
last blue tooth paired location
furthermore you can have them emit a
high-pitched tone so if they're in the
grass or just under your bed you hear
exactly where they are
that's a clarifying they don't have GPS
so if they've been moved you won't be
able to see their current location now
since I'm showing you the app some of
the other feature that you can adjust
are an auto shutoff timer voice prompts
and language studies other than that
they both app is really plain Jane and
doesn't offer much alright folks so
let's move on to what might be the most
important part of the review besides how
it looks to me is the audio test let me
start off by saying these sat flippin
great here balance clarity and fidelity
are the key words here a sound spurt
freeze provide a very high resolution
sound that's also accurate to the music
now these do get loud enough I found
myself often listening to around 60% of
I'm but would sometimes bump it up to 75
80 percent during those really intense
songs I listen to EDM and hip-hop the
classic rock and folk even retro wave
and you guys gotta get up on that they
all sounded great genres I would say
that really shine were classic rock and
pop music with these earphones now bass
was present and punchy for small
earphones they didn't sound bass boosted
like my j-bird runs which I'll admit I
do love I like some moderate bass in my
audio but for the boats it was just a
cleaner sound it didn't sound synthetic
there's no distortion it's full bodied
and just enough for most generous of
music to be enjoyed now if you ever
listen to their both QC 35 Hz headphones
it's a very similar characteristic now
the mid-range is where the sound support
freeze really shines through the mid
ranges when you hear most instruments
like guitar strings and woodwinds as
well as vocals resolution and detail was
very very much apparent here all sounds
were distinguishable and crisp without
being recessed in electronic music those
bright resonating notes that provide a
feeling of energy and excitement are
reproduced with fidelity and precision
vocals were pushed forward which I love
and most of my viewers enjoyed as well
allowing you to hear them clearly and
with separation that moderate vibe
detail and articulation filled out the
higher frequencies here the treble were
not sharp but gets to a point where you
can appreciate the cymbal crashes - the
higher pitched
it's on EDM and pop music at the higher
volumes that's where you do lose a
little bit of definition to prevent
penis or ear singing but honestly
overall they provided a fantastic audio
experience without any listening fatigue
I was able to wear these for an entire
battery cycle with no problems now the
last part here this is a unique
situation the fans who have been farming
for quite some time do you guys know I
love a wide an open sound stage with the
sound sport freeze it does absolutely
great with audio separation we're
talking about left and right audio
channels we're talking about hearing
vocals in the forefront and maybe some
drums little bit further back but the
sound stage it is there but it isn't as
wide as expected and here's the big but
here the audio is perceived as though
it's coming from the center of your head
yes right in the center here now it
sounds crazy but it's as though you're
sitting written from the artist or maybe
standing right in front of home those
concert speakers it's a different level
of immersion a different type of
immersion that's not experienced too
often play immersion or immersive
experience nonetheless now I would say
it's something you got a tryout test out
your old earphones and then try on these
and hear the difference again it's quite
unique now one last thing I know Sony
was getting a lot of heat in my previous
review one of the reasons was due to the
WUF 1000 X's having a delay watching
video it was the same here of the sound
sports unfortunately there's a second or
two delay when you're watching after
speak to the time that you hear it in
your earphones now this might be an
issue across all truly wireless
earphones because they have to sync with
each other to play at the same time
either or I just want to give you guys a
heads up on that
so overall the Bose sound support fries
are a solid product it sounded
phenomenal here and I can't stress that
enough although they looked huge as crap
in my ears right now but again looks are
subjective but just to quickly end this
video if they look good to you
definitely give these a try but folks be
sure to LIKE and subscribe to help
support my work
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review and I'm here
to help you make that purchase decision
you guys take care and I'll see you guys
on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
