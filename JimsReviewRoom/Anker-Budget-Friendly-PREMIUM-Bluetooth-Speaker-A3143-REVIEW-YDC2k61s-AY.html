room a few asked me to review something
more budget-friendly items on the
channel as I do admit some of these
stuff that you do see here can be very
expensive and although I review
expensive stuff I do love it when I do
find underrated items that are much
cheaper than the competition what I have
here is the anchor premium bluetooth
speaker it's the model number a 3143 off
of Amazon and it's priced at just $60
you can always click on the link in the
video description below just to see what
the most updated prices are so without
further ado my channel is here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's review getting right
into this the anchor is 8.3 inches long
2.4 inches tall and 2.4 inches from
front to back it's slightly bigger than
the Bose Soundlink mini to having this
fall into the mid-size category of
speakers the front figure is something
you'd normally don't see on Bluetooth
speakers here it's a fabric lined front
grille which is different and pretty
original behind the grille it is solid
and so is the entire unit it's built
very well and everything is assembled
tight with nothing cracking or flexing
with the plastics as for the aesthetics
and the materials you do feel the price
being reflected here besides the glossy
black piano finish which is heavily
fingerprint prone the Bunz gives this
eerie plastic feel impressed it is not
as tactile or clicky as you'd hope
regarding the buttons you have a power
on with pairing button when held down
playing pause and you can skip songs
with volume up and down as well rotating
to the right side there's a
three-and-a-half millimeter port for
physically connecting your audio source
and right below that is a microUSB port
for charging the device there isn't an
AC adapter which is perfectly fine to me
since everyone these days does have a
phone charger so so this really came in
handy
regarding battery life anger is claiming
up to eight hours of music during my
standard testing with all my Bluetooth
speakers leaving this at 50% vibe from a
full battery to dead I was able to
achieve seven hours in 43 minutes
comparing to other small and mid-range
sized speakers this is a bit on the low
end for today's standard
rotating to the rear there's a passive
radiator and to the left side is absent
of any additional features more ports
regarding wireless range this performs
as well as most other Bluetooth speakers
on the market with me leaving this on
one side of the house and walking
downstairs to the other side about 40
linear feet through several walls the
connection remain intact so overall
that's it for this speaker it's only $60
and I wasn't expecting to be answered
through any additional features like NFC
or doubling up but the speaker really
just keeps it simple with just providing
audio but how does it sound I'll play
several samples for you guys and then
give you my verdict afterwards
they're sleeping on my own cause if you
like the way you look that much oh baby
you should go and love yourself
you think that I'm still holdin on to
somethin you should all in love y'all
and there you have it folks now sound of
course recorded on my end and then
played through your speakers not the
best depiction of audio quality but
hence my review hear the sound quality
obviously doesn't compare to a
three-dollar speaker like the JBL
extremer bose soundlink 3 but at just
$60 it's a lot of bang for your buck in
the audio department these do have some
bass to it and for a 60 dollar speaker
it's more bass than most small bluetooth
speakers like the ue role or JBL foot 3
at higher volumes though there is some
slight distortion for bass heavy music
but again keeping price in mind it's not
bad at all the mid-range where you hear
most of your vocals is neutral not
bright or underwhelming and surprisingly
clear for me and my experience the
mid-range was done well as for the high
range high-hat cymbal crashes snare
drums there's slight distortion when you
do have I'm normally 80 percent or so
and higher with the more expensive
speakers like the Sony ex 33 or the JBL
charge 2 plus having volume higher to
fill up a room or for entertaining
purposes you can stay in that room for a
good bit of time with the high notes on
the anchor though they are slightly
distorted and at times harsh on certain
songs now this did cause some listening
fatigue where I had to rub my ears after
a while listening add more personal
levels listening levels that is the
anchor was perfectly fine regarding
soundstage like most Bluetooth speakers
is not as apparent in sound separation
is pretty minimal as well but that comes
to be expected with Bluetooth speakers
in general regarding loudness I found
this suitable for small to mid-size
rooms with large rooms losing some of
its audio immersion now so overall from
my experience despite having a little
trouble at the very high volumes and
more importantly keeping in mind this is
still a $60 speaker this performs really
well audio quality wise it didn't
perform as well as the JBL charge 2 plus
or they both sound like many too but
this sounds to perform more closely with
the hundred dollar speakers like the JBL
flip 3 which is still great considering
Ankur's price points i would say if
you're considering a budget-friendly
speaker this is still worth a
consideration after you look at how the
aesthetics looks to you so that's it for

care I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
