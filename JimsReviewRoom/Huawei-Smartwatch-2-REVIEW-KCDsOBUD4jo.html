Jimmy would Jim's Revere Ummah when I
reviewed the original Huawei I loved it
classic look metal casing and the screen
was perfectly round
unlike the Moto 360 at the time it was
one stellar smart timepiece well I'm
pleased to show you guys the newest
model this is the Huawei SmartWatch 2
Sport Edition in carbon black which
retails for 299 dollars I personally got
it for a slight discount though at 250
as always I'll leave my links in the
video description below click on those
links and that will give you the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
so without further ado if you like our
video work here I'm sure you'll love our
photos on Facebook Twitter and/or
Instagram I'm Jimmy with Jim's review
room and I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review
going over the physical features first
unlikely support design a lot
I love the beveled edges and how the
screen is recessed in the button
placement on the sides are perfect they
don't stick out as much as these n watch
3 from Asus which I also enjoyed using
the casing on the support model is all
plastic though to be a bit more rugged
it hasn't scratched up on me like
stainless steel competitors but I'll MIT
this is personally just me I should have
bought the huawei classic as I do miss
the premium feel of metal also testing
the Samsung gear s 3 it's somewhat hard
to switch back the plastics you can be
the judge at which might look and feel
better to you the bezel is glossy and
fingerprint Pro the display covered by
Gorilla Glass is slightly smaller than
the previous generation which is a shock
but more on my assessment later the
Huawei SmartWatch 2 is IP 868 certified
with my testing of chunking this into my
bucket here it's still functioning
perfectly fine and because it's not the
leather band you don't have to worry
about damage straps looking at the back
while wear retains its toolless design
like most smartwatches pull the pin over
and swap them out the support model uses
20 millimeter straps while the classic
uses these standard 22 millimeter sizes
for your reference now there is a
built-in heart rate sensor which I'll
get into detail shortly
and on the right are the pins to charge
the Huawei with the supplied magnetic
cradle not the prettiest thing coming in
all white but it does justice Huawei is
claiming more than two days worth of
ussen with my tests I'm a virgin one and
a half days until I receive a
notification that there's 15% battery
life remaining usually around 6 p.m. on
the second day that's when the
SmartWatch goes into watch mode with no
always-on display
and no notifications coming through the
watch continues as a pedometer so
continue to count your steps and in
watch mode after one half days worth of
use I'm able to stretch the watch for
another three days before it officially
dies in regards to recharging I'll place
a quick chart on the screen for you but
from a dead battery to full takes about
an hour in 30 minutes
no other additional features which are
available on these Samsung gears 3 and
Apple watch series 2 the Zen watch 3 to
name a few you are able to take phone
calls right on your wrist now you do
have to go into your settings to turn
this on by default it is off by speaking
into your watch might sound weird at
first for those who haven't tried it yet
but
honestly it is convenient especially
while driving keep both hands on the
wheel if you'd like working at home on
the computer cleaning around the house
it seriously comes in handy now testing
microphone quality then while we
SmartWatch 2 does a fairly good job not
as good as the Apple watch or gear s3 my
voice is audible but testing this with
two other people both said the same
exact thing the analogy that gave me was
as if I was speaking on my phone with
the comforter over my head
audible but not crystal clear you can
say slightly muffled in regards to me
hearing you from my wrist it's loud and
sounded like a good speakerphone in
general here's a quick test hey Adam
testing out the microphone on the Huawei
SmartWatch 2 can you just give me some
context give me some words cool all
right thanks man touching base on
comfort I did prefer the leather straps
of the previous generation keep in mind
I can easily swap these out with those
lugs on the back but this being the
sport model it's a blend of ruggedness
and durability with some flexibility
I've never felt uncomfortable wearing
this but I wish the support steps were
slightly more elastic although I tested
this with running sweating and don't one
day use my skin never became irritated
now looking at the down there isn't
always on display in color which is
super handy and lifting up your wrist or
pressing the buttons does enable the
display to show its full glory I didn't
notice the Huawei SmartWatch 2 is not as
sensitive to the previous watch or the
competitors out there requirement to
noticeably flick my wrist more often to
get the full display while wearing out
doors and I know my camera isn't really
doing justice but in person under bright
direct sunlight the display is still
visible pretty impressive how bright the
screen can get as for these sides of the
display there is a menu difference I do
notice the screen is smaller at 1.2
inches versus last generations at 1.4
the watch looks chunkier than the
competitors and unfortunately the old
model the display on the other hand gets
less pixels but because of the smaller
screen pixel density has increased and
it looks noticeable I didn't see any
pixelation the screen looks great and
has smooth edges around small text
movements on the screen are also buttery
movies jumping into features and
performance besides the basics like
receiving push notifications seeing the
weather on your watch to controlling
Spotify Pandora or Google Music you can
store music on your watch with up to 4
gigs of storage and then pair your sport
earphones or headphones via bluetooth
and listen to music while running or
we're out and about no need to carry
your phone for text messages besides
typing on that little screen we also get
voice of text from messenger apps and a
low voice detects has worked great
that's still not 100% like most other
smartwatches
but while we does recognize my voice
inflections to a reasonable degree for
the average consumer it's much easier
and faster again than typing physically
with your fingers now one of the basic
features that all smartwatches have is a
vibrating alarm the vibrations are a
moderate to slight buzz and for some
reason you're wearing this while
sleeping I would say deep sleepers will
have some trouble waking up four times
you are awake though the buzz should do
a good job at getting your attention as
for the audio alarm it's loud and this
will shortly wake you up though with the
alarm you can have both audio and the
vibrations on or one or the other so
let's take a look at me while we health
features the Huawei's daily tracking app
on the watch is surprisingly robust on
your screen you can see a track steps
distance active minutes resting heart
rates and duration of various walks and
movements when you're going up and down
stairs
now backing out and back into the main
home screen here you also have google
fit and runtastic that comes
pre-installed i was also able to
download Strava as well but why always
own app you can utilize the GPS inside
and go for it run GPS at times oddly
doesn't pair immediately despite me
being outdoors with other competitors it
doesn't matter if it's sunny or cloudy
as long as I'm outside it works fine but
once it does pair though going for runs
and comparing to my smart phones GPS
it's spot-on as for a heart rate
tracking Wow I did very well when I
compared it to my chest strap I tested
both consistent runs to interval runs
with running and brisk walking here and
there wow he was very close in accuracy
overall it's as good as Samsung's s
health with data such as steps calories
paste distance elevation changes at set
it's all in there so in the end the
Huawei SmartWatch 2 is still a great
watch a good alternative to the others
out there compared to the last
generation it's better in regards to
function and display quality but takes a
step back in screen size that's
noticeable at least to me comparing to
what else is currently on the market
while we has caught up to the
competition by offering everything that
the others do and it does have a hard
time in standing out from the rest now
although the asus n watch 3 is very
similar it's just basically missing
heart rate tracking it beats most of its
competitors in price if you haven't
watched that review be sure to check
that out but then on the flip side
though if you can spend a little bit
more you can get these Samsung gear s 3
so in the comment section below what
would you prefer Samsung's version or
Huawei's or maybe someone else let me
know down in the comment section below
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision you guys take care and I'll see
you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
