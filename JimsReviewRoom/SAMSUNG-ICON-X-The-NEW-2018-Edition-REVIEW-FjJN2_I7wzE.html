room testing truly wireless earphones
last year they're slowly getting better
in my opinion I think they're starting
to get in traction as well I've been
seeing more people wearing them at
airports and while I'm traveling and
such let me know in the comment section
below if you're seeing truly wireless
earphones more often a personal one
engage and see if there's a demand for
these in 2018 now with that being said I
personally bought these these are the
Samsung Ikon X 2018 edition these are
refreshed and updated come in with a
price tag of 199 dollars as always I'll
place my affiliate links down in that
video description below click on those
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
again I'm Jimmy with jims review room
and I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review
both of the physical features the new
icon XR hard plastic with three sized
ear wings and ear tips now although
they're in your earphones very
lightweight and very comfortable the one
of the biggest features that I'm
relieved what excited to show they have
a low profile unlike many of the other
competitors on the market now because
they go inside the ear canal the icon
axis offers passive noise isolation
letting these earphones black out
outside environmental noises for
reference the Apple earpods sit more on
the outside of your ear canal and you
can generally hear your surroundings
it's just a matter of preference and
which one you would prefer now
attachment based on how well these stay
in the ear fins don't feel to provide
too much stability but of course
everyone's ears are a little bit
different and the positive notes while
testing running jogging literally
standing and shaking my head if right in
front of you guys right here they'd
never bail out the ear tips themselves
does a great job of staying in and no
question these are stable now the icon X
2018 edition didn't promote that there
is water resistance on their website or
even their spec sheet at the time this
video according to Samsung and the rep
did confirm his internal documents it
did state that the icon X's are indeed
resistance against light water and sweat
exposure now they're personally dressed
these and this is clearly overkill I
don't recommend doing this but after
pouring water on these the icons are
still working perfectly fine now a few
other competitors offers a better water
protection against heavier water
exposure Samsung only offers very light
water protection it's good enough for
most people but I would have preferred
better or increase the peace of mind
here now the icon X provides a sensitive
and intuitive controls that are
responsive much easier than physical
buttons compared to the competition a
gentle swipe on either earphones can
adjust volume tapping allows for
skipping going back on music and all the
menu features I'll have on the screen
for you and one of the features that is
worth mentioning the icon acts like many
other trailers wireless earphones have
ambient sound press and hold a touchpad
and the microphones activates and it
pumps in your environmental surroundings
right into your ears now as I mentioned
earlier the icon X does have passive
noise isolation pretty good though but
for runners cyclists even wearing them
during their morning commute
the ambient sound feature is available
for safety too
that you're not running it's traffic or
you can hear if someone is trying to
sneak up behind you and when the biggest
reason why you would consider buying the
icon axis store music right onto the
earphones it does come before gigs
that's what Samsung exclaiming I did
double check for you guys it comes with
three point four gigs that were actually
available per Samsung will be claiming
we can store up to a thousand songs but
this means you don't need to lug around
your phone when you go on a run or you
can leave your phone back in the locker
room then go into the gym caring much
less you can say you can transfer your
music with the supplied USB cyr one
plugged into your PC it's very easy and
simple to do you can also go wireless
and again this does work with non
Samsung phones as well
now another positive to supplement this
feature if you're exclusively using
onboard mp3 files the better leaf on the
2018 icon X's are up to seven hours now
if you're using this exclusively with
Bluetooth and having the earphones
stream from your phone Samsung is
claiming up to five hours of better life
which is on the upper end of average
virtually wireless earphones and with my
test that 50% Vonn from a full battery
to dead I was able to achieve five hours
and three minutes to be exact using this
V of Bluetooth now for those who are new
to truly wireless earphones I know that
might not sound like much up to five
hours if you think about it five hours
is more than most people's commutes or
workouts when you get into the office or
back into the car you can stow them away
in this carrying case the case itself
works like a power bank recharging your
icons for the next time you use them ten
minutes in the carrying case will give
you an hour of audio if you're ever in a
crutch but the only downside though with
other competitors you get multiple
recharges with the case with Samsung
you're only getting one charge one full
charge out of this not a big deal it's
not going to prevent me from buying this
but something that I want you guys to be
aware of if you guys do value battery
life now a touching base I'm blue to the
range in performance the icons are using
bluetooth 4.0 it's Adly no Bluetooth 5
considering their Samsung phones has the
latest technology but Bluetooth 4 points
you still performs exceptionally well
now doesn't this there's several walls
my samsung s a plus I was able to
achieve 72 linear feet that's about 21
meters with two walls in between before
the signals
- crackle now right before I talk about
the audio test in my experience here the
last standout feature for the icon axes
are the health benefits despite last
year's model not being accurate
after I tested it and confirmed it the
built-in heart rate monitor I was hoping
for Samsung to bring it back at least
but improve on it unfortunately with the
2018 version without we're testing here
Samsung decided to get rid of it
altogether and what makes it return
though our audio prompts that you can
set up to give your give you information
on your run or workout now for runners
who don't want to whip out their phone
to check their distance or speed and
stay focused on their workout itself you
can set the icon X's at certain
intervals to tell you audibly and
automatically your duration distance
calories calories burned that is and
speed but that does sound great and I
appreciate the feature but keeping guys
informed Strava RunKeeper and similar
running apps will offer audio prompts to
any existing audio device this is
nothing special
other than that with no HR monitoring I
don't see too much offered in the health
department here sorry folks to the audio
test the icon X 2008 Edition offers
neutral and balanced bass when compared
to the competition basis there with
enough authority for most mainstream pop
and rock music and the positive side
it's surely enough for most people and
you'll never hear them distort or become
muddy and lose quality but on the
opposite end of the spectrum and wasn't
experiencing a bass boosted sound
signature like the j-bird runs or the
dimension and depth of bass that you can
get with the Bose sound sport freeze now
if your bass focused or enjoy a somewhat
bassy sound signature I can't access all
that needs to be tuned with an equalizer
or you just got to look somewhere else
on the mid-range frequencies in audio
where you can hear most vocals and
instruments it's mostly heard or
identified by the human ear and this
frequency arrange the icons do a good
job with offering again I'm very much a
neutral audio signature it's not
recessed and that muffled yet they're
not bright or for now what you will
experience is a clean signature but it
doesn't sound as alive as I would have
liked recently the B note II eighths to
Bose and again jaybird sounded more
detail and exciting as though there was
more color in the competition versus
these icons here it's not bad guys do
sound good but I have to acknowledge
them
competitors and the block offers a bit
more edge basically now as for the high
frequencies it's a very similar neutral
experience as some some felt as though
they played it safe
nothing ear ringing or ear tinging and
with Samsung easy to listen to with
minimal listening fatigue as for
soundstage this might be where it's
actually lacking I do achieve left and
right audio separation and some for
front and off to the side direction of
audio but I wish the offered more depth
and a dimension again I do admit the two
that does better are more expensive
again the abhi no eights and the bose
sound support free specifically but for
samson at the $200 price range the
soundstage performed i would say within
reason so it's tough for me to say as I
really like Samsung products and they
usually provide stellar performance the
icon X 2018 Edition they're not bad at
all and if you're set on Samsung or the
icon X's in general it's a good purchase
especially with the onboard storage the
low profile comfortable earphones and
very intuitive touch controls a lot of
the competitors either fail or don't
even offer that at all but I would say
if your top priority is the audio
experience the competitors offers a more
vibrant alive and expansive audio
performance so folks that's it for this
review if you watch this far be sure to
show your support by following my social
media handles again I'm Jimmy with gyms
review and I'm here to help you make
that purchase decision you guys take
care I'll see you guys on the next one
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
