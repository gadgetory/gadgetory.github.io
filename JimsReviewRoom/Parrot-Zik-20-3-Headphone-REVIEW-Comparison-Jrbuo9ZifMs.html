parrots are known for making
remote-controlled drones they're
actually one of the biggest names in the
drone industry but on the other hand and
may be a shock to some they also make
wireless headphones now what I have here
today is the parrot Zik 2.0 priced at
350 dollars retail and the Zeek 3 at
$400 however you can always go to Amazon
or BH photo and get them for much less
I'll place my links in the video
description below that way you can check
for updated prices so without further
ado my channel is here to help you make
a purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review
one Zeke models are nearly identical
offering the same look the same
dimensions and both have the same build
quality when stress testing these
headphones the more expensive Zeke 3
however for the same price as my generic
black ones here you can purchase
different colors and different patterns
to suit your style
I personally ordered the stitched
version but oddly they sent me this
plain one here so apologies if they look
identical in the video nonetheless the
faux leather is absolutely the most
supple I've ever felt on a pair of
headphones the solid aluminum arms going
down the side feels ultra polished and
smooth and if I could give an analogy
this feels like a very luxurious
top-of-the-line automobile the arms do
offer a very stiff ratcheting system to
extend out the headband and the ear cup
to do swivel and 90 degrees to lay flat
unfortunately don't fold in so stone
these away and be supplied felt pouch
air will take up some room but because
of their minimal design they're not bad
at all moving through the air cups the
left side in both DZ 2 &amp;amp; 3 are
magnetically held on and never did they
fall off behind here is where the batter
is located offering a removable battery
which is always a huge plus for me
considering when batteries fade or die
over time you can easily replace them
the zig 2.0 model claims two sets and
numbers here for battery performance Eco
mode is with active noise cancelling on
Bluetooth and enabling that concert hall
effect now this mode gives up to seven
hours of use now I personally test this
leaving this on until it died and was
able to get 6 hours and 58 minutes of
use which compared to other wireless
headphones is a be very low-end but keep
in mind you can always swap out
batteries if you do buy a spare
now the other setting called airplane
mode claims up to 18 hours of use that's
using a wired connection and there's no
special sound enabled and the only thing
that is on is ANC now I'm getting around
17 hours in 30 minutes which is still
very good in general and although the z3
is pricier and more feature packed it's
also getting very similar numbers in
regards to battery performance as the
Zeek 2.0 and for both I'm getting about
two and a half hours to recharge the
batteries from dead now finishing up the
layout of the air cup the right side has
your power button below that is a 3.5
millimeter input to connect these
physically and the headphones still do
work even if the battery dies and last
is a microUSB port for charging both
sets now the right ear cup and this is
the same for both models you do have
gesture controls
swiping your finger
or back skips and plays back songs and
music stations included and sliding up
and down increases or decreases volume
from my experience of controls do work
but the Zeek 2.0 model can be spotty at
times adjusting volume causes the music
to stop or via justments simply doesn't
work no adjusting different pressure and
it's showing that I'm sliding here
versus a press still didn't seem to help
unfortunately not a zig 3 though
graciously was very smooth to operate
with no issues whatsoever but going into
other features that truly does make a
Zeke line of headphones the most
advanced pair of headphones on the
market there's a sensor on here that
will pause your music and turn off noise
canceling as soon as you take those
headphones off and music will
automatically resume again once you put
the headphones back on
now speaking of noise cancelling there's
6 noise cancelling microphones included
versus four from the last generation
being able to reduce ambient noise by 30
decibels versus 25 and from my test here
I got emit these are very impressive for
wireless headphones from my experience
these do beat these Sennheiser
Momentum's Wireless the JBL Everest
elite in regards to being both Wireless
and specifically noise cancelling but
compared to the wired qc25 s from Bose
here I feel a Bose has slightly an edge
over this one here but nonetheless for a
wireless set the z2 and z3 really shines
in the noise cancelling Department
sitting next to a dishwasher at home to
bring this out into the coffee shop
where it's really busy here this blocks
up majority of the outside city noises
that you may encounter as well just very
impressive noise canceling performance
in general now you also have this
feature in the app that you can control
how much noise let in as well and it's
perfect for situations when you're using
this in the streets here and you need to
hear your surroundings for safety
now other simple features includes NFC
for easy pairing and with the supplied
parrot app available for both Apple and
Android here you have features like a
battery indicator the active
noise-cancelling controller as I've
shown you earlier an equaliser the
concert hall mode and attempt to
recreate different sound stages and last
are just audio presets
now with the z3 you're paying for all
those features of course plus you get
wireless charging you get to use USB
audio which allows you to playback
higher resolution audio files from the
computer and as stated earlier you do
receive unique styling here from the
designer Philippe Starck now moving on
to comfort the weight is nearly
identical with both models with just
being
a few grams all from each other they're
very light was subtle clamping pressure
at the jawline and minimal pressure at
the crown of the head making these very
easy to wear usually anything under 300
grams are pretty comfortable to me and
the zieks are no different when wearing
these for extended periods of time so
with all that being said how is the
audio here now repeatedly playing
different music and sliding the
headphones one after another off really
didn't yield much difference the zig
three did seem ever so slightly louder
and just ever so slightly more spatial
and sound
but both honestly exhibited very similar
characteristics then for those who have
experienced the flat and neutral sound
signature of the ever-popular bose qc25
you'll find here that is a 2.0 and 3
offers more bass and these headphones
can get much louder now these aren't
heavily bass boosted here or they don't
hit as hard as his Sennheiser momentum
Wireless and I recently reviewed Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen h6 based on the other hand for
the Z 2 &amp;amp; 3 here it's a nice touch with
being enough for most John Rose than a
more basic music more basic tracks these
do hit tight clean and accurate then now
if I would attempt to give an
illustration this is in between being
flat like a bose qc25
and being bass boosted like the
sennheiser momentum Wireless it's a nice
yet suitable amount now the mid-range
isn't pushed forward or nor bright here
but offers voices and singers clarity
and definition overall it's a balanced
sound signature that complements the
rest of the audio characteristics as
well from the low frequencies to the
high making these some of the easiest
pair of headphones to listen to for
extended times then regarding the high
frequencies here they're very controlled
here with a bit of roll-off at the top
end to prevent any screeching or ear
tinging and the z2 s however in the zig
3s
if you do listen to these on very high
volume talking about near maximum here
there is slight distortion and the notes
do jumble just a bit here but again the
bottom has to be at a very very high
setting soundstage wise these are quite
impressive for a closed back system
popping the vine Mondays you can for
sure get a feel of left and right audio
channels of course but you do get a
sense of music forward and slightly
behind you and when the hi-hats hit the
sound is slightly in front of you but
above you at the same time so it's very
impressive and less regarding sound
leaking blasting these they do isolate
sound very well preventing others nearby
from listening to your music so that's
it for this review overall these are not
100%
perfect but the audio performance
seriously makes up for the gesture
control issue that I had with the z2s
and not to mention for a wireless pair
of headphones this has to be the best
active noise-cancelling pair that i've
tested so far so all this video helped
you in some way again I'm Jimmy with
Jim's reviewer remember to find me on
Facebook Twitter and or Instagram you
guys take care and I'll see you in the
next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
