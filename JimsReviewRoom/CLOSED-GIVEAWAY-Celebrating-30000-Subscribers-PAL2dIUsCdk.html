review room as the total proceeds the
channel has been growing ridiculously
fast and once again I'm doing another
giveaway for you guys and also giving
you a bit of insight on myself and also
the general now first and foremost I of
course want to say thank you to everyone
who's been with me on this journey and
I'll continue saying thank you and every
milestone that I hit I still see some
faces from when I first started the
channel to when I had about five
thousand subscribers or so and of course
many new names today they continuously
share my video and show support from at
work so it's amazing to see this long
lineage of people joining and staying
with a brand here now it's so cliche to
say but without you guys I can't be
doing what I'm doing here sharing my
experience with you guys and helping
many others along the way answering
their questions and also feeding into
their curiosity of these awesome
products now but let me go over the
giveaway first and get that out of the
way and after the instructions I hope
you can stay and get to know me a little
bit better and also what I have in store
for the future now as mentioned on all
my social media last month I'm giving
away the misfit flash it's an activity
tracker that you can wear on your wrist
or waist and to see how it did in my
test you can find the video of course on
my review channel here at Jim's review
room or if you're on your desktop you
can click on the video playing right now
and it will open in a new window now
similar rules to follow just like my
previous giveaway videos and be sure to
follow them so here goes number one here
add me to your social media and share
this video add me on one or if not all
of your accounts here if you'd like on
either facebook twitter google+ and i'm
also now on instagram as well and shoot
me a message to say hi if you want
number two what is your user name or the
name that you're using and your social
media account so that way when i
randomly draw your name i can find you
on social media and get your address so
be sure to add me as i do check and make
sure that you have me on your list well
but number three here because I have
such a huge international audience tell
me where you're from it's awesome to see
people from all over the world
have tons of people from India from
Europe a lot of people from cali from
the west coast here and then a lot of
sporadic people across the united states
as well i mean it's amazing to see where
everyone's coming from and that when did
you find my channel so those two things
here where you from and when did you
find my channel you can list how many
subscribers ahead at the time or what
you think the first video you thought
you saw was with me and if you don't
know those two how long you been
watching Jim's review room for in
general and it's seriously awesome just
to go through these and in read the
comments so what I'll do like set up
I'll announce the randomly chosen winner
in a week from today and I'll give a
48-hour window for you to respond with
your address now if there's no response
I move on to the next random person and
yes this will be a international
giveaway so it's pretty cool to see
these guys get these and they're always
happy to see them in one sometimes can
believe it they don't know what they
don't believe that these YouTube
giveaways or real or not but best of
luck to you guys look out on social
media next week as I'll be contacting
you then so a little background here on
the progress so far a lot of people
don't know but I left my corporate job
October of 2013 so this past October
just two months ago has been a full year
that i've been doing YouTube full time
and when I first started I maybe had six
hundred subscribers or so from 43 videos
in total that I was doing as a hobby and
they all looked totally like you can go
on to the channel and scroll back to my
very early videos and you can see they
look totally different from what I do
now nonetheless today all of you guys
came out of nowhere in the count as of
this video is closing in and thirty-two
thousand subscribers then putting this
into perspective it had taken about six
months for me to hit my first 10,000
subscribers then 20,000 in total came on
board around sick tember 16th that's
about three months later and more
recently two months in two weeks after
twenty thousand subscribers that was on
November 30th we're here at 30,000 so
it's definitely snowballing growing
ridiculously fast in my opinion and it's
in to be ostrich at the numbers right
now it's only been a week and a half and
it's almost thirty two thousand
subscribers already
so again I want to say thank you for
those old and new to the channel for
help me grow the way it has now nearly
every one of my videos I put up has been
hitting the first page of youtube search
results and I'm just glad people are
enjoying my work people are messaging me
with questions that do try to answer and
in return people are just showing such
great support now with all that being
said I provide one of those life updates
on or a little after the new years as I
have a project that I've been
contemplating about and trying to spruce
up the channel a little bit here and
also trying to diversify Jim's review
room in general I'm pretty sure you guys
would like it so again best of luck to
those who enter and i'll post a winner
on my social media channel in a week and
like i said make sure you respond within
48 hours so be sure to be on the lookout
so this is Jimmy with Jim's review room
you guys take care and I'll see you on
the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
