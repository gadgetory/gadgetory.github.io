Jimmy with Jim's review room I've always
wanted to give these a try since I think
it's genius it's a small little device
that you can attach to almost anything
and if you ever lose it you can find it
with your phone that most will probably
attach these to their keys but thinking
beyond that you can attach these
wireless trackers to pets you can put
them inside your kids coat or backpack
or throw one of these into your luggage
to locate your belongings when the
airlines can't find it the tracker Bravo
that I have here is priced at $30 for
one and they do sell multi packs and
give a good bit of discounts when you do
order in bulk they did send me a review
unit here and I will no question test
this to ensure if it works or not
so without further ado my channel is
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to jim's
review room going over the physical
features it's about the size of a
quarter with the outside being made of
anodized aluminum in the retail package
it does come with a keyring and one
adhesive sticker to attach this onto a
flat surface built inside is a cell
better lasting up to one year per
tracker and compared to the other major
competitor here the company tile
trackers battery is interchangeable
while with tile they require you to
repurchase a new tile at a discount when
their battery dies overall the physical
build is top-notch and the aluminum
finish does give it a nice quality feel
to and tracker also discloses in their
FAQ this is water-resistant being able
to withstand light moisture now it's a
bit confusing as it doesn't clearly
define can it resist some penetration of
water such as being caught in the ring
or is it only able to withstand vapor in
humidity but tracker does sell a
separate water-resistant case and with
it on the Bravo can withstand puddles
splashes and temporary submersions now I
would be a cautious about the Bravo by
itself as it may get caught up in the
weather here but on the other hand tile
trackers competitors does offer their
version but ip5 certified meaning it is
splash proof but now jumping into the
app here and going over the available
features the first thing that you'll see
is the most
location of your sink Bravo if the item
is no longer within a range of your
phone a timestamp is provided which is
convenient here and giving you an idea
where you last left your belongings if
you happen to lose the item and go back
to that last known location the app does
provide okay proximity indications it's
not pinpoint accuracy but you can press
this audio icon on the bottom of the app
here and the Bravo will admit a ringtone
and helping you find your tracker which
I've found to work the best during
testing the audio ring is moderate in
volume at best and I want to consider it
as being loud here's a quick sample
going back to the app here other
features include a device and phone
separation alert a perfect scenario is
if you're the type of guy that carries
his wallet everywhere or for females you
always carry your purse everywhere if
you have the Bravo inside either or once
you walk away from your wallet or purse
the Bravo will emit the audio alarm and
your phone will also sound off a
specific ringtone as well this also
works the other way if you lost your
phone and even if your phone is on
silent press and hold the Bravo button
on the bottom here and your phone will
sound off an alarm itself again even if
your phone is on silent it's highly
convenient overall from using the
tracker around the house it's been great
the Bravo claims up to a hundred feet of
Bluetooth coverage and within my average
two-story home it's been able to keep a
constant connection I had taken this out
to the open here and place the Bravo on
one end and walked until the Bravo lost
connection and cause my phone to ring
during this open test I was able to
achieve about 84 linear feet with my
Nexus 6p
but moving on to the very last feature
that I very much have been anticipating
on testing is what they call crown GPS
similar to others on the market there's
no fee there's no monthly subscription
if you ever lost your item for example
let's say someone stole your bicycle and
of course your phone is not within range
proud GPS then relies on other tracker
owners when others with a tracker app
walks within 100 feet of your item the
GPS location will update on your phone
tracker claims to be the largest crowd
GPS service at the moment and keep in
mind the service and technology is still
new and hasn't caught on with mainstream
consumers just yet now with that being
said I tested this by placing my tracker
at
populated shopping center here in the
middle of the city a drove several miles
down the road and waited about an hour
just to see by chance if someone else
with a trekker might walk by and update
my app and unfortunately it didn't do so
I decided to go into the Target store
there where there's very much a lot of
foot traffic and discreetly left the
Breville in between some key red cups
here and I checked the app two hours
later and still no updates and I'm aware
they were about an hour or two hour test
which is quite short yet if anything I
was testing my luck with the limited
time that I had now in one of the
tracker promotional videos with a stolen
bike they had taken ten days for the GPS
location to update and that could very
well be accurate in my situation as well
I'm not saying the service doesn't work
but those expecting a same day
turnaround might be out of luck until
the service is more widely adapted onto
the market and more consumers are
carrying these around also keep in mind
larger metropolitan areas would most
likely receive higher and faster success
rates versus my midsize to somewhat
large city here which is Charlotte North
Carolina so altogether I didn't have any
problems loading and syncing the device
with my Nexus phone and a tracker work
great within the house and I wish the
audio alarm on the tracker itself was a
bit louder and they crowd GPS I am
certain that does work and there's
evidence that it does when you do search
online but consumers wouldn't need to
keep in mind it may take some time for
someone with the same app to walk by and
update your items location so hope this
