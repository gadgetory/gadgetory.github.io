the brand new second-generation Nike
FuelBand se now this was released to
market on November 27 2013 and currently
retails for $149 which is on par with
its competition the Fitbit force and
also the jawbone up24 now with my review
and testing I gotta say this band in
ways is much different from the two
aforementioned products so without
further ado we'll get started the band
internally feels like hard plastic with
an outer layer of silicone or rubber now
you have a status button here that
lights up a beautiful LED display with
indications and your progress such as
steps calories burned Nike Fuel points
burn for that day a digital clock and
this thing called hours won and now get
into that a little bit later now around
the other side is the locking and
clamping mechanism with the data port
there now the band snaps and unsnaps
very easily and hold down securely Nike
provides a USB cable for you to connect
to your computer for data transfer and
to charge the unit as well now keep in
mind the FuelBand se does have bluetooth
technology so you can wirelessly sync
your data with your phone or device now
the biggest downfall though is the fuel
band only works on Apple devices as
shown on your screen and currently any
Android powered devices unfortunately do
not work in regards to battery life Nike
claims up to four days of news at least
that's what it says on their website at
the time of this review now that's
really low compared to the competition
but I do believe possibly the website
might be a little bit misleading or just
incorrect information since I've been
wearing this I've noticed that it does
last up to seven days about there and
then a recharge is actually needed so
just heads up on that now the band has
been very comfortable to wear as it's
very lightweight weighing in just a
little over an ounce and the design
isn't bad at all now from eye level it
almost looks like I'm wearing one of
those silicone wristbands like the
iconic yellow LIVESTRONG bracelets there
is a wrist measuring guide on the side
of the box as well to test your fit
before purchasing and in the box there
are two links for you to add or remove
to ensure a better fit I do wear this
every day
then even when I'm doing the dishes or
showering the band is water-resistant
for those kind of activities but the
band itself cannot be some
in water like swimming or bathing and
that's okay though as the competition
has the same limitation as well so
overall the physical aspect is nearly
identical to the previous generation and
like you really went with the concept if
it's really not broken why fix it
mentality it's still a very rugged
design lightweight and fashionable and
of course that is subjective of course
and Nike claims that the SE band has
better tracking capabilities that not
only measures the amount of time that
you move but also how often in how
intense now going into Nikes concept of
how this product works and how it could
help you is very unique now this is
where Nike does very well or very poor
based on what specifically motivates you
now the Nike FuelBand records and
monitors your activity with a strong
emphasis on Nikes reward system as
mentioned earlier they're called Nike
Fuel points now throughout the day and
the activities you perform you start
earning these points in an effort to
meet or beat your set goals although the
fuel band records your steps and
calories burned it's not at the
forefront of the app though but the
negative fuel points are basically on
every page that you click on proactively
though reminding you to reach those
goals then I'll go over the app and you
can decide if the fuel band is for you
now the main menu offers you to set your
goal for the next day again these are
points and not steps taken you will
always receive suggestions to increase
your goal in attempt to push yourself
harder now as for the day off you'll
have this ring here that eventually
fills up as you progress indicating how
close you are to your set number and
this is a quick and also a visual way of
course to see how close you are the next
menu feature is activity in which you
can break down the day week month or
year and this is the only screen where
you can see your calories burned and
steps taken and earlier I did state Nike
puts a strong emphasis on the Nike
reward system and one of the methods
that it does to accomplish that is
called hours one now you have to move
for five minutes
within the hour to quote-unquote win it
and this is a great way especially for
myself because I do work on YouTube
throughout the day and I do sit in front
my computer basically throughout that
time so it keeps me reminded and keeps
me motivated to keep basically get up
from my chair
now as I
when the hour the app records how many
hours for that day and in turn I can
over time try to beat my own record the
next feature and this is new to this
year's model is sessions with sessions
before you actually start your activity
let's say it's either running or tennis
walking or snowboarding you can select
your your location where the activity is
being performed then add friends who
have bands as well during that activity
and lastly is turning and the cheers
function that emits an audible cheer for
other friends participating through
their device but honestly I don't think
I'll be playing basketball with my
smartphone in my shorts though so it
might work and might not work in some
instances either or once you click start
a timer will begin and Nike Fuel Points
will then be earned
once you click stop a break down on your
performance is shown with your intensity
the only downfall though I've seen here
is that if you forget to stop the clock
you just somewhat skewed the numbers and
intensity level because the system
records in real time you can go in later
and change only the duration of the
session but not the points or the
intensity so just a heads-up on that now
the last metric and the reward system
are the trophies now this is a pretty
cool feature as you earn accolades or
achievements with every milestone that
you hit some are very simple as going
green for the week or beating your goal
for that day by either fifty percent or
a hundred percent and so on and some are
really hardcore though such as going
green for a hundred consecutive days
even going up to a whole year without
missing one day and other trophies are
unlocked once you have enough Nike Fuel
points so the reward system in general
with no question will keep you busy for
a very long time if your points kind of
a person and lastly and as important
though is the social aspect now all
these apps in bands are great for the
individual but once you have friends and
family members on the same boat it does
really become a friendly competition yet
a very supportive community now you can
add friends from your Facebook account
or you can add friends through your
address book on your device or if you
want to you can also go through the Nike
Plus icon here and search under random
people and the point system as Nike
advertises is a universal measurement
across all age groups and activities so
regardless where you are in life
either in size or age you still have the
same comparative metric to use so in my
opinion as I stated earlier either this
band will do wonders for you or it won't
the reason being the band doesn't focus
heavily on counting calories or carbs
and even a sleep monitor is basically a
time clock you start and stop when you
go to sleep and then awaken it's really
not much there but I believe if you want
to track how active you are and or want
to be more active and that's all you're
really aiming for without a strong focus
on the health aspect then yes this band
is definitely for you if you like the
point system and believe as long as
you're active you'll receive the health
benefits then yes again this band is for
you then but if you're really looking
for something more health focused and
I'm specifically speaking of food blogs
detailed charts of your jogging and
running and even your sleep patterns a
bit more detailed exercise log then
there are other bands out there for the
same price that does that though so
altogether the FuelBand se isn't bad at
all it's a really good product but you
have to understand what you want and
what you're getting yourself into
it's truly a matter of preference it's
basically activeness versus health
logging it depends on which one you want
so I hope you enjoy this review of the
Nike FuelBand se if you have not please
look at my other review specifically the
jawbone up24 and the Fitbit force which
is shown above there of course subscribe
and comment to this video as I'm always
eager to hear your opinions and again
this is Jimmy from Jim's review room
