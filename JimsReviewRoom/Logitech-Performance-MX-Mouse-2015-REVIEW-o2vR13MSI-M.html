room now it's such an afterthought on
such a small device that our computer
Mouse's are really important in fact for
me personally being a computer 10 to at
times 14 hours a day editing video it's
crucial in my opinion now I have
purchased Logitech's most expensive non
gaming mouse on hand it's priced at $99
retail as of this video but periodically
throughout the year you'll see Amazon
providing about 50 percent discounts on
logitech products now I personally
bought this again from Amazon for about
$45 a month ago and I've tested all of
its features and use the MX mouse quite
extensively so we'll see if this huge
Mouse is right for you so without
further ado welcome to Jim's review
now for a mouse priced at a whopping $99
or even at $45 you expect more than just
the simple left and right click buttons
now right off the bat this is a wireless
mouse using logitech's unifying
technology now one tiny USB plugin
controls up to 6 other compatible
Logitech devices now in my case I'm
using my Logitech keyboard with this
Mouse in turn saving a USB connection
from being used but being Wireless I did
encounter one flaw having the mouse and
the USB plug in literally 3 feet away
provided stuttering and lag in movements
the mouse would move several inches on
the screen pause and it would resume
again now I did buy another Mouse and
found the same issue so in hindsight it
wasn't the mouse at all but actually the
unifier buying a cheap USB extender
allowing the unifier to be much closer
solve the issue so just be aware for
some people there appears to be an issue
and you can see this on the Logitech
forums now for others and surprisingly
for me after about a week of using the
USB extender in for testing purposes I
actually replugged it back into my
computer and then it worked fine though
I reconnected this to my 10-foot USB
extender cable again and laid this cable
across the floor and now the mouse and
keyboard worked flawless again with a
unifier extended 10 feet away from my
mouse and keyboard combo now it was an
odd phenomenon but it is working now and
last year on regarding the wireless
technology and of course uses batteries
now these new models if you run out of
juice you can use the supplied USB cable
to recharge but if your battery ever
goes bad where it can't hold a charge
anymore you can swap out for new
rechargeable double-a batteries which
can be found at your local Walmart or
Target and most Mouse's today and use
removable batteries but if you stumble
across ones that are fixed inside just
be aware how long it may last for you
now logitech claims up to one month of
news on a fully charged Mouse and after
the third day of music the MX the
battery indicator dropped to one bar
remaining which was very concerning
however I still worked with it until it
died and from my personal experience the
mouse lasted 16 days 2 hours and 52
minutes to be precise and everyone's
results will vary of course and to give
an idea that days that I do edit work I
utilize the mouse probably six to eight
hours a day out of the six day workweek
I might spend some days filming and
utilizing the mouse maybe just two hours
instead and I would say I work with the
mouse more than the average user and my
number would possibly reflect someone
that uses the mouse full-time at the
office instead of those who actually
come home after work and use it on their
home computer now it's still not bad but
again it's nearly fifty percent less
battery life than that one month
duration that logitech is suggesting now
going into its comfort and size indeed
it's a large Mouse and compared to
another Logitech model that I have here
at the m 705 you can see how much bigger
it is now if you like it big this is the
way to go but I'll be honest with you
going back to the medium sized Mouse
still feels refreshing as you can almost
palm the entire Mouse now as an analogy
you're driving a Range Rover with the MX
where it feels bigger there's a bit more
weight to the mouse than most others and
just more refinement you can say where I
felt movement tended to be more relaxed
rather than a very agile medium-sized
Mouse now with that being said bug feels
great in its own way but the MX is
perfect for me when editing and working
in Photoshop Lightroom and my video
editing software we're fine movements or
a must now the MX was for sure not the
go-to Mouse for gaming though you can
see the MX just didn't feel quick enough
not by software and sensitivity but by
the weight and feel but again I'm truly
happy with this Mouse after using this
for extensive periods of time through
the day with its large size to come and
hold but now going here into the
features this is where the MX really
sets itself apart though now I highly
recommend downloading the free software
from Logitech that works and unlocks the
features offered on this MX now first up
here is the scroll wheel allowing a
flick of the finger to scroll through
large documents now those working on
excel sheets will love this feature for
sure and for those working with
Photoshop with a need of zooming in and
out will find this very fluid and you
can adjust the sensitivity again through
any Logitech software but for more
precise scrolling you can press down the
scrolling lock button basically allowing
you for more precise movements on line
by line navigation through work
documents in addition the squirrel will
itself works as a button by pressing
down you can gently press or pull left
or right on the wheel as well and it can
navigate in that direction or perform
actions that you assign to it and again
the Logitech software now it's worked
flawlessly and all the actions mentioned
so far with no hiccups or stutters in
this case now to the left of my mouse
here are my navigation buttons which I
find very convenient when you're on a
web browser or going through a series of
folders on your computer a quick click
can have you go forward or backwards on
a web page or file at your choosing now
directly below that is a zoom feature
allowing for webpages and other programs
with a zoom option to be performed now
on the fly changes for your convenience
is offered when you press once and then
use the scroll wheel basically to zoom
in and out then now the last main finger
feature you can say is the window button
now tap that once and you'll see your
screen shrink and multiple windows that
you have opened are now visible to
select it's a hit-or-miss future
depending on how you can use it though
now working with many programs I still
have to search for that particular
window on my screen but this can be
easily be done by looking at my windows
taskbar instead though now the real
benefit however are those working with
many internet windows not tabs but
windows is the key word since Microsoft
already groups webpages under one icon
on the taskbar spreading them out what
this option does provide useful though
in the very last feature here some way
somehow Logitech was able to make this
mouse work on virtually any surface
including transparent glass and I have
to admit it works perfectly fun and
there was no difference that I could
experience so with all that being said
in detail the MX is one amazing
multitasking feature filled mouse the
fact that the wireless connection was
short when I first purchased this might
throw some buyers in caution and again
it's discussed on the Logitech forms as
well with some experiencing to similar
issues and before Logitech messages me
with a possible defect I did try three
different unifiers and two different
Mouse's and the results were the same
initially now the fact that the battery
lasted fifty percent less than what
logitech claimed the mouse could perform
is ok as 16 days or a little over half a
month worth of work it didn't feel too
short in my pen
but overall when it works the mouse is
great and feels great in the hands too
and for those with smaller hands in
general now to be honest it might be a
little bit overwhelming and you can't
really fully grasp the mouse to really
feel it's a ergonomics sometimes bigger
might not be better so how this video
helped you in some way if you like my
work add me gems review room on to
Facebook Twitter Instagram or Google+ as
I normally post updates on items I'm
currently testing before I put them on
the website again this is Jimmy with
Jim's review room you guys take care and
I'll see you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
