portability and one the best compact
designs the Bose Soundlink micro might
be the answer now full disclosure I've
personally bought this at $100 at the
time of this video click on my affiliate
links down in that video description to
purchase or to check for the most
updated prices in real time they never
know when these things might go on sale
I'm Jimmy Luna with Jim's review room
and I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another review
now while Bluetooth speakers like the UE
winter broom or the Jamie off the floor
are considered as small bluetooth
speakers they're not a slim or portable
as they both sound like micro now made
with tear resistant silicone rubber it's
meant to be a durable outdoor speaker to
with span abrasions now although there's
a quick mentioning on BOCES website
saying quote there's no need to panic if
you drop it unquote I didn't see any
mentioning in the user manual of a
formal drop resistant height or
certification well I dropped damn thing
on tile flooring at the office actually
I'm multiple occasions just to test it
out here and it's still fine today and
it's also sealed to prevent water damage
the Bose micro is IP 7 certified meaning
it's able to be submerged in water up to
one meter they say three point three
feet for up to 30 minutes now Bose also
claims it's safer on ocean water as well
so saltwater not a big deal
the bigger question though especially
for those who bring this on a boat out
on the water does it float with my
testing dropping this into a bucket of
water the speaker
sadly does not keep that in mind now
lasts for many who are unaware or don't
read the instruction manual like me
before I started doing YouTube
the instruction manual says this can be
used in the shower rain or snow some
Bluetooth speakers can't withstand water
jets breeze that is now one of the
biggest reasons why you would buy the
boats micro is this strap on the back
from my testing it's very simple to use
and highly convenient at first it seems
sketchy to use as it's barely latching
and to this little hole right here
but after attaching this in random areas
the tension provides a lot of security
see you attaches to a bike handlebar
with these shocks and shakes it's
not going anywhere it's not going to
unsnap on you now I've always enjoyed
the bose pairing process they give you
voice prompts when it's connected but
also who this speaker is connected to
the bose peers easily for me and the
boast micro is able to remember up to
eight devices at the same time now
placing the speaker on one side of my
studio and walking I wouldn't do the
hallway over there letting the signal go
through several walls I'm able to
achieve 42 linear feet before the
speakers started to crackle now button
wise and going around the speaker here
power and pairing is up top thankfully
there's a battery level indicator
something that I wish that a Sony
actually speakers would have I just
reviewed those but to the front here you
know simply vibe up and down and right
in the middle here is the multifunction
button
one press pauses in play two taps the
song moves forward and three taps goes
back on your music
although most devices are wireless these
days it would have been nice though to
have a three-and-a-half millimeter input
to connect this to your playstation
controller or a PC there's unfortunately
not one but anyways like I said most
devices are wireless so you'll be the
judge on that now jumping into battery
life Bose claims up to six hours of
typical use I ran this at 50% vinyl I
can do all my tests here in the studio
and let them playing from a full battery
to dead with my test I achieved 14 hours
in 35 minutes to be exact
very impressive now other than that this
speaker is very simple to use without
any extra features and gimmicks it's
very straightforward
let's get into some quick audio test be
sure to put on your headphones or
earphones as I'll be using them by
neural microphones and before I starts
be sure to help support my work if I
follow me on Facebook or Instagram also
my personal Facebook and Instagram
accounts called Jimmy loon official fire
mode use the comment section here we go
alright folks please have your
headphones or earphones in for the
binaural experience here goes the first
saw
so first up for a small speaker it does
very well at providing enough for
personal space listening but also
smaller reception like areas that need
background audio although this is priced
at $100 don't expect it to be as loud as
the JBL flip 4 or again the ue wonder
boom in this price range but for the
size of this thing the boast micro is
really really good now for such a small
speaker this thing has pretty tongue
good bass more so than any other ultra
portable bluetooth speaker that I've
tested this includes the old UE Rule two
and be JBL clip that I have tested
before now those didn't hit as deep as
the boast micro but there's a little
thump in the music that helps make this
little speaker enjoyable now moving to
the mid-range any audio track strong and
vocal as we're talking Sam Smith Adele
songs of Beyonce as a few examples here
the most the boast micro that is does
exceptionally well that's very clear and
pushed forward now I'm pop songs that
has a lot of instruments and background
audio this is slightly and they get
slightly jumbled together with the upper
mid-range frequencies and slowly heading
into the very high frequencies there
wasn't much audio separation there when
there's a lot going on it gets slightly
hard to distinguish some instruments and
vocals that's what I mean light gets
kind of jumbled up there and for most
small speakers for them to be this loud
though there's usually some sacrifice in
the high frequency range with screeching
and ear piercing notes you don't get
that here with the microbe if anything
Bose plays it really safe in the high
frequencies and rounds off the top and
in general with the lack of resolution
on the top end it prevents the speaker
from going overboard and sounding too
sharp it's not a bad thing most average
consumers will find this perfectly fine
now
are there any movie syncing issues a
quick test with me Samsung si+ and they
pixel XL - watching Netflix I personally
didn't have any issues so over on the
portability makes the speaker and winner
rugged waterproof and functional the
only thing really missing for me is the
ability for it to float just in case you
drop into the pool or such demo I cannot
dive in and get this for you guys a
pride drown seconds keep in mind how
small this thing is for the quality
comes out of this
thing it's quite impressive and I highly
recommend you guys get this
if ultra portability is on your list is
at the top of your list that is if you
want better sound quality but less
portability of course again check out
the JBL flip speaker or the ue wonder
boom so alright folks let up that
comment section with fire emojis and
follow me on Facebook and Instagram to
stay up to date with Jim's Revere by
signing up on my website in Jim's review
calm and yes I know you guys are asking
me a bunch of times and I'm excited
about it the Sony 1000 was an MX 3 mark
3 is coming to China pretty soon and
also this Samsung Galaxy watch alright
folks
