room welcome back to another one of my
vlogs here today we're celebrating a
hundred and ninety thousand followers on
YouTube holy cow this is getting
ridiculous
and I'm excited every one of these vlogs
is because it's always always you guys
always beat my expectations I don't know
who the hell's watching my videos but
thank you very much I'm seriously it's
humbling I'm so grateful that this is
happening it's growing much faster than
I ever anticipated I know I said and
every one of my videos but it's like the
numbers or something it's camp out and
you guys are coming out of the woodwork
so thank you very much I got a special
treat for you guys at the two hundred
thousand subs whenever that's coming so
look out for that but today we're doing
a very quick Q&amp;amp;A I posted it on my
social media you guys asked me questions
I'm gonna do a very quick quick firing
session I'm gonna answer as many
questions as I can for you guys but
today I'm at the park here if you guys
been following you guys know I'd go to
this park religiously and the reason
being is because today I'm testing out
the Fitbit charge - the reason why comes
here one of two reasons
there's this loop here that I run and
it's exactly a mile so I can ensure if
these bands are accurate or not
second this is probably on the more
friendlier parks the other part that I
usually go to or sometimes go to not
anymore
every time I go there they always call
the cops on me for some odd reason and
the officers are really nice but they
always come up to me and say hey someone
called them said your you have a camera
and you're out taking photos and stuff
like that and I'm wondering you know
what's wrong I stay away from the kids
and everything but you know I understand
you know people are concerned that and
that other Park is no more much more
residential area this is right in the
city
so hopefully YouTube and the digital era
is a little bit more I accepted here
some behind-the-scenes stuff here with
Jim's review last week I did not post
any videos it's probably the first time
I ever did that and maybe a year and a
half or so I don't know but um I I was
still working don't get me wrong and
also you know someone it wasn't as
grueling because I didn't have to do any
fear recording and video editing
um last we got this worked just trying
to contact as many brands that I could
just try to see if I can get some few
units i pre-ordered a bunch of stuff
here but this is probably the most
organized yet the most exhausting most
filled jam-packed fall season and I'm
not complaining at all I'm excited for
it I hope you guys are excited about it
as well there's just so many products so
many tests so many gadgets they're gonna
be on the channel pretty soon here and I
have everything filled pride from today
all the way till Midway of December so
it's gonna be back-to-back guys hope you
guys are excited about that button that
I'm still trying to work on the second
business some behind the scenes stuff
it's still very early so I can't
disclose too much yet I don't know if
it's gonna happen or not but follow me
at Jimmy long official I'm there I do
post some banishing stuff some
motivational stuff some you know other
content besides Jim's review room hope
you guys do you add me on there and
enjoy the content over there as well
other than that let's get going with
this Q&amp;amp;A session first up is a
sponsorship and keep in mind guys
sponsorships do help tremendously with
my channel here I basically use that
money to reinvest into all these gadgets
that I'm getting hey guys I know the
video is a little bit dark right now
it's 9 o'clock and just got home today's
Tuesday the video earlier was from
Monday and sorry about that sponsorship
they literally pulled out overnight last
night and woke up this morning solving
or cancellation so it is what it is
sometimes that happens well first time
for me it happened so it's no big deal
sorry about that I didn't want to redo
the entire vlog since I filmed it
yesterday and just a cotton piece of
together just what would have looked
right
anyways let's do some questions for you
guys starting with Twitter and I
apologize in advance amount of bastard
names no matter what I'm just horrible
with pronouncing names here first one up
is from a cash PI on Twitter here when
will be your next giveaway it's gonna be
at
thousand subs whenever that happens I
think Oh God right now I'm at like 197
or so whenever that happens that's when
we be next giveaway which one do you use
at your daily driver right now is the
note 7 I'm sorry the s7 the note 7
potentially could blow up you guys
already know about that I kind of want
to get the v12 from LG I really love the
v10 b12 that's a lot it's really
different from the original one so we'll
see a lot of the same features are
coming back they're just great but just
a physical aspect it looks a lot
different of course but anyways we'll
see about that still contemplating shab
elite or at any leat on Twitter I hope
you can do laptop reviews in the future
do you prefer Mac OS or Windows for
video editing and productivity asks to
be oxygen I haven't used a Mac computer
since probably middle school high school
when they had those square box Apple
Macintosh I don't know what you call
them back in a day have everything via
windows and Android Google all that
stuff and you know what the business is
just rolling so fast it's kind of
hesitant I'm making that switch next one
up here let's see Perth eesh and I'm
sorry man / theis on Twitter it says if
your life before as a youtuber I used to
work in insurance I used to work in
banking specifically mortgages I used to
be a daytime trader
I used to trade stocks or equities and
then I used to trade SMP futures I'll
get more into detail about that in the
next video to 200,000 video in a 200,000
sub vlog I'm gonna detail my past my
present basically YouTube today and what
I have planned for the future so more
details about that just hang on tight
that should be coming up shortly
let's see Alex Potvin ask do you prefer
alto shoots or indoors or why letting
deaf visuals and how much time you spent
on one review very common question about
how long does it take for me do a review
I do prefer to shoot indoors the reason
being is
as a controlled environment I could
double lighting situation for the most
part and identically the same with every
shoot that I do if I go outdoors if it
is raining if it's super sunny that day
high noon the colors the the settings
all have to change them to read down
everything back down so there's a lot
more variables now with that being said
I personally would love to work outdoors
so most of time when I do my narratives
most of the time when I'm testing the
products I usually just go out just to
get away from the studio here to see it
get out get some Sun on me and just
these civilization because if you're
cooped up in the house for so long of
course it could be very daunting oh and
almost forgot here how much time do I
spend on a one review it really depends
and this is not including testing
testing can vary by different products
if they have batteries of course I
dreamed up a couple batteries sometimes
with these activity bands or so that's
why I'm not the first one to come out
with a review is because if I do get it
on the street release date that means I
don't get a review unit that means if I
can't you know have my guy hooked me up
at some store and get early on you know
I have to wait five seven days to have
the battery entirely drained until I can
pull out an actual review I really
thoroughly test them as for let's say
it's a pair of headphones that does not
have batteries it's a traditional wire
that could take maybe about three days
or so the reason being the first day I
always do the burnin test I just let it
doesn't run for a couple hours straight
just in case you never know and then I
start preparing and listening and
usually on the third maybe the fourth
day I have a listen one more time just
in case my thoughts change it's not a
first impression video but it's you know
I try to put some meat in the reviews
and stuff so I really do testing but
regarding the filming and editing
narration typing up my narrative that
the narrative itself I would say maybe
six hours for me to type it all up
proofread it try to tweak it to the
point where customers can usually
understand me but yet the same time have
that narrative come off naturally as
well so that's the bail
that try to take and also then I would
record my voice of course that never
perfect every time I do stutter a lot if
you say um a lot and of course in the
narratives I do speak a lot slower and
it do in person and so that's just the
narrative part the filming part takes
holy cow it depends again the note 7 and
you can imagine that's a maybe three or
four days or so three days each day
about eight to ten hours of work that's
not including my time so it's email
towards you know business calls and all
that stuff behind the scenes trying to
fill up my calendar for the eat maybe be
found a month and you know they finally
week sponsorships whatever it may be
other times it takes an average I would
say if it's just your typical review I
don't say two days to film and add it
and put it all together render upload
all that fun stuff and I know I'm
probably slower than a lot of people but
like I said I I always try to focus more
on quality than quantity and that was
something that I struggled with
corporate America when I was working you
know for companies it was always a rush
rush rush rush rush and then you know to
get your numbers good or right you just
had to do enough and there's times you
had to cut corners that say I don't know
that that just wasn't me that's a
stomach work ethic so anyways I know
that's a long answer but that the detail
answer for those who are curious I know
a lot of people if you ask me that
pretty often it actually next look next
question here Alex
h7 off a Twitter this isn't a correlated
but I want to know what's your most
embarrassing story / moment I have so
many embarrassing moments I would think
I don't know back in like middle school
I had a crush on a girl and I used to be
like a total dork so I I would print out
a card basically your standard printer
paper and you would print it out and you
will fold it in four and I would you
know put a cute picture on there in a
write a little message and I'll stick it
into our locker that I think it worked
once
then I eventually met her who started
talking and her breath was horrific and
I was like oh I'm and this is this is
not my chick bad breath and odor that's
such a turn-off
but anyways none of the other future
attempts ever worth so that's prime of a
most embarrassing moment that I have
that just like you know comes off top my
head alright next one here
alright so Emma's check Chaffin says who
is your favorite youtuber and why
Congrats on your hundred ninety thousand
subscribers thanks man and love watching
her videos favorite youtuber one that
just comes across my cuz he's the most
popular in my opinion Casey nice that
and it's not because he does make
entertaining videos and he's just quirky
and funny it's because he I believe he's
just a true genuine creator and he's
just for original and with today with
YouTube especially there's just so I see
it I see it so much so many people are
just copying each other and it just it
discusses me and that's probably the
only bad side maybe one the very few bad
sides that I see on YouTube today is
just the capping that's occurring and a
lot of people say hey you're you're not
me but they're just saying hey there
they're looking for inspiration tweak it
your own way there's a lot of people
that I not a lot but there's people that
I watch that you know does inspire me
and I try to derive my style my
techniques actually off of Netflix and
watching a lot of documentaries and just
watch up those angles of slope and
watching the way the color things and
frame things especially that's where I
get my inspiration from but what I'm
saying is there's so many youtubers
today that they're you can almost take
one channel and put another channel next
to it and they'll have maybe the same
white table maybe the same purple neon
lights and I'm not calling anyone out
and it looks gorgeous I think it looks
good and sometimes I look
way better than my videos I'm not hating
on that I'm just talking about and again
the reason why I like Casey nice that is
because I love originality I love the
creative mind
I really dislike it it's kind of
annoying when I see people is copying or
finding inspiration others and then just
incorporating into their own work squeak
it just enough to make it your own and
that's all I could ask I know some
people were saying well what the hell I
really like something I mean it is what
it is and there's times where maybe my
stuff looks pretty similar to others but
then at the same time I strive to be
different in my way and not because I'm
a rebel or anything at the end the day
I'm a creator so again that's a my
excellent explanation so Casey and I
said it's a long story I actually watch
a lot of I watch more like Fitness
channels Christian guzmán is one of the
guys that I watch I actually knew him or
started watching him ever since he
started from the beginning before he had
a warehouse before he had the fancy cars
and everything before and it's real
clothing line but just really into
fitness stuff I'm trying to be a fitness
nut although I'm you know hypocritical
about that but I try to be super cars of
London
Shmi 3:50 those a car guys basically I
do love nice to ask loud cars that's why
I'm not as much as I like a tech and
Tesla like I said just now
loud v8 V tends naturally aspirated non
turbos and German built hand-built
whatever it may be you know those are
the cars that just mmm
just that gets me going and one day like
I hope to have that but of course
there's family first in the business
second and then maybe the supercars one
day down the road who knows all right
woman on next year ray and chaski says I
didn't even draw my life what are your
plans on YouTube in the future again at
the two thousand two hundred thousand
subscriber video I also posted my again
personal Facebook accounts
jimmy'll on official Louis caster asked
are you a fan of The Walking Dead and
are you looking forward to season seven
hell yes been watching every season as
every episode has been coming out it's
such a slow show but I have no idea why
I'm so addicted to it I think God and
what's that what's that dude's name to
do with the mullet I think Meighan
whacked him at the end of last season so
who knows me and my fiance is still
trying to guess who it is
really Thomson says I was wondering what
was harder in your new career speaking
to the camera or continuing on in the
beginning when you were unsure when you
were a unsure noob keep going through
way way more money that you could make
so it was harder in your new career
speaking to the camera or basically
blowing money I'm assuming I'll be
honest it was it was blowing the money
the speaking part if you watch my old
videos they are horrible but my bigger
focus was if I don't get this business
off the ground by you know whatever my
time for me was I planned everything out
if I didn't make it my numbers at that
time I knew I would have ran out of
savings 1 2 I would have gone back to
corporate America and that's the last
place I ever want to go back to I never
want to be employed by someone else I I
would rather be making less and just
being my own boss and be content and
happy and producing my own content and
just seeing you guys
you know absorber it watch it I don't
know looking at your comments and
feedback I enjoy that much more if I can
continue you know motivating inspiring
people and I have a voice through
YouTube through Jim true guru now
through my personal accounts that that
what makes me happy worked for corporate
was for ending this
so anyways money if I didn't make my
numbers it would have been hell
James Chenoweth says you live in
Charlotte yes I do if you haven't been
definitely
astral I have been up to Asheville and I
have been to the built when the Biltmore
is ridiculously fabulous been there for
the Winter Festival where they light up
all the candles and stuff it would be
nice
Adrienne Navarro has do you plan on
getting a Tesla Model car if so could
you do a review and I would love to do a
review on it I would definitely love to
try a Tesla myself this is see if it
fits you know my personality yeah Lucas
ludicrous mode sounds great but again
when you combine the sound of an engine
and just the rumble the shakin nuances
of that it really makes you connect it
to a car if those who drive manual know
what I'm talking about that's what I
mean you just feel connected to the car
and I know manually going away it is
what it is but I feel Tesla it's a great
car can't a sacar love the tech but I
don't know I just love the rawness of a
old-school car I guess our traditional
car or actually a today's car but hasn't
captured yes
let's see Dan Edmund dead or beside an
eminent or Emond I am sorry man do you
have any productivity tips for others
who work in their home on their own time
how did you stay focus when you first
started again it's just a house on the
grind my focus and life and it's always
been like this I always have a goal
wherever it is it's usually I try to aim
really high because there are times when
you fail but at least are that much
higher than if you had your goals that
much lower but what keeps me motivated
little lethargic just not feeling it
same thing with working out sometimes
you get them down gazers is like yo I'm
just not in the mood we'll keep looking
at that bigger picture and just know
everyday you grind it just makes for a
better day tomorrow just know it every
time that you feel fatigued or you feel
exhausted or you feel like you don't
want to work the days that you do work
same thing when working out that I've
noticed all the days that you make the
most games there's no different women
it's kind of getting cliche now but it
rings so true when people are sleeping
you're up working when people are
napping
I don't know grind harder when people
are on vacation put 2 X 3 X 4 X down and
just hustled that much harder and I
guarantee those are the times that you
make the most strides the most gains the
biggest performance increases are doing
the during those moments when you lack
the most motivation when other people
left the most motivation so I don't say
those are the times that I try to
convince myself and crank as hard as I
can
let's see here Gideon GK asks you always
by your review items isn't it expensive
yes it is expensive today and I think
another person had the same question to
a lot of compassion it has the same
question I I still purchase a lot of the
items that you guys see on the channel
Anubis closed it in the beginning of
every channel as well if I did purchase
it or did not 90 I was 80 90 90 percent
in 92 percent of the items that you guys
see as items that I think personally
purchase and it doesn't mean I'm rich or
anything like that what I do and I don't
think it's any secret sauce or anything
like that I I strive to try to make the
best videos that I can with enough
content and information that would
definitely help people because when it
does help people you get shared
obviously and I try to make as much
money as I can back I do sell the items
eventually so that's why for the longest
time you don't see me doing comparison
videos now I'm starting to do a little
bit more of those and those have been
pretty decent but yeah I just sell the
items back as soon as I'm done with the
review to try to make as much money back
and over the length of 12 months I look
at the analytics the numbers and I try
to make sure or ensure that i recoup the
cost back and when you guys see any one
of my videos that makes maybe 10,000
views you can you for sure know I'm not
making my
you back the phones I lose my money so
mentally the note seven even though I
got I'm a seventy eight thousand views
so far on it
it's a $900 phone I'm not I'm not making
anywhere close to 900 bucks
excuse me I'm that phone so the note
sounds actually to my right here so let
me shady slim sheddy on instagram here
and longtime viewer to be honest with
you guys shoutout to slim can we expect
a second channel and my name is
pronounced AK he'll let I murdered your
name last time I'm probably murdering it
right now slim I just call you Shetty
that's all it is man yes I am planning
to make a second channel and that will
probably come and pretty soon just to
keep things organized but the second
channel be more personalised background
stuff Jim's review will most likely
exist for these logs here
so second channel will be coming I
decided to commit myself to doing that
just waiting for things to die down a
little bit and create the banner create
the the analytics create the account all
that fun stuff
okay JW x ec whatever your name is have
you ever thought of expanding your team
so he can fire us with more content more
efficiently with more variations and
sponsors to afford more expensive and
higher end items we're trying next year
all right next one
Mithun 41:49 says what's your favorite
smart form of the year there's probably
three more phones coming out this year
so I want to hold back a bit I still
love the LG v10 you guys see me rocking
a lot of Samsung
I love the LG v10 because most likely
has the IR blaster that I love and then
I used I missed that for my Samsung Note
4 back in the day
ah let's see here Evan Chang any dream
car for the future yes right now I'm
really digging the new Aldi or H or the
ar-10 you know both models are the same
Mik on the outside the Lambo
work on God man those price is so
expensive by getting that is a dream car
it is really nice
I don't know if that could be my daily
driver I'll see I have seen some
youtubers for God's sakes and use those
things every day I don't know how they
do it
the repairs would be up the arse I have
always been fond of Austin Martin
watching a lot of reviews they're really
just refined you know grand touring cars
sport oriented cars they're not super
cars but I've always for some reason
really really loved Austin Martin's they
always seem timeless to me and they just
have some level of sophistication that I
really like so we'll see
so anyways that's it for this video in
this vlog here I hope I answered a lot
of these questions for you guys I know
this video is probably long right now it
is 10 o'clock so I took about an hour
answering questions
I probably condense this down to maybe a
10 20 30 minute session who knows but
anyways guys I'll catch you guys on the
next one Fitbit charge review is coming
out next later at the end of this week
the 200,000 sub video is coming out
whenever that is but at the rate we're
moving man we're killing it alright guys
I'll talk to you guys later and good
night I'm going to sleep bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
