room welcome back to another one of my
vlogs here today we're celebrating a
hundred and ninety thousand followers on
YouTube holy cow this is getting
ridiculous and I'm excited every one of
these vlogs is because it's always in
all ways you guys always beat my
expectations I don't know who the hell's
watch of my videos but thank you very
much i'm seriously it's humbling i'm so
grateful that this is happening it's
growing much faster than ever
anticipated i know i said and every one
of my videos but it's like the numbers
or something its compound and you guys
are coming out of the woodwork so thank
you very much i got a special treat for
you guys at the 200,000 subs whenever
that's coming so look out for that but
today we're doing a very quick Q&amp;amp;A i
posted it on my social media you guys
ask me questions I'm gonna do a very
quick quick firing session I'm gonna
answer many questions as it can for you
guys but today I'm at the park here if
you guys been following you guys know I
go to this park religiously and the
reason being is because today I'm
testing out the Fitbit charge to the
reason why comes here one or two reasons
there's this loop here that I run and
it's exactly a mile so I can ensure if
these bands are accurate or not second
this is probably on the more friendlier
parks the other part that I usually go
to or sometimes go to not anymore every
time I go there they always call the
cops on me for some odd reason and the
officers are really nice but they always
come up to me and say hey someone call
them said you're you have a camera and
you're out taking photos and stuff like
that and I'm wondering you know what's
wrong I stay away from the kids and
everything but you know I understand you
know people are concerned that and that
other park is no more much more
residential area this is right in the
city so hopefully a YouTube and the
digital era is a little bit more I
accepted here some behind-the-scenes
stuff here with Jim's review last week I
did not post any videos it's probably
the first time ever did that and maybe a
year and a half or so I don't know but
um I I was still working don't get me
wrong and also you know someone it
wasn't as grueling because I didn't have
to do any fear recording and video
editing
um last we got this worked just trying
to contact as many brands that I could
just try to see if I can get some few
units i pre ordered a bunch of stuff
here uh but this is probably the most
organized yet the most exhausting most
filled jam-packed fall season and I'm
not complaining at all i'm excited for
it i hope you guys are excited about it
as well there's just so many products so
many tests so many gadgets they're gonna
be on the channel pretty soon here and i
have everything filled pride from today
all the way till mid way of december so
it's gonna be back to back guys hope you
guys are excited about that button that
i'm still trying to work on the second
business some behind-the-scenes stuff
it's still very early so i cant to
disclose too much yet i don't know if
it's gonna happen or not but follow me
at jimmy long official i'm there i do
post on piano scene stuff some
motivational stuff some you know other
content besides jim's review room so if
you guys do you add me on there and
enjoy the content over there as well
other than that let's get going with
this Q&amp;amp;A session first up is a
sponsorship and keep in mind guys
sponsorships do help tremendously with
my channel here i basically use that
money to reinvest into all these gadgets
that i'm getting hey guys i know the
video is a little bit dark right now
it's nine o'clock and just got home
today's Tuesday the video earlier was
from Monday and sorry about that
sponsorship they literally pulled out
overnight last night and woke up this
morning solving or cancellation so it is
what it is sometimes that happens well
first time for me it happened so it's no
big deal sorry about that i didn't want
to redo the entire vlog since i filmed
it yesterday and just a cotton piece of
together just wouldn't look right
anyways this do some questions for you
guys starting with twitter and I
apologize in advance amount of bastard
names no matter what I'm just horrible
with pronouncing names here first one up
is from a cache pie on Twitter here when
will be your next giveaway it's gonna be
at
thousands subs whenever that happens I
think Oh God right now i'm at like 197
or so whenever that happens that's when
we be next giveaway which one do you use
at your daily driver right now is the
note 7 arms are the s 707 potentially
could blow up you guys already know
about that I kind of want to get the v12
from LG I really love the v10 b12 it's a
lot it's really different from the
original one so we'll see a lot of the
same features are coming back which is
great but just a physical aspect it
looks a lot different of course but
anyways we'll see about that still
contemplating shab elite or at any
leaked on twitter i hope you can do
laptop reviews in the future do you
prefer mac OS or Windows for video
editing and productivity tasks to be
oxygen I haven't used a mac computer
since probably a middle school high
school when they had those square box
apple macintosh i don't know what you
call them back in a day have everything
via windows and android google all that
stuff and you know what business is just
rolling so fast it's kind of hesitant
i'm making minutes which next one up
here let's see pritesh and I'm sorry man
pritesh on twitter says your life before
as a youtuber i used to work in
insurance i used to work in banking
specifically mortgages i used to be a
daytime traitor I just to trade stocks
or equities and then I used to trade S&amp;amp;P
futures I'll get more into detail about
that in the next video of the 200,000
video in a 200,000 sub vlog I'm going to
detail my past my present basically you
to today and what I have planned for the
future so more details about that just
hanging on tight that should be coming
up shortly let's see Alex pot Vanessa do
you prefer alto shoots or indoors or why
letting depth visuals and how much time
you spent on 1 review very common
question about how long does it take for
me to do a review I do prefer to shoot
indoors the reason being is
because it's a controlled environment I
could double lighting situation for the
most part is identically the same at
every shoot that I do if I go outdoors
if it is raining if it's super sunny
that day high noon the colors the the
settings all have to change have to read
out everything back down so it was a lot
more variable now with that being said I
personally would love to work outdoors
so most of time I do my narratives most
of the time when i'm testing products i
usually just go out just to get away
from the studio here to see it get it
out get some Sun on me and just see
civilization because if you're cooped up
in the house were so long of course it
could be very daunting oh and almost
forgot here how much time do I spend on
one review it really depends and this is
not including testing testing can vary
by different products if they have
batteries of course I dreamed up a
couple batteries sometimes with these
activity bands or so that's why I'm not
the first one to come out with a review
is because if I do get it on the street
release date that means I don't get a
review unit that means if I can't you
know have my guy hooked me up at some
store and get early on you know I have
to wait 5-7 days into the battery
entirely drained until I can pull out an
actual review I really thoroughly test
them as for let's say it's a pair of
headphones that does not have batteries
is the traditional wire that could take
maybe about three days or so the reason
being the first day I always do the
burnin test I just let it just run for a
couple hours straight just in case you
never know and then I start comparing
and listening and usually on the third
maybe the fourth day I have a listen one
more time just in case my thoughts
change it's not a first impression video
but it's you know I try to put some meat
in the review steps on a really do
testing but regarding the filming and
editing narration typing up my narrative
that the narrative itself I would say
maybe six hours for me to type it all up
proofread it try to tweak it to the
point where customers can easily
understand me but you at the same time
have that narrative come up naturally as
well so that's the Bell
I try to take and also that I would
record my voice of course that never
perfect every time i do stutter a lot i
do say i'm a lot and of course in the
narratives I do speak a lap slower and
it do in person and so that's just a
narrative part the filming part takes
holy cow it depends again the note 7 you
can imagine it that's a maybe three or
four days or so three days each day
about eight to ten hours of work that's
not including my time for its email
towards you know business calls and all
that stuff behind the scenes trying to
fill up my calendar for the eat maybe be
found a month and you know they finally
week sponsorships whatever it may be
other times it takes an average I would
say if it's just your typical review
outs eighth two days to film and edit
and put it all together render upload
all that fun stuff I know I'm probably
slower than a lot of people but like I
said I I always try to focus more on
quality than quantity and that was
something that I struggled with
corporate America when I was working you
know for companies it was always a rush
rush rush rush rush and then you know to
get your numbers good or right you just
had to do enough and there's times you
had a cut corners sounds like I don't
know that just wasn't me that's a
stomach work ethic so anyways I know
that's a long answer but that the detail
answer for those who are curious i know
a lot of people if you ask me that
pretty often actually next look next
question here Alex h7 off a Twitter this
isn't a correlated by want to know
what's your most embarrassing story /
moment I have so many embarrassing
moments I would think uh-huh I don't
know back in like middle school I had a
crush on a girl and I used to be like a
total dork so I rent out a card
basically your standard printer paper
and you would print it out and he will
fold it in for and I would you know put
a cute picture on there in a round
little message and I'll stick it into
her locker that I think it worked once
and then I eventually met her we started
talking and her breath was horrific and
I was like um and this is
this is not my chick bad breath and
order others that's such a turn on but
anyways none of the other future
attempts ever work so that's prime of a
most embarrassing moment that I have
that just like you know comes off top of
my head alright next one here alright so
ever check chaffin says who's your
favorite youtuber why congrats on your
hundred ninety thousand subscribers
thanks men and love watching your videos
favorite youtuber one that just comes
across my cuz he's the most popular my
opinion Casey nice that is not because
he does make entertaining videos and
he's just quirky and funny it's because
he I believe he's just a true genuine
creator and he's just for original and
with today with YouTube especially
there's just so I see I see you so much
so many people just copying each other
and it just it discusses me and that's
probably the only bad side maybe one the
very few bad size that I see on youtube
today it's just the capping that's
occurring and alack it was say hey
you're you're not me but they're just
saying hey they're looking for
inspiration tweak it your own way
there's a lot of people that I not a lot
but there's people that i watch that you
know does inspire me and I try to derive
my style my techniques ashley off of
netflix and watching a lot of
documentaries and just watching those
angles of slope and watching the way the
color things that frame things
especially that's where i get my
inspiration from but what I'm saying is
there's so many youtubers today that
there you can almost take one channel
and put another channel next to it and
it'll have maybe the same white table
maybe the same purple neon light and I'm
not calling anyone out and it looks
gorgeous I think it looks good and
sometimes it looks way better than my
videos I'm not hating on that I'm just
talking about and again the reason why I
like KC nice that is because i love
originality i love the creative mind i
really dislike it it's kind of annoying
when I see people is capping or finding
inspiration others and then just
incorporating into their own work squeak
it just enough to make it your own and
that's all I could ask i know some
people were saying well what the hell i
really like something i mean it is what
it is and there's times where maybe my
stuff looks pretty similar to others but
then at the same time i strive to be
different in my way and not because i'm
a rebel or anything I the end the day
I'm a creator so again that's a lie
explicit explanation the casein I status
a long story I actually watch a lot of i
watch more like fitness channels
Christian guzmán is one of the guys
that i watch i actually knew him or
started watching him ever since he
started from the beginning before he had
a warehouse before he had the fancy cars
and everything Brad it's real clothing
line but just really into fitness stuff
I'm trying to be a fitness nut although
I'm you know hypocritical about that but
I try to be a super cars of London Shmi
350 those a car guys basically I do love
nice to ask loud cars that's why I'm not
as much as I like a tech and Tesla like
I said just now loud v8v tens naturally
aspirated non turbos and German bill
hand-built whatever it may be you know
those are the cars I just mmm just that
gets me going in one day light I hope to
have that but of course there's family
first in the business second and then
maybe the supercars one day who knows
alright net woman on next year um rayon
chaski says I find it and doing a draw
my life what are your plans on youtube
in the future again a two thousand two
hundred thousand subscriber video i also
posted ah my again personal facebook
account Jimmy long official Louis caster
ask are you a fan of The Walking Dead
and are you looking forward to season 7
hell yes been watching every season
every episode i've been coming out at
such a slow show but i have no idea why
i'm so addicted to it I think God and
what's that what's that dudes name to do
with the mullet I think negan whacked
him at the end of last season so who
knows me and my fiance is still trying
to guess who it is really Thompson says
I was wondering what was harder in your
new career speaking to the camera or
continuing on in the beginning when you
were unsure when you were a unsure noob
keep going through way way more money
that you could make so it was harder in
your new career speaking to the camera
or basically blowing money I'm assuming
I'll be honest it was it was blowing the
money um the speaking part if you watch
my old videos they are horrible but my
bigger focus was if I don't get this
business off the ground by you know
whatever my time for me was I planned
everything out if I didn't make it my
numbers at that time I knew I would have
ran out of savings 12 I would have gone
back to corporate America and that's the
last place I ever want to go back to you
I never want to be employed by someone
else I I would rather be making less and
just being my own boss and be content
and happy and producing my own content
and just seeing you guys you know
absorber watch it I don't know looking
at your comments and feedback I enjoy
that much more if I can continue in
motivating inspiring people and I have a
voice through YouTube through Jim sri
guru now through my personal accounts
that that wasn't makes me happy worked
for corporate was horrendous so anyways
money if I didn't make my numbers it
would have been held James Chenoweth
says you live in Charlotte yes I do if
you haven't been definitely visit Ashton
what I have been up to asheville and i
have been to the Biltmore the Biltmore
is ridiculously fabulous been there for
the Winter Festival where they let up
all the candles and stuff it would be
nice Adrian Navarro has do you plan on
getting a tesla model car if so could
you do a review and i would love to do a
review on it i would definitely love to
try a tesla
myself this is see if it fits you know
my personality yeah Ludacris mode sounds
great but again when you combine the
sound of an engine and just the rumble
shaken nuances of that it really makes
you connect it to a car if those who
drive manual know what I'm talking about
that's what I mean you just feel
connected to the car and I know manuals
are going away it is what it is but I
feel Tesla it's a great car can't a
sacar love the tech but I don't know I
just love the rawness of a old-school
car I guess our traditional car or
actually on today's car but has any
petrol guess let's see Dan Edmond dead
om Sai dan mm or Iman I'm sorry man do
you have any productivity tips for
others who work in their home and their
own time how did you stay focus when you
first started again is just a house on
the grind my focus and life and it's
always been like this I always have a
goal wherever it is it's usually I try
to game really high cuz there are times
when you fail but at least your is that
much higher than if you had your goals
that much lower but what keeps motivate
can be little lethargic just not feeling
it same thing with working out sometimes
you get those down days or like yo I'm
just not in the mood we'll keep looking
at that bigger picture and just note
every day you grind it just makes for a
better day tomorrow just know it every
time that you feel fatigued or you feel
exhausted you feel like you don't want
to work the days that you do work same
thing with working out that I've noticed
all the days that you make the most
games it's no different one the cush
it's kind of getting cliché now but it
rings so true when people are sleeping
you're up working when people are
napping I don't know crying harder when
people are on vacation 2x 3x 4x down and
just hustled that much harder and I
guarantee those are the times that
you'll make the most strides the most
gains the biggest performance increases
are doing during those moments when you
the most motivation when other people
left the most motivation so I would say
those are the times that I try to
convince myself and crank as hard as I
can let's see here Gideon gks you always
buy your review items isn't it expensive
yes it is expensive today and I think
another person had the same question to
a lot of people has the same question I
i still purchase a lot of the items that
you guys see in a channel and you
disclose it in the beginning of every
channel as well if I did purchase it or
did not 90 I was eight ninety ninety
percent in ninety-two percent of the
items that you guys see is items that I
do personally purchase and it doesn't
mean I'm rich or anything like that what
I do and I don't think is any secret
sauce or anything like that I I strive
to try to make the best videos that i
can with enough content and information
that would definitely help people
because when it does how people get
shared obviously and I try to make as
much money as I can back I do sell the
items eventually so that's why I for the
longest time you don't you don't see me
doing comparison videos now I'm starting
to do a little bit more of those and
those have been pretty decent but yeah I
just sell the items back as soon as i'm
done with the review to try to make as
much money back and over the length of
12 months i look at the analytics the
numbers i try to make sure our ensure
that i recoup the cost back and when you
guys see any one of my videos that makes
maybe 10,000 views you can you for sure
no i'm not making my money back the
phones i lose my money somewhat like the
note 7 even though i got i'm gonna send
me eight thousand views so far on it
it's a nine hundred dollar phone i'm not
i'm not making anywhere close to 900
bucks excuse me I'm Batphone so the
Notes app is actually to my right here
so let me show you slim shetty an
Instagram here and longtime viewer to be
answered you guys shout out to slim can
we expect a second channel and my name
is pronounced echo lake I've murdered
your name last time
I'm probably murdering it right now slim
I just call you Shetty that's all it is
man uh yes I am planning to make a
second channel and that will probably
coming pretty soon just to keep things
organized but the second channel be more
personalized background stuff Jim's
review but most likely exists for these
vlogs here so second channel will be
coming I decided to commit myself to
doing that just waiting for things to
die down a little bit create the banner
create the analytics create the account
all that fun stuff ok JW XE whatever
your name is have you ever thought of
expanding your teen so you can fire us
with more content more efficiently with
more variations and sponsors to afford
more expensive and higher end items
we're trying next year all right next
one mithun 4149 says what's your
favorite smart from the year there's
probably three more phones coming out
this year so i want to hold back a bit i
still love the LG v10 you guys see me
rocking a lot of samsung i love the LG
v10 because most likely has the IR
blaster that in love and then i use i
missed that for my samsung note for back
in the day ah let's see here Evan chain
any dream car for the future yes right
now I'm really digging the new audi r8
or the r10 you know both models are the
same Mick on the outside the Lambo Heric
on God mean those price is so expensive
by again it is a dream car it is really
nice um I don't know if that could be my
daily driver obvi I have seen some
youtubers for God's sakes use those
things every day I don't know how they
do it the repairs would be up the arse
I've always been fond of Austin Martin
watching a lot of reviews they really
just refined you know grand touring cars
sport oriented cars they're not super
cars but I've always for some reason
really really love Austin Martin's they
always seem timeless to me and they just
have some
sophistication that I really like so
we'll see so anyways that's it for this
video in this blog here i hope i
answered a lot of those questions for
you guys I know this video is probably
long right now it is ten o'clock so i
took about an hour answering questions i
probably condemned this down to maybe a
10 20 30 minute session who knows but
anyways guys I'll catch you guys on the
next one Fitbit charge review is coming
out next later at the end of this week
the 200,000 sub video is coming out
whenever that is but at the rate we're
moving man we're killing it alright guys
I taught you guys later and goodnight
