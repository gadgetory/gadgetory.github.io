welcome back to another video today
we're comparing the Bose qc3 5s with my
sony MDR 1000x again I'm folded here
both excellent active noise-cancelling
headphones I did personally pay for both
of these the boasting retails for 349
dollars and the Sony 1000x here that
retails for 399 what I'll do is I'll
leave my links in the video description
below click on my links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
add up both who ever go on sale they're
down to Toys for offering sales but I
have seen Sony headphones in general
they do drop the price from time to time
so again click on my link so you never
know when the price could have dropped
also in the comment section below I'm on
social media several of you guys
mentioned that in your particular
country the post QC 35 s were actually
more expensive than he sell the Sony
1000x which is crazy it's pretty because
of like import taxes and import fees but
in the comment section below let me know
what country you're from and how much
these headphones cost since we've got a
global audience on my channel here but
anyways let's get started here
constructionwise these have so much
confidence in just having the bend twist
no problems at all same thing with the
Sony's very durable construction both of
these headphones or diesel
I've been reducing on doing the stress
test on my channel the reason being is
because I just haven't had a pair of
headphones break on me these headphones
today are very very rock-solid all of
them are done very well but these two
headphones phenomenal quality headphones
the Bose qc3 5s are a bit lighter they
actually want the most comfortable
headphones that I have ever used here
these the sennheiser HD 598 SES and also
the bino h6 is those are wired
headphones but those do have phones most
comfortable ever that I've tested with
these Sony's they are still very
comfortable and I as a rule of thumb
here anything under 300 grams in weight
these specifically are under 300 grams
they are good for wearing for most
people here many people would not have
problems whatsoever but indeed if you're
comparing apples to apples here this is
slightly heavier then they boast QC 35
probably the reason being is because
there's much more exposed metal or metal
used in general on the top here you can
see the metal headband and the sides is
also metal and then the arms that are
holding the ear cups itself are also
made of metal
and of course there's some additional
features on these headphones that I'm
going to go over pretty shortly here but
overall this does feel beefier it does
feel more solid but because of that it
does provide a little bit more wearing
fatigue again comparing apples to apples
with the bose qc25 in long run if you
guys are looking for a long flight
entertainment many hours of wearing
straight the most QC 35 are the way to
go one other additional thing that I
want to mention now I think a lot of
people don't mention this the ear cups
on the bose qc25 it's actually recessed
or angled in because of that when you do
put these on the only thing that you
actually feel is the cushion on the ear
cups themselves around the ear with the
long part of the ear right here it
doesn't touch anything lose my ears
doesn't touch anything
with the Sony 1000 axis is actually
flush so when you put these on your ears
are actually touching either the side of
the cushion here or the felt lining on
the inside and because of that it does
warm up my ear a little bit more so
again these Sony's still very
comfortable when compared to a lot of
the other headphones on the market but
comparing to the Bose QC 35 the Bose
does feel a little bit more comfortable
I very much love wearing these for long
periods of time now regarding the
buttons here and how easy it is to use
Bose does have your very standard pause
play volume up and down voice controls
there's also NFC or near field
communication very easily to identify
Sony was a little bit harder it's much
more flush against the ear cup itself
there's little ridges or nubs here it's
for you to feel around
but again Bose was easier to identify
but with that being said Bose has very
straightforward features Sony and this
probably justifies why it's 50,000
premium over the boast there's awesome
features on here this thing called
ambient sound and I know these are
active noise-cancelling headphones but
let's say if you're walking through the
park or just walking through somewhere
that you might not feel ESIC here for
some reason and you want your to listen
to your headphones turn on ambient sound
the microphones picks up your
environment and pumps that audio into
your ear so you can
to your surroundings another awesome
feature is while you have music going
and active noise-cancelling is on you're
blocking out the world basically and
let's say someone comes up to you and
wants to speak with you or if you need
to hear something really quick take your
right hand place it over the right ear
cup active noise-cancelling turns off
your music pauses the microphones turns
on and you can hear your surroundings
once again as soon as you take your
hands off everything reverts back to
normal
music resumed active noise-cancelling
turns on and then it just performs as
normal so i love i absolutely really
love that feature it's very unique it
actually does come in handy without
taking your headphones off so again very
convenient both does come with the 3 1/2
millimeter chord for physical
connections both does come with a micro
USB cord for charging both does come
with an airplane adapter so you can have
your in-flight entertainment be used by
these headphones other that they both
fold and still very easily here both
headphones have the same exact mechanism
here for them to fold into your supplied
case now looking at these side-by-side
the footprint is almost the same here
both maybe has a slightly smaller
footprint but more importantly on the
sides when you do put it against each
other here and I know I have this
unzipped right now but these Sony's is
actually a little bit thicker it's a
little bit taller versus the bose qc25
case so if you want the absolute
thinnest profile smallest profile boast
is the way to go in addition there's a
little pocket on the back of the boast
case here on the inside there's another
pocket where you can stow additional
wires or paperwork whatever you need in
here for your convenience with its own
ease unfortunately there's only a POC on
the outside but there's no pocket on the
inside so both of these they offer 20
hours of performance I did test them
both they do offer around that time
range from a dead battery other that
active noise-cancelling performance in
general bose heads for the long time
been the king of canceling unwanted
noise sony in boats here i've been
trying to
take them on and off repeatedly at every
environment at every area that I was in
to test these headphones and I gotta say
it's so close I don't think the average
consumer can really tell it's not
something that you can just tell right
away I had to repeatedly do this test
time and time and time again but I have
to say the sony MDR 1000x does
outperform the active noise-cancelling
performance over the boats by a very
small fraction though but nonetheless it
still beats out the boat by a bit
they're just by a small bit there but
with that being said both of these now
are hands-down the best in active
noise-cancelling performance these two
headphones will block out most of the
noises in your environment if you guys
if you want the absolute best of course
go with Sony but if you go with boats
it's so close to the Sony's it's not a
it wouldn't justify which one you would
prefer to purchase to be honest with you
other that audio signature bow so
provides a very accurate very clean
sound it's lovely and at the base levels
the mids and the clarity up at the highs
is amazing with the Sony's there's a
little bit more bass the mid ranges are
also a little bit more emphasized and
then the high frequencies I wish there's
a little bit more clarity on the top
band it's missing a little bit there
just a little bit more detail that would
have been phenomenal but other than that
apples to apples these are still two
best performing at the noise cancelling
headphones on the market right now
if you chose either one I think you'd be
absolutely fine if you want the
high-tech features the active noise
canceling with ambient sound get the
sonís if you want a little bit more
bass get the Sony's I always say get the
boast if you want just absolute clarity
Fedele I would say go with the boast
they're they're both phenomenal
headphones I can't say that enough but
that that's about it hopefully this
comparison video helped you in some way
