j-bird run XTS there's some things that
they kept in some things they mildly
changed are the improvements worth
upgrading and how does it compete with
the competition as always being
transparent with my lovely audience here
what is up team James Revere was fired
modi's for you guys
j-bird did send this over for a review
but my assessment was not altered in any
way I'll be going over both pros and
cons the last this is priced at 179
dollars retail but I place my affiliate
links that in that video description
below click on those links for the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review and I'm here
to help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone the video
alright folks let's go over the physical
features first and see what those subtle
changes are first we receive a slightly
redesigned ear fin they're much more
curved or angled than before and when I
tested the original runs I was clear and
transparent with you guys and admitted
they kept falling out of my ear during
my jogging sessions most likely my ears
are a little bit weird but when I
compared them to all the other
competitors I reviewed so far on this
channel I've never had that issue and
sorry about the cringy faces in the
video here but this time around they
stay in perfectly fine and they do give
me confidence that they won't fall out
and I know I look a little bit weird in
the video right here but after testing
these shaking them vigorously they stay
in not to mention they look really damn
good black and black is killing it now
getting a closer look for those who are
unfamiliar with the j-bird runs there
are physical buttons for pairing turning
them on and off and such they're all
very responsive and very clicky now each
press is light enough so when you have
these in your ear you're not actually
like jamming these earphones into your
head here again very subtle clicks
awesome now most of the functionality
from the button presses are all there
although I do appreciate having Google
assistant in the left ear bud or Siri
that is at my fingertips
but what we don't have or all the
features available at the same time here
let me reach into my pants in them so
within the app you have to choose in the
settings other default controls or
alternative controls as you guys can see
here now if I choose default controls
you get Google assistance or Siri which
is awesome but you only have pause and
play you can't use that left earbud that
is over here to adjust your volume down
now same thing with your right ear but I
can pause and play but then I can't
adjust the volume up I have to switch
over to alternative controls and I know
what your blood is off right there but
what's up alternative controls
it's basically vice-versa I'll lose the
Google assistance or Siri and then it
lose the pause and play feature
unfortunately you have to pick and
choose now this was a nuisance to me the
less times honestly that I have to take
up my phone that is the better during a
workout especially during a run or
simply having the convenience of just
sitting at my desk right here and then
if I need to adjust volume again
don't want to whip out my phone you have
to again pick and choose I wish a bird
found a different way to do this now
since I'm still on the buttons here
the only other feature that I found
missing Jabra calls it here through
Sennheiser themselves calls it
transparency mode they're run XTS
basically doesn't include a feature like
those other competitors they don't
include a function that allows the
outside environment the noses around you
to be pumped in through the microphones
for safety or simply awareness so with
the run XTS these are 100% passive noise
isolation earphones which I do love
though and these do blackout a lot of
noise these barely sound leaked as well
but having the option for runners to
hear their environment raw listening to
music
would have been nice now I don't know if
you the consumer actually value this but
comment down below let me know let all
of us know if I'm just being picky here
but this is something runners actually
use I personally think I personally use
it again for safety reasons let me know
if this is a feature that you guys
desire yourself now the workaround and
actually a plus for most people you have
the ability to leave only one of these
earphones in your ear if you'd like with
other ear phones such as again the
Sennheiser Momentum's true Wireless
which I reviewed earlier this week you
can only leave the right earphone in if
you choose to leave only the left one in
like I do with the Jaybirds here and the
right earphone goes into your pocket or
so it's not going to work with the
j-bird run XTS you don't have that
problem I can't I can confirm that you
can either switch either/or and put the
other one in your pocket and you still
have a year to listen out you know for
what's going on around you now moving on
the second change that makes the XTS
better than the previous generation but
more importantly better than most of the
competitors is its ipx7 rating while
most competitors have an ingress rating
of around 4 or 5 many that they're only
splash-proof or maybe at most spray
proof the xt can be fully submerged in
water up to one meter for up to 30
minutes now I wouldn't recommend
swimming with these but these are now as
rugged as the draw bras which also have
an IP 7 rating as you see in the video I
had this in water as well and they're
still functioning fine today now it
would be cool though if these could
float in water too but again for most
people who are running along the street
or so baby bike
the woods you're probably not gonna drop
this into the lake now getting into
better life it's still decent for hours
and the earbuds themselves with another
eight hours from the charging case so
that's a total of 12 hours quick charge
is available with only five minutes in
the case and you can get up to an hour
of playback back if that makes sense not
pet at all
now I did run my battery test at 50% in
Vaughn to get in middle-of-the-road
result and I achieved four hours and 53
minutes which was very similar to the
first generation since I briefly
mentioned the case here's a closer look
they're not magnetized so once you put
these earphones in here be careful
because they could drop out now rotating
to the back they still stuck a USB 2.0
connection for some reason we're heading
into 2019 and in my humble opinion I
think a lot of consumers should be
investing to USB type-c since that's the
next Universal ports most likely it is
touching base on bluetooth performance
now oddly we're still at also Bluetooth
4.1 although Bluetooth 5.0 has been out
for a while and older technology but
let's see what my testing showed with
signal strength I'm able to achieve 82
linear feet of range with one wall in
between and that's really good for an
older Bluetooth technology testing this
with video Android first I have a
Samsung S A+ but I did have any video
syncing issues with Netflix or YouTube
that's a huge plus twitch on the other
hand had horrible delays and I'm aware
these are dedicated support earphones
but my viewers do watch the video with
sport earphones to a testing this for
those with iPhones Netflix was slightly
off youtube and twitch was horribly off
sync I also never had issues with the
right or left ear but cutting out and
not playing as well the last feature I
wanted to talk about before discussing
audio is a phone call performance my
voice is audible and at the forefront
which is great news but like most other
earphones they do pick up a good bit of
environmental noises so getting into the
audio performance I really love the
chambered sound signature not because
it's the most accurate if anything is
the furthest from being accurate but
it's loud it's
in your face it's great for pop EDM
hip-hop genres that I personally listen
to you for those looking for balance or
accuracy these are not really it's but
if you're looking for more of an alive
sound signature that's what the j-bert
run X T's are for starting with bass
these are surely bass boosted earphones
it's fast thumping bass with some
residents here it's not deep
thunderous bass but more than plenty for
the after mention generous I would
caution though the mid-range is clear
enough for most there is though an ever
so slight amount of bass spilling over
that prevents the mid-range from shining
a bit further but we can address some of
this in the app which I'll show you
shortly
after testing a good bit of truly
wireless earphones over the years I do
notice the Jaybirds not having an
expansive or having a wide soundstage
the run X days have excellent left and
right audio separation but that spacial
miss is not there it doesn't take away
from the music but a wide soundstage
always helps with the experience now the
high frequencies are not screeching or
over piercing but could use a bit more
resolution or detail overall and to
reiterate though the jaybird run XTS
these pair of earphones are very
colourful in a sense and many average
consumers will really really enjoy them
if I can give you an analogy let's say
The Avengers movie infinity war or
endgame nearly all the background is on
a green screen but the visual artists
tweets it to be visually appealing they
put in all that filler and stuff in this
case j-bert engineer's tweak the audio
to what most average consumers like
hopefully you guys understood that
analogy there but let's get into the app
here let me not whip it out but without
the phone that is right on the dashboard
you have several presets right on the
home screen now hands down go to the
equalizer this is where you can adjust
all your settings it's very intuitive
and very easy to use making an
adjustment does not ruin the audio what
I personally like is more for vocals
more forward mids a little bit brighter
right here so what I do is I just this
up slightly to achieve my personal sound
signature if you guys been farming for
these years I
like a slightly brighter sound
signatures I should I usually leave it
right around here I think there we go
the j-bird app now on the base level I
do enjoy the base I just leave it
exactly where it is but right here is
where it's at so next up here is the
settings and define my bud option I love
this feature not many competitors offer
this but you're able to find your last
location of where you last left your
earphones now it's not 100% precise but
it's a pretty good indication hopefully
with it's showing where you are it will
show you or it will remind you on where
you last left the every button that you
can go back to the area and look for
them and like I said most other
competitors don't even offer this so
overall in my personal opinion if you
only previous jaybird runs and you don't
need the waterproofing I would say don't
upgrade now for these XTS despite not
being the most technologically advanced
sport earphones for those who don't
currently own the original runs or at
least had trouble with the original runs
had trouble with them staying in your
ears I think the XTS are executing at a
very very good level we're talk about
battery life or tumble comfort and fit
now and we're talking about the IP seven
rating not only that but a sound
signature now the negatives such as the
button functionality or lack of button
functionality the lack of transparency
mode video playback is somewhat shot
there you can say an USB 2.0 and the
case it's one of those things where if
you don't care for it or if you don't
need it for video you don't care about
the USB 2.0 and such the Jaybirds are
still an excellent choice for the price
the only other competitor that has an IP
7 rating that's a completely mainstream
here is the Jabra elite sport that does
come with some extra features all the
button functionalities no USB type-c
though if I recall but keep in mind
those do retail for 219 dollars it's a
little bit more expensive if you're in
the 150 to 180 dollar price range
the jaybird run XTS could be a very very
good option for you I'd say definitely
check it out at least definitely check
out the audio signature that they
provide all right folks like subscribe
and fire mochi that comment session I'll
catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
