wireless earphones were gonna be a main
focus this year but Bose
Sony and Jaybirds in the past several
months have released theirs and also in
the past I've tested the jarba support
elites and also the Apple earpods now as
for the Samsung icon acts 2018 Edition I
know you guys have been asking about
that those are coming soon to the
channel so be sure to subscribe to get
notified well Megan Thompson also
released their own with the Bo play e8
as always being transparent with you
guys I personally pay for these at the
very expensive retail price of $300 but
testing the Vino h6 headphones and the
a1 bluetooth speaker in the past they've
been amazing products we'll see how this
one goes and see if the price is
justified as always I'll place my
affiliate links down in that video
description below click those links for
the most updated prices in real time you
never know when these things like the
one sale so without further ado I'm
Jimmy with Jim's review room I'm here to
help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review Bang
&amp;amp; Olufsen has always made some very nice
products offering understated elegance
in my personal opinion the model that
you see on screen is called charcoal
sand well there's a more stealthy option
coming in black now they're made of
mostly plastic which works perfectly
fine but having more metal to the touch
or even a rubberized coating to give it
a bit more texture would have been nice
neither or I haven't been picking here
these are quality built now B no claims
these are sweat and water resistance and
with my testing risking my $300
earphones obviously don't try this at
home
i drench them and they're still working
perfectly fine today touching base on
comfort and physical performance for ear
tips are included plus one set of comply
foam which works great if you want
something a little bit more foam fitting
or form-fitting that foam fitting that
is but keep in mind these are in ear
earphones versus many of the competitors
which sits somewhat in ear now resulting
in less passive noise isolation now one
of the biggest praises for the e eights
they black out most of your outside
environmental noises because it's
completely sealed in there they are very
comfortable to wear as you can see they
don't have air fans or ear wings for
stability but they do stay in the ear
very well also if you notice the Yeates
might possibly have the lowest profile
when wearing here and they don't stick
out and look our can turn like the bose
sound support fries that I just recently
reviewed now moving on to the controls
there are touch sensitive surfaces which
very intuitive I'm both earpieces a nice
alternative to the physical button that
sometimes you have to press into your
head to activate sometimes now a single
tap pauses and plays your music as well
as answer and end phone calls now if I'm
is increased by tapping and holding the
right earphone
while holding the left side decreases it
now I'll have a fullness and other side
of my head here for your reference but
the only feature that is not here
basically and I wish every company would
have this our voice prompts the e8
verbally doesn't tell me what my battery
life is which device I'm paired to and
besides a quick audio beef having a
voice prompt to indicate if I'm in
pairing mode or not would streamline my
use now it's not a reason to not buy
these but paying three hundred dollars
those features would have been nice but
getting back to the earphones I
mentioned these are able to take phone
calls and you do get some background
noise for cars driving by and footsteps
being horrible like other ear phones but
the voice on the other end came in super
clear here and my voice for the
recipients on the other end was good
enough and I know how to pretend crystal
clear but it's very much usable also
during phone calls the eh turns on the
external microphones and pumps your
surrounding audio ambient noise here
into your ears so it eliminates all of
the passive noise isolation for safety
that's a pretty cool feature now moving
on to the case it is small and when you
first open the retail package it's gonna
smell like a shoe store or some high-end
leather boots so make sure you take a
whiff here but also yours this a case
very premium leather soft and supple and
when you open it they do hold the ear
buds with magnets which holds perfectly
fine the case itself is able to charge
your earphones two additional times
essentially holding an additional eight
hours of battery life and you can check
how many additional charge cycles you
have with the two LED lights on the rear
pretty convenient
now speaking of better life veno claims
at four hours of playtime in my testing
playing audio at 50% from full to bed I
managed to get four hours in 25 minutes
there's also quick charging which helps
for men
sleep with 20 minutes on the charger
providing you an additional hour worth
of playback no touching based on
Bluetooth performance the e8r equivalent
bluetooth 4.2 testing them in the office
with my iPhone 10 and having them go
through two walls average 61 linear feet
before the audio started to crackle and
that's great for what we have today
once it's paired the e aids does have a
connection that's very stable for normal
everyday use I never had an issue and
all right last before I talk about the
audio performance the one unique feature
that be you know incorporated is
transparency mode the microphone kicks
on and you're able to select one or
three levels to hear your environment
with the left ear bub you can tap and
turn it on or off but unfortunately you
can't cycle through each option though
you have to do so within the bill play
app now with transparency mode activated
it's perfect for runners are those
walking during their commute and wanting
to hear their environments again for
safety again these provide excellent
passive noise isolation if you want to
eliminate that you have the option to do
so so right folks to the moment you've
been waiting for the audio test the e
aids do get loud here I'm constantly
fighting myself listening comfortably
but loud s 60 to 70 percent vine bass
wise they sound slightly bassy but tends
to lean and the more accurate sound
signature rather than truly being bass
boosted now if I were to compare its
Emily to the Bose sound support freeze
and the job or support elites both
absolutely truly wireless earphones it's
not bass books it's sounding like a
jaybird runs but it's a bit more of a
true fine performance compared to a
jaybird recent release if you're a bass
head I will look into those but the eh
is surely enough for most people now in
the mid ranges there is a balance that
equally and accurately portrays both the
instruments and the vocals focus are
surely not recessed but it does stand
front and center without being bright
now same with instruments and it's
imaging it stands out but at a pleasing
and neutral level they aren't colourful
but as a positively to do sound accurate
and well pronounced when you're
listening to high-quality audio files as
for the high notes music that's a bit
more mellow doesn't have a lot of attack
or is very fast per se sounded
absolutely fine the it does absolutely
well in that regards now when listening
to the opposite where there's tons of
synthesized high frequencies a lot of
the upper frequencies are just going on
it just sounds really cluttered you lose
a lot of resolution and detail it gets
slightly jumbled in at times not
necessarily ear piercing but can be
sharp at times on those fast attacking
songs the high frequencies do overpower
or overshadow the mid frequencies just
by a smidge taking away from the
experience a slight bit that is now as
for soundstage the EAS perform better
than average it's not the best but you
do get some depth and truly clear left
and right audio separation although it
does better than half the market and
competitors out there and wasn't as
strong or close to say the Bose sound
sport freeze or the shape or runs now
Pino does offer the vo play app and
offers a simplified tutor called tongue
touch Odin gets you warm made the autumn
muffled and didn't really increase bass
to my liking increasing excited or
bright slightly did help improve the
audio to be a bit more pronounced but
other that the app didn't offer much
more besides better level indication and
adjusting the transparency the tone of
transparency settings which we discussed
a little bit earlier and most will be
fine having it and stock but the option
to adjust is there now last but not
least video delay has been a big topic
and truly wireless earphones lately
tested ee8 with netflix there's a
fractional delay very minimal but on
youtube you can see lips moving first
before you hear the audio this was also
the same on the sony WF 1000x and the
bose sound support freeze that I've
recently tested in the channel now they
don't stick out my ear like crazy here
which I absolutely am appreciative of
they have decent better life and they
stick inside your ear comfortably as
well that might justify its price tag
but the audio was not the best but it's
on the very good side of things when
listening to other truly wireless
earphones that I have at the office so
folks please let me know in the comment
