review room welcome back to another
review
cheer oh the makers of this product
reached out to me to do a review on
their power bank a device that stores
power to charge your phones or tablets
on the go perfect when you need just a
bit of juice or when you're in an
emergency and your device is almost dead
now I don't know about you but I asked
all my friends and everyone said they've
seen this face before but didn't know
who it was or where it's from well the
company cheero from Japan licensed this
very poplar cartoon comic character
danbo also known as dan bored in some
areas from the manga yet Suba and I'm
sorry if I pronounced that incorrectly
but he's been known around the internet
for these cutesy images of him and his
little adventures and again he's crazy
popular in Japan from what I've heard
and not to mention kyo states it's the
number one selling power bank in Japan
right now so these guys are actually the
real deal so without further ado we'll
get started
the version I have here is the mini
coming with 6000 milliamps of power
there's also a bigger one with a little
over 10,000 mill amps and both can be
found on amazon.com now the many that
cheer provided features two USB ports
one with one amp of power output and the
other 2.1 amps which is reserved for
more heavy-duty items like tablets now
on the other side of the Tarot is a
micro USB input used to charge the
device with the supplied USB cable and
you can connect this to your computer to
charge or you can use in an existing
cell phone wall outlet adapter per the
instructions and on the very front here
features Dan Bo's face where his eyes
glows to indicate battery levels now for
my test I was able to charge the chera
from a dead state to at least 50% in two
hours so I would roughly assume four
hours in total to have this unit fully
charged and for my testing basically
using my ipad 3 again from a dead state
to 40% into the churro started flashing
his red eyes here indicating the churro
is near empty this had taken the iPad 2
hours and 40 minutes to drain ichiro of
its news and keep in mind the iPad 3 has
a 11,000 560 milliamp battery and you
can look up your own device online to
see what yours is as well and at 0 I
have here is a 6000 million battery so
of course it wouldn't fully charge the
tablet but for phones there should be no
problem at all and keep in mind I treat
power banks as an emergency alternative
I don't use them to fully charge the
device but to give me enough juice to
get me going again so overall this
product is handy especially for those
who are on the road or working off-site
away from a wall outlet away from your
car or if you need to charge the device
let's say in your bag while you're
catching the train would be the most
perfect example I can give you but the
other huge selling point over the other
power banks is again it slicing that it
has with this cartoon character so
concluding this video sure was nice
enough to offer the danboard action
figure to give away now these items are
again popular very popular that is in
Japan and Shiro is nice enough to offer
one here so be sure to visit their
website churro net and or check out
their products on amazon.com now to
answer this giveaway it's similar to my
previous giveaways number one like and
subscribe to my channel
Jem's review room number two like and
follow me on either Facebook Google+ or

address of course and last you can put
anything on there afterwards any kind of
