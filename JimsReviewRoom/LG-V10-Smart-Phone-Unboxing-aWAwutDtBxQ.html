room now it won't take less than a
minute here
yesterday I did do a LG v10 unboxing it
was on site while I was reviewing
another product and I just had the phone
in my bag and I just want to do it
really quick recording for you guys but
I did take a look at the video last
night I noticed that there were some
blurry issues a lot of people are asking
me to film in the black room here and I
don't know I just felt like it didn't
have enough meat so I'm gonna redo the
video I did delete the old one already
and hopefully with this one here you
guys will have more meat a little bit
better quality and of course the room
that you guys been asking for the table
the black room thanks alright folks I
present to you the v10 from LG now this
should be hitting markets at the end of
October of 2015 so be on the lookout for
that this is the international version
that LG did send me and let's take a
look in here there is some international
parts here I'll show you pretty shortly
here but beautiful display beautiful
packaging here on the left side is all
your accessories as I mentioned earlier
this is the international version so
this wall adapter is normally for Asia
and for Europe as well so this does not
fit into the US walls here but of course
I can always get an adapter or basically
use my own charger as well but this is a
fast charging fast charging wall adapter
it does come with the USB cable and let
me check here hopefully this is a USB
type-c USB 3.0 of something but
unfortunately it is not it is though USB
2.0 hoping for something faster just for
those video transfers I do a lot of
video recording on my note 4 and it
still uses the USB 2.0 standard it is
slow as heck when you transferring files
but on here we got the quad beat 3 tune
by AKG some earbuds in here let me take
a look
wow look at that gorgeous
just a really really nice looking pair
of earphones here let me just unravel
this
these are tangle free cords as you can
see I just pulled them basically apart
above the Y split here let me show you
the cord here so above the Y split it's
still plastic or silicone or whatnot
pretty standard into earphones but below
that it's a braided cord feels really
durable really nice in the hands really
different unique pretty original I don't
see too many earphones earbuds that are
like this is really really cool but if
you guys are into details look at that
matches the phone the cord is white
though and then you have the gold three
half millimeter plug but the phone
itself it is beige and gold itself so
but it's no matches still looks very
very good here let me go back up above
the Y splits and we'll look at the
microphone and also the volume controls
here but look at that gorgeous on the
back of course that little dot is your
microphone very smooth finish but the
volume buttons up and down of course the
action button right here it is brushed
aluminum or brushed steel the at least
that's what the texture looks like so
very fine details like that just gives
it a little bit of more of a nice
aesthetic look there for you guys but
going to the earbuds themselves not
perfectly round let me show you guys
real quick here look at that it's like a
little cut right there that just gives
it a little bit of personality this side
too and look at that that looks classy
holy cow there you go brushed aluminum
as well and the are that brushed steel
brushed texture on top I don't want to
say that these are aluminum or not since
I don't want to state anything
incorrectly here but these are angled
tips as you can see and in the package
it does give you an extra set as well
which I have somewhere laying around
extra set of earbuds ear tips just in
case and there you go so I'll definitely
test those out a little bit later those
look really promising in the package
here so in here battery one of the last
few phones in this world
has a removable battery 3000 milliamp
and let's take the phone out real quick
here let's see what this what this
beauty looks like look at that huge
massive screen now this is a 5.7 inch
screen it does feature a dual screen and
it's just this little tab up here which
I'll show you pretty shortly once I turn
on the phone but let's install the
battery real quick here and see how
everything feels back snaps off real
easily right out the USB port slide this
in real quick here if you guys look
right here there is a dual slot it's a
four your SIM card and your micro SD
card as well let's snap this back on
simple and easy so regarding the backing
here since I'm already on here right now
it is a textured back
LG's website did say that this is some
kind of a synthetic back to help of
course reinforce and absorb shock and
abrasions and whatnot so it's it's weird
it's like kind of soft but it's also
hard at the same time it is a plastic
backing right here not big on it it's
really textured let me see if I can zoom
in for you guys it has really scratchy
surface just to give it some texture and
some grip as well I don't I know this is
subjective I'm not too big on it to be
honest with you but other than that
everything else about this so far just
from first impressions looks really
really good and aside of course your
gold trim but this is stainless steel
this is not aluminum the whole frame
from what LG claims has been reinforced
for durability on the back here 16
megapixel camera flash of course you
have your volume up and down your power
button but now unlike the g4 this does
have a fingerprint scanner as well so
that's really cool on the bottom here
let's take a look here we're at it this
way 3.5 millimeter input for your
headphones USB 2.0 again I was wishing
for USB 3.0 or USB type-c since that's
the latest and greatest I'm moving into
the future
I'm sure that's your microphone and your
speakerphone is now located here
I'm a g4 I believe it was actually
located on the back on the top here snap
that back together
looks like more microphones this one's a
little bit flush actually it's not
hollow or drilled in this could be an
or blaster I don't know I'll
double-check on that on the front let me
zoom in for you guys there is dual
cameras which I'll demonstrate shortly
and just peel this back off for you guys
and let me just turn this on while I got
this here and there would be a little
screen it's called basically a UH a dual
screen mode that LG is presenting and
this is holy cow beautiful I mean it's a
nice size let me see if I got my note 4
on me real quick here just for
comparative purposes with wise it looks
the same it is a little bit taller you
can put it side-by-side real quick here
for you guys a little bit taller
see how it sticks out a little bit but
width wise it's practically about the
same but let's see what this screen
looks like so that's what it looks like
it was always like a Samsung phone to me
but less bloated software I guess look
at that but let me just show you the
dual screen real quick here that's one
of the biggest features that LG is
really promoting so it's just a little
small band up top that you can swipe
across you have some apps recent apps
you have quick apps basically can setup
app that you want to access quickly
phone you have the calculator I think
that's one keeper right there and you
can have media control you can input
your contacts so kind of similar to the
Samsung Galaxy I believe it's the s6
edge and the s6 edge+ on the side you
can have your quick select apps and also
contacts as well but this is just
located on top here and that's about it
and has what they call your signature
you can just put your name on there on
the top right so at night when the
screens off it does display your dates
time and your basically your battery
indicator right there for you guys and
you can still rotate for quick select
options flashlights of course let me see
there you go and turn off the screen
real quick here
let's go back here what else we got vol
Wi-Fi settings a quick quick camera
select and you're basically back to the
date and time again so you know an
additional feature handy for those quick
select moments again it does remind me
it does remind me of the s6 edge with
those features on the side so I'm gonna
show you guys what the dual camera does
or what it looks like go into camera
mode and very fast a lot up as you can
see go into mode and of course there's
time-lapse slo-mo and I wonder how many
frames per second wonder if it's gonna
tell me here doesn't state unfortunately
alright let me get back out here
I was hoping 240 frames per seconds
probably hundred and twenty to be honest
with you panorama multi view here goes
the dual cameras let's get out of that
and there you go and here goes dual
camera mode basically right now like I
said I haven't played around with this
so too much but there's one that shows
me kind of far away one that's a little
bit closer and you can swipe here and
basically change to different cams at
the rear camera as well there you go so
three cameras all at once and you can
change the orientation or configuration
you need to have two one on top one on
the bottom let's see and you can swipe
to get different camera angles and
whatnot so that's about it for dual
camera like you said I'll go over all
that in the review but other than that
5.7 inch display 2560 by 1440 gorgeous
display nice big size phone glad that LG
has gone this route here with another
flagship phone I'll put the specs on the
screen real quick here for you guys over
here and that way you guys can pause the
screen if you guys need to so I said
I'll give it the run through see what
it's all about and hopefully look out
for my review coming up shortly

little bit better than the last one all
