their Bluetooth speaker line-up I had
just reviewed their mid tier model the
SRS X 55 but today we're reviewing the
cheaper alternative the X 33 now it's a
smaller much more portable units and of
course we'll look into the build
construction and as importantly sound
quality as well now I'm personally paid
one hundred and twenty nine dollars at
the time this video make it this
comparable with other models on the
market now as always visit my website
for reviews on other Bluetooth speakers
and of course other consumer products as
well
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room comm
and I'm here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review starting with a physical overview
this is a very much portable unit it
measures seven point three inches wide
2.3 inches tall and 2.4 inches deep now
weight wise it's not too heavy but it
does have a feeling of being a very
solid build coming in at 1 pound and 8
ounces now overall the physical build
consists of a very solid girl on both
the front and the back here with
absolutely no flexing or bending here
when I applied very firm pressure and on
the top and the sides features this very
grippy yet smooth silicone texture now
this does accumulate dust and brushing
it off with your hands does not do the
trick but a microfiber towel has this
looking new
once again now on the top features all
of your traditional buzzes like power
and volume additional features include a
speakerphone option to use for incoming
and outgoing phone calls now during my
testing the other party did hear me
clearly at close distances but at 6 feet
and beyond they did notice I was much
further away now when they spoke they
could hear static and their own voice
feedback now if I lowered the volume on
my speaker here they heard their own
voices and the static much less but it
somewhat lowers the volume on the
speakerphone too low on my end and it
really reduces the benefit of basically
speaking across the room but further
here to the left clear audio plasma
makes it return which switches the audio
characteristics to enhance bass and
clarity but I'll demonstrate that in
these sound tests later
to the furthest of the left here NFC is
also available in the far left helping
you connect with Android NFC enabled
phones with just a tap here instead of
going through your Bluetooth menu every
time now rotating to the rear it's
pretty straightforward with a microUSB
port for charging your device and a 3.5
millimeter jack for physically
connecting your devices instead of using
the wireless and Bluetooth connection
and Sony does provide a wall adapter but
a USB cable directly to your computer
let's say a laptop or so charges the
speaker as well while using that
three-and-a-half millimeter audio cable
and that's sold separately here at the
same time provides much better sound
than what comes out stuck of your PC or
laptop now regarding better life sony
claims up to 12 hours of use for this
new unit but for mine standard testing
here living this on with a 50% volume so
that way we both have a even standard
base to judge and engage here I was able
to achieve 7 hours and 30 minutes a bit
odd and I did confirm this three times
now this would die around a seven and a
half hour mark every time at 50% volume
but now regard the technology that you
cannot see here normally with Bluetooth
connections audio files are compressed
with wireless transmission you do lose a
little bit of audio quality however with
today's Bluetooth there's enhanced
codecs like AAC or apdex that ensures
the wireless transmission retains its
quality either equivalent or better than
mp3 or equal to CD quality respectively
however we haven't seen a codec really
for the high resolution audio files now
think flat files that is lossless audio
Sony provides all deck which is Sony's
developed technology here to ensure high
resolution audio is transmitted via
bluetooth so that's a feature we see
even on this model here which a budget
brainer budget priced the ex 33 but to
be honest for the average consumer if
you're not purposely using high bitrate
lossless audio from the get-go or you
normally just stream music from Pandora
or I Heart Radio you're just watching
YouTube those files are nowhere close to
the high resolution audio standard
anyways so the L deck really becomes a
marketing term rather than what an
average consumer may use so just the tip
or a heads up on that but let's get into
the audio test real quick here I'll play
several songs and then I'll give you my
verdict
two words here's Tori Kelly with her
version of JT's suit and tie imma leave
it up for tonight and you got fixed up
to the nines nothing like an Y and I'm
dressed in the dress you love is swing
it in the Etzel so you cuz I got it like
that flow so smooth like I got it on tap
yeah and I'm a shake it be a good night
while I'm on my gangland while I'm
drinking Bud Light ah can you get it
when you miss me like I'm wit whiskey
drink hey baby do you do would do it
that way do you do that did you take a
break you know that I'm released when I
kill it on the beach like a sex on the
beach like it's Malibu chase you should
the California way we do with you
californica like we own an oyster yeah
all the flowers didn't make sure I put
it down like this 24/7
you
and there you have it folks now as a
disclaimer in every audio test that I do
audio recorded on my end and then played
through your speakers are not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence my
review here starting with bass for a
small Bluetooth speaker it's actually
good for most John Rah's voices has
depth beats in EDM and pop music or
pronounced and not recessed or to
muffled either now genres not dominating
synthesized bass like rock and classical
music does do well for a small bluetooth
speaker now bass demanding genres and
artists like Nicki Minaj does okay it
doesn't hit sub bass very deep though
but that's typical of most small
bluetooth speakers unless you probably
go with the beats pill for example but I
felt if you're listening to rap it's
more of casual listening you can say
then really getting deep into that music
again for a small bluetooth speaker it
does very well only at maximum volume we
do hear a very minor bit of distortion
though button that regarding voices they
stand out and are slightly forward and I
like this as it does offer clear vocals
sharper notes and when listening to
radio or movies it does make those
generous span out pretty well the sound
field surprisingly isn't too monotone or
censored either now there's not much
audio separation like most other
Bluetooth speakers but from the front to
back here I can hear the bass in the
back and it sounds like mid tones are
pushed forward it's not a bright sound
but enough to take notice and appreciate
now regarding high tones it's not ear
ringing in that tinging that can tell
through all the Jenners that I tried now
the highs for a small bluetooth speaker
holds tight and rarely loses its quality
the very top with the asses on very few
songs here normally found that
high-pitched vocals with very fast beats
you'll hear some distortion now this
song is somewhat old now but if you
listen to sexy check here from David
Guetta featuring Akon you hear some of
that minor distortion at the very top
end so for the X 33 here it does for
sure fill up small bedrooms and also
bathrooms as well with no questions
medium-sized rooms like master bedrooms
or let's say son rooms again did
perfectly fine for large rooms like open
floor plans or say your two-car garage
it does great for personal listening but
if you are entertaining even at full
volume you can still speak and
here are the people's conversations
perfectly fine it does project across
large areas but it won't fill a room you
can say again during entertainment and
if you have seen my other review of the
Sony X 55 of what I'm saying here sounds
very similar to the more expensive
speaker and it's accurate this small X
33 might be very well enough for you at
50% by shockingly the cheaper X 33 is
louder but at 100% volume the X 55 then
does push more sound now is that a
dramatic difference not really at all
but compared to other Bluetooth speakers
on the market the Sony X 33 I believe
here is a great speaker for its price
design and sound quality again for a
small Bluetooth speaker now which the
battery life was closer to the claimed
amount but the sound quality does
overshadow that some of the battery
downfalls I believe if anyone's looking
for a small bluetooth speaker I would
personally recommend this so if you can
to help support what I do stop by and
take a look at Jim's Ruby room comm for
more content and other reviews that I
don't put on YouTube and add me on to
Facebook Twitter Instagram or Google+
and you get to see something behind the
scenes info and you can always stop by
and say hi again I'm Jimmy with Jim's
review room comm you guys take care and
I've seen the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
