doing good today's the 20th of August
it's a beautiful Monday morning trying
to get my day started early here Sun is
beaming on my face here it feels good
not too hot out to do a polar loop to
run and to finish up the data on that
and do a little bit of filming got the
camera in the back of course and got
another package for you guys I don't
know we'll just be a thing I'm gonna be
doing under vlogs who knows but let me
set the camera down real quick alright
so instead of holding the camera while
I'm driving which is very dangerous I
decided if I'm gonna do more vlogs which
I'm gonna try to do I got this mount
here let's see show you guys real quick
there's $10 on Amazon there you go just
open up this package right now for you
guys hopefully it will help with the
with the camera shake and just I have a
better viewing angle than having you
guys in the cupholder right now
super-duper suction cup it's supposedly
claims to have and it says it's wide
enough for a note 4 and an iphone 6s so
again $10 on Amazon I'll give it a run
like so I'm not doing a review and this
is it really just really basic personal
use I'll put the link in description
below just in case if you were curious
and we give this a shot
I knew it I did forget something
I forgot the freaking the heart rate
chest strap to go along with the
freaking loop - damn it gotta get back
alright got it
man it makes me wonder people got day
jobs they have a mortgage to pay
Monday afternoon oh you know what maybe
they're just bloggers all of them are
just bloggers I just don't know that
your tube name that's all it is all
right all seriousness here it's question
time
so last video last vlog the first vlog
ever I guess you can say you guys
submitted questions I told you guys ask
me anything help you guys did and I want
you guys to do the same thing again this
video leave your questions down below
and I'll answer them I made mexico√≠s
hopefully next week so let's get
straight into it here apologize in
advance if I ruin your name here I'm not
good with names
alright this is a me Tech what editing
software do you use I use Adobe Premiere
Pro CC that's something that I started
with extremely difficult to get a hang
of in the beginning it's a steep
learning curve but after a while you do
get a hang of it I didn't go to Sony
Vegas or any other program just because
I got eventually accustomed to this
custom to Adobe I didn't want to watch
up to be honest with you a national one
is the Wiis roubles what is your goal
for this channel man just keep on truck
trucking along a list products and a
quality reviews of course getting a
little bit more personal trying to be
with the with the videos and whatnot
just to have a human element behind it
it's just something personally I want to
do the channel is doing perfectly fine
it's doing very well just excuse me just
on the reviews by itself but I don't
just want to add it a little a little
something extra if you guys enjoy it
that's that's right then if the views
are good you know I'll continue doing it
if not I'll see you next question here
ex leash Shetty
PACA leash I'm sorry man have you
considered tech news no it just takes
too long
and then last one here Sandra
Oriana Orion do I feel awkward filming
in public to be honest I did you know I
can't lie I mean I feel you know shy
nervous that's why I don't blog in
general I don't know what to say but at
the same time holding the camera up you
know and there's people around you
sometimes especially you know in the
shopping centers and whatnot
I got a tune them out that's all I got
to do when I'm actually doing my actual
reviews and that vlogging when I'm
holding this big camera and walking
around with it and then planning in the
middle of nowhere and people are you
know people do look and people do stare
you know once in a while I just have to
tune them out and I have literally
tunnel vision towards that camera and
towards you know whatever I'm trying to
showcase so that's that's one way you
can do it and just something you gotta
overcome just to get the shots
I can't keep I guess I don't know try to
give you guys a variety besides that
black tape all the time
although I really do like and it looks
damn good all right well that's
literally all the questions from the
last review I think Ali said I got to
get back to doing this here and again
leave more questions down below and I'll
try to answer more of them next time
hope you guys enjoy this so far here's
the rest of the video jim's review room
is back to reviewing games again at
least for the season until the christmas
season is over and we'll take you know
then i'll see what happens after that
but when's the Best Buy got me this here
had the original one for a while and for
some reason it broke but uh just used to
use an elgato and they make some good
stuff hopefully there's one last longer
so I got me one of these and of course
got me one of these too so can't wait to
get home try this real quick here and
that's about it
gotta love your job man
doesn't feel like a job after all tell
you what I'm gonna end this video here
I'm gonna see in the next video remember
write down your questions down below in
the comment section shoot up a like if
