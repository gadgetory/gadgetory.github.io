broom beads last week released the
replacement to the pill 2.0 claiming to
offer better dynamic range and
definition to the sound characteristics
there's improved better life and a few
more features that I'll go over as well
now pricing wise this is an e very high
upper end for mid-sized Bluetooth
speakers even more so than they both
sound like mini two from both and that
is considered as a premium product now I
personally paid two hundred and twenty
nine dollars retail for this and if you
want to check today's updated pricing I
place a link in the video description
below and that leads to what Amazon is
offering today so without further ado
add me on to Facebook Twitter or
Instagram and if you haven't already
subscribed to my channel I'm here to
help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's
review room the pill plus does get a bit
bigger than the older model and
considering beats didn't disclose the
weight on their website I was kind of
surprised how beefy it feels when I pick
it up for the first time compared to the
older model and other mid-sized
bluetooth speakers out there this is
somewhat on the heavier side and you
will notice it once you put it in your
bag however though it's still very much
portable and easy to manage the front
and rear still features the very durable
grill practically indestructible but new
surrounding the width of the speaker is
a grippy silicon like texture perfect
for having to stay on your table and
make this easy to grab going over the
top here on and off with a five light
remaining battery indicator in the
middle is the beats logo that does light
up and it's actually a button which
allows you to control your music pause
play skip tracks and even answer phone
calls and to the right are your vibe up
and down buttons now rotating to the
rear and covered by a flap that pill
plus offers a charge out port enabling
you to charge any device with a USB
cable and if you ever need to charge
your phone and just give it a little bit
of juice next is a 3.5 millimeter port
to physically connect your device
instead of going Wireless and last
familiar to Apple users a lightning port
is used to charge the speaker I
personally would have preferred a micro
USB connection instead since I have
phone chargers and micro USB cables
laying all around the house as I'm sure
as you do as well so if you're going
anywhere
remember you have to bring your
lightning cable and speaking of
batteries beats claim
up to 12 hours of use and from my
standard test that I do on most of my
Bluetooth speakers leaving this at 50%
volume to have a median number to
compare I play this the entire day in
the pill Plus that in 13 hours and nine
minutes a very much improved test over
last year's model
now recharging wise from a dead battery
until full this did take three hours to
do another feature that makes it come
back is the ability to pair another pill
plus so two speakers can play at the
same time offering more room filling
music a bigger perk I thing if you do
have two of these again you can have
separate audio channels one left and one
for the right basically stereo
separation at the time this video you
can only pair the pill pluses via the
app for both Apple and Android platforms
and just real quick regarding the app
it's really basic with options just to
pair those speakers as I just mentioned
rename your speaker to your desired name
and independent volume control and
that's basically it there's no built-in
equalizer and no built-in sound boosting
features and let's before I go into my
sound test I know there's no such thing
as a Bluetooth speaker that has every
feature in the market but one thing that
I did notice that beats did remove is
NFC Near Field Communication is what it
stands for allows for NFC enabled
devices and phones to just tap on the
side of the speaker and pair your device
immediately it's very convenient and I
believe it's underrated that's no longer
here and before I forget here the
Bluetooth range has been excellent
testing this with the newest phones on
the market this one all the way to the
other side of my house downstairs going
through several walls of course and the
first floor ceiling the connection never
cut out or disconnected altogether so
let's get to the part that you've been
waiting for the sound test I'll play
several sounds or several songs here and
give you my verdict afterwards I can't
wait I get you fucker looking oh not so
hot just like in a day
maybe some
you
and there you have it folks of course
sound recorded on my end and then played
through your speakers or not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence my
review here keep in mind I test a huge
amount of Bluetooth speakers so branding
weather beats or Apple or this was even
boast or JBL to be honest with you it
really doesn't matter to me I just want
to point out what I hear and how it
stacks up with the others now because
it's a midsize speaker it's not a
full-size like the recalled pill XL you
won't have deep sub bass levels but if
you're a bass lover definitely still
consider this bass is there and more
bassy than most mid-size speakers on the
market the mid range of audio where
vocals and most instruments resides for
the average consumer it will sound
decent with voices and instruments being
pronounced enough the speaker itself is
still very loud filling up small rooms
for Shore and midsize rooms to a good
degree the sound signature is not bright
and I'm sure with being very much Basie
it's not intended to for those listening
to hip-hop this will sound perfectly
fine those who listen to more pop music
with lighter notes you may notice some
slight vocal droning and some songs
where the vocals may sound slightly
suppressed now regarding the highs this
is where I noticed a bit of distortion
sadly I'm very high vocals cymbal
crashes snare drums it gets jumbled and
not clear up top this is very much
noticeable in volume is near or at
maximum volume it just doesn't retain
its clarity as much as I would have
liked now keep in mind this speaker as a
whole I believe does well it's not
garbage by any means and the pill plus
does sound much better than the older
model it's just some songs played very
well while some songs in John Rose on
the other hand didn't play as nice now I
would say if you're a bass lover for
sure this is worth the consideration if
you're not deep into bass I believe the
other sound characteristics are a bit
lacking
now as for audio separation and
soundstage that's performed like many
other mid-sized Bluetooth speakers out
there because the speakers inside the
unit are small and so close together
it's hard for the channels to separate
left and right again that's pretty
typical so in the comments section below
let me know what you think of the pill
plus I personally think it's still a
very capable and good speaker but more
so in the right John rrah
but then again if your money conscious
the price tag does hurt a bit
so let me know down in the comment
