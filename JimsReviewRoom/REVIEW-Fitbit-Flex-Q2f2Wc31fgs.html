review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the Fitbit flex now this
is an activity bracelet that monitors
your movement and even your sleep
patterns and if you wish I've also done
a review on the competing activity
bracelet the jawbone up and you can
click on this pop up video here to watch
that later so we're going to go over the
Fitbit flex features construction and
styling and determine if it's easy to
use so without further delay let's get
started so I purchased the Fitbit flex
for $99 at the time of this review mine
came in black and slate was also
available in stores now online you can
purchase different colors as well in
orange navy and mint green now in the
box
Fitbit didn't skimp and it provided two
wristbands one small and the other large
and each Bend has various notches that
ensures whatever size wrist you have the
band will fit so in regards to putting
on the band when you first purchase this
and attempt it to put it on I personally
found it slightly difficult the tabs
didn't snap into the holes as easily as
I'd like
however over time the holes will stretch
out a little bit and you'll develop your
own technique for snapping it in and
eventually the process will feel natural
to you the rubber material makes it very
comfortable to wear all day actually
light wearing this more than I did jump
on up just for the fact 90% of this band
is just rubber and the only computerized
part lays behind this protruding piece
here and in turn this band feels
ridiculously light to where it's not
cumbersome at the jawbone up because
it's flatter all around and because of
the majority of the band is just rubber
again it's less susceptible to damage
again the only computerized part is
located here and this is the brains of
the device
the only time you would take this out is
to charge it with the supplied USB cable
and typically the battery does last
about 10 days on a full charge there not
to worry as well the Fitbit flex is also
water-resistant now washing my hands and
showering daily with the Sun found no
damage to this unit itself and Leslie in
regards to its physical rundown the band
features this strip here that once
tapped twice it'll indicate your
progress on your daily goals with its
five illuminating LED dots so overall
it's a very durable simple and practical
design
and I have to admit the Fitbit flex is
very easy to use the Flex offers a free
app for download for either your Apple
or Android power device and once
downloaded and installed everything is
now done wirelessly and there's no need
to take off the band the app does record
your steps and distance walk the minutes
you were very active and calories burned
and tapping on any one of them expands
its category now this is where I found
myself wanting to do better personally I
didn't realize how inactive I was I do
work in an office environment and sit in
front of a computer most of the day
unfortunately so hence my chart looks a
little bit weak here but sliding the
chart over reviews to break down
throughout the day again you can view
burn calories distance and active
minutes and because of this chart it was
like a reality check where I needed to
get in better health and like a
pedometer this Fitbit also monitors your
sleep through movement during the night
now once I'm in bed and ready to snooze
the night away I open the Fitbit app and
tell the band I'm going to sleep as soon
as I get up I tell the band I'm awake
and a summary chart of my night's sleep
displays and throughout the night it
tracks your sleep restlessness and how
long you are actually up as you can see
here this is where I got up in the
middle of night to use the restroom now
as I've said in my jawbone up review
it's a great way to monitor if you're
getting a good night's rest and if not
you can adjust your thermostat maybe
adjust the lighting even napping under
different mattress and comparing your
results to optimize your deep sleep
other features on the fitbit app include
food and drink intake which is a huge
plus i access the food log through the
calories eaten category on the home page
and simply select the meal of the day
now earlier today I had Panera Bread for
lunch and I ordered my second most
favorite sandwich the Sierra turkey now
this app actually finds it and records
it with little to no fuss and I would
repeatedly do this throughout the day or
for the day at night in one more example
let's say for breakfast I ate a Chobani
Greek yogurt again this easily finds it
for you as you can see here now one of
the downfalls I have to mention though
the step meter the food diary in a sleep
log there weren't as detailed at the
jawbone up now the up actually had a
section after put in putting your food
you can also view the amount of sugar
fat and protein taken this
one example there the flex only recorded
calorie intake that's it
so for sleeping the up broke my sleep
down to light sleep deep sleep how fast
it fell asleep in and how long I was
awake for the fit Fitbit flex only had
the time I was asleep time I was awake
and how many minutes in total I was
Restless and the information on the app
was just a little bit easier to read and
easier on the eyes with more information
in general it just makes me more of an
informed and health-conscious individual
so the last notable feature here was
logging your work out there were no
generic options and everything had to be
manually inputted in similar to your
food diary so let's say for example I
lifted weights today for about let's say
30 minutes or so I searched
weightlifting and then I select my time
of day and duration save it and it
records your calories burned and then
going back onto your home page it does
tally and total your efforts for that
day it's a great way to compare the
amount of calories you've taken and the
calories burn to balance yourself to a
healthier you so all in all it's a easy
to use in the app software does more
than just track your steps and sleep
which it does automatically as long as
you're wearing it with your interaction
and commitment though you can log in
your foods water intake and workout
sessions if you have friends with a
Fitbit flex you can compare and compete
with your progress within the app as
well another feature is a vibrating
alarm you can set up an alarm and wake
yourself up from a vibration on your
wrist without disturbing those around
you in bed and lastly with this band you
can have other Fitbit accessories work
in conjunction with your flex to
automatically log in your information a
perfect example is getting a Fitbit
scale which sinks into the same app to
record your daily weight so in my
opinion both competing activity bands
had their own pros and cons the Flex is
a very comfortable and subtle device to
wear while the job went up was a bit
more chunky and required manually
syncing in your data
however the jawbone up does have so much
more to offer in its free app like a
more detailed breakdowns of your
activity exercise and daily consumption
food
so overall the Fitbit flex is a great
device on its own merits again it's $99
at time of this review while the jawbone
up is $129 so that's it for
reviewing the Fitbit flex definitely
click on the other videos above and also
watch the job on up review that I've
done as well as always please show you
