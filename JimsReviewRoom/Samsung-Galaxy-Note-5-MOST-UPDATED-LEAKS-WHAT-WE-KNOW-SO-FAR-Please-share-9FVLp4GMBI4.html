week into the galaxy note5 is
potentially announced Samsung will be
hosting their unpacked 2015 event and
Thursday August 13 2015 right here in
New York and if you're not part of the
press you can watch the live broadcast
at the following address on your screen
so be sure to mark those calendars now
before getting started going a few
months back samsung released the galaxy
s6 a phone meant to turn samsung's
declining mobile sales around and hold
off apple's creeping market share the
Essex was a total redesign and indeed
was subjective with some loving the new
look and feel while some long-term fans
were disappointed it's now missing a
removable battery no SD card slot and a
lack of water resistance that was found
on just the prior model the s5 now with
that being said hardcore phone users
assumed that's what the note series is
intended for to keep those productivity
features for their productivity phone
well today I'm going to do a roundup of
all the most credible leaks that i can
find and try to stay away from the
rumors as much as i can obviously
nothing has been confirmed by samsung
yet but again it's less than a week away
so I'm Jimmy would Jim's review room
calm welcome everyone to another video
big phones are becoming more popular
than ever as evidence even Apple
following suits and now offering an
iphone 6 plus model the note 5 from
leaked photos does very much suggest
they same 5.7 inch screen to make a
return and a similar metal frame like
gambino for now if you look closely
aesthetically the beveled edge is now
gone any more flowing and smoother
design is chosen as her features right
off the bat there appears to be dual
microphones on the top yet the headphone
port gets moved on to the bottom of the
phone and well down here sadly USB 3.0
or USB type-c doesn't show up it looks
like we're still using USB 2.0 a decent
changes to the speaker here now on the
bottom of the phone versus on the back
as we've seen in the previous generation
and of course last is the S Pen itself I
also looked everywhere to find a photo
of the back of the note 5 and only found
one however lete case manufacturer
renderings have all suggested in note 5
will most likely feature a class back
eliminating a removable battery and of
course the microSD card slot that fans
on the note were expecting again I'm
aware the average consumer may or may
not need the SD slot nonetheless a
microSD card costs twenty-five dollars
or so on Amazon at the moment versus
paying double or triple the cost to bump
your phone up with more gigs having
options was always nice and the
foundation of Samsung and regarding that
battery replacement I will say this in
every one of my videos as this is
something I truly believe in know the
average consumer will not replace their
batteries at their desk in their car or
even at their bus stuff especially with
cheap power banks now available quick
charging and not to mention especially
the note 5 will have wireless charging
example as well just like the s6 but
batteries do lose its efficiency while
some just don't hold a charge anymore
for those who do own their phones for
the full two-year contract or longer it
would be nice to have again the option
to purchase a replacement battery at
that time considering the note was more
of a Productivity workhorse and to
differentiate from the s6 besides having
a bigger screen and the s-pen I would
have thought Samsung would return to
those specific features as I think it's
fair to say and this is not just me
trying to be tacky or so but just
looking out for the average consumer to
those again who
do hold on to their products for a good
bit of time but enough of that here let
me know in the comments below what you
guys think especially for the note 5
phone considering that it is the the
productivity phone of Samsung but in all
ways what's more interesting here is the
spec sheet was also leaked just recently
evleaks notorious for providing credible
leads to the world on Twitter provided
details of what's under the hood it
looks they use the same processor the s6
currently has the same resolution of
2560 x 1440 mix of return which I think
still looks amazing possibly the biggest
buzz is now the industry-leading 4
gigabytes of RAM standard there's 32
gigs of space assuming there will be 64
128 gigabyte models available a 16
megapixel rear camera makes a return but
I'm curious and what hope further
improvements are made to the already
great sensor same with a 5 megapixel on
the front as well again in the league
evleaks stated no SD card slot and with
all that being said thankfully the
latest Android will be installed with
version 5.1 point 1 now this is just
personal speculation besides the alleged
physical design changes I would think
we're going to see some obvious
improvements to the already good
features samsung offers the s-pen
software features will surely improve
while I'm very confident Samsung will
offer a camera equivalent or better than
the s6 which was already a great camera
by itself and more than likely wireless
charging will be built in now I know
Samsung's change in direction some will
be bummed but I believe samsung's new
direction is towards more mainstream
consumers where bulk of the buyers are
at not so much the power users
unfortunately but for the time being
things are still technically up in the
air until August thirteenth but yet
again a lot of these leaks I personally
cross-referenced and saw these news
outlets getting the same or similar
information again we just gotta wait and
see now if you enjoyed this video please
share this and add me n to your facebook
twitter or instagram accounts and be
sure to visit my website jim's review
room captain for news and other reviews
and always feel free to comment below
are you excited about the note 5 or have
you lost your interest in samsung let me
know if you're an average consumer or a
heavy smartphone user be great to start
dialogue again I'm Jimmy with Jim's
review room calm you guys take care and
I'll see in the next one
