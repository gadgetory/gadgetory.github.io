j-bird released their truly wireless
earphones the j-bird runs which I have
reviewed and the channel definitely
check it out but they also released an
update to their j-bird freedoms these
are the freedom twos and they're priced
at one hundred and fifty dollars at the
Thomas video coming in either carbon or
gold as always being transparent with
you guys with my work here j-bird did
send these over for review my assessment
was not altered in any way please watch
the entire video for both pros and cons
last I've placed my affiliate links in
the video description below click on my
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time they never
know when these things might go on sale
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
going over what comes in the package
please pause the video if you need to
items highlighted in orange or gold are
new or redesigned while the rest remains
the same over last year's model we have
new ear fins and ear tips jaybird dubs
this secure fit and there's a new method
of shortening the wires behind your neck
called speed fit now starting with the
earphones and ear tips they're now one
piece construction for different sizes
and less to manage now they're super
soft very comfortable in the ear and a
jaybird freedom to provide very good
passive noise isolation to block out the
outside world here but one area I'm more
concerned about doesn't stay in my ears
this is clearly subjective and I want to
make sure everyone understands this
everyone its ears are different now
please write in the comments section
below if you owned a pair of Jaybirds
before did they stay in your ear well or
not this should help everyone get an
idea versus just my own experience here
now the freedom to use are indeed crazy
small and very light weights more so
than any other pair of headphones I've
tested in the channel they're also one
of the lowest profile earphones ever so
if you're wearing a ski mask if you're
going skiing which I clearly haven't
done but say you're biking and wearing
how much the earphones stay flush
against your ears without sticking out
and wearing any kind of headgear like a
helmet won't feel uncomfortable you can
wear these two different ways the first
is your traditional method like most
other earphones laying it dangle on the
back of your neck now this was okay for
me the new ear fins and ear tips
combination does work better than my
freedoms from last year but compared to
the competition I would have to press
them back in from time to time the other
wearing method that did work for me
though is the over the ear wearing style
flip ease around and as mentioned
earlier there's new built in clips that
makes the wire taut preventing the wire
from bouncing around as much simply pull
on them and they stay in place and I
love this feature here much easier than
last year's and easier than you j-bird
x3s
and to undo them basically you just pull
them apart this holds true to the speed
fit name hen it works with a stop the
earphones were less likely to fall out
and for the most part stayed inside my
ear canal much better again test them
out yourself but being up front after
reviewing so many earphones over the
last four years or so
I've had others staying with a bit more
confidence moving on j-bird retains its
water resistance simply spray
actually drenching the hell out of these
things j-bird has been holding up
perfectly fun I've never had an issue
with Jaber products over the last
several years
and specifically with the freedom twos I
can attest mine are still working now
going over its battery life most other
air phones offers between six to eight
hours of use j-bird offers something
very unique to keep these earphones
possibly the lightest and smallest in
the world
the j-bird freedom twos have up to four
hours of battery life sounds shorts but
jabber includes this little attachment
here and when you're on your way to the
gym possibly before you go for your run
clip the Sun and it recharge the
earphones very similar to a mini power
bank now you get an additional four
hours here so in total in theory you get
eight hours of total playback now if
you're in a crunch 20 minutes of
recharging - freedom - gives you an hour
worth of music so with my test living it
at 50% vine to get a middle-of-the-road
number from a full battery to dead the
j-bird freedom twos lasted 4 hours and
16 minutes to be exact
to recharge to a full battery using the
clip jibber claims up to two and a half
hours I timed my experience and was able
to finish at 1 hour and 28 minutes as
documented on your screen now as a side
note you can wear the clip while you're
working out or running I prefer wearing
it with the over-the-air method as it
wires stays in place if you're wearing
this the traditional Undergear method be
sure to use the clip to attach to your
shirt the better attachment is very
lightweight and you won't feel it winged
down on you if worn but it will cause
the wire to sway a bit more than not
having it on now keeping the wire
stationary helps a lot for a Bluetooth
connection jaybird is using bluetooth
4.1 which is still very good here
testing the range on these and I know
the chamber graphic is bigger than my
entire head here but I was able to get
the full 40 linear feet in my office
with these Samsung no.8 now as we're
phone calls voices sounded great during
quiet environments these earphones still
picked up wind noise surrounding
background noise and just wouldn't in
general while moving running biking etc
now getting to audio quality jaybird
does offer one of the best audio
experiences for a pair of sport
earphones from the factory they're on a
flat audio setting but using these
jaybird my sound app you can get them to
sound the way that you want using the
equalizer get bassy beat headphones like
performance or if you prefer brightness
is crisp highs for vocals maybe or some
rock music in there you can achieve that
too it's very intuitive and very easy
for any average consumer to use then
because of how easy it is to tune these
are the most versatile earphones for all
genres of music and that's not a blanket
statement that's not me trying to make a
general statement these truly are
capable of customizing to your personal
preference
now for some reason if you choose not to
there's presets built into the app from
brand ambassadors of jaybird and once
you'd like a setting even your own the
settings are saved into the freedom to
itself even if you didn't have the app
later let's say you pair this to a
SmartWatch your audio signature stays in
the earbuds stored on there for your
listening experience pretty high-tech
now overall the audio signature is loud
it's not distorting overall they sound
amazing
