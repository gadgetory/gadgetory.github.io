room at the moment there's tons of
Bluetooth speakers out there and you
can't imagine how many questions I get
and which one's the best and who's
better than the other all valid and good
questions though as you're trying to
pick out that right one
well my buyers guide today will go
through the best of the best for each
speaker category from small mid-range to
large and I'll go over just the major
features for each bluetooth speaker for
the full review or the full details you
gotta watch my videos and keep in mind
these are speakers that I've personally
tested with some speakers I
unfortunately couldn't get to just yet
as always I'll place the Amazon links in
the video description below so that way
you can click on the updated prices for
today considering prices have been
fluctuating a good bit so I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room and my channel here is
to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another video
starting off with small speakers the
three best speakers have encountered so
far are the UE roll JBL flip three and
the underrated Sony X 33 models with the
first two priced at $99 and the Sony at
129 dollars retail the roll offers
lifeproof features allowing you to throw
this literally into the mud spray down
afterwards and continue to have music
play it's also one of the few speakers
where you can completely submerge
underwater
regarding better life all of my speakers
are tested at 50% volume to get a
middle-of-the-road result to judge on
the roll claims up to nine hours of use
and I was able to achieve 11 hours and
12 minutes into the unit died but
looking at the competition the JBL flip
3 does offer what they call JBL connect
enabling again 2 JBL connect speakers to
pair with one another but on the
opposite end the flip 3 is only splash
proof and not waterproof like the roll
the battery life is claimed to be up to
10 hours of use and then these same 50%
volume test that I did on the flip 3 it
yielded 10 hours and 53 minutes
regarding Sony this is the most
conservative look but it does look the
most sleek in the most modern here
features include clear Audio plus which
enhances the sound being played and
there's different audio types of audio
encoding to help retain audio quality
despite being beamed across bluetooth
now better life on the Sony is claimed
to be up to 12 hours and from my test I
achieved seven hours in 30 minutes now
regarding sound the roll does good for
its price and I think it is perfect for
those planning on using this outdoors
it's been tested by me and this for sure
can last but if you want better sound
quality I would step up to these Sony X
33 very much underrated but once clear
Audio plus is on this little speaker
works very well with offering details to
your audio and styling that you may
consider but for overall enjoyment I
have to give it up to the JBL foot 3
it's just rugged enough for most people
it's still small and these sound
signature from JBL is a sure favorite
for most there's decent of bass yet the
mids are slightly pushed forward
offering very good vocals that's not
drowned out by the lower frequencies not
only that this is the loudest speaker of
the three and one that retains most of
its quality when blasting at maximum but
if you need this for a medium-sized room
this just barely satisfies that need
again I'll place the links in the video
description below for updated
pricing and of course my reviews as well
and moving on to mid-sized speakers this
is where it really gets interesting
I nominated another Yui product but ue
boom to the other speaker here is the
Bose Soundlink mini to the JBL charge 2
plus and the creative roar - I know a
lot of second-generation speakers going
on now first up the 199 dollar Yui
speaker once again offers life proof
features and it's the only speaker out
of the four to offer true 360 degree
sound you can stand on any side of the
speaker while it's upright and you'll
hear the same loudness and directional
audio coming from this thing and then
better life and this is claimed to be at
15 hours with my standardized test that
came in at 10 hours and 2 minutes extra
features include double up again
allowing you to pair two boom speakers
together for more room filling music and
last near-field communication comes in
handy for easy pairing to other NFC
devices going to the Bose Soundlink mini
2 it's priced at $200 and rarely if ever
I see this go on sale it's one of the
best sounding mid-size speakers for the
longest time so let's see how this one
stacks up it comes in all aluminum
giving a nice modern feel they're
definitely not waterproof though and the
only other real feature that Bose is
offering is a charging cradle to use
just set this by the side of your bed
and when you're ready to charge it just
drop it right in there unfortunately
Bose is lacking the most features out of
the 4 however better life from my test
proved very well at over 12 hours of use
until the battery died but regarding the
JBL charge 2 plus with the best price
tag of 149 dollars retail this is indeed
a more rugged design with splash proof
capabilities which might be enough for
some people now what is unique and on
all of the new JBL speakers at the
moment are these passive base radiators
on the side that you can see move when
music is bumping and although the
speaker can stand upright this does not
push sound out 360 degrees although the
design might suggest otherwise the one
the predominant features hence its name
is the charge out port on the rear
allowing you to charge your phone or all
the devices with a USB cable handy
during a power outage if you don't have
a power bank laying around and because
it has a six thousand milliamp battery
this can last up to 12 hours per JBL and
from my testing at 50% volume light
with all my Bluetooth speakers I got 14
hours and 12 minutes of use very
impressive the one thing that I wish
that the charge to plus did have is the
ability to use JBL connect basically
syncing to JBL speakers and having them
again play at the same time now moving
to the creative forward to which doesn't
get too much press but has won numerous
awards at least on their roar one with
the original model this is the Swiss
Army knife of Bluetooth speakers with
nearly every feature other Bluetooth
speakers are offering the only thing
really missing here is just basically
being water-resistant it's priced at
$199 retail but I really ever see it at
this price it's usually around a hundred
and seventy to as low as 150 but feature
wise here this has a charge out port
bass boost and clarity enhancement
features NFC voice recording and this
can also play audio with a micro SD card
but this really leads up to the audio
quality
now the UE boom - gets louder than the
previous model but comparing to the
other speakers this sound signature
hasn't really much improved
now I placed it on this list as the
audio quality isn't bad by any means
it's not as good as the other three in
my test but it's the features of being
super rugged one of the few speakers on
the market to offer true 360 degree
sound and again if you did bring this to
the beach or have kids playing with this
you don't have to worry about sand dirt
or water but the creative row -
surprisingly provides very good audio
almost equivalent in detail and clarity
as the Bose Soundlink mini - and of
course they both provided very good
sound here bidding the last - in my
opinion as much as the boom is in or was
known for bass the bow still provides a
deeper but more importantly richer tone
the creative roars again about
equivalent now the charge - plus offers
good bass but what I loved about this
sound signature is it's very bright in
the mid-range pushing vocals a bit
forward
helping the mid-range sound more
predominant and not necessarily recessed
or boxy many will find the mini to
offering more definition and audio
detail but the JBL I found perfect for
the John Rose of music that I personally
listened to which is pop hip-hop and EDM
the sound signature from JBL helps to
immerse you into the music and as
important the price tag being cheaper
than the other three makes this the best
overall mid-range speaker
all right folks unless moving on through
the heavyweights here the best in this
price range that I've tested has been
the Bose selling three JBL Xtreme the
fugu XL and lastly Marshall Stanmore
starting with the most unique Marshall
has been around for ages mainly
providing amps to guitarists rock bands
and the likes their Bluetooth speaker is
very unique with a nod to the Past with
their other rap cabinets gold knobs and
switch and most unique here look at that
front grille
now this isn't portable whatsoever and
it is heavy and since not being portable
it physically connects to the wall
there's no battery inside however if
you're looking for a conversational
piece when guests do come to over to
your apartment this is flip and cool but
besides looking nice there's not so much
other special features except that you
can connect this via an optical cable on
the back and also make note of this this
is the most expensive coming in at 399
dollars retail now bose comes back again
with they're selling three as this was
my favorite for a long time and still
one the best sounding Bluetooth speakers
available still built very well premium
materials and retains its subtle
understated look here and very similar
the feature set is on the low side
nothing else really talked about
but regarding better life Bose is
climbing up to 14 hours of performance
and from my testing less than 13 hours
and 38 minutes to be exact
now this one is priced at $300 now
regarding the JBL Xtreme in the video it
doesn't look too big but when I did hold
it with the carrying strap here that
supplied viewers were mentioning how big
it really looked you can tell how
extreme this is passive base radius on
the side once again pulsate when sound
is bumping and in theory it helps with
offering better bass response the outer
shell has the same water resistance like
on all the previous models again splash
proof but not fully submersible in water
notable features include JBL connect for
two JBL speakers once again and on the
back has not one but two charged out
ports to charge your devices better life
on this thing is claimed to be up to 15
hours of use and again that 50% bottom
test
lasted 18 hours and 16 minutes into the
unit died and last up the fugu XL has
been the most requested speaker for
review lately
as of this video I've done all my tests
down here I just haven't finished
filming it just yet
but I can say the fugu is tough as the
UE mega boom and for sure sounds better
than the mega boom
fugu has come out of nowhere and shown
itself to be a strong contender this
thing is dust proof waterproof up to
three feet for up to thirty minutes
underwater the better life claimed is
crazy at 35 hours and with my test here
I was able to achieve 27 hours and 23
minutes and insane number regardless
there's a charge up port and because of
its speaker inside a shell design here
that I'm showing you guys perfect this
has been dropped tested at 3 feet about
the same height as my hip here in a
little bit higher than most tables and
deaths and basically survived the fugu
XL comes in at 299 dollars retail
sometimes on sale for 270 so this brings
me to the sound test right off the bat
if you're more in tune with a more
neutral sound presence bass isn't
damaging or overdone basically the
marshall is your best bet this provided
possibly the most neutral sound of the 4
and because of its size small medium and
large rooms are perfectly fine second I
would give this to the fugu XL this does
offer big sound and very good amount of
bass perfect for genres of pop hip-hop
and EDM now this sounds great by itself
and I mean great but if you did put the
side-by-side with the next two you can
hear why the bose and JBL sounds better
moving on i honestly prefer the sound
signature of the both sounding three due
to its fidelity and details in music
though still stands as the best in
offering clarity and just enough bass to
have most genres and especially movies
to be enjoyed and surprisingly not many
bluetooth speakers do well with audio
separation but bose here does a good job
with a more open soundstage
not much but more so than other
bluetooth speakers and this brings me
here to the best overall speaker JBL
wins again although audio resolution
might not be there as much as both the
much more forward mid-range and the
strong vocals more so than most speakers
i've tested if not all also the bass
levels and the JBL being very well done
not droning and how loud overall this
can get I felt more immersed into my
music more so than the Bose Soundlink 3
now once you add in the overall package
the styling and the features here I
think makes this the best
large bluetooth speaker on the market so
that's it for the entire list here I
know this video is getting pretty long I
have to admit I'm sure many have to
agree because I read most of the
comments on YouTube JBL really cleaned
house this year with their Bluetooth
speakers a lot of people really do like
them and from my test I can definitely
hear why again I'm sure there's many
other speakers that I have yet to try
but the ones I have mentioned so far in
this video has been some of the best
selling most popular Bluetooth speakers
on the market if you do get one of the
above I'm sure you can't go wrong so be
