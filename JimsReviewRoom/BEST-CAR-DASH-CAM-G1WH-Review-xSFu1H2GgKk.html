review her welcome back to another
review
so last year I was involved in an auto
accident with an 18-wheeler but rather
going into details about that after the
incident I sure wanted to give a dashcam
now I don't believe there's a mainstream
brand or model out there that the
average consumer is aware of but I did
some research and I believe I found the
best dashcam based on my tests and also
from other car enthusiast
recommendations that most of these dash
cams are from China with some skepticism
since they're so cheap but the one I
purchased is the g1 WH from amazon.com
for just $52 now they very impressed
greatly but around $50 is what you
should aim for with a 32 gigabyte micro
SD card which is sold separately it's
another $20 bringing my personal total
to $72 for the entire package again much
cheaper than what I thought before I
started my research so without further
ado we'll get started
we'll start by going over the physical
parts of the camera first with the very
top having a mini USB port for charging
and also viewing content on your
computer once connected audio and video
out via three and half millimeter cords
your on/off switch and to the right of
that is the record slash action button
now the very left is the micro SD card
slot and far-right features the mini
HDMI port now nothing on the bottom but
the front features a 2.7 inch wide
screen with a really low resolution of
960 by 240 now the high definition
screen by any means but for a dash cam
it works perfectly fine now finishing up
the up and down arrows are on the left
and the access to the menu is on the far
top right and the mode button below to
toggle between recording video or taking
photos and we'll get into these settings
and what the menu looks like pretty soon
now going over some of its features the
dash cam does continuously loop video
when the SD card is full the camera
deletes the oldest file automatically
and continues its cycle and for the
manufacturer this camera can take up to
32 gigs of storage no more and it's
highly recommended to use a class 10
card for recording again I bought mine
just for $20
another great feature you leave this in
your cigarette lighter and when you turn
on your car the camera starts recording
automatically and of course this would
turn off once you remove the keys from
the car and leave overall it's truly a
set it and forget it kind of concept and
it's worked every time since owning this
now other features includes motion
detection and also night vision which
I'll again show you shortly and one last
item here there is a built-in battery
now not considering I would a video
record without the DC chord but
inventive and emergency the dash cam can
easily disconnect from the suction cup
mount and just by sliding it over and I
can go and snap photos of an accident
scene if need be now one of the most
important things you should consider is
the lens that they use in a camera now
this has a 140 degree wide angle lens
and be sure to purchase the g1 WH and
not the g1w the latter is only 120
degrees and the two models price
difference is less than $10 in most
cases now going through the menu
settings and screens here the first up
is the video size for 1080 720 and so on
next is disabling and enabled
loop recording at different time
intervals for me after every three
minutes the video saves and becomes a
file on the SD card wdr is wide dynamic
range and you can toggle that on or off
then next is the exposure settings and
after that is motion detection perfect
for when someone walks in front of your
car the camera does record that brief
instant and turns off after there's no
movement now if you're parked in a busy
area more than likely you have to plug
this into a cigarette lighter outlet
that's always on and it's a perfect
feature for catching possible vandals or
hitting runs in the camera's direction
now recording audio on or off which is
self-explanatory and next is another
unique feature here it's a g-force
sensor allowing the camera to stop the
recording and save the file immediately
if the camera senses a sudden collision
or drastic shake and you can change the
sensitivity on this to your liking but I
personally left mine on medium the less
than the window is to decide if you want
it date stamped the video or not which I
suggest having on now going to the
second set of menu options here there's
many more self-explanatory items from
changing your date and time to changing
the video output from pale to mtsc when
using the HDMI cable a screen protection
allows the screen display to turn off
after a certain amount of time and the
IR LED is truly not an infrared light
it's just a flashlight feature that does
nothing to illuminate the road when
driving at night and the last menu item
here is to format your memory card which
I highly suggest before using the camera
and the very last item on the main
screen you can toggle between again
recording your video like I'm doing here
or switch to photo mode and the last is
basically display mode where you can
watch all your saved content so here's
the moment that you've been waiting for
is the actual video and just as a
warning there's nothing really stellar
from the video footage it's just my
fiance going to work or me driving
around town going shopping or so
whatever it may be
but as you can see for a camera under
$100 with all those features the video
is stunning no question it's not crystal
clear or it looks like my video from a
Nikon but I think it does enough justice
to determine who is at fault or any
other bizarre driving under way work or
home now you can for the most part and
makeout license plates that are in front
of you and in worst-case scenarios you
can make part of the license plate but
least you have been making model the
vehicle
and the suction cup has worked very well
without falling once and the recent hot
summer days and night driving here is
just enough in my opinion it's not true
night vision you can say although the
listing and box mentions infrared but on
the inner roads at night you can still
make out the lines lights and other
vehicles so an event of an accident you
can still see who is at fault or at
least see what had happened and then
driving in other miscellaneous dark
areas it does become quite dark now
regarding the movie files themselves
they do save as MOV file formats for me
and they save at every 3-minute interval
now each clip is 3 minutes long and on
average it's about 300 megabytes per
file at the full 1080p resolution so
overall I'm personally really impressed
from this device from being really cheap
as it is and not to mention direct from
China as well which sometimes you do
receive some sketchy stuff from there
set it and forget idea and the
continuous loop recording which works
great for someone not as aware when the
membercard is full or if the camera is
even recording and I know I would
personally have that the same issue as
well and before ending the video here I
would highly recommend doing some
research on the seller as there's been
some knockoffs being sold both online
and of all places on Amazon and the
reason why this video had taken so long
for me to put out was indeed I received
a fake g1w model which felt completely
cheap hollow and the video quality was
just horrible and even at times it
didn't even record then trying to get a
refund direct from the Chinese seller
was even a joke so I hope this video
helped you in some way I highly
recommend getting a dashcam in general
as there's missile you know not so
honest people sometimes out there in
this world and you just never know when
it comes to these accidents so please
take your time to like and subscribe but
more importantly share this video with
someone that might find dashcams useful
and last find me on Facebook Google+ and
Twitter this is Jimmy with Jim's review
