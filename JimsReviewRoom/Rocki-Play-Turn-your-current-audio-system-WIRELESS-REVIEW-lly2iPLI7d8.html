review room welcome to another unique
gadget review now I'm a big fan of
Kickstarter and the company Rocky is one
of those success stories they surpassed
funding by over 400% just this past
December and what's unique about this
the rocky play turns virtually any
speaker into a wireless one and only at
$49 it's not a bad deal at all and if
you go to my rocky comm and enter promo
code ready to Rocky
you'll get another 10% off until
Mother's Day of 2014 so without further
ado we'll get started on the review now
the rocky play is very small easily
fitting into your pocket or bag and it
comes in 7 different colors making this
one trendy looking device then the box
you get a micro USB charging cable with
a wall adapter three-and-a-half
three-and-a-half millimeter cord and a 3
and 1/2 millimeter that splits into red
and white audio channels the rocky play
works as being a mini Wi-Fi receiver you
can say you stream your music from your
phone or tablet through your home Wi-Fi
connection you can play music stored
locally on your phone or tablet or you
can choose to stream from online audio
sources so range is dependent on how
good your home wireless router is and
typically home networks are much wider
and range than their Bluetooth
companions now if you're using the rocky
outside of the house let's say in the
park or on the go the rocky play has a
built in battery that's good for 8 hours
of news and actually becomes its own
hotspot where you can stream your music
direct to the rocky play now the record
play connects to any audio device that
has an auxiliary port meaning any one of
your old speakers with a
three-and-a-half millimeter input can
play music wirelessly you can have
several of these rocky plays in each
room throughout the house and it will
play your music throughout
simultaneously it's great for
entertaining in keeping that ambiance
flowing and even in the event that you
have a banging surround sound system now
my personal AV receiver does have a mic
input but it's a 6.5 millimeter size now
with the supplied red and white audio
cables you can still receive music
wirelessly I connected to the back and
adjust the input and now my receiver is
a wireless one alleviating the cost of
buying a proprietary device for that
specific AV
facture now the raki does work on both
Apple and Android power devices with
Android receiving a nice app to work
with while Apple devices simply uses
airplay for the time being an iOS app is
scheduled for release later this April
and both devices can play locally stored
music on your phone or tablet in a wide
variety of music formats and for the
audio files out there this includes the
newer file formats that's gaining
traction its lossless audio FLAC files
now setting up an Android powered device
was very easy at first with a very clean
and easy interface it was as simple as
adding your router's name and password
and naming your rocky play however I
spent a good two hours trying to have
music play
and neither hotspot nor over Wi-Fi
settings truly worked as seen on your
screen now although the rocky denotes
it's connected audio was just not
passing through and I've looked on the
my rocky forums and notice that there
were several similar issues as well it's
very unfortunate at the time but the
forum's do indicate my rocky is aware of
the issue and is fighting a solution
fast now through the Android version amp
the streaming services are currently
limited to SoundCloud and last dot FM
now rocky has stated they are working on
adding more services soon and Spotify
appears to be next however with Apple
AirPlay works well on every app and I
tested once the rocky Play is connected
to your home network it's as easy as
selecting your source where there be
Pandora or even HBO go to SoundCloud and
YouTube you click the airplay button and
select your rocky and sound start
playing instantly and with my testing
audio played through several random
speakers I had laying around the house
and they all sounded perfectly fine and
as my internet range is very good and
never lost music while moving the rocky
play from room to room and a sound
quality is of course dependent on your
speakers but the audio that came through
my testing sounded like a physical and
direct source that streamed over Wi-Fi
so overall the nooses are very practical
especially in my instance of now having
a wireless receiver for the
entertainment area now sound quality
being transferred through is good in the
unrestricted list of compatible file
formats is a plus and over time rocky
will be adding more streaming services
to its app and lastly just having your
old boombox able to work or having
multiple speakers throughout the house
playing at the same time it doesn't get
more affordable than going with
rocki play now in my personal opinion
the rocky play has great potential but
needs to fix these confirm the setup
issues first so let me know in the
