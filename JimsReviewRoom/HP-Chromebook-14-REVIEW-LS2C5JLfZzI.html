review by James review room today we'll
be looking at the HP Chromebook 14 and
the one I have here is priced at 299
dollars while the 11-inch model retails
for 250 and instead of explaining in
detail on every Chromebook review that I
do if you're not too familiar with
Chromebooks I do suggest watching my
video
what's a Chromebook on my channel or
clicking this video if you're watching
this on your desktop now the video will
show and explain the Google operating
software and its benefits and
limitations so without further ado we'll
get started on this particular model now
all Chromebooks are known for their low
price and slim profile the HP Chromebook
14 and 11 are no exception the entire
unit is made of plastic with the bottom
having a very thin silicone or rubber
like material which I really do enjoy
whenever I grab this it really feels
secure and more secure than any other
Chromebook I've reviewed so far in
regards to design in my opinion this is
the best-looking Chromebook with the
acer c720 coming in second place it's a
very modern looking design with an all
white exterior and a HP chromed out logo
red and milled LED in the Hewlett
Packard wording on the rear of the unit
now at least on the 14-inch models the
Chromebook is very rugged feeling
there's very minimal to no flex at all
and when working in carrying this
Chromebook around physically felt more
like a seven hundred to eight hundred
dollar laptop actually now HP really did
a good job just to have it feel like a
real quality oriented product the
measurements are on your screen with the
unit being thirteen point five six
inches wide nine point four four inches
deep I'm sorry ten point eight six
inches thick with the lid closed and it
weighs in at four point one nine pounds
and it's obviously not as light as the
11 inch models that weighs in about 2.2
pounds or so but compared to other 14
inch laptops this Chromebook is slightly
lighter now connectivity is on par with
other Chromebooks on the market there's
no connections on the front or the rear
of the Chromebook but on the right side
does include a USB 2.0 port with a
built-in SD card reader and the input
for the supplied power cable
now while rotating to the left side here
yield a three-and-a-half millimeter
microphone
slash headset combination port 2 of the
newest USB standards which is USB 3.0
and an HDMI port to connect to your TV
or monitor now the last physical feature
is the built-in webcam which like most
Chromebooks has VGA quality it's an
older technology and as you can see on
your screen isn't the most crisp image
available but do keep in mind
Chromebooks are a budget laptop so to
keep prices down they do have to put
some subpar items in there now in
regards to screen size HP currently
offers the biggest screen for
Chromebooks at 14 inches with a
resolution of 1366 by 768 now the
resolution is actually on par with other
low to mid grade laptops only when you
start to head around the $800 price
point is when you do see a higher
resolution being offered in turn
providing more crisp and detailed images
and lettering and as much as I like the
compact 11-inch model Chromebooks and
the higher pixel density the 14 inch
just makes everything easier to read
with bigger icons and text and as for
contrast for a budget-conscious laptop
the colors are fine and is enough to
have an enjoyable experience while
watching movies now the screen is not a
matte finish so there is some glare if
you do have recessed lighting or a
ceiling light light bulb will basically
reflect onto your screen now moving on
internally Chromebooks in general uses
low power consumption processors in this
case all of HP 14 inch models uses the
latest Intel Celeron processor running a
1.4 gigahertz dual-core chip with 2 gigs
of RAM on board now 4 gig versions are
available directly from HP's website for
just about 30 to 60 dollars more which I
do recommend for a bit more multitasking
performance now also built in is a 16
gig solid state hard drive which means a
very fast performance and with very
minimal boot up time now the 11 inch
version / HP websites still uses the
Samsung Exynos 5 processor which is the
same processor in the samsung series 3
Chromebook which I also reviewed a few
weeks back that's an old processor and
when compared to the new Intel ones the
Exynos was not as fluid in performance
and the battery life wasn't as good so
just be aware of that
now other notable features are Wireless
ABG
and n connections with Bluetooth
connectivity to all your Bluetooth
enabled devices and the battery claims
off to a huge nine and a half hours of
news however during my tests of mixin
use that includes web browsing and
typing my narrative with the occasional
YouTube videos there I was able to
obtain on average about eight to nine
hours of news that's not bad at all
that's actually pretty good now lastly
regarding the actual performance my
tests yielded perfectly fine for
everyday casual news now these new
processors do make normal actions feel
smooth and perform as it should compared
to the older generation Chromebooks
pulling up email going onto Facebook
browsing photos went without a hitch
watching youtube videos in high
definition wasn't a problem at all and
of course the Netflix ran smooth now as
for gaming I do not recommend the
Chromebook at all
now although some games can be found in
the Google store some were just not
compatible with Chromebook and required
either Windows or Java no games that
were playable weren't any 3d
heavy-hitting games more two-dimensional
games were found and they ran perfectly
fine games like Angry Birds to cut the
rope may be the latest in gone viral
flappy birds but even the more demanding
games that's still on a 2d platformer
but has more on physics calculations
like happy wheels ran perfectly fine as
well running about an average 30 frames
per second and not sure if you notice so
far but every application opened has
opened in a web browser
now Google doesn't run on programs but
everything is web driven and this being
a Chromebook developed by Google there's
nearly if not all of Google services
available we're speaking of Google
Hangouts Google Docs Google Maps Gmail
Google Drive etc you name it now what
are the limitations on the operating
software is again not being able to use
programs that you wouldn't normally
install so if you're not too familiar
with Chromebook or how it works I highly
suggest watching again my video called
what is Chromebook and it explains the
Chromebooks operating software and what
it offers so to wrap things up for only
299 dollars you can get a 14 inch laptop
little tentacle a Chromebook with the
build quality that feels like a
moderately priced laptop the battery
life is on the top tier of Chromebooks
and laptops alike the only downfalls I
can see
is of course the gaming department or in
general anything too demanding but as
long as you understand this is a budget
laptop then this laptop will possibly
work out for you so I hope this review
helped you in some way and if you have
not please take your time to like and
