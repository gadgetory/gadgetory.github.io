room Bose is clearly responding to
consumers and also the competition
simply the market is willing to pay a
little extra for wireless headphones and
we're seeing it for the first time on
their QuietComfort series now I
personally paid for this at the retail
price of three hundred and fifty dollars
just fifty dollars more than they're
wired qc25 model I'll place my Amazon
affiliate links in the video for both as
you never know the qc25 s might go down
in price since the QC 35 s are just
released click on my links and it'll
give you the most updated prices for
today so without further ado sit back
relax and welcome to another review
going over the physical features for
your consideration the QC 35 s are in
silver and the QC 25 s are in black the
despite both looking nearly identical
there are some subtle differences
looking at the headband the very top
features soft and supple synthetic
leather versus fabric on the previous
model Alcantara which can be found in
luxury automobiles like Audie to
Lamborghini provides a very soft cushion
on your head now more my comfort test a
little bit later now moving down here
and stainless steel retractable arms are
used and the clicking mechanism stays
firm enough without accidental
adjustments while wearing now I know
this is a bit extreme here but it
doesn't hurt to know how durable these
are performing my stress test with every
one of my headphones the band retains
its shape and it seems along the
headband stays intact
there's no creaking no squeaking of
materials here overall a very quality
build now moving down to the air cup
these are closed back over ear
headphones with the controls on the
right side offering pause play and to
adjust volume to lights indicate
Bluetooth connectivity and power levels
here and a microUSB port for charging
the QC 35 s and since we're touching
based on better life here bose is
claiming up to 20 hours Wireless and if
you tend on using the supply three and a
half millimeter cord you can get up to
40 hours worth of use these numbers
claims are impressive and on par with
the other high-end headphones here but
from my actual testing living these on
at about 50% volume just to get a medium
result here I had a whopping 23 hours
and 32 minutes of use wirelessly and for
those who are curious here also time
they're pre charging from a dead battery
and had taken about two hours and 25
minutes and before if we get here every
time you turn on your headphones the QC
35s graciously prompts you and tells you
the percentage of battery remaining
battery 10% connected to not only to 4G
LTE the last few features the QC 35 s
have NFC or near field communication tap
your NFC enabled device and they connect
automatically it's very convenient and
less like all other active
noise-cancelling headphones there's
external microphones that helps with
adjusting the noise canceling
performance and/or enables your
headphones to work just like a headset
for phone calls with my test here audio
was perfect my voice came across very
close to what it sounds like talking
into the phone and right before going
into my audio test here to finish the
physical aspects comfort wise these
things have been amazing just like the
qc25 s both emphasizes and promotes
they're not using plastic but glass
filled nylon to retain its lightweight
build while keeping rigidity now the
qc25 weighs in at 208 grams and despite
not listing it on their website the QC
35 s comes in at 234 grams making these
ridiculously light compared to the
competition now wearing these they don't
give any wearing fatigue at the crown of
the head the clamping force at the jaw
line is very subtle here with no
discomfort whatsoever and wearing these
for several hours straight here ideally
for those wearing these on the airplane
the QC 35 s works perfectly fine I
highly recommend them for the comfort
aspect and last what is in the package
you receive a 3.5 millimeter cord for a
physical connection I do admit though
the wire could have been a little bit
more beefy it feels somewhat cheap here
but of course it still works and it's
hassle free there's no locking mechanism
either just like the qc25 s but I know
some of my channel here they do prefer
to not stay 100% secure as your
headphones could go flying off your head
here if the wire was ever pulled but
going back to the contents you do
receive an airplane adapter some seats
on the airline's do have two prongs here
this adapter solves that issue a USB
cord comes in the Box here to charge
your QC 35 s and last is the case it's
the headphones do graciously fold in for
easy stowing and the case itself does
provide adequate protection when
traveling so that's everything about the
physical aspect here and getting to the
part that you probably been waiting for
the noise cancelling and the audio
performance
getting into the active noise-cancelling
performance I have tested the pair at
Zeke's the Sony Hurons these Sennheiser
wireless Momentum's and several more
headphones with a and C something more
recent headphones I'll admit though they
do come close in performance
specifically the Zeke's and the Sony
Hurons but both still offers the best in
canceling out unwanted noises now just
like Lee Weyer QC 25s the QC 35 s works
equivalently the same from my tests here
I've worn these in the city with tons of
construction going on here as you've
seen in the beginning of the video I've
tested these on the Metro in a cafe
around many people talking here and
random other areas around the city most
your environment being muted is simply
amazing
and once you have music going on here
nearly everything disappears now you
still hear some nearby voices as most
ANC headphones do but most of that dirty
noise like cars driving by the wind
construction in the background etc it's
reduced significantly now I don't hear
any hissing on both the qc25 s or the 35
s it either both wired or Wireless with
ladder but if you're looking for the
best and active noise-cancelling I've
tested the others these again are still
the best now regarding audio performance
here the QC 35 do get loud enough for
the average consumer and to answer your
question does it sound identical to the
QC 25 s it's very close but it's not
100% let me preface this by saying the
differences are very minut and you can
only tell if you had both the wired and
the wireless versions in front of you
just like I do that regardless would be
a heavy QC 35 s either connected with
the cord or using the wireless function
the QC 25 sounded more well-rounded it
was louder the bass hit it just a little
bit harder the mids were a bit more
forward in the end the QC 25 s the wired
version that is sounded a slight bit
better than a newer wireless version and
again it doesn't matter if I use the
three-and-a-half millimeter cord or not
now does Bluetooth compression impact
audio performance oddly when I tested
this on my LG v10 the galaxy s7 and the
Nexus 6p the audio would be a good bit
lower versus using bluetooth while using
the wire here I had to pump up the
volume to achieve similar results odd
but I tested this on three different
phones and those were the odd results
now comparing these to the momentum
Wireless these
our bass boosted while the Bose provides
add a good bass it's not flat but the
bass is much more refined and some would
say more accurate now I do personally
prefer a slave bass boost signature and
I love the momentum Wireless for the
longest time but revisiting both that
Bose provides just a clean and clear
based signature especially at higher
volumes
now with the momentum at medium volume
they sound great but pump up the volume
a bit here you can hear the bass drone
into the mid-range a bit here when you
do compare them with the QuietComfort
headphones now the bass doesn't sound as
bass boosted if any are at all but
because so the mid-range where most
instruments reside and vocals are
apparent the BOCES mid-range are a
pleasure to listen to their Ford but not
too bright with details of instruments
and voices coming through the Bose QC 35
just like the 25 gives a natural
listening experience that isn't dumb at
all the highs are kept very intact here
no ear ring and no ear tinging and
listening to these for several hours
here no listening fatigue whatsoever if
you're on a long flight there shouldn't
be an issue whatsoever
now the soundstage allumette isn't as a
parent as my B&amp;amp;O h6 is I had reviewed a
little while back but comparing these
two other anc headphones the Bose
performed as similar now those asking me
to give my thoughts about these Sony
Hurons those are great headphones in the
sound signature is surprisingly similar
they actually sound more like the qc25
than the QC 35 but again the noise
canceling and comfort on these Bose
headphones are better now I would say if
you're into classic music we're talking
about ac/dc the Red Hot Chili Peppers
and maybe even the Beatles definitely
the Beatles through strong vocals and
instruments of Adele Alicia Keys maybe
some John Legend piano work too Sam
Smith these are amazing it's immersive
the instruments and vocals stands out
these still work great for pop in EDM
but at times I do in myth though I do
these are just a little bit more bass
same with hip-hop here but if you have
an equalizer that does help a bit now
regarding wireless range absolutely no
problems with my samsung galaxy s7
smartphone walking downstairs to the
other side of the house here having the
signal go through several walls
never didn't lose audio the last thing I
want to show you real quick Bose does
feature their own app available for both
Apple and Android really basic but it is
useful info the main screen indicates
your better levels bomb control and if
you need you can see the Bluetooth
connections for all of your devices on
the perks the QC 35s remembers your
previously connected devices that way in
the future here you don't have to repair
your devices from scratch each time and
that's basically it for the app no
equalizer no sound profile so simple and
pair of bones so overall for the QC 35
as a wireless option there's a lot going
for it yet it doesn't have all the extra
features you see like on these Sony
headphones or JBL but the battery life
is insane the comfort is one the best
here and indeed the noise cancellation
is the best on the market the other
thing I would say though test these
headphones to see if you enjoy BOCES
particular sound signature there and
someone say it's tame while some may say
it's very accurate and it hits that
sweet spot so I hope this review helped
you in some way here if you haven't
already subscribe and like this video be
