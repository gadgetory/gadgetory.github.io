room after experiencing how great the
audio was on the sony xba-40 I decided
to review the entire lineup that Sony is
offering this includes the XV 30 which
you'll see soon on the channel and the
xB 20 that I have here today actually
Tony retails for $100 however I
personally bought this for $70 instead
at the down this video they're still on
sale but as always I'll leave my
affiliate links in the description below
click on those links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
you never know when these things might
go on sale so sit back relax and
hopefully my videos can help you make
that purchase decision welcome everyone
to another the first time you pick up
the XP 20 you'll notice how comfortable
it is to hold there's this rubberized
texture up top and on the back as well
that gives you tons of grip the firm
provides a strong metal grill for
durability and if you're looking for
portability this is of course bigger
than the you wonder broom and just ever
so slightly bigger than the JBL foot for
for reference nonetheless the XP 20
still falls in the small speaker
category and is perfect if you want to
throw this in your bag to carry just
like the xB 40 and the xB 30 this metal
is also water resistant against splashes
and spills and of course you can't
submerge this underwater and with my
testing at the office I drenched the
crap out of this thing and it's still
functioning perfectly fine now on tap
you have your typical buttons as
outlined on your screen with NFC for
easy pairing but unique features
includes a google assistance in syria
activation with one quick press and a
speaker phone button assisted phone
calls with this as well and it sounded
very good with no echos standing within
5 feet of range was great anything
beyond 5 feet thankfully still no echoes
but the loudness of my voice does
somewhat dissipate with the add feature
you can pair another compatible Sony
speaker and have left and right audio
separation for true stereo sound or you
can sync up to 10 compatible speakers
enable what Sony calls party chain and
have all the speakers play at the same
time now you eat and JBL the other hand
allows you to sync a hundred speakers or
more if you
like by giving Sony credit I don't think
most people would care more than a
hundred speakers let alone ten there
roads in the speaker to its rear you
have some additional base being pushed
when the speaker's near a wall behind
the water-resistant flap on left nears
your inputs for the standard three half
millimeter jack for an analog connection
and a microUSB port for charging the
device unfortunately we're still not
using USB type-c touching based on
better life sony claims up to 12 hours
of listening life in my testing leaving
this on at 50% by overnight say and
timing it here i was able to achieve
nine hours and eight minutes a bit lower
than what i was hoping for
now regarding Bluetooth signal strength
if using bluetooth 4.2 instead of
bluetooth 5.0 but with my testing inside
my office at forty linear feet with no
obstructions the XP 20 works perfectly
fine with a wall and indoor the way I
was able to achieve about sixty liter
feet before these signals start to cut
off now right before I give you the
audio test here is one of the biggest
reasons why you would consider by me
Sony over others it's the LED lights the
lights will flash to the beat of the
music and various styles and with these
Sony's song pal app you can switch it
from strobe where it might give you some
epilepsy here the other is chill where
the lights fade in and out very smoothly
and les is rave where it gives you a
basically a mix now the light to do add
to the experience but I do admit though
I wasn't disappointed that there were no
other color choices as you can see with
my black XV 20 it's only displaying
white now if you buy the blue model it
shows blue green shows green etc but
only if the Bluetooth speaker was able
to display a variety of colors like
these sony xba-40 that would have been
great
nonetheless it's one of the very few
speakers on the market that offers
flashing lights at all now to the
partner you've been waiting for I'll
play several samples for you and then
I'll give you my verdict afterwards one
thing I do need from you though please
comment down below tell me what other
speaker you want me to compare this to
in my head I have the JBL flip for that
comes to mind here or the ue wonder boom
i want to see where your interest lies
thank you
told me y'all of too but it and I'm
investing to join talking eyes long
dreams on my fusion we are your famous
are nothing more than done but what you
say
keep in mind the speaker falls in the
small speaker category and also around
that $100 price range now for a small
speaker very much enjoyed the audio
experience
it's definitely loud for a small bedroom
dorm room and such for midsize rooms
it's very capable at 80% invitin for
large open areas I of course would go
with a bigger speaker for entertaining
and room-filling audio for the XP 20 was
still perfectly fine for personal and
private listening in those large spaces
no bass was very good again for its size
there's definitely more on the XP 20
over the UE one room and face is very
close if anything identical to the JBL
flip for punchy it doesn't become
distorted or drones into the mid-range
it's only better performing mainstream
small bluetooth speakers on the market
currently now on the other hand if you
aren't looking for something more basic
you will most likely have to look or
spend a little bit more maybe even get
the sony xp3 the mid-range is where the
speaker shines though I love the bright
mid Ford vocals clear and articulate
details of instruments all this plus
bass helps create a bumping and
immersive experience that gets me really
into my music especially for pop hip-hop
and EDM the ties do complement the rest
of the audio signature without being
raspy or singing it's not as sharp and
detailed at the top but playing it safe
without having it go overboard is
technically my preference the last audio
separation in sound is always hard to
pull off on Bluetooth speakers with the
XV 20 you do have very little separation
but it performs like most others out
there in the end for $99 the speaker is
a great alternative to the other ones
out there I do wish the lights would
have changed colors or nkv more of a
variety and having it fully waterproof
would have been nice but if you can
forego those features and if you do vary
audio at the $100 price range I highly
recommend this as I stated earlier I
bought this for $70 and if you can get
it for that price
there's tons of value with the XP 20 so
that's it be sure to LIKE and subscribe
if you haven't already be sure to follow
me on Facebook Twitter or Instagram I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision
you guys take care and I'll see you
