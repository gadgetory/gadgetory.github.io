by Jim's review room today we'll be
looking at the all-new NeverWet by resto
liam purchased from your local hardware
store home depot for $20 so what's never
wet and is it safe does it work and how
long does this come look
so we'll find out on this review so
never what is a super hydrophobic
coating it uses nanoscopic chemicals to
create a barrier at a given surface that
repels liquid dramatically now per
rust-oleum this product goes on metal
wood concrete aluminum galvanized metal
PVC masonry asphalt vinyl siding plastic
fabric leather and canvas materials so
never what is a two-stage system where
it's simple to apply you spray on your
base coat and wait 30 minutes for it to
dry then spray several light top coats
and allow that to dry for at least 30
minutes before exposing the material to
any kind of liquid now the instructions
inside the box also indicates for the
maximum super hydrophobic performance at
least 12 hours of dry time is suggested
to let the product hear how the box did
indicate this will dry bottom quote a
frosted clear color as you can see in
the video it does dry with its white /
blueish residue so to avoid any mess of
what this item can do I won't be
spraying this on my feet and walking on
water like Jesus so sorry folks no
spraying on the skin here but the the
can does give some safety warnings that
should be mentioned obviously nothing
held us either accidentally or
eventually yes and not to have skin
contact the can specifically states
quote this product contains a chemical
known in the state of California to
cause cancer and birth
effects or other reproductive harm so
brings me into question why only
California does this so just a word of
caution out there so one I specifically
use this for the basics include my
workloads and keeping them as dry as I
can
any water-type liquid literally beads
off the gloves white shoes and hats
would be a common item for people to
treat just to avoid those rainy days and
it works great at an umbrella as well
the water beads right off and your
umbrella stays dry something worthwhile
to me is spraying my toilet scrubber and
plunger after using this to do the dirty
work you can say the toilet tools remain
completely dry hence it's more sanitary
and as you can see when I pull out this
toilet scrubber here there's barely any
water remaining and lastly spray Ghassan
concrete where it's prone to ice or have
sustained substantial amounts of rain it
works great for those who live in the
wintry parts of the world water would
beat off the pavement and prevent water
from pooling and freezing overnight so
those are just some of the more ideal
applications that you can seriously
apply in your personal household and now
on the internet though the videos show
this product doing some amazing things
but the question I had and the point of
my review was would it apply to me in
the real world or is it just cool to
look at and just fun to try it so very
confident that you would have some
applications in mind that I haven't
thought of yet but please share them and
your usage or share your ideas in the
comments below but because of its white
residue and items this does limit its
new significantly applying this to black
dress shoes yielding horrible aesthetics
I was tempted to spray this on my new
sofa set but again it does leave that
white residue I can see more industrial
/ commercial applications I can see this
being applied to let's say paint booths
maybe you high humidity and condensation
areas just to prevent corrosion and rust
linings of funnels barrels etc where a
company needs to reduce waste
those are some of the areas or ideas off
the top of my head but I'm certain
there's more out there though so some
issues I noticed after constant exposure
water would still penetrate through the
fabric also heavy oils such as motor oil
didn't work as well as I thought oil so
it's right into the concrete and my
gloves as well and I did liberally spray
these items down with a huge stage
change so with that being said I can't
dismiss the fact that I never what does
well though to repeal those watery
liquids so the last thing I wanted to
test was its durability and longevity
after spraying this on my gloves it left
it pretty stick the first time I dropped
water on the glove it repelled water
very well after using my gloves and
stretching the fabric materials it did
lose some of its repelling performance
like keep in mind though this isn't this
is because of the material and it's not
because of the spray bailing and fabrics
after one cycle the washing machine that
never went basically washed away so
spraying this on concrete worked great
but over time of abrasion such as
walking concrete of course the layer did
wear off a bit in a respray was
definitely in order and another use I
don't think would work are boats or
applications where it would be submerged
under water after testing my materials
in the waste water there were flakes of
never wet
hence indicating the product was
actually finishing off so maybe one day
never what will have if not yet an
industrial grade formula but again these
two kids that I have here today are for
the consumer and of course a wooden
cutter problems severe or intense and
occasions they're so overall it's a darn
fascinating product and truly does what
it claims to do it's to repel water
dramatically so there are definite
applications where this truly works and
makes sense however because of its white
haze it leaves behind and the durability
longevity makes this item somewhat
limited
use so I'm certain with this items
potential one day we may have a truly
transparent application and we could
have applied it to class or maybe even
colored items routes so for the meantime
I'll use this on my toilet brush and my
white Adidas so again there's still some
use for this product today so I hope you
liked this review that never went from
rust-oleum if you haven't please take
