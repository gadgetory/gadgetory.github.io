review by Jim's review room now the last
several months companies have been
dishing out tablets and they've been all
impressive in their own way
now since announcing in June 2012 LG
themselves decided to stop making
tablets and at that time focus on more
profitable ventures specifically their
smartphones now nearly a year and a half
later
LG's decided to step back in so if you
haven't seen their tablets too much
that's the reason why but today we'll be
looking at the return of the LG tablet
called the G pad 8.3 so without further
adieu we'll get started the specific
model have here is the 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi
only version that comes in black and
they also come in white as well
- priced at $350 which is a pretty hefty
premium considering all the other
tablets start at $229 and goes up to the
recently released iPad Mini with a
Retina display and that's priced at 399
dollars so what we'll do is go over its
physical features first this year's
model the G pad 8.3 comes in slimmer
all-around at 8.5 inches wide four point
nine inches tall and point three to six
inches thin and the tablet comes in
weighing at eleven point nine ounces
which is a little bit more than its
competitors however it is to be expected
nonetheless because it is a bigger
screen competing in the smaller screen
arena so holding on to the G pad it's a
solid product with no flex although it's
one of the thicker tap as compared to
the others in its segments it's still
very thin when you hold in your hands
and you can only tell there's a
difference when you're actually holding
two different tablets at the same time
and I have medium-sized hands and I can
still hold the G pad pretty comfortable
here now the design and its backing is
worth noting being built to what looks
like brushed aluminum and painted to its
corresponding color for the black model
now taken as a whole the G pad is a
beautiful product with clean lines and
some finished side bezels on a tablet
and quality you expect from the premium
price now regarding its physical layout
we'll start at the very top here you
have your three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone port here and to the right in
the middle is the micro SD card slot
that's expandable to 64 gigs and this is
truly handy and I wish all tabs had this
to the right is your infrared sensor so
you can control your TV just like a
remote control and on the right you have
your power and volume buttons on the
side the very bottom that has your
microUSB port for charging and yes you
can connect this to your computer to
charge as well and there's nothing on
the left side of the tablet going on the
front face here the front house is your
1.3 megapixel camera and on the rear a 5
megapixel camera as you can see on the
screen right now or actual photos I've
taken right from the new G pad with no
editing photos are at random and
consists of bright light low-light and
close-ups
so overall the G pad took great photos
and bright lighting however it had a
tough time with shadow detailing showing
some areas where shadows are present as
being a little bit too dark now a low
lighting situation still produced noise
and photos but that's pretty common
among tablets overall the experience was
good but not the best and lastly there's
no assisted LED lighting on the back of
the tablet and finishing up the rear of
the G pad refers to the two stereo
speakers on the back not at maximum
volume they don't produce ear ringing
teenis which is good however there is
those slight distortion on behind notes
from the high notes at times sound a
little bit jumbo or drone out it's it's
not this distinct or clear as you'd
expect from a premium priced tablet and
I'm somewhat surprised though because
the Kindle Fire HDX line offers so much
more immersion and depth to its speakers
but yet for a much cheaper price
so overall they're OK speakers in
regards to quality now regarding the
screen LG has the G pad at a resolution
of 1920 by 1200 which translates to 273
pixels per inch now overall the screen
is clear and even though slightly lower
in pixels per inch the screen is still
beautiful with crisp and clear lettering
and imaging you won't notice the pixel
difference even if you place the screen
close to your eyes and squinted and I
personally have 20/20 vision on the more
important factor I look at nowadays is
color reproduction and contrast now just
like an LED TV you have to have rich
color content and dark blacks and bright
whites to make an image really pop now
the LG G pad does that with clear and
rich colors and skin tone reproduction
is on par as well and that's
washed out or flat so on that aspect
that's very good now moving on
internally in regards to performance and
features the G pet houses a 1.7
gigahertz quad-core processor with 2
gigs of RAM on board and currently runs
an Android jelly bean 4.2.2 now like all
tablets today the basic applications
such as email web surfing and browsing
YouTube all ran flawlessly and without
hitch now all games available today
played with no issues including
graphically intense games even
performing an epic Citadel test which
runs on the Unreal Engine yielded
average frame rates to be about 59 FPS
which is really good the only new
nuances I noticed it's probably in the
coating though once in a while I noticed
a slight hitch or delay as problem as
this machine is that shouldn't be
happening though overall it's only a
slight and very minor nuisance but in
the end the machine is capable of
everything that you throw at it in
regards to better and usage playing with
the G pad all day utilizing web surfing
email YouTube videos etc and you did at
about 7 1/2 hours of news and auto
brightness now a bit on the lower end
compared to its competitors though and
playing this unit in and my wattage
meter show the unique consumed about
eight watts while plugged in and
continues and now I'm moving on to the
user experience now Android is installed
on the system and LG puts its overlay to
provide additional features that only LG
offers the system is very easy to use in
my opinion and also customizing my
screen to my fitting improves my
productivity now everything can be moved
around just by holding down the icon
then dragging it to your location and
I'll go over the most notable features
first that are truly unique LG offers
its Q line of functions and the first
one is Q pair a Q pair allows your G pad
to be synced with your Android powered
smartphone and anytime you receive a
phone call or a text message it will
show up on your tablet as well through a
pop-up notification and pairing the
phone and achieve the G pad was easy as
the instructions are very
straightforward now although you might
not think of it too much at the moment
it's still a nice feature to have and
ashlee convenient once you actually set
it up and you only need to do it once
and then you're set you can think of the
tablet now being a true extend
of your smartphone the next item here is
huge slide a cue slide is very important
and it's a sign that tablets are slowly
and starting to become true multitasking
machines now with cue slide and it seems
him some has nearly an identical feature
and you can access these eight different
applications and have them run in the
foreground while you have other things
going on in the background in the past
you would have to close one app then
open another so only one amp was
viewable at a time so now as an example
of using this feature you would be
accessing your calendar while having a
webpage up to put in a reminder or let's
say you run a calculator while you have
other numbers in the background and of
course you can adjust this window and
you can change the size in the
foreground app to see fit cue memo is
the next and very similar to the Samsung
Galaxy Note I just reviewed you can
write on your screen and save it to
either share it or retain it for future
reference now this feature is unique
when you want to draw directions for
somebody and then email to them or let's
say if I have a photo and sometimes
describing what I want is difficult I
can use action cues to draw what I'm
trying to describe an example would be
indicating in the picture what to do
with a certain object as I've done here
in this video and then other items
include knock-on where you tap on your
tablet to wake it up from a dark screen
and this other feature called slide
aside where you take three fingers and
slide an app over to access it later so
the more I can do this review the funny
thing is though the more I notice how
Samsung has very similar features it's
pretty interested in see but overall the
rest of the features are just real basic
and almost redundant of other tasks that
are already performed through other
methods so in general I consider this to
be a good tablet it has a bigger screen
than the other brands multitasking
capabilities a decent amount of features
that's not offered on some other tablets
such as a micro SD card slot and the
physical build on this tablet is
top-notch now the processor is fast
enough for my needs
but those minor stutters deters me from
purchasing a small tablet at such a
premium price then honestly with my
experience with the speaker's was a bit
of a downer again the Kindle Fire HDX
and
seven has amazing speakers but sells for
a cheaper price and the iPads are
premium price but they do come a very
good components all around them so if
you're not really needing or desired to
have multitasking capabilities and can
pass on the micro SD card slot you might
look elsewhere to find a much cheaper
deal overall it's a good tablet and if
you will definitely utilize those unique
features mentioned only at that time
this tablet is worth those extra dollars
so I hope you enjoyed this review of the
LG G pad 8.3 and if you can please like
