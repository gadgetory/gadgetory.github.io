room Yui or Ultimate Ears
finally has a new small speaker to
compete and I'm happy to see them
offering something in between the Yui
role and the UE boom as always being
transparent on my channel Ultimate Ears
did send me the speaker to test under
embargo here so I did have this for a
while just to see what this is all about
prices are on your screen and looking at
the competitors they're looking squarely
in the eyes of the new JBL flip for now
I have a dedicated and detailed
comparison on that very shortly and last
I'll place my Amazon affiliate links in
the video description below click on my
links down there and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time you
never know when these things might go on
sale so without further ado my channel
is here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
remove the physical features first the
Wonder broom is quite compact the design
gives it a nice soft look but how it's
made as identical to the other Yui
products these things are built like
tanks it's dust mud and stain resistant
it's also drop resistance from up to 5
feet which I've tested it's also ipx7
certified meaning this can go underwater
for up to one meter and up to 30 minutes
at a time and one of the biggest
benefits compared to the Yui roll - or
they newly released JBL foot for this
speaker can float on its own there's
peace of mind while you're at the lake
and it's also perfect by the pool and if
you do have kids you may tend to sort of
speaker in the water now I'm taking a
closer look here you have power and
pairing up top the Yui logo also works
as a way to control your music with one
tap to pause and play a double tap will
skip your song forward but no controls
to go back unfortunately a triple tap
would have worked perfectly here last
with the same Yui logo you can double up
with another you you wonder boom and
have two speakers play at the same time
but there wasn't an option to allow for
audio separation simply left and right
audio channels but the two speakers
playing at the same time does fill a
room much more than obviously just one
also second I do want to mention this
double up method only works with another
wonder boom speaker you can't mix and
match with the boom - or the mega boom
at this time apparently two speakers
together is very easy and unlike the
previous Yui products no app is needed
hold the logo down at the same time and
they pair instantly with each other now
moving on here volume up and down are
located on the front pressing both at
the same time gives you somewhat of a
battery indicator it plays a certain
tone to indicate either full medium or
low battery left now this is one of my
biggest gripes though simply having the
speaker speak the percentage would have
been great even five white LEDs would
have been more intuitive it's not a deal
breaker but something simpler or more
precise I think any
consumer would appreciate lastly all the
buns are very responsive now we rotate
into the rear is a port for the microUSB
cable to charge the speaker here
no exhilarate is offered for physical
connections so just a heads up on that
but you is claiming better life to be up
to ten hours of use and with my testing
at 50% of I'm doing all my speaker's I
was able to get 10 hours in 20 minutes I
did a second test just in case here but
this time at full blast a full volume
and was able to achieve 2 hours and 50
minutes to be exact almost 3 hours
regarding Bluetooth signal strength UE
pulls through climbing up to 100 feet of
signal performance within my house here
the signal went through several walls
and the first floor ceiling I left the
phone downstairs walked upstairs with
the Bluetooth speaker never wanted the
wonder boom ever cut out and signal now
last before I give you the audio demo
one of the biggest selling features
though on the boom products they do
provide 360 audio outputs no matter
which side of the speaker is standing on
you're going to experience direct audio
so let's get some samples going here
I'll play several songs for you guys and
then I'll give you my verdict afterwards
no I
and there you have it folks
of course audio recorded on my end and
then played through your speakers or not
the best depiction of audio quality but
head to my review here it's a very loud
speaker for such a small and compact
size it's perfect for small rooms and
for short loud enough for medium rooms
as well now when I spoke with Yui they
did disclose they went with a more
balanced sound signature it's not a
basic Bluetooth speaker it doesn't sound
bass boosted either and that's fine for
those who do prefer that type of
listening now those who are familiar
with the boom 2 in mega boom don't find
the audio characteristics similar to the
Wonder boom here and which are at the
time I did enjoy the speaker as a casual
speaker as most genres performed good
there are a few select songs once in a
while where there is slight rasp eNOS or
distortion between the upper bass
frequencies and lower end of the
mid-range more noticeable at higher
volumes
now same with the mid-range that's
somewhat forward which I do personally
like but at times the high frequencies
do get sharp and takes away from the
experience and as with most Bluetooth
speakers there's no audio separation or
an open soundstage so overall the
characteristics are again very much
similar to the other UE boom speakers or
it is loud where it provides a more
neutral bass sound signature compared to
so many competitors out there I would
say the biggest selling point and why
you would choose the wonder boom over
some of the competitors it's not
necessarily its audio performance but
the fact that it is compact it floats in
water and the biggest reason I think is
it's built rugged as hell complete peace
of mind basically so that's it for this
