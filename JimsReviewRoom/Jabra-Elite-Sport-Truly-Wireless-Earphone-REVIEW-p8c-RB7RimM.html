hey everyone Jimmy would Jim's review
room truly wireless earphones are
picking up traction
we've seen smaller independent companies
bringing these to market and now big-box
names like Samsung Apple and Motorola
are bringing their own versions with
their special features beyond and audio
experience drebber was very nice enough
to send two of these to me not sure what
to set me to but I'm going to give one
of them away on this channel so be sure
to subscribe if you haven't already
these retail for $249 at the time this
video they can be on the upper end in
regards to pricing but as always I'll
place my link in the video description
below click on my links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
so without further ado my channels here
to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
go over the physical features first
these are completely made of plastic yes
is still very durable the driver at
least our ip67 certified meeting their
dust tight and not only splash proof
when you can submerge these underwater
up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes I
have poured water all over these things
and they're still functioning perfectly
fine now when you look at the
competition the job boards here keep
ready - and the motorola Berber ones
plus are the only ones with the ip67
certification while others are there
just splash proof or offers no
protection whatsoever now moving on to
the Elise doesn't use touch sensitivity
which would make the experience that
much smoother but Jabra is using a
physical button ears to adjust volume
and to access other features which I'll
go over shortly the buns are responsive
but a slight push into the ear is needed
each time now let's take a look at the
left ear bud plus and minus are there to
adjust volume depending on your music
app a long tap will either skip a song
for about 15 seconds ahead or so and for
some other F it was skipped to the next
song altogether and they're right here
but the bottom button is used to turn on
and pair the earphones and with that
same button with a double tap you can
turn on the microphone so you can hear
your environment perfect for time you
don't need passive noise isolation while
running and you want to hear your
surroundings for safety purposes now the
very top button opens up your Jabra
sport app and a very long press will
start a workout activity again which
I'll get into detail right after I talk
about comfort now in the box you get
small medium and large tips and wings
first testing the silicone need rubber
elites do stay in the air during my
entire run they're not heavy at all and
at worst case scenario for me the upper
part of the earphones ever so slightly
pulled away from my ears but the
earphones never falls out in the retail
packaging your expanding foam ear tips
they do increase the amount of noise
isolation and more importantly they say
more secure or snug than my ear versus
the silicone you can tell a difference
by using one over the other but if you
want that ultimate fit the best in noise
isolation
looking for today's video sponsor it's
from comply foam now them personally
using their foam ear tips on my Jay bird
freedoms and x3 you see me wear them in
those reviews but I have worn them here
with the job release and seriously one
they provide the best foam
expansion to fit into my ear canals
number two they do help with keeping the
earphones in while running here and
three they do block out the most noise
from my experience now these are the
truly wireless model but they do make a
variety of phone ear tips so check them
out and get they make one for your
earphones already I place their link in
the video description below they take
you to their website or visit them
directly at comply foam comm now jumping
on through battery life on this thing
here it's ready to up to three hours of
continuous music playing with or without
the health tracking that's per driver
there with my personal testing I'm
getting about two and a half hours to
two hours and 45 minutes worth of
playback and that's with me testing
these while running that's with the
heart rate tracking of heart rate
sensors activated as well now there
isn't an auto shutoff mode when you take
off these earphones from my experience
taking off just the right earbud your
left ear but of course stays about
you're here that will actually go on
standby and stop music while on the
right ear bud you can actually still
hear music going now if I took off both
of these earphones at the same time it's
the same result the job at least doesn't
auto pause for some odd reason but will
continue to play music in just the right
earbud alone with the case you do get an
extra two full charges for a total of
nine hours of use if you were to include
a full charge of the earphones
themselves the only thing that I found
really missing and these so far is the
lack of onboard memories you locally
store your music and the earphones
themselves and again the touch gestures
to adjust volume and toggle functions
like these temps on icon X and briny -
that would have been a bit more
intuitive now let's take a look at all
the health tracking options so this is
possibly the number one reason why you
would pay the premium and consider
health tracking earphones over some
normal ear film that just simply plays
music now these drivers sport lights
available for both Apple and Android has
been in the works for some time here the
F has been ever-evolving and it's gotten
to the point where it really has
everything that you want for one you can
have the app track and segment and
abundance of activities from basic
walking running and cycling and if it's
not on the list for some reason you can
customize and simply create a sport
profile for yourself now you can set a
goal whether you want to go a certain
distance a certain duration or if you
want to burn a certain amount of
calories you can set that up keep in
mind the
of distance and speed is based on your
phone's GPS there's no built-in GPS in
the earphones themselves now while
you're performing your workout the job
release will periodically come on
through the earphones any voice prompt
will tell you how fast you're moving how
much distance you have gone down to
eating cadence pace and sense there's
even heart rate tracking built-in heart
rate heart rate zones are also disclosed
right through the earbuds themselves
distance
Sera's miles in one minute heart rate 52
beats per minute
cadence zero steps per minute workout
completed distance zero miles in two
minutes and 31 seconds training Effect
one this workout was easy for you
calories one average heart rate fifty
eight beats per minute heart rate zone
light average cadence 35 that's per
minute but alerts can be set up for
every minute - every hour or at certain
distances it's all completely up to you
now in addition to these freeform
activities there's a guided workouts if
you're into that some infinities you use
these movement sensors inside the
earbuds themselves so there's automated
rep counting each crunch that you do or
each pushup let's say you do the jobless
does a pretty good job at counting each
rep so there's a decent amount already
in the app itself if we kind of work out
but you can customize your own workouts
and basic create certain workout steps
by manually making a workout routine now
the very last set of features here that
I want to touch base on are the extra
health of measurements that Jabra is
offering now vo2 max measurements are
offered in determining where your health
levels are perform a guided fitness test
with the app and in the end a sport life
app give you a baseline on where your
house is I have their multitude reading
that do two tests here redo that test
and see where you stand amongst your
peers also after each activity the
driver app lets you know when your
fitness levels are that's comparable to
others within your age and weight the
very less health measurement is
recovering time based on your previous
workouts your intensity heart rate
efforts the app helps determine how much
rest you need before you can function at
your peak once again
so to finish up the health aspect I want
to discuss heart rate accuracy I use my
tried-and-true polar h7 chest strap to
compare and like most other heart rate
sensors optical heart rate sensors that
is they provide you with a good idea of
where your heart rate is but it's not
100% accurate interval runs or workout
to where your heart rate elevate them
descends down quite a bit it seems a
jumper it leaps had a little trouble
keeping up overall and to be fair most
applicants enters with a wrist base or
other earphones that measures your heart
rate on your earlobes the jabra has
similar results but moving on here how's
the sound quality but job release
provides a nice punchy amount of bass is
not as bass boost sounding like the
jaybird earphones if you guys are
familiar with them however you can tell
this based on basic tracks enough to
have music enjoyable all around the like
basically mid-range is also neutral for
my experience offering a clean and clear
experience nothing brighter boxing but I
do wish though that the mid-range would
stand out a little bit more same with
the higher frequencies as well just to
give it a bit more bytes or more sparkle
you can say to the music but at the end
of the day the elites are very easy to
listen to it offers very good quality
here for the average consumer
even the sound stage there is a moderate
amount there if you can get a perfect
seal again use those noise isolation
foam ear tips that aren't included in
the package the noise isolation helps
out big-time so that's it for this
review here overall for the price that
you pay the drop relief does give you
practically everything a pair of sport
earphones and truly wireless earphones
can offer today from a very good audio
experience to a robust lineup of fitness
features it's very much working look at
if you're in the market for again truly
