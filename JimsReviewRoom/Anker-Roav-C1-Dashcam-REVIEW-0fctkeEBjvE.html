room it's been maybe a year or two since
I reviewed a dashcam I'm personally not
attempting to see if I can find one any
better anchor did reach out to me and
sent me a review unit to tests but as
always I'll be sure to give you a 100%
unbiased review the Anchor Rove retails
for $129 however at the time this video
I have seen them on sale for $100
instead I'll place my Amazon affiliate
links in the video description below
click on those links and they will give
you the most updated prices in real time
you never know when these things might
go on sale so sit back relax and
hopefully my videos can help you make
that purchase decision welcome everyone
to jim's review room
door over the physical features the rove
goes with a clean and straightforward
design starting up top you have the
insert for a microSD card and some dash
cams do have compatibility issues with
certain brands however I was able to
confirm with my Kingston in SanDisk 32
and 64 gigabyte models they do work the
robe is connected using a micro USB
ports instead of a mini USB port which
helps with offering more compatibility
with wires laying around your house and
on the left side you have your enough
button and a little speakerphone that is
quite loud with this chirps fortunately
you're able to turn this off in the menu
before discussing the 2.4 inch screen
and its touch buttons the robe does
apply a super-long micro USB cable I
measured it at 10 feet long which is
enough for my car if I were to run the
cables along the headliner the a-pillar
and under the glovebox to the cigarette
lighter now most dash cams comes with a
moderately sized that huge plug but the
one anchor provides is the smallest I've
seen in addition you get two USB ports
one for the camera of course the other
port you can use to charge your phone
now getting back to the camera this was
possibly the most subjective part of the
review it uses 3m double-sided tape to
stick to your windshield that's
ridiculously sticky and even lightly
pressing it against a glass for the
first time it stays on strong so be sure
to align it the best that you can the
first time the camera mounts along the
angle of the glass so in an event that
you need to go through the menu settings
your angle viewing is severely downward
that might be a con for you and the flip
side and this might be the very reason
why you prefer this design at eye height
when driving I rarely if ever see the
dashcam itself it doesn't obstruct my
vision at all you can still unmount the
road quite easily by sliding it off
changing your settings then and sliding
it back on as a side note during my week
of testing the dashcam does not fall off
when turning and in the recent 90 degree
weather that heat inside the car has not
caused the dashcam to unstick from the
windshield
anchor also provides a Wi-Fi option and
an app where it provides all of your
menu settings and the option to review
your safe footage without the need to
move the dashcam itself so that's one
way to work around it my personal
opinion I do prefer a more versatile and
flexible suction cup in the event I
would ever need to move the camera to
another car or if I would like to
realign my camera with greater ease now
if you're looking for a dashcam comment
down below let me know if
design works for you or not going over
its features there's continuous looping
of your footage when your memory card
fills up the dash cam will delete your
oldest videos and save the newest ones
very much standard on any dash cam now
one setting I did notice missing was the
ability to change the recorded length of
each video and despite the lack of
flexibility for the end user from the
factory the standard recording time is
three minutes before the dash cam
records a new file in my opinion three
minutes is still very reasonable there
is a G sensor or what I would rather
call a collision sensor when the dash
cam senses a considerable collision the
rove automatically saves the file lacks
it so no one can accidentally delete it
just in case any file would not be
overwritten when the memory card fills
up and continues with loop recording
there is a built-in battery in with
motion detection when someone or
something walks her drives by the car
while your car is off in parked the
camera will start recording then stop
when there's no more motion a handy
feature in a parking lot or parking
garage moving on looking at the user
interface the rove is one the easiest
ones to use here there's touch sensitive
menu keys on the bottom and selecting
through to tackle the different settings
is simply done by pressing ok as shown
on screen
the display is 2.4 inches it's enough to
align your camera view recorded content
if you'd like and display does turn off
after 30 seconds a minute or you can
have the screen stay permanently on
after you start driving but let's move
on to the video footage everything you
see on your screen is completely
unedited and comes direct from the road
dash camera itself from my assessment
the 1080p display is very good for a
dashcam here some of the things that you
want to look out for is the clarity of
lesson plates while a vehicle is in
front of you the numbers and letters
aren't very much attainable for
insurance purposes the other aspect to
look for is field of view the rove
offers 145 degrees viewing angle which
isn't bad as the lower-end dash cams
offers 120 degrees and on the upper end
there's - temps at these similar price
range featuring a hundred and seventy
degrees of viewing angles instead anchor
falls right in between and highways
you're able to see over your front and
fenders for sort of catching anyone
possibly merging into you at
intersections field of view is important
as well if someone runs a stop sign or
red light you're able to get a glimpse
of them on the sides but I'll meant
though the other 170 degree cameras
might be a better option
now you can be the judge if this is
enough for you other video features you
want to make sure that you have here is
great night time performance most des
Champs do struggle here with too much
glare or maybe too much noise in the
image an Kerr does as well as my 180
dollar dashcam that I Drive with on a
normal basis blacks are blacks colors
are accurate there is some glaring as
with most dash cams at times when you do
pull right off to the lesson plates but
it's not as bad as other cheaper dash
cams on the market now what is recorded
is better than others that I personally
experienced and having a dashcam in
general is better than not having one at
all in the end after my assessment with
the Grove before the price it's very
reasonable for what it offers the only
error that I would really critique here
was the mounting of the dashcam itself
but again there's pros and cons behind
that you can be the judge and the
positive sign it does come with most
standard features that you see on other
dash cams available and the video
quality for $99 it does really well so
