room Samsung is back again with her
second-generation fitness pan and not to
hype this up here but the gear fit too
has to be the closest thing that you can
buy of having a fitness band and
SmartWatch in one I'll think of it kind
of like a hybrid of sorts Fitbit has the
blaze Garmin has the vivoactive HR and
polar introduced the a 360 just the name
of you here the most activity trackers
offers great health benefits but the
SmartWatch side of things are a bit
lacking with the gear fit - it's great
it's not perfect and on detail why but
starting off here I did personally buy
this at the retail price of a hundred
and seventy nine dollars retail with GPS
and real-time heart rate readings built
in it's actually quite a steal but click
on my links in the description below my
links will give you the most updated
prices as of today in real time and if
you do decide to purchase it does help
go towards the channel so without
further ado my work is here to help you
make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's review room gulnur of
the physical features first for your
reference I am working at large the band
is very soft and smooth but a subtle
amount of stretch is not a stretch as
the fitbit products but while running
and working out with weights the gear
fit - still feels very comfortable to
wear now one of the biggest perks if the
band ever becomes damaged or if you
happen to want to change colors here the
straps are detachable with no special
tools press the button on the rear and
slide each side out now one area that I
did have a concern is the button and nub
style locking mechanism most other bands
that uses this method rather big garment
or Under Armour whoever it may be
there's usually two buttons for a more
secure hole however during my time
testing never did the straps undo on me
and hopefully with this material the
holes don't wear down and become loose
over time but again you can swap these
bands out now looking at the rear of the
gear fit - there is the built-in optical
heart rate sensor which I'll get into
detail shortly
these are charging terminals to pair
this with the supplied charging cradle
Samsung offers a magnetic hole to simply
drop this in here and about an hour and
a half - to the gear fit will fully
charge from a dead
battery it regards to use Samsung claims
three to four days and from my
experience I've been averaging four days
in about an hour without any exercising
or logged fitness activities now if you
are running about a mile with GPS and
the heart rate sensor on during those
runs I'm averaging around three days of
use now it is a shorter life span than
other activity bands out there
however the display which is coming up
next and the features offered justifies
for these shorter battery life at least
that's my opinion now facing the front
of the tracker here the sides are
tactile return and menu buttons here
regarding this gorgeous screen here this
is hands-down the best one I've seen on
a hybrid fitness tracker I haven't had
one issue of lag or stutters the entire
menu system is very fluid and everything
is simply huge and easy to read with a
1.5 inch curved touchscreen with s
AMOLED from Samsung offering deep blacks
and very vibrant colors here running on
a very sunny day in person at least the
screen is still readable not the best
but does perform very well by going back
indoors here on the main home page you
have various screens that you can
display from an animal clock to numerix
detailing your steps and calories burn
and other sort of information that you
may seem useful no change in your screen
is graciously done right on the band
itself and there's no need to use your
phone to change the displays unlike most
other competitors out there on the
market but in addition you can download
more screens both free and some causing
$1.00 to to have a variety other than
the factory options not to download more
strange of course you need to go through
the gear app and your phone
the swiping right offers calories burn
with a colored wheel indicating times
you are active sleeping or being dormant
tapping Emma's offers a linear breakdown
and going past that offers a history of
past performance tapping again on that
linear portion breaks this down even
further by offering how much time you've
been active or not active and your
lowest to highest heart rate range you
can decide how useful this information
is backing out completely next is to
start an exercise keep in mind the gear
fit 2 can auto recognize some workouts
here such as running biking rowing with
running and biking I did confirm to work
and it worked very accurately here but
while on the workout screen I'm using
running as an example since it's the
most popular you have your duration with
your set target goal your heart rate
real time heart rate information that is
directly below that
swiping right is your distance next
bernd pace speed and last is your heart
rate once again just in a bigger display
I did confirm while in exercise mode the
screen doesn't stay on as I'm sure it's
to conserve battery when you are done
running down the screen offers all the
information that we just went over
including a map at the very bottom and a
graph of some performance data that's
pretty impressive something I haven't
seen another band offered to date making
the band quite engaging
after being on some unknown trails or
unfamiliar parts of the city through a
run or maybe biking now backing all the
way out once again here the screen
offers your steps tap on this and
Samsung just provides a plethora of
information here you can compare this
week's average steps versus last week's
and see if you need to pick up the pace
we're not hitting that back button the
next screen of info are your floors
climbed swiping right is your heart rate
data with your lows and highs for the
day and regarding heart rate readings
the gear fit to periodically samples
your heart rates when you're not active
or moving too much and takes a sample
then now when you are running the HR
data again is being displayed in real
time and regarding accuracy like most
we're space trackers there is some
variability but I can say gear fit too
looks to offer average readings as you
can see the charts here and I had to
draw these lines that get a bit more of
a precise reading here of 1d heartbeat
start and stop but comparing to my Under
Armour chest strap which has been highly
accurate as my polar h7 the numbers are
within a few heartbeats as circled on
your screen the air is where I did
notice a difference though a huge
difference is Ali when the heart rate
drops this one time with a deviation of
up to 10 however every other spike and
drop there's a deviation of about 2 or 3
heart beats again which is about the
same or similar to other most risk based
trackers now the only other observation
that I notice here I notice these
Samsung is not as dynamic or as fast
that's reading my chest strap as you can
see how quickly or how fast your heart
rate changes and it's reflected on the
teal chart but on the Samsung the lines
are ultra smooth and flowing again it's
not crazy off I've definitely seen worse
but if you're serious about heart rate
data I believe there's some more precise
model out there as for accuracy in
regards to distance speed pace it's very
accurate and equivalent to when I use my
phone's GPS to measure during my runs so
besides all the health features here and
it's pretty robust of what this does
display right on your wrist we have to
take a look at these Smart Watch
features from the homepage swiping left
pulls up off your notifications this
will display your text message
in full unlike some other trackers where
it only provides a summary text messages
in Google hangout email - push
notifications from other third party
apps will alert you here the only real
gripe that I had with this if you want
to clear notification you have to scroll
all the way down and tap that clear icon
or if you want to go back on the screen
you can't simply just swipe left or
right you have to take that extra step
and physically push that back button not
a bigger issue at all it's not
streamlined or intuitive like a
SmartWatch where swiping notifications
works perfectly fine there now you do
receive call alerts when someone calls
you and you want to accept a rejected
phone call you can just swipe a door and
there's no built-in microphone so if you
are responding via text message there's
no voice to text option and that would
have been amazing but without that
built-in mic you also can't use the okay
Google option for voice commands and
prompts to come up most smartwatches at
least offers the okay Google option that
would have made this tracker complete
beast but regarding those text messages
there's a simple phrases that you can
use to respond to a message here in some
samsung emojis - which is always nice
it's on alternative I guess no other
awesome features press that menu button
on the side and this thing has a music
player you can truly leave your phone at
home here and store music alright on the
band itself and pair this through some
wireless earphones and you can have
music while you're running and since
we're on the menu options here you can
manually check your heart rate pair
another gear fit to band and compete
with each other you can see each other's
data manually keep a friendly log of how
much water or coffee you drank for the
day find your phone if you ever lose it
a built-in timer and stopwatch here is a
feature as well and the very last option
unlike every other band currently on the
market
Samsung allows you to download other
third-party apps right onto the band
like Spotify as one perfect example I do
admit though the Galaxy app store there
isn't much to download and there's
always been that struggle there
the lack of third-party app support but
at least you have a few options vs. none
now the last bit of information I want
to discuss about the physical band
besides having an amazing screen and
vibrant display here like most other
trackers and smartwatches the screen
does come on automatically when your
wrist moves up a very natural motion if
you're checking under time like
any normal watch bother than that that's
essentially everything on the physical
side of things for the gear fit to
visually the app is very easy on the
eyes and fitting to the average consumer
these are steps taken sleeping analysis
which is equipment to fit bed it's
pretty basic - similar to many other
sleep trackers out there there's just
light and deep sleep versus being
restless the only thing that I found
lacking is a linear line graph just to
see my trends a bit better over a month
or maybe over the year the bar graph
that is provided by Samsung
it is something but competitors like
Fitbit or my other band here from Under
Armour one glance you get an idea of
what your average is your goals and what
you're actually performing now one perk
though when you do perform a run the s
health app doesn't provide a very good
amount of data for you to review from
average speed to pace to elevation and
even down to heartbeat information the
other aspect is the weather as well
although I would have liked a weather
widget on the band itself I didn't see
one in the gear store at the time this
video but at least the weather
conditions are saved here as I'm sure
that would impact anyone's performance
and you can always come back and review
it now also the s health app recently
received an update name is compatible
with a wider variety of third-party apps
examples like Fitbit Garmin RunKeeper
Strava just to name a few the data you
collect on there can easily be synced
with these programs the only issue that
I've noticed though when using RunKeeper
my chest strap data didn't sync to the s
health and they gear fit to heart rate
data from my running here from the wrist
then in sync back to run keeper so just
a heads-up on that the heart rate
information doesn't transfer over to
other programs it seems like so in the
end here I truly believe for the average
consumer this is a great band with
above-average information and the band
itself regarding the app it does provide
a good robust amount of information
again the only thing that I'm griping
about I guess you can say is the trend
line button that it provides a lot of
information and again it's very easy to
read as well now if you are more fitness
focus health focus the other competitors
and I'm being completely honest they do
provide easier to reach friends and a
bit more detailed analytical data
specifically Garmin I mean they're very
very detailed however when it comes
through the physical band itself again
from the gorgeous display to the robust
amount of SmartWatch like features to it
fluid performance and last but not least
the price the gear fits who comes highly
recommended this watcher ban is the
closest thing in blending both worlds
together at the moment so I hope this
