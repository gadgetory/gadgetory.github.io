room besides the release of Windows 10
their new Lumia smartphones in the
surface book and surface pro 4 being
released the Microsoft band makes a
comeback and it does truly make me
wonder though how much has improved over
last year's model now the price has gone
up slightly to two hundred and forty
nine dollars retail as of this video but
I'll place a link in the video
description below click that and you can
see what the current prices are today so
without further adieu I'm here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's
review
first getting into comforts for your
reference I'm wearing the medium-sized
band one thing I must say though this is
a huge improvement over the last model
the OLED display up top and the sides
now curved to fit the contour of your
wrist unlike that very stiff and
straight edge display last year even a
strap to the band where one stiff is now
for the most part very flexible but it's
still not 100% although this hasn't
greatly improved there's still the
slight bulge down here at the clasp and
this will get in your way if you do rest
your palm on the table when typing in
regards to working out like all wrist
heartrate trackers the band is still
worn snug then not necessarily tight it
is recommended to be worn prior to the
wrist bone for increased accuracy for
the heart rate readings and to be honest
with you this does feel much better once
you do move it kind of back here now if
you're used to wearing watches or other
types of bands at or closer to the wrist
bone there is discomfort or clenching
when you do move your hand back and
forth a perfect example is when you're
doing dumbbell curls or let's say
military presses when compared to most
other activity bands and smartwatches on
the market the Microsoft band still
unfortunately isn't the most comfortable
but compared again to the old Microsoft
band this is a serious huge improvement
before getting into the buttons and
interface the locking mechanism works
perfect at staying secure however one
huge flaw yet it's only cosmetic this
thing scratches up pretty bad even just
within the first two days of using
within a week you can see how badly this
thing can get I just want to point that
out to you guys the end of the band
physically connects to the supplied USB
charger that's magnetized for an easy
connection and regarding battery life
microsoft claims up to two days of use
and for my testing without using gps i
was able to average one day 14 hours and
38 minutes to be precise now on a day
that I did use gps for a 30 minute run
I noticed the battery would last about
24 hours I comparing these numbers to
dedicated fitness trackers like jawbone
Garmin or Fitbit it's not that great as
these bands are averaging around five to
seven days at the moment of battery life
as for smartwatches this is actually not
bad smartwatches usually average around
one to two days of use so it really
depends on how the consumer would value
the Microsoft band to is it
of a SmartWatch or is it more of an
activity tracker but going back to the
top you have the Display button to turn
on the screen and to the right is the
action or execute feature and I'm not
sure why this isn't on default but you
do have the option of going into your
settings and turning on watch mode which
enables the band to turn on the screen
when you do turn your wrist facing up
towards you it works for the most part
and on par with other smartwatches but
like most smartwatches if you're not at
the right particular angle or right
position it won't show not a negative
but again this is something that's
typical amongst these SmartWatch
category here overall the display is
very bright a very smooth interface and
very responsive to now rotating to the
back the optical heart rate sensor has
moved here which I'll detail in the
fitness section later in the review and
the apps inside our galvanic skin
response sensors which absolutely
displays no information for you per
Microsoft it's only there to read when
you do wear the band and when you don't
so the band can adjust its other sensors
other features you can't see right off
the bat there's a barometer to measure
how many flights of stairs you've
climbed which is new for the band too a
UV sensor which honestly I don't see
myself using and last is a skin
temperature reader GPS and a microphone
for use with your Windows Phone and it's
voice recognition system Cortana and
before I forget here this is one of the
few bands on the market at the moment
that does work for Apple Android and of
course window phones this was once a
huge selling point for window users but
Fitbit Garmin and polar are some of the
few companies now offering compatibility
to all three Phone operating systems
today but let's go through the display
real quick
starting this on you have your time and
with the action button you can leave
either the date displayed distance
walked calories burned flights of stairs
climbed heart rates and last is total
steps holding display down and pulling
right reviews that I have bluetooth on
with the HR sensor working and on the
bottom remaining battery life tapping on
the main screen will offer the
information I just mentioned here but
just a little bit bigger for easier
reading and then swiping left reveals
tiles similar to the Windows operating
system and they're similar products now
my configuration could be a little bit
different than yours since you can
completely rearrange these and add or
remove tiles at your choosing my first
tile here is messaging basically any
text messages would show up here next or
all of my smart
certifications that actually shows up on
my phone such as Instagram hang up
messages and really just all the other
notifications again it will show up here
last is basically emails now it's going
to the next screen here are missed phone
calls my calendar and the last tile is
the start
- what fitness activities the band - can
record this includes running biking
golfing and weightlifting again I'll go
into detail on how these work pretty
soon next up is sleeping in which like
other sleep trackers on the market this
does require you to manually tell the
band when you do lay down it's not
automatic you can set up a silent
vibrating alarm which works pretty
strong for waking me up in the morning
without disturbing my significant other
and the other feature is the smart alarm
which wakes you up within a 30-minute
window prior to your actual wakeup time
you've set the band based on its sensors
will attempt to wake you up at your
lightest point of sleep in theory having
you feel not as agitated as if you had
woken up from a deep sleep but one thing
I got emit that the American soft band
and the band too does very well is the
sleep tracking this differentiates my
total hours actually slept versus the
total time in bed there's also an
efficiency rating and it's accurate
wearing a second watch my basis peak to
sleep at the same time of course for
testing purposes both showed similar
results on nights that achieved 90%
sleep efficiency and higher I do feel
more energetic when I do first wake up
and that's prior to me checking the band
so there's really no placebo effect or
false positives backing onto the tiles
once again the clock offers several
features including a reminder to vibrate
you at your set time there's a timer to
countdown and for the Fitness folks out
there there's also a stopwatch feature
built in going back I have a Twitter
notification tile I added a weather app
is next to show today's in the next
several days weather predictions and
very last are your settings here just
briefly showing what the app has that I
have included on my towel strip there's
a finance tile Starbucks payment option
facebook notifications and whatnot now
one thing I wanted to mention which I
failed to mention in the original
Microsoft Banner review Microsoft does
allow for third-party app developers to
use the sensors and the band to offer
more tiles to use then what comstock
similar to Android wear
Apple watches operating system now how
robust or how abundant considering both
after mentioned competitors are really
huge Giants in the market right now the
Microsoft App Store is quite lacking
when compared but let's talk about
Fitness since this is huge for some
people going back to the running tile as
an example one of the first prompts is
if you want GPS on or not for any
moderate to serious runner out there I
highly recommend using GPS and any
activity band or even your phones for
much better accuracy in the data you'll
be collecting a GPS per Microsoft has
been improved and it definitely does
show searching for a signal on a rainy
or cloudy day here the Microsoft band to
still found a signal in a reasonable
amount of time running with my
smartphone with GPS enabled and
geo-mapping the distance pace and
accuracy was on par with my phone's GPS
when you're running biking or whatnot
the screen stays on all the time showing
your pace time elapsed and distance and
then swiping right reveals your HRO
readings calories burned and whatnot but
regarding HR accuracy using my trusty
chest strap that I've used time and time
again and shown to be very accurate
I find the Microsoft band to when
stationary works fine but during runs
this thing is very much off and before
any criticism believe me I try to make
this thing work and I do have experience
from all the fitbit's mio basses and
recently the jawbone products which all
have some kind of heart rate tracking
built into the band's itself now I am
wearing this before my wrist bone which
is advised by any risk-based HR activity
tracker and after running random
distances stopping to compare my
readings the Microsoft band is usually
short time in time in time again as
improving in the video I then move the
band further up my arm again a
suggestion provided by some activity
bands again offering risk based readings
and although it was a little bit better
it was still not accurate
I went even further and the next day
gives us another shot this time wearing
the band with the sensor on the inside
of my wrist and forearm and just looking
at these charts you can see how off and
how low they are again very very
unfortunate from my testing and one last
test I cross-referenced this with my
basis peak and wearing much h7 chest
strap you can see again the result
on the screen but let's go over the
Microsoft health app real quick and see
what this has to offer and the main home
page Microsoft really kept it simple and
familiar with the Windows theme steps
and calories are at the top and if you
performed any runs cycling golfing or
weightlifting this will show up here and
last all the way at the bottom is the
total hours of sleep from the ignite
prior now going back up tapping steps
shows you distance floors climbed how
many minutes you were active and a bar
for the total progress going back all
the other tiles appears to look the same
with similar ways on how other data is
presented to you now looking through the
menu options here on the left most are
really self-explanatory like home
history and profile but find a workout
hour pre-loaded guided Fitness videos
and/or coaching on the band for example
if I start this here on the top left
will show the workout to perform and a
countdown and this will cycle through
several exercises to perform including
my rest times it's a feature that some
may find beneficial while some may not
be too engaged with that's really up to
you guys now find a course are for
golfers on the app this will find
probably most of your golf courses
around your area and new to the band too
you can sync that course layout to your
band for golfing features but being
upfront I'm not versed with golfing in
general but here's some of the
information that is displayed on the
band for any golfers that are out there
now back to the main menu what's new is
self-explanatory but in apps this can
sync to the following applications now
if you use RunKeeper for example the
Microsoft band 2 data will sing to the
RunKeeper app so if you don't carry your
phone that distance will be recorded but
it did notice though heart rate
monitoring will be absent backing out
you can personalize the band a bit with
changing the background and the general
color and if you go to the Microsoft App
Store there are some other backgrounds
that you can download there as well now
managing tiles offers you to add up to
13 tiles max onto the band and you have
the option down below to rearrange the
tiles to your desired location
and less than the main menu to be as
mysterious really all self-explanatory
from here on out so overall from my
experience the Microsoft band 2
strongest suit is no question the
physical redesign if you have a Windows
Phone the band really makes it
worthwhile to
I with Cortana understanding voice
recognition in your commands as for
features there seems to be a lot and no
question there is but looking at what is
available on the market today for the
same or similar price you get basically
the same data like HR monitoring or
built-in GPS and other different types
of workout recordings these can be found
on the garmin vivoactive and the fitbit
search their name too but the thing is
the fitness experience really seems to
be more exciting and easier to analyze
and digest with the other companies now
granted there is the Microsoft health
dashboard which you can access through
your desktop or laptop and the
information displayed on there seems
much more valuable and easier to read
but that's the thing it's not the same
experience when you're on the phone but
besides the fitness experience providing
good numbers but not so great visuals
and charts the Smart Watch side of
things are limited to Microsoft is very
much limited on the apps and the
customization options in addition you
can't store music on the band like
smartwatches
and for the most part you can't read an
entire message or email like on a
SmartWatch either the band only shows
the first few words in any message or
email in the end the Microsoft band 2
does some things really great though I
do admit that but for the consumer
experience I don't believe it's really
there this will very much be a niche
product and not for the average consumer
not going mainstream that is so hope
this review helped it in some way if you
do like my work please help support the
channel by liking sharing and commenting
below every little bit does help don't
forget to add me on to Facebook Twitter
or Instagram and again I'm Jimmy
