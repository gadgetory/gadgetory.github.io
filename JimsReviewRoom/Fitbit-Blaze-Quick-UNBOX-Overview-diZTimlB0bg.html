room welcome back to another video as
you guys probably know I review a lot
and I mean a lot of activity bands right
here on this channel today is no
exception I'm very excited to tell you
guys I got the Fitbit blaze here on deck
and the reason why I'm excited I did
pre-order this via Best Buy and then
yesterday morning they said that my
order was backordered for an entire
month to March 31st which is obviously
ridiculous
so yesterday I just went out drove
everywhere I had to drive to another
state and I found one in stock the black
was sold out by the time I got there so
blue was the only one available and this
is in this size large so today what I
want to do just real quick here I
normally don't do unboxings but because
this is such a hot item I just want to
go over what's inside the package of
course and I'll go briefly over what
features are available of course have
the full review out probably about a
week a week and a half from today I do
have to go through the entire battery to
see how long it actually lasts and until
then that's when I can put out the
review for you so let's get into this
let's see what's inside I hope you guys
are excited as much as I am
all right folks so the Fitbit blaze
really blurs the lines of being a
SmartWatch and an activity tracker many
have been asking for something like this
but it's either lacking in SmartWatch
features and dominate on the fitness
side of things and vice versa
and I know from my viewers some have
been holding off as current trackers are
either ugly they feel too bulky and they
don't have heart rate readings on the
wrists etc and that's why the blaze has
been on many people's radars now this
offers a SmartWatch light display
interchangeable bands and on fitbit's
website I have seen them offer a metal
band instead of a silicone one or rubber
one that I have here and of course this
has your notifications like incoming
phone call alerts text messages calendar
alerts and whatnot
now I just need to personally test this
and see if the entire message shows up
and it's not just a preview like we've
seen on some other bands in the past
we'll see in my review now I personally
bought this for the retail price of 199
dollars but you can always click on the
link in my video description below to
check for the most updated prices so
what we have so far in the box right now
is just basically the Fitbit blaze and
also the huge charging cradle that we
have here but let's take a look at the
band real quick see what it looks like
alright so like I said earlier I
couldn't get the black model I had a
succumbed to the blue one the blue one
actually still looks pretty decent here
I did prefer black but by the time I got
to the store it was sold out
unfortunately buckle like style like on
a traditional watch very secure I always
loved this method instead of the snap on
buttons regarding the display and I
guess it's a little bit of juice in here
and just tell me to set up I'll go over
try to go over some of the screens later
for you guys but overall very very nice
build here all aluminum or metal
surrounding here buttons are very very
clicky love that feature
let's see what's at let's see let's look
at the back here look at the heart rate
sensor and from my experience with a lot
of activity bands I noticed the bigger
the sensor the bigger the watch that is
the more accurate it reads Fitbit I
believe it's using some kind of
technology called pure pulse heart rate
I'm pretty sure is probably trademarked
with another company so hopefully it
does provide much better heart rate
results than originally what I tested on
the Fitbit charge HR and also the Fitbit
surge just notice this little latch here
this is other watches that I've seen you
just basically pull this over and you
and interchange the bands pretty quickly
so we give that a shot right now for you
guys but again this video is in real
time it's not heavily edited as my
reviews just want to try to get this out
the way for you guys and there you go
that's basically it
I just try to kind of get my nail in
there because see I don't have too much
of a nail to really pull it over all of
that just basically put it in I'm sure
and there you'll snaps right back in
very easily done if you guys need to
basically swap out bands maybe get that
metal one that I talked about earlier
other than that I just felt this pop out
a little bit and there you go so this
just literally just pops out what leaked
out so you can change instead of just
changing the band you can change the
bezel and you can have the actual
activity tracker out of its placement
there you go pretty cool let me see if I
can snap that back in pretty easily
hopefully that goes pretty good I'm a
surprise it's actually just held on with
basically just snapping it in there I
don't think there's any kind of locking
mechanism let me see
yeah it just snaps in and that's how it
stays intact but while it's in here I
don't feel any movement I mean it just
really really stable of course once you
have this on your wrist it shouldn't pop
out but again of course that's in my
review let me put this on my wrists to
try to give you guys what it looks like
based on size and also if you guys look
at the side profile it's not completely
flush I don't think it's completely flat
as the garmin vivoactive i'm talk about
the current generation that new one is
coming up pretty soon I haven't seen
that yet or personally touched it but
the profile does stick out just a little
bit here it's not too bad at all but I'm
pretty sure if you compare and I'm
wearing the Under Armour band right now
doing some tests on those but let me
just take this off real quick just do a
really quick edit for you guys so here
goes both bands side by side the other
armor band does look a little bit
thicker because just one big straight
profile on the side here if you look at
the blaze it does look a little bit
thinner but if you do put them you know
one on top of another and in person I'll
be honest with you it does look about
literally the same exact size and again
the Under Armour band is probably your
most traditional size of an activity
tracker
it's rare that you really see a really
fun activity tracker for the time being
like I said the one that really just
pops up to mind is the garmin vivoactive
of course i'm talking with the current
generation the profile is thin enough I
would say that to still be very
comfortable this is still comfortable to
me but when you do wear it again this
bezel here it does allude to a thinner
profile you can't really see the other
side which works really well in addition
if you look at the bezel itself you can
see you can see through it you see my
finger kind of peep through there but I
do like this really unique style here it
does give this kind of like a beveled
edge or a beveled look when you do wear
it so it does give it a little bit more
personality or character and just one
more time rotating to the back to give
you guys probably a better look or a
better angle of what this looks like
there you go so let me update the
software out here and give you an idea
of what the screen looks like and just
go through some of the menus and that
should basically finish up this unboxing
all right give me a second all right so
it just paired the glaze over with my
phone it's telling me that there's a
firmware update so this takes a little
bit of time here fitbit's climbing up to
10 minutes for this to be completed so
that's the only thing I'm waiting on for
now we'll see alright folks so the
update just finished for me of course
results would vary but for me personally
sharing my personal experience this had
taken a little over 38 minutes to finish
which was of course a lot more than what
Fitbit was claiming again just showing
you guys just in case you guys run into
this as well
alright folks so the first thing I
noticed here if you lift up your wrist
the displays should turn on
automatically just like other
smartwatches very convenient if you lift
up your wrist the timer should show so
just like a Astro clock here the display
of course turns off when your wrist is
to the side here to save battery and
then we lift up the screen should come
on and it looks like it works you know
pretty well here so far again full test
during the review but the display here
looks a little bit darker I'm pretty
sure that we can split change the
display styles here and get different
dials and whatnot but you can see these
steps counters up there and of course
your current heart rate or heart beat
now with Fitbit from what I'm aware they
don't sample it in real time when you're
not in an activity during activity of
course it's real time but right now it
probably samples or takes your heart
Beate once every minute or once every
three minutes or so but don't quote me
on that I have to double-check out put
that again in the review for you guys I
know it's not in real time that's all
I'm just saying so swiping left
nothing here swiping let's see
notifications around the bottom if you
swipe up let's see if you swipe down you
can turn off turn on and off
notifications again you got music
controls you have to play back and
forward buttons right there I know if
you guys can see it it's a little bit
dark here for the time being swiping
right is today's numbers I guess
let me see yep so the amount of steps
literally I just put this on here
resting a heart rate which is always an
awesome plus here for those you know
basically trying to get into fitness
just to see what your heart health is
like over on a daily basis distance and
estimated calories burn of course
calories have been burned somewhat here
of course the body naturally burns off
calories over time and of course this
has flights indicated or how many
flights of stairs that you've climbed so
far so really cool on that let me see if
there's anything else here just double
check nothing and so you left to right
so I have to push the button to get back
swiping right one more time because
you're exercising profiles tap on that
you got run of course biking weights
treadmill elliptical and just general
workout now keep in mind I did find out
that this does not have GPS so I'm very
confident this does not replace the
Fitbit surge there's no GPS built-in
which is very unfortunate I was hoping
for something like this this will have
been killer even if this was priced at
$250 with GPS on here you don't need to
carry your phone that would have been
great but this does pair with your phone
your phone would be the GPS carrier so
when you do run if you do need GPS you
do need to carry your phone and a watch
at the same time but you don't have to
but again of course it's always more
accurate if you have GPS enabled
I'm just click on the sprocket here
let's see what that offers run cues mark
laps based on your Fitbit app settings I
can use your phone GPS secondary stats
it left's time and that's basically it
all right backing up one more time here
next screen fifth star from what I
understand is coached workouts so here
was a seven minute workout ten-minute
ABS let's just do a warm up real quick
here tap that
play and fitstar basically demonstrates
and it shows this female here on her
your knees and hands and whatnot
basically simulating a warm-up for you
guys so press play and it would
basically give you a minute to basically
do that to warm your body or neck up
here and let's say can I skip it skip
that let's see what the next exercise is
real quick here reversed shoulder rolls
and again it's nice that it actually
offers you a slight animation of what it
looks like or how to perform it and of
course that time is counting down and it
should start automatically for you and
there goes your warmup so pretty cool on
that if you guys are into coaching or
need coaching in general so that's
fitstar that's a new on fitbit a timer
what kind of timers do we have and it
whoops that it look like it started a
little bit there just noticed so there's
a stopwatch
and there's a countdown for you guys I
know a lot of personal fitness trainers
and whatnot they do prefer that I really
like that feature all arms there are
silent alarms on here whoops and no
alarm set create alarms using the fitbit
website or the app so i can't set it up
on here but there is a silent vibrating
alarm which is cool and settings let's
see quick view so that's if I raise my
wrist the screen will turn on brightness
sorry about that a little sensitive so
brightness is on auto right now let me
see how I can get this for you guys
normal and here goes maximum brightness
and we will go back to that front page
really soon Bluetooth classic heartrate
let me see what kind of options we have
for heart right here that little air is
low it's kind of hard to tap here there
we go so it's off on and autumn okay
that's basically about it let's see if
there's anything else besides settings I
highly doubt it and basically back to
alarms so look at the animations here
I'm surprised I saw that little stutter
again it could be just the device is
still very new maybe it's catching up or
trying to get its you know stuff
together and whatnot but again that's
the of course that doesn't look too
promising
on that here goes the very
impressions what this looks like and see
hopefully that stutter doesn't come back
here but looks like it's flowing pretty
much smoother now there we go so there's
the screen on maximum brightness so it
is a little bit more visible again
during the test I'll test it in full
sunlight just make sure we can see this
when we're outdoors but other than that
that is it for this unboxing I know it's
been very very I guess you could say raw
it's you know it's me without narrative
I know this is isn't as polished as my
reviews but other than that I present to
you guys the Fitbit blaze if you can
like subscribe follow me on Facebook
Twitter in or Instagram and I'll see you
guys on the next video you guys take
care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
