room if you guys been watching me for
some time you have been hearing my voice
over the past two years or so doing
YouTube and the microphone that I used
was actually introduced my soldier knows
best one of the pioneers of YouTube tech
videos way before the days of like mkbhd
or so maybe during the time of John
Rhett injure with TechnoBuffalo but
anyways here I went out and bought the
same mic after seeing him use it and
that's been my mic ever since it's from
Samson not a big name to the average
consumer like Sennheiser however they
make professional-grade
audio equipment for good prices never
overkill well Samson for the first time
ever reached out to me and sent me their
just released professional reference
headphones to test here these are these
z55
they retail for 199 dollars at the time
this video here but I'll place my links
in the video description below
including my microphone in case you want
the same voice as I do but the links
will give you the most updated prices
for today so without further ado welcome
everyone to Jim's reviewer
going over the physical aspects and
looks are indeed subjective but after
reviewing so many headphones over the
years Samson stays with a classic a
little bit more versus in his studio
look here with no gimmicks there's some
minor chrome accents but there's no
fancy stitching or glossy paints the
headband itself is synthetic leather
with retractable metal arms the
adjustments are light though and I do
admit I was concerned of accidental
extending but the headphones have stays
stationary on the entire time of me
testing these now moving down the ear
cups here they're plastic with a very
nice textured metal sensor with the
Samsung logo and only the left ear cup
will have your 3.5 millimeter ports that
provides a locking mechanism so you
don't accidentally yank the wire here
Wow audio monitoring or recording now
the ear pads themselves aren't
replaceable and made of genuine lambskin
they actually pretty comfortable here
the ear pads do warm up a bit though
after about an hour of use but never
caused my ears to sweat something to be
aware of if you do intend on wearing
this for several hours now one feature I
haven't seen in a long time the Z line
of headphones offers a a lot of
adjustments here to ensure this fits all
heads with the ear cuffs rotating
swiveling - folding in for stowing as
well but I've discussed this further in
my comfort test soon and last regarding
quality my stress tests as always it's a
bit extreme here but at least you would
know what this is capable of everything
stays intact especially the swiveling
and rotating pivots I do notice however
the metal band does stretch a little bit
here in the end giving a slightly less
firm squeeze around your head now I've
only noticed a few headphones doing this
during my stretch test but like every
headphone I've done this - the Simpson
has nothing detrimental to the quality
overall still very good in regards to
durability touching based on comfort
before the stress test I thought the
clamping force would have been a little
bit much on the jaw line since it does
feel firmer than more recent headphones
I've been testing however the Samson's
are comfortable to wear again this is
before I did a stretch testing before
the headphones stretch the reason being
as discussed earlier the ear cuffs have
much movement here and the aircrafts do
distribute the pressure pretty evenly
around the ear as for the crown of the
head these headphones are considered
lightweight for me coming in a little
under 250 grams anything under 300 grams
is usually ideal now right before
talking about the audio test because
these are studio headphones they do come
with an assortment of cables first one
is a coil wire that at rest here that
extend
to this standard for feet but it can
stretch up to 10 feet if you need to
there's a 8 foot straight cable and last
there is a 4 foot cable with an inline
microphone for phone calls but I was
also able to use this with my
PlayStation 4 controller as well for
those who are interested now the
microphone does work very well here my
voice is distinct where that phone calls
or with an in-game here however I wish
the wire was a bit more beefy though as
the other two felt like it had a thicker
gauge wire the thinnest on this one does
feel a little cheap unfortunately and
last in the package here is a leather
carrying bag here for stowing your
headphones now moving into the audio
test I'm sure you guys been waiting for
this year the z55 closed back and over
ear headphones produces a balanced
uncompromised audio signature it simply
sounds natural as it should for
professional studio grade headphones and
you don't want your headphones to alter
what you hear and have it produced or
provide different results when you're in
post-production now base is punchy and
that much sub-base though zero muddy
mids however bass is there even more so
than my sennheiser 598 however it's not
bass boosted and whatsoever which is a
good thing again for studio headphones
the mids are clear and present with it
again being natural and that bright and
not boxy or recessed very clear and very
clean now regarding the highs though
very easily no ear ringing or ear
tinging and a very few songs though
there are some slight jumbled noises but
most songs clear as can be again there's
really no distortion now regarding that
soundstage it's definitely above average
it's not the best I've tested so far but
it is up there though the soundstage is
expansive with hearing audio sources in
front of you and behind you and it does
I perform my open back Sennheiser HD 85
to 98 I would say it's on par with the
HD 8 DJ's again from Sennheiser and also
the B&amp;amp;O H sixes that I've recently
tested both of those headphones costing
100 or than these Z 55 s here and very
less starting to do this more often on
my headphone reviews if you are using a
deck or an amp these headphones drives
very well using my Pheo or file I think
that's how I pronounce it EA teen the
audio immersion bass clarity everything
is amplified in a headphone then
it sounds like a 300 and up a pair of
headphones it's fabulous
get an amp or get a deck if you don't
have one already so overall it's been
really a neutral but a very good
experience these are indeed geared
towards studio work and they definitely
do justice the audio signature for
accuracy and audio monitoring is very
well done here the only thing I would
say that is not up to snuff is the
physical feel the quality is good though
and I'm not looking for a glossy paint
schemes here or original styling but
having two headphones feel a lot less
rattling because of the rotating pivots
here and maybe removing that fit chrome
accent and using aluminum would have
been a better choice but over our great
value and great performance I highly
recommend them as an alternative so
that's it for this review here again I'm
