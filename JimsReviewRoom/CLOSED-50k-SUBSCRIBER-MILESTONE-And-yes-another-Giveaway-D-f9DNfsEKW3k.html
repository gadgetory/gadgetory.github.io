room welcome back to another video and
you guys know i'm at my fifty thousand
subscriber mark so i can't be more
thrilled than ecstatic about that thank
you guys very much for found me and
supported me through our like a year and
a half of me doing this so far so again
thank you thank you very much so today
I'm out looking for a little bit of
lunch and right now I'm wearing a pink
here it's my girls first birthday today
so I'm gonna celebrate tonight with a
family dinner and some very close
friends of the family so that's why I'm
wearing pink but again regarding the
channel 50,000 subscribers I can't I all
be as I can't believe it when I first
started this like literally first
started this I said yeah I'm probably
hit like 10,000 subscribers or so in one
year and by the first year i think i hit
I don't remember now fifteen twenty
thousand so courageous blew my mind and
now here 50,000 subscribers I can't
believe it so thank you thank you thank
you to all those who really supported me
who's been following me all this time I
can I can't stress it enough thank you
and every video and every video in the
future I thank you so much and I'll be
honest with you and I if you guys found
me on Facebook Twitter Instagram all
that stuff it is really about the
comments that you guys leave that makes
me continue doing what I do yeah I get
to play with the gadgets and whatnot and
to be honest with you because it is work
I guess you can say you go through these
items so quick I I wish I had more time
to even play with them but I
unfortunately don't but it's the
comments when I want to read where I do
help people make a purchase decision
where I do help people make a decision
not to even buy something that's very
gratifying it's um it's my work that's
actually helping people and that's why I
do it so again thank you very much and I
love your comments and to be honest with
you and to answer your phone someone
asked me as well do I read most if not
all my comments I actually do I probably
don't respond to every one of them
because it is very there's so many caps
i get about
I haven't counted but several hundred a
day you know I do read through them so
thank you very much I do appreciate it
i'm sorry if this lighting is bad
probably facing the Sun and whatnot but
uh what I want to do in this video is
answer some more questions for you guys
I know you guys have some curiosity and
what I do behind the scenes and also my
work process what i use and also some
other questions as well so i want to
answer that for you continuing here
someone asked me on instagram his name
was jay can't remember last name he
asked me how do i keep my content fresh
basically you know every video that i do
i'm trying to you know I learn new
techniques new ways of video recording
new ways of testing products so that way
there's more information or different
style maybe it's a more concise way of
giving you more information so every
video I try to add something that I just
learned and that way for me I guess in
turn it keeps the video fresh is because
I'm always striving to learn something
new to make my product better now if I
kept doing the same exact thing over and
over again how did I it's at the flaw I
guess and say it's a negative at the
same time I get bored pretty easily with
doing the same repetitive work over and
over and over again and so far I'm gonna
keep doing YouTube as long as it's fun
as long as it keeps me you know
intrigued by letting new techniques new
video ography new Styles new technology
all that fun stuff it's always new and
it's always fresh and I've been trying
to look for new locations to film as
well like I said just to give me
outdoors a little bit away from that
black desk and I'm black table and just
keep it going
powered there so another question that
someone had for me was what kind of
software were kind of programs don't use
what's my workflow work process so we're
on software I use Adobe Premiere CC
photoshop and illustrator and once in a
while I'll use Camtasia as well just for
screen recording anything off of the
desktop regards to equipment I prior to
my two most recent videos i've been
using the nikon d50 100 with the stock
lens 18 to 50 millimeter pretty
straightforward compared to allow the
cameras today it's not the best camera
matter of fact any time especially this
past winter about three thirty four
o'clock or so i don't have enough light
in my room and if i do attempt to
continue recording it gets pretty grainy
and it gets pretty nasty as well it's
not a good video so heading into some
great news that I want to share and I've
been telling you guys on my social media
I remember to add me twitter facebook
and instagram jim's review room and i
finally got a full frame camera and it's
been years since i've upgraded from the
d 5100 finally got the d810 I got the
tamron 24 to 70 f 2.8 for all the camera
nerds out there I guess you can say and
it's a phenomenal camera crazy good
low-light performance the reason why I
didn't go we can in the 5d mark 3
specifically is because that camera is
technically several years old now and I
just look at on other youtube reviews
the d810 outperforms the 5d mark 3 now
keep in mind this upcoming spring and
canon has already announced there's
going to be a brand new canon 5d r &amp;amp; 5 d
s so i might hold onto them maybe i'll
get it maybe not I might get comfortable
when I can't buy them then I just maybe
just leave it as that you can say but
we'll see like I said that's the only
reason why i didn't buy in canon again
was because the 5d mark 3 is it is
somewhat old it does not perform as well
in low light situations especially when
i record on that black table in that
I a room that I do for you guys and I'm
walking under a bridge right now so it
looks a little bit dark I'm pretty sure
I'm dark as hell right now now go like a
little bit better uh so that's my first
really good bit of good news is the
brand new canon Arab side Jesus Christ a
brand new Nikon camera so second here
very good news in May I am ecstatic to
have to tell you guys I am dropping a
website WWE mzv room calm so with
YouTube I produce maybe two or three
videos currently with the way everything
set up that's as fast as I can go and
that's at still working 12 14 hours a
day and that's no exaggeration and that
includes of course recording the video
recording my voice editing my voice
finding some darn good music and working
with producers and am and record labels
and then of course editing the video
rendering it uploading it putting in all
the tags yadda yadda ya so the video
outside itself and that's not even
including testing the product as well
and that could be a week two weeks or so
and basically just taking down notes and
playing around with other other items as
well at the same time now with Jim's
review rom-com the goal on that is
because YouTube it takes so much time to
produce this content with the website I
can put up content much faster and add
more variety and for example I have an
interest in like messenger bags and bags
in general and now all bags are made the
same and I'm guilty of that I've you
know I bought something nice off of
Amazon let's say and it's just flimsy
hidden hold on my stuff it was an
ergonomic etc so that's just one quick
example the website has the ability to
do that instead of making a full-fledged
video and it could be a video that as
simple as a bag or a video like the
activity bands that I do and it still
takes the same amount of time it takes
about
two three days to edit upload render all
that shebang and to be honest with you
yet the activity bands gets me the most
views but in a business sense that bag's
won't the bags are just the project me a
thousand views two thousand views and
that's about it and I have to you know
it is a business at the end day this is
my full-time job I do have to do what
you know that makes economical sense
because so much my time has already been
taken up you know by just one or two
videos for that week so with the website
at least now besides just mainstream
products I have the ability to review
yeah continue mainstream products of
course but also lesser-known products
and I'm more diverse lineup of products
as well so with the website I can review
bags I can review more dash cams or
security cameras or network cameras for
your house like the Dropcam for example
I can review more cameras digital
cameras i'm actually upload those photos
for you guys maybe more bluetooth
speakers less well-known bluetooth
speakers and to be asking to be pried
youtube i also do more of the mainstream
items because i still believe youtube in
this video in general she chose the
product in much more detail when you can
actually show show up being tested and
show it in the works so I still value
video very much but again the website
will just be another source i guess you
can say with much more additional
content and i will no matter what i'll
put my heart and soul into this and make
it as good as my videos in regards to
content so I website is probably more
traditional again Jim's review room calm
and they would go there and search and
find more content patch that much easier
so Jim's review room is the second piece
of information I want to drop very
excited about it and I can't wait to get
that up and done that's built from the
ground up I'm hiring nobody I am
learning HTML and CSS and all that fun
stuff and all those tags as I go along
while doing videos in between so pretty
good stuff i'm really excited about that
alright folks I think that's good enough
I've been walking for a good bit
although this video might be long as
hell although it might be I don't know
ten minutes or so I've been actually
walking around for a good hour and a
half or so in the Sun and beaming on my
forehead right now but I love this
weather and it's weathers coming back
and it's only getting started guys so
welcome back to spring warm weather the
Sun I'm excited and it gives me more
opportunities to film in other locations
and review other products as well that
requires me to be outdoors basically so
I'm thrilled about it but um like with
uh sorry bout that truck there so like
all my subscriber mark videos I do a
giveaway this time I am giving away the
ue mini boom from Logitech something
small you know something i'm broke as
hell but it's something last time I gave
away a an activity band or activity
bracelet leave us from misfit this time
it is again a Bluetooth speaker is the
ue mini boom that i will be giving away
I'm not sponsored by these people this
is something that i have paid out of my
own pocket that i'll be giving away and
all you have to do is add me on your
social media and the handle is basically
jim's review room for all facebook
twitter instagram and google+ of course
requires that plus sign of any gems
reviewer so again Facebook Twitter
Instagram Google+ add beyond there and
then down and down below in the comments
let me know which one you used and then
let me know what your name is so that
way I can contact you and get your
address also in the comments below just
let me know which country you're from
I'm always intrigued by where my
audience is coming from I always get
people mostly from the US of course a
lot of people from Europe but I also get
a very good amount from India Asia some
people down in South America shout out
to you guys a lot of people Mike said
India a lot of people have been
commenting me from there and a shout out
to you guys as well hope you guys doing
good
and that's about it and if you want to
put anything else in the comments below
that be nice to hear from you guys i
always love reading your comments and
that's about it so that's 50,000
subscribers my first ever vlog and no
I'm i am horrific at this i know the
sun's all jacked up right now and the
cameras probably all shaking what not my
right arm is tired I've been holding it
like it's that for a good hour so a
little over an hour but I'll be signing
off this video is long enough again guys

bottom my heart you guys make this
possible again this is Jimmy with Jim's
