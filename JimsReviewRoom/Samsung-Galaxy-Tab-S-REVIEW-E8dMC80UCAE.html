review room welcome to another review a
samsung has truly been saturated and
dominating the tablet market and because
there's so many tablets from Samsung has
been released in the past six months I
almost think what else can they possibly
do almost to the point where I asked
myself as an average consumer are they
just adding some minor features and
selling a product for the hell of it but
going back to Big a review professional
Simpson confirmed I'm wrong every time
now prezis on your screen as of this
video and today we're looking at the
Samsung Galaxy Tab s
the model i have here is the 10.5 inch
version alongside the Tab pro 10.1 inch
released not too long ago with
dimensions of nine point seven three
inches wide six point nine nine inches
high and just a quarter of an inch thick
making this smaller than some depends
actually have laid around my desk this
is currently the world's second thinnest
tablet next to the 6.4 millimeter thin
Sony Xperia z2 now weight wise it's
similar to the iPad air weighing in at
just one pound now overall the build is
still very solid despite being very thin
there's no flexing in such a small thin
device and as you can see I chose a new
color that's offered by Samsung which is
titanium bronze which looks ultra rich
and fancy in my opinion now flipping to
the back of the tablet uses the Samsung
Galaxy s5 backing that bandage look in
strong away from that pleather and faux
stitching that was seen on many of these
Samsung products in the past a design is
obviously subjective but for me it still
works and original compared to allow the
other templates on the market now going
over its physical features the top-left
has your power and volume rocker buttons
with the metal having an infrared
blaster letting you control your TV and
access to a TV guide right on the tablet
now to the right has your micro SD card
slot so you can expand the amount of
memory up to now a hundred and twenty
eight gigabytes more than these 64
gigabytes which was standard on previous
generations and last is the micro USB
port for the supplied wall charger now
to the left has your three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone port and on both
sides of the tablet has your stereo
speakers which performs very well for
stereo channels and personal listening
and last the very bottom of the tablet
has a very discreet microphone and
basically nothing else and moving to the
front of the tablet includes the
standard recent apps home and back
button and newly introduced is a
fingerprint scanner which after setting
up surprisingly works repeatedly and
very well at the current time in this
settings menu samsung has made use of
this fingerprint scanner to of course
unlock the tablet verify your Samsung
Account before making purchases instead
of entering in your password each time
and also pay using PayPal again no need
to enter in your password and more than
one finger
can be registered and saved under the
tablet now the tempest has a two
megapixel camera on the front with a
eight megapixel camera on the rear with
an LED flash the photos on your screen
are unedited and as you can see are very
clear very sharp with what I deem very
good results for a tablet low-light
performance is pretty impressive as well
with some noise present though but
better than most tablets in the market
today
and I'm hoping by Christmas or more than
likely next year we might start seeing
4k video recording now moving on to the
screen here and this is the biggest
feature I believe Samsung has going for
the tab s the screen now utilizes Super
AMOLED technology which in turn works
out to be a gorgeous display that's the
best that I've seen on a tablet and yes
the best that I've seen and every view
tons of tablets in the past now the
colors are much more rich and the
contrast is simply amazing with deep
blacks on the Tab s where it really
shines is during movies and looking at
photos and once you start using the tab
S and look back at other people's
tablets it'll never be the same your
eyes have just been spoiled it's just
simply gorgeous
then as rich as the colors are it's not
too saturated and when you are watching
movies skin tones look normal with
everything else in the screen showing
colors that personally I've never seen
or at least taken noticed from previous
tablet reviews now the resolution comes
in at 2560 by 1600 which is the same as
the previously released Samsung pro
models with a pixel density of 287 which
is really good for today's standards but
now moving on to the internals and
performance the ten best uses one of
Samsung's latest processors is the eight
core Exynos 5800 the four cores runs at
1.9 yoghurt while the last four runs at
one point three gigahertz with three
gigs of RAM on board and running as of
this video Android KitKat 4.4.2
now other wireless connections include
Wireless a BG and and included is the
latest and newest technology being
adapted right now is wireless AC now
Bluetooth 4.0 returns but still no NFC
also known as near-field communication
which is in my opinion not an issue but
would have been nice as an option to
have now I'll put benchmarked on the
screen for those techy people out there
who would like to compare devices and
can test their own devices as well
but I'll discuss real-world performance
there for the time I have testing this
product it's been very reliable and I
know Samsung has had stuttering issues
before on certain applications and
actions but from my testing I think
they're mostly gone
Monash stuttering still occurs when say
downloading an app from the Google Play
Store or moving files on a tablet at the
same time there's still some slight
stutters but overall usage has improved
moderately I believe and for the average
consumer like myself the tablet is still
a very enjoyable experience but
regarding the rest of performance every
high-end tablet today can run Netflix or
surf the web and run practically any
game from the Google Play Store with no
issues a samsung claims on their website
up to nine hours of news from their
battery and from my tests of watching
two movies surfing the internet playing
some games and casually testing the
product throughout the entire day the
Tab s lasted just over ten hours as
evidence on your screen from a full
charge
it's impressive indeed and overperformed
what Samsung claimed but still going
down the list of features Samsung is
offering multi window makes a return
again now becoming a standard feature on
all their tablets it seems like now this
tablet allows you to use two apps at the
same time on the screen and I was hoping
for four screens similar to the new
Lenovo yoga tablet I reviewed a few
weeks back but two is always better than
one window that most other tablets as a
today provides now this feature is
always convenient when you want to
browse the Internet at the same time
you're watching let's say YouTube or
looking up an address and using Google
Maps simultaneously no another feature
from Samsung is side sync 3.0 now once
you set up side sync you can view your
phone screen on your tablet allowing you
to transfer data copy and paste text
easily and you can even send and receive
voice calls from the tab S once paired
now currently / samsung call forwarding
is supported on the galaxy s4 s5 and
galaxy note 3 with more devices coming
soon as proprietary that it seems only
Samsung phones will be compatible a very
nice feature Samsung includes is remote
PC allowing you to access your PC from
anywhere and anytime through your
yes you can remotely use your tap s to
control either your Windows or Apple
computer now using this to move files
and folders and viewing documents is
ideal but gaming and other more
demanding tasks doesn't appear to work
too well now jumping over to magazine UX
which Samsung introduced not too long
ago and a feature I personally was not
too fond of when first shown now this
time around there's a bit more content
compared to before and each page can be
basically customized and similar to the
awesome app Flipboard information is
updated on these tiles here now I
personally find opening and using
Flipboard to still be a more fluid more
robust experience with more information
and a screen at all at once again
magazine UX is just another option for
you to catch up and organize your news
your calendar and agenda for the day or
staying on top of social media again not
as robust but it is there for you to
news though and some minor subtle
changes pressing the apps button and
scrolling to the far right doesn't
reveal widgets anymore but now from the
home page you have to press and hold to
access your available widgets to use not
an issue or nuisance at all but just
something different for you to be aware
of that's all
but I'll mint using this has been very
pleasing it truly does feel like a step
up from the pro models that were
released back in February of 2014 the
refinements like these super thin
chassis that also supplements the beauty
of the screen helps with the aesthetics
and using the tablet from typing on the
screen and using its programs and apps
have been very fluid and air free no
issues and everything runs as smooth as
a premium tablet should and with all of
its features and Samsung has tons of
features on this tablet it really shines
from the rest of the competition on the
market form and function to usability
and features this is definitely worth
its price so hope this review helped you
