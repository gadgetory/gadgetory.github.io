new QC 35 dubbed the QC 35 - pretty
original but I love my original ones
from last year they were in the top
three active noise-cancelling headphones
video that I made and if anything I
still personally use mine over many of
the other headphones here at the studio
jumping right into this I personally
paid for these at the retail price of
349 dollars as always I'll place my
links in the video description below
click on those links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
you never know when these things might
go on sale so without further ado sit
back relax and enjoy the content i'm
jimmy with jim's review room and i'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
jumping into the physical features they
look identical to the original QC 35 s
for those who don't know here's a quick
rundown of the physical build first up
is my stress test and I know it's over
the top here but hey I do to see if
there's any weak spots so that way you
don't have to now I haven't had any pair
of headphones break on my channel
thankfully but seriously though what I
look for are any seams popping cracks or
creeks anything that may be of a concern
that we can find immediately in the end
they're very durable and have amazing
build quality here and no creeks
confirmed another trait these things are
super lightweight and coming in around
two hundred and thirty five grams these
are one of the lightest wireless active
noise-cancelling headphones that I've
tested the other pair of headphones that
comes to mind are these Sennheiser PXE
550 s those were lightweight as well but
every other pair that I recall in the
channel have been heavier the original
QC 35 s were practically identical in
weight now a comfort and looks they're
soft and supple leather up top here at
the headband Alcantara fabric used on
the headliner the matte black looks
stealthy as hell here and while we're
reiterating these are the lightest pair
of headphones that most people are going
to buy they do feel great well this is
one of the few headphones that I can
personally wear all day and not feel
wearing fatigue at the crown of the head
nor fatigue at the jawline from the
clamping force the design of the ear
cups down to the ear pads are very
comfortable one of the best features of
these over the ear headphones the inner
lining is recessed and at an angle now
where the upper part of my ears stick
out and it kind of big here they don't
touch the inside and provide this
airiness giving room so my ears can
breathe I never felt my ears overheat or
experienced sweaty ears during my time
testing as I signed up yes the ear pads
are removable and replaceable moving on
and taking a closer look on the right
you have power on and off with bluetooth
pairing once you slide it over looking
on the rear of the right ear cup pause
play skipping and going back and songs
are in easy reach and easily
identifiable on the forefront you have
NFC or near field communication for easy
pairing and folks don't take this for
granted a simple tap with your NFC
enabled phone pairs the two nearly
instantly no need to scan or refresh the
bluetooth menu now lastly on the bottom
here
most have the chance but like 99% of all
headphone manufacturers out there today
we're still on USB 2.0 and not USB
type-c not just yet that is now since
around the sportin bose is climbing up
to 20 hours of use which is great with
my test at 50% vibe from a full battery
to dead I achieved 23 hours and 22
minutes to be exact
now another feature that many overlook
and Apple gets a lot of praise for this
and others don't
Bose does have some sort of rapid
recharge if the headphones are dead
recharge them for 15 minutes and you get
two and half hours of playback moving to
the left ear cup and this is the only
new feature that Bose is offering
there's a bunch of toggle between active
noise-cancelling performance and Google
assistant now previously before an
update you could not turn off a and C
and later it was exclusively through the
app now with the press you can talk
about turning off a and C all together
now getting deeper into Google
assistance you tap and hold speak
naturally and Google assistance provides
conversational responses it's a
convenience to have it here it works
fast it's smooth and not getting too
deep into Google assistance since most
of you guys I think are familiar with it
but controlling your music through voice
asking for a specific artist or genres
to start playing and having the
headphones obtain my text messages and
notifications are great and a few
examples of what you can do I found a
few places within 1.5 miles the next few
showings of Blade Runner 2049 are at 7
p.m. 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. I like blue
red yellow and green
Google's colors but I found a very
similar experience with my other
headphones earphones and other audio
products even with my previous
generation QC 35 the hold down their
multi-function button and Google
assistant it pops up on my phone
speaking to my headset like normal and I
get the same results as the QC 35 twos I
would assume this would be beneficial
for the few phones that don't have
Google assistant just yet and are still
using Google now as for Siri she doesn't
work on this new button however the
multi function button on the right ear
cup can still bring her up so before
touching base on active noise-cancelling
performance and knocking out some of the
minor details here I did test Bluetooth
range and over time with most flagship
phone today and Bluetooth 4.0 or
here I've been achieving wireless ranges
up to 60 to 80 linear feet with the bose
qc25 twos I confirmed 58 layer of feet
on both my google pixel XL and samsung s
a Plus same exact results with the
original or older
QC 35 s no change now regarding phone
calls here's a quick sample for your
review pay attention this picks up
background noises or not hey Adam can
you hear me
yeah hey I just want to touch base with
you and see if you're free tonight
Jenny's having taco night and I don't
know are you available touching base on
active noise-cancelling performance al
abbreviated anc from here on out to set
up proper expectations no pair of anc
headphones completely sound sees your
environment however some blocks out more
than others also with most anc
headphones some may feel a sensation of
air and cabin pressure feeling when ANC
is activated with the QC 35 to s I feel
it more so than most of the competition
out there it took half a day maybe the
next day until I was acclimated and
stopped noticing it every time second I
tested these in the coffee shop as
always do it's usually busy in there
while cuter sitting with these on and
wore them while here in the studio or
the office the QC 35 twos do block out a
lot of your surroundings more so than
majority of the other ANSI headphones
out there they give a quick demo here's
a live clip I'm using professional
microphones and this is possibly one of
the best audio tests that you guys can
find on youtube right now I implore you
for you to put on earphones or
headphones for the best audio experience
please like and subscribe to help
support my work
I could make everything on that are you
100% that are you 100% battery 100%
connected to Tyler's essay MSUM GSE
jumping into audio quality just to get
this out the way both the old and the
new boast QC 35 s sounds exactly the
same after several years of testing
audio they boast QC 35 twos and I guess
the 35s are still my favorite sounding
pair of active noise-cancelling
headphones I have tested Sennheiser's
JBL Samsung Sony beats and the list goes
on here and these provide such a clean
level of bass it's not bass heavy by any
means but there's just enough thump and
punchy bass to make nearly every genre
of music shine the mid-range and in my
opinion this is the biggest highlight of
the audio experience it's very clear
very articulate and offers more spatial
sound than the aforementioned brands the
details of instruments to the details of
vocalists its impeccable for the anc
300-350 dollar market touching base on
high frequencies you typically hear
snare drums cymbal crashes synthesizers
up at this range here and they hold up
well when I listen at higher volume it
doesn't get raspier tinny and more
importantly its resolution and clarity
on the top-end
remains intact more so than other
headphones that I've tested now if you
owned the original ones your call here
but in my personal humble opinion there
is absolutely no reason at all to take a
hit or a loss on money by selling your
old QC 35 in buying the new QC 35 twos
if anything for me it was an excuse to
buy the black models and replace my
silver ones both colors look great when
you guys know I like the dark look at my
channel here know if you don't know any
of these get them or at least try the
active noise-cancelling performance it
is so real come back to my channel then
and let me know your thoughts in the
comment section down below I also have
the Sony WH 1000 X m2z that's the direct
competitor to the QC 35 twos that's
coming to the channel shortly so be on
the lookout for that and also a
head-to-head comparison so thanks for
watching guys be sure to LIKE sub and
share to support my work I'll catch you
guys on the next one
