room LG smartphones has always been
under the radar it's been an understated
option next to big giants like Samsung
and Apple today we're looking at the new
LG g6 I received as a loaner from the
lovely folks at AT&amp;amp;T it did not sponsor
this video here but definitely check
them out at 18 C comm or your local
retail stores for smartphones and
accessories the g6 retails between 650
to 700 dollars depending on which
carrier you get them from compared to
the competition you're looking at about
$100 savings all around
as always I'll place my Amazon affiliate
links in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time you
never know when these things might go on
sale so without further adieu on
channels here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room
go over the physical features first it's
not rounded it doesn't have any curved
display there's nothing that really just
pops right out at you but take your time
give it a second chance you'll see that
the g6 having one of the thinnest bezels
on a mainstream phone today the screen
stretches 5.7 inches bigger than the
iPhone bigger than my pixel XL yeah at
the same time the footprint is smaller
than most phones out there now one phone
that does come to mind that is bigger in
screen size and has a bigger or similar
footprint is this samsung s8 the screen
it's not an older display so we're not
getting a super rich vibrant color
specifically in the red and blues but if
the phone is not lined up in the right
next up to my samsung here the LG screen
is still a pleasure to look at and
doesn't offer any discrepancies or
issues that would deter anyone from
buying the g6 comes with an IP 68 rating
meaning you can submerge this phone in
fresh water not saltwater that is up to
one meter for up to 30 minutes I did a
quick test and left my phone in the
bucket here after pulling it out so the
LG is surely still intact for everyday
use and simply testing how it feels in
the hand it's not then per se but it
feels like a nice premium slate of metal
and glass not only does it feel solid in
the palm it fits perfectly with not
being too small or too big now buttons
on your screen
pretty straightforward with volume on
the left and a SD card holder on the
right etc but what you won't find is the
power button on the side rather it's
located on the rear LG makes a return
with that fingerprint scanner that also
works as the power button is perfectly
located right below the camera here
every time you pick up the phone land
your finger right in the center and the
phone unlocks for you it's fast and
reliable every time from my testing but
getting back to the ports on the bottom
is the USB type-c connection which
offers fast charging from a dead battery
to full I was able to get it back to
100% in an hour and 28 minutes in
regards to battery stamina I'm averaging
five hours in 30 minutes now in my
samsung s8 review many asked me to
comment on the audio output since my
channel focuses on somebody audio
products testing the g6 against my s8
plus any pixel itself for a quick
comparison the audio did sound best on
the g6 it is minut in quality and if you
don't have two phones side-by-side the
average consumer won't even be able to
tell here the biggest difference though
the volume levels were quite
all for me when I play the LGG six at
fifty to sixty percent volume the
Simpson si+ had to be played at
seventy-five percent to have the same
loudness if you're a music lover
I believe the LG was the best option now
moving on the camera is surely one of
the biggest highlights of the film the
camera is quick to load and the layout
is one of the best in my opinion besides
a robust auto mode featuring in up to 13
megapixel camera high dynamic range in
4k video recording there's also menu
mode allowing you to select shutter
speeds ISO levels menu focus with focus
peaking and such and for the type of
person that takes a lot of photos for
Instagram any camera with menu mode
helps up big time getting correctly
exposed shots but let's take a look at
some photos here that I've taken one of
my favorite features the camera has a
standard lens that takes photos like
this very standard most cameras that is
but LG has a second wide-angle lens and
it offers shots like this line you're
taking so much more in each photo the
wide-angle is missing optical image
stabilization however with a reasonably
steady hand shots are still great now
let's take a look at some of the photos
samples here keep in mind all these
photos are unedited and direct from the
camera itself
I also brought along my samsung si plus
so we have some that are compared to as
well the first thing I noticed is the LG
takes much more vibrant and sharper
pictures overall what kind of shot
considering Samsung was known to produce
much more saturated in sharper images
than most other phones on the market
with the LG time and time again here the
college was richer but I do admit at
times they were a bit too saturated to
the point it looks unnatural or colors
just simply looked a little too dark it
surely is not perfect now getting back
to my samsung phone I really love the
phone to be honest with you but shocked
to see the stark difference during my
time testing LG provided simply more
vibrant photos dealt with the outdoor
sunny and cloudy shots much better and
then looking at the glass on the
building's pasta shows the best detail
out of both phones now getting into
daily use and discussing about the
internals I'll place the phone specs on
your screen right now
but the g6 it's really a simple phone as
I mentioned earlier you don't get the
iris scanner there's no curved edge
displays and such nothing super far
advanced and I'm not saying it's a
boring or an underperforming phone but
there are some subtle features though
that makes the
really worth a consideration the street
itself has an 18 by 9 aspect ratio
something a bit different from the
traditional 16 by 9 LJ calls it full
vision now most content on today's
Netflix and other recorded formats
they're still on that traditional 16 by
9 so we're not able to take full
advantage of that screen you may still
see some of those black letter boxes I
mean top in the bottom not on the flip
side though despite the matter with some
video for daily app use web surfing
messaging you name it the entire screen
is fully utilized now with gaming there
are instances where you can pull up app
scaling that you can force the g6 to
display a full screen and remove any
unsightly black bars in general giving
performance on an everyday basis
performed perfectly fine for my needs
and never did I notice a hiccup or slow
down and the g6 is performance now one
caveat that I did notice though oddly
jesus comes with an older processor his
Snapdragon 820 one versus the newest as
of this video which is a Snapdragon 835
now as stated the phone doesn't show any
signs of slowdown and the experience has
been fast or at least fast enough for
every average consumer out there you
only let down is future proofing the
phone as with the 821 it doesn't have
quick charging 4.0 and of course it
doesn't take advantage of any battery
management efficiencies that it's found
I mean newest processor now I would say
if you're paying full price for this
phone take that into consideration
so overall here having the phone for
several weeks I very much enjoy the g6
as an alternative to my samsung s A+ no
indeed I am missing that luster of the
curved edge display of my samsung I'm
missing that superfast autofocusing
camera or even having peace of mind and
the latest and greatest processor but in
the end the g6 I felt was very practical
it's still performed great nonetheless
and I would say if you can get this less
than the retail price or at least around
that 650 dollar price range 40 32 gig
model and then add in your own SD card
this phone comes recommended as a
cheaper option and other flagships if
you guys can please write in the comment
section below
what do you guys think of this phone and
how much would you pay for it assuming
that prices would eventually drop I
personally think LG is in the right
direction so guys if you can please be
sure to LIKE and subscribe to help
support my work be sure to follow me on
Facebook Twitter and or Instagram
whichever social media platforms you
guys
and as always keep Jim's review room in
mind as my videos are here to help you
make that purchase decision you guys
take care I'll see you on the next one
