I've been reviewed on the XP 20 and the
XP 40 today we're wrapping it up with
the XP 30 over the past two years Sony
has been checking but what is new is
Bluetooth speakers have been testing on
the channel we'll see if this one lives
up to the hype
they XP 30 it's priced at one hundred
and fifty dollars at the time of this
video as always I'll place my affiliate
links in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time
they never know when these things might
go on sale so without further ado be
sure to follow me on facebook twitter or
instagram again I'm Jimmy with Jim's
reviewer and I'm here to help you make
that purchase decision welcome everyone
to another review go over the physical
features first the XV 30 and you might
have guessed it falls into the mid tier
speaker line-up inserting I've tested
all three the Holy Trinity you can call
it here the XV 30 is identical in
styling as the bigger XV 40 there's that
same durable front grille there's a
slightly smooth texture all around here
and the front has the same LED lights
which I'll show later the only
difference is that these speakers don't
light up and then on the rear you have
the passive basic radiator one question
you have to ask yourself to see if these
Sony speaker is right for you do you
need a speaker that's fully waterproof
like speakers from JBL
fugu and ue just name a few or is splash
resistance from sony is just enough if
you don't need waterproofing against you
drops and spills into the pool or lake
here it's only XP 30 there's at least
water resistance and from my testing
here at the studio drenching these
things here all three Sony speakers are
holding up well looking at the buds up
top the XP 30 is a mirror image of the
other two while still providing the same
quality feel and press the far-left
toggles extra base on or off holding it
down does turn off the LEDs if you would
like and with the telephone icon holding
that down will give you your battery
information and that's fine imprisoned
tapping it when not on a phone call
brings up Google assistant or Siri the
time is 5 p.m. and of course if there's
an incoming phone call you can answer
and use the speaker like a speakerphone
with mine testing the Sony
thirty it's clear doesn't give off that
bathroom echo effect or reverb and
standing five feet away my voice is
still very much audible now we're joined
to the buns pause play by I'm up and
down but right in that middle just like
JBL connect + ue party up this add
button allows you to pair to sony XB
speakers and have them offer stereo
separation which I highly recommend or
you can pair up to 10 speakers and have
them all play at the same time whether
you can pair up to a hundred speakers
just like the competition here but 10 is
truly enough for most people and with my
test syncing worked and during playback
99% of the time the signal was clear and
clean and once in a while I would hear
the speakers cut out though for about a
second or two and that's what the
speakers in the same room pretty odd
phenomena now for those who own more
than one these speakers let us know in
the comment section below
if you had a similar issue or not
hopefully you can help others that are
thinking of buying two of these
specifically to pair them now moving on
NFC is offered which is seriously
underrated here tap your NFC enabled
phone and have these speakers sync
nearly instantly rotate into the rear
behind the flap is a 3.5 millimeter
input a USB port to use the speaker like
a power bank to charge your other
devices or phone and dead smack in the
middle is the AC wall adapter port oddly
the speaker doesn't use USB 2.0 or USB
type-c or recharge you'll need a
supplied wall plug if you ever travel it
is proprietary so keep that in mind
touching based on battery life Sony's
climbing up to 24 hours of use 4 hours
more than he charged 3 and way more than
what you eat offers with my testing I
perform on every speaker living at 50%
volume playing it from full to dead I
was able to get 14 hours and 52 minutes
and that's what extra base time and the
LEDs and I believe most people will use
extra base since that's the only way
that the Sony speaker would sound
competitive on the market in my opinion
Oh before I forget here Sony is using
bluetooth 4.2 testing wireless range
having to signal go through a wall and a
storage cabinets I was able to achieve
about 60 meter feet with my samsung si
plus that I recently cracked a screen
with it last probably one of the biggest
reasons why you would buy this speaker
over the others are the LED lights they
fade in and out there's a little mini
strobe light that pulsates to the music
etc and I'd like to actually look really
good I can see this in dorm rooms if
you're having some late night jamming
session and the lights are dim it's
surely a conversation starter for sure
if you have two of these laying around
they look pretty legit to accent the
mood if you download the app Fiesta Bowl
and song tale you get the same amount of
settings as you do would be bigger xp
for tea giving you the ability to change
them to colors and then have them fade
to different styles
now they could use some more options
here to be honest or at least a
customization mode for us to play around
with but what is available is way more
than what other speakers are offering at
the moment so to the opponent you've
been waiting for here I'll play several
songs for you to hear I might as well
throw the JBL charge three for
comparison and try to help you make that
purchase decision again be sure to
follow my social media when you get a
chance and help support my work by
following
your mommy Ellen come back to me I want
to be below the chain rounded where your
fans on fishes are tilting I want
neither man before you go but I ask it
separated fast and burn is all I ever
known
go and there you have it folks audio
recorded on my end and then played
through your speakers are not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence my
review here first up and this is always
hit or miss some say it's a placebo
effects but with my time testing audio
you have some speakers or headphones
they respond better to a break-in period
better than others when I first played
the XP 30 the bass was a bit strong and
it was noticeable that they were
spilling over into the mid-range after
the first hour man did the XP 30 sound
better consistently comparing to the JBL
charge 3 the sony is slightly louder and
offers slightly more bass it's not a
huge leap but if you had them side by
side you can tell there's a slight
difference now for a mid tier speaker
it's punchy and offers a bass boosted
sound signature it's not deep and
resonating but comparing to the many
other 150 to 200 competitors out there
the XP 30 has some of the most the
mid-range one first tested it sounded
recessed but after about that hour again
mid-range was as Ford and bright as the
charge 3 and at times louder and more
pronounced any charge 3 though keep in
mind I still love my JBL speakers and
I'm confident many of you still do of
course it's still a great speaker and
they perform very very close with each
other as for the high notes
nothing tinging was experienced called
an ear ringing or listening fatigue
however I do wish that there was a bit
more detail or better resolution and
it's happened at full violin as for
soundstage Bluetooth speakers always
struggle in this area however the XP 30
does very good for a Bluetooth speaker
better than most out there and inches
out the jpoa charge 3 by a hair as well
so in the end into summarize the JBL
charge 3 at times sounds clearer as
there is just ever so slightly lesser
amount of bass but most of the time for
the average consumer
I believe what Jordy of you will enjoy
the bass your experience in more for and
colorful sound coming from the Sony /
JBL more so than fugu better than these
smaller boats revolve the both revolve
Plus well that was a very good speaker
but the Sony did better than the UE boom
- hands down now in the end if you need
a more rugged build waterproof
something that you want to take somewhat
of a beating for peace of mind the
competitors are there for sure the
charge three I would say offers both
great audio and the aforementioned
ruggedness but if you solely are basing
your decision an audio at the $150 price
range the XP 30 is the one I would
highly recommend that you try first so
