review room Google the creators of the
Nexus brand takes a different turn
compared to the previous tablets they've
made in conjunction with HTC they're
offering a size right in between most
competitors at 8.9 inches and a starting
price that's equivalent to premium small
tablets 399 dollars for these 16
gigabytes and 479 for the 32 gigabyte
version so we'll see how this fares and
share with you my personal experience so
without further ado welcome to another
review as with all my reviews we'll
start with the physical features first
overall this has been a comfortable
in-between size that's not too big and
not too small
with my medium-sized hands I can still
grab this single-handedly and it's not
close to being the thinnest tablet in
the world but it's thin enough in my
opinion it comes in at almost 8
millimeters thick but what I did notice
after testing so many tablets it did
have a bit of weight to it the Nexus 9
although light for everyday average
consumers but comparing the weight with
other small tablets the Nexus 9 weight
actually falls closer to the 10 inch
brands on the market again for the
average consumer I don't think they'll
notice but if you do have another 8.4
inch tablets or smaller you'll notice
that there's a difference in weight and
less regarding the backing I try to stay
away from reading other reviews before
my review comes out but at one point it
was all over social media that the
backing was thin and flimsy now I try
this personally myself when holding it
upright in my hands and slightly
squeezing the middle here and also
placing it on a table face down and
pressing on the Nexus logo now there is
a slight flex and it honestly looks
worse than it really is
at least on my tablet and I believe with
my experience it's still within
tolerance and if I recall I felt that
squishiness and a different tablet i've
tested in the past as well but again
it's possibly just my tablet but others
on social media have documented worse
overall the construction does not feel
premium or high-end but in my opinion
it's still done well though nothing that
suggests the build of the tablet will
start falling apart or having gaps or
maybe seams will start becoming bigger
and start the show by going over the
rest of the tablets here
doing a quick overview there's a 3.5
millimeter port up top for your
earphones or to connect this to your
speakers to the right are your power
button and volume rocker buttons which
I'll omit are so recessed that it's
actually hard to find physically over
time with muscle memory it does get
slightly better but there's no question
this takes much more effort than any
other tab that I've tested on the market
and not to mention at night it's very
difficult to find these buttons as you
can barely see them as well they're not
chrome trimmed or they don't have any
other color to accentuate or
differentiate I'm sorry with the very
black look at the tablet and very less
on the bottom here if you're holding
this vertically is the microUSB port for
charging now one item that I honestly
was disappointed and was the missing
micro SD card slot now we've seen with
many other premium tablets - Apple that
provides additional storage at your
device clearly 16 gigabytes is not
enough for today's huge photos apps
movies and games so if you're a big
downloader of items this might put you
in a little pinch now with the frontier
one of the biggest perks that I wish all
tablets had are front-facing speakers
now what the Nexus 9 they're just loud
enough to listen to nothing to stell it
or speak of but it's really all the same
with most tablets they're really small
the only difference sound is not muffled
from either being under the tablet or
covered up by your hands when holding on
compared to the competitors and the last
item on the tablet itself is the front
and rear facing cameras with pictures on
your screen for your review now all
photos are taken with the rear eight
megapixel shooter that's unedited and
you can be the judge for yourself
pictures were okay with hit or miss
performance from the Nexus 9 in my
opinion of course inadequate lighting
pitches were sharp and the colors do
appear accurate but in both very bright
lights and low-light situations the
camera had trouble in very producing
accurate color and distinguishing light
versus dark areas now discussing the
screen itself the resolution comes in at
2048 by 1536 giving it pixel per inch
density of 287 now that's on par with
bigger tablets on the market but just a
little bit lower than smaller tablets
but overall images are still crisp and
clear now this may be an issue for
something and possibly not for others
but of all the tablets listed on the
screen all but Apple products being used
a 16 to 9 or 16 to 10
aspect ratio now most movies and TV
shows are now recorded and displayed
with the widescreen format and with a
four by three aspect ratio which the
Nexus 9 has it's the same ratio as your
old-school boxy square conventional TVs
back in the day now when watching
widescreen contents you'll have those
black bars and going across your screen
again it's not a big issue for some but
I just hate to lose some screen real
estate when the content provided
supports the mainstream standard of
today and regarding color accuracy and
saturation all images appears natural
with just enough color definition to
make the screen enjoyable however there
has been mentioning some screen bleeding
basically where the edges appears to be
slightly brighter and at times not
uniform and this is very important when
you intend on purchasing a brand new LED
TV the same principle applies here now
it's not a bothersome for most people
but a few Nexus 9 owners have reported
much worse experiences than I have here
where it would be an obvious issue now
going into the performance here this
tablet does feature the newest k1
processor developed by Nvidia and no
question this processor is a beast for
gaming but going down some of the major
specifications first the Nexus 9 does
come with two gigs of RAM and the latest
Android lollipop and indeed two gigs of
ram seems very 2013 ish but my overall
experience has been for the most part
still good and didn't feel different
from other tablets I've been used in
regards to multitasking as for casual
navigating the tablet feels IPPY to me
and I didn't encounter any repetitive
lag or stutters that I would deem
unreasonable
now this entails opening different
applications and moving in between apps
again a very smooth experience I also
tested this right next to the latest
iPad air 2 with their latest processor
on board or just no slouch either
and from real-world testing side-by-side
they both loaded about the same time
sometimes the Apple is faster sometimes
the Nexus was faster but both always
within a reasonable amount of time of
each other so either or I'm confident
that you'll really enjoy the performance
of his tablet 9 regards to connectivity
the Nexus 9 does support the latest
wireless standard that's wireless AC and
also included like any tablet should
these days is bluetooth 4.1 and last is
NFC also known as the near-field
communication and that's low
right under the camera I know some
people thought it was right in the
middle the tablet but we eventually
found it's not in a traditional location
now in regards to better life Nexus is
claiming up to nine and a half hours of
Wi-Fi browsing and as with most if not
all of my battery tests across devices
living this at 50% brightness and
playing movies music random web surfing
and leaving a screen on in the entire
time I achieved eight hours and 20
minutes and that's with three percent
remaining left until the battery died so
overall where Google has entered into
the tablet market with its unique size a
great processor in my opinion a display
for the most part that is nice to look
at and of course the newest operating
system stock Android 5.0 it does warrant
the price tag of 399 but when you
account for the possible design flaws
although mine doesn't seem as bad as a
few select others out there the possible
screen bleeding the lack of a microSD
card slots and the for the three aspect
ratio on the screen and again the design
flaws mentioned earlier as well it
really makes you feel for $399 there
might be better design options out there
now if you do decide on getting the
Nexus 9 of course double check the build
quality when you bring it home right
away
like I said mine doesn't seem as bad and
hopefully it's something that Google and
HTC realizes and manufactures a new
batch and hopefully they're clean and
free of any issues so how this review
