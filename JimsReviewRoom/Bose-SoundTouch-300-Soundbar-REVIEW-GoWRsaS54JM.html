room I'm continuing to grow my reviews
for sound bars I've tested clips one
from pulk Visio Yamaha and I'm finally
touching base on this one you requested
it I'm reviewing it hits the Bose
soundTouch 300 let me know in the
comments section if there's anything
else you want me to review if it gets a
ton of likes I'm sure to notice it and
I'll look into it for you guys but the
Bose soundTouch 300 I got this off of
B&amp;amp;H photo for the retail price of $700
as always I'll leave my links in the
video description below click on my
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
so without further adieu I'm Jimmy with
jims review room and I'm here to help
you make that purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review
going over what's in the box first you
get everything on screen pause it if you
need to now if you're wondering what
this funky head pin is for some home
theater systems and sound bars include a
mic you would position and where you are
sitting so the audio system can
calibrate to your rooms orientation in
your seating location in this case the
microphone is a headband that you wear
during setup I know a bit funky but I'm
taking a closer look at the Sun bar
measurements are on your screen with my
55 inch Samsung TV in the back for your
reference it's very compact with an
extremely low profile for a sound bar
the very top it is super fingerprint
prone from Bose using a lovely piece of
tempered glass though and when sitting
at a height with my TV I didn't see any
distracting reflections from the
television which is a huge relief the
front is solid with an aluminum grille
and then rotating the sound bar here to
the rear
it is hard plastics with your bass ports
on either side now looking into
connections the inputs for your video
sources are quite limiting very limiting
actually for my taste but first going
over the basics there's the power port
and a LAN cable connection for your
internet you have a port labeled
acoustic master connected BOCES
subwoofers sold separately that's
another 700 or 1329 dollars if you buy
both as a package and then on the right
is one HDMI out to your TV and the port
for a debt IQ again that headband now
the only two inputs that you have are
optical in and one HDMI in and that's
basically it now that's where it is
limiting if you have a PlayStation Xbox
blu-ray player maybe a PC connected you
would have to connect directly to the TV
and use arc it's abbreviated for the
Audio Return Channel now I'm confident
that's what Bose would say as the
alternative and it's great in theory but
the fact that some TVs and many don't
know this especially the average
consumer if it's not a direct connection
to the sound bar the arc technology and
some TVs takes your surround sound
signal and brings it to a 2.0 sound
experience you essentially lose surround
sound if you have a TV that's a few
years all that's something you have to
take into consideration if you plan on
having multiple devices if your TV is
new you might be fine of course check
with your manufacturer now four
connections are there than a video
source if you can't run a LAN cable
there's built-in Wi-Fi for audio
features like internet radio 2
for all your news and talk radio and
services like Spotify I Heart Radio and
Amazon music all of those services are
accessible through the Bose soundTouch
app available for both Apple and Android
NFC or near field communication pairing
is offered right on the center of the
sound bar one touch with your phone
pairs both devices nearly instantly
bluetooth is available and from my
testing I walked 40 linear feet away
from the sound touch 300 and my Samsung
phone still retained a connection so do
the moment you've been waiting for hear
the audio test be sure to put your
headphones or earphones on and enjoy hey
Adam everything set up on this good
let's play it
it's view of the Hudson I never get over
how beautiful it is up here
birds
that way you take me to the walls class
I didn't like the quiet
the boy sing a lot
we got a mother and he be getting back
to
I just saw a lot a real bond between man
and beast here in Norway are the same
word on war we know that the military
needs to reduce casualties some people
took the robots in the future look
Nature gave us the most effective
killing machines put 75 million years
ago and now we know they can take orders
finally make progress about the fencing
you say make a weapon and there you have
it folks
of course audio recorded on my end and
then play through your speakers are not
the best depiction of audio quality but
that's my review the sound touch 300
provides some of the cleanest and
clearest audio experiences what Bose
does offer is a very articulate sound
bar what gets most people hook the first
time around first time hearing this is
the impressive wide ambience and
soundstage that these sound touch offers
I would say a hundred and forty to 150
degree field of view in front of you
this is where you can hear the audio
separation at its best
playing scenes from the revenant and I
can't show you the violent parts on
YouTube of course but here in raindrops
or the Sun of the outdoors is very very
immersive then some scenes have actors
in front of you front and center pretty
straight for here then hearing the sound
of nature further in front of the actor
in addition muffled ambience air in the
rear of the actor there's just simply a
great deal of audio depth now that the
sambar does not offer Dolby Atmos or DTS
virtual X for a height or vertical
surround sound simulation there is a
sense of audio above you and off to the
side not as this thing too but you'd get
a slight to moderate experience we're
not having these certified Atmos or
details virtual content and speakers
what is missing though and most Sun bars
do struggle with this there are no
distinguishable simulated rear audio
understandable in Bose does offer tiny
rear satellites for an additional three
hundred dollars now as per base for a
sunburn that doesn't come with a
subwoofer which is I'm considering I'm
paying $700 for this thing the sound
touch 300 is very capable of providing
subtle bass to help supplement the audio
experience for a standalone sound bar it
performs well on the other hand with any
setup either desktop speakers - home
theater I personally recommend getting a
subwoofers so you can feel the bass
either/or if you're only going for the
soundbar is still an experience that's
very easy to listen to very clear and
balanced the bass is decent and the
sound such does save itself you can say
by offering such an impressive sound
field the only things I would say that
you would have to worry about is the arc
connection as mentioned earlier and
pricing with the sum it's not cheap but
if you have the money I highly recommend
the setup so hope this review helped you
