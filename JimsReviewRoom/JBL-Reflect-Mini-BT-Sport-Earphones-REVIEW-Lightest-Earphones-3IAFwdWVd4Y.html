room I'm looking for some cheap sport
earbuds and seeing if there's any
alternative to some of the more
expensive brands out there I just
reviewed several from Jabra and they did
very well for my test but today we're
looking at one from JBL it's the reflect
mini bt it's priced at $99 retail as of
this video and as always you can click
on my link in the video description
below for the most up-to-date prices so
without further adieu my channel is here
to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
going over the physical features first
these are a very simple design the air
tips provided has two sets that are a
one-piece design that sits in the ear
with the attached ear wing up top the
other two sets are just the ear tips
themselves and note your wing of course
provided either case the material used
is very soft very comfortable in the ear
and more importantly this stayed in my
ear very well during workouts and during
my runs now the only issue though they
do attract a good bit of dust moving to
the design and durability these are all
plastic construction with rubber ends
here that's very grippy for texture and
the wire guards below are protected with
the same material and I know some will
have the same concern about how thin the
wire is and indeed they do feel thin yet
from my time wearing these and throwing
them into my bag like any other pair of
earphones I've tested they haven't shown
any signs of issues or disconnection
moving down to the inline volume
controller I do admit these do feel a
bit cheap though they don't give as much
feedback as you would like to affirm an
action nonetheless they do work and the
back side of controller there's a
microUSB port for charging the reflect
mini from my test here from a dead
battery to full had taken an hour and 34
minutes to do and regarding battery life
JBO claims up to eight hours of use and
from my test and leaving these on and
about sixty percent volume they died at
nine hours and 17 minutes not bad in
that aspect now I would have her throw
some caution to the wind here as reading
up on other customer reviews on both
JBL's websites and Amazon there's a good
handful people mentioning their having
battery issues after several months of
use the battery then doesn't hold a
charge
I haven't only for several months yet so
I personally haven't experienced this
but again just so you guys are aware
just be cautious about that and the very
last issues these are water and sweat
resistance as they should be for being
sport earphones and for my test dripping
and spraying water on these the reflect
mini still works perfectly fine
regarding wireless range I have this
pair to my Nexus 6p smartphone and
walked from one side of the house to the
other and there's no issues whatsoever
and that's me going through several
walls and down to the first floor so
overall how is the sound quality for a
$99 pair of sport earphones from my
experience these do well bass may be
lacking for some as it doesn't offer
that deep sub bass levels that some may
desire however bass is still evident and
it's very tight and very controlled I
will consider these in years
to have a neutral bass signature
and still acceptable for non-base heads
the mid-range is clear with voices
standing out and the high notes in high
pitches of music isn't droning or
causing any kind of listening fatigue
you can listen to these for several
hours and just be perfectly relaxed and
fine
audio separation is there for left and
right audio separation however the sound
stage isn't as open as much as I would
have light but for a $99 pair of support
earphones they do just fine
now I would say if you're on a budget
and looking for very good all-around
pair of support earphones from pop rock
classical folk maybe some EDM in modern
day country these are for you if you're
into basic core genres of hip hop rap or
in general just these are a bit more
bass I would say look elsewhere now it's
so caution about the battery life but
other than that these are indeed super
lightweight they are very easy to wear
and it does stay in the ear very well so
that's it for the review be sure to help

care I'll see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
