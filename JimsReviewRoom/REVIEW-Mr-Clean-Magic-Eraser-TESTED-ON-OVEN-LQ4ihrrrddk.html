review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the mr. Clean Magic Eraser
by Procter &amp;amp; Gamble well looking through
the erasers construction &amp;amp; Style
specifications and features and lastly
my pros and cons on its performance and
usage so let's get started here now I
gotta admit this is a really cheap
product and I'm strong away from my
typical electronic reviews but after
using it this eraser I had to tell
people about this thing now it claims to
remove all sorts of stains that can't be
removed by sprays and cleaners and can
be used on all sorts of surfaces so I
purchased this magic eraser for my local
Walmart for about three dollars and
fifty cents and it came in a four pack
and there's other various erasers out
there that are a bit more expensive and
they're a bit more thicker for the
heavy-duty ones and some come with
grooves and whatnot
now the exterior color is white and when
touched it feels like a really dense
sponge the construction or material from
my research it's called melamine foam
which have been around for over two
decades it was initially used for either
sound or temperature insulation and
apparently someone found out it's great
for removing stains the cleaning works
as a Super Micro abrasive pad which
won't scratch most surfaces now of
course test in a small spot first before
scrubbing and this magic eraser just
make a damp just wetting it a little bit
and scrub away so let's get into the
pros and cons here first it works and it
works great you don't know how many
different chemicals are used on my oven
and especially my oven glass splatter
from just baking cooks right onto the
glass and sticks there virtually forever
and I've used store-bought cleaners and
commercial chemicals that would get from
a local restaurant and nothing would
take it out this eraser does depending
on how long since you last clean there
may be some elbow grease but again like
I said it does work and uses primarily
I'm an oven my toaster oven and my
microwave
however I've heard people using this on
their car rims painted walls etc wide
variety of usage but I haven't done that
myself but again for only three dollars
and fifty cents if you want to
highly recommend that you can try it
another Pro that is great it only needs
water there's no harsh chemicals you
don't need to soak the sponge or
anything like that
I guess that again you just wet it and
you start scrubbing away some of the
cons it doesn't last long
unfortunately the material wears down
pretty quick I would highly suggest when
holding the eraser just work out certain
sections of that eraser and ensuring
that it wears down completely before
flipping the eraser and using the other
side or the other end so is this a buy
try or not buy at all I got to say it's
so cheap it's handy just to keep around
the house for your stove at least and
it's confirmed that it works I would say
is definitely definitely a buy so I know
it's a short review but again I didn't
know about this product that's ok let's
let me give it a shot so there's just
more of a wareness so hopefully you can
give it a try yourself if you need to
and hope it helps so I hope you enjoyed
this review of the mr. Clean Magic
Eraser and if you have not please take
