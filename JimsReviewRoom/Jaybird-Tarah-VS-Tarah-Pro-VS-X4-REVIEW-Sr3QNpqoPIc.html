have the ex fours the Tara Andy Tamara
probe models now what you want to choose
since the Tara and the pro model looks
practically the same and the exports
sits right in the middle get into a
straight-up comparison and which one
might be better for you may not mention
little tidbits of how they compare with
the competition as always being
transparent j-bird did send thee Tara's
over for comparison the x4 is though I
did personally pay for and for those who
have been following me team Jim's review
out there I'll always go over both pros
and cons for updater prizes I'll leave
my affiliate links down in that video
description below click on those links
for the most updated prices in real
times you never know when these things
might go on sale again I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room and I'm here to help
you make that purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review
anyway let's go over the physical
features first let's take a look at the
j-bird x-force
now the x-force and eat eras both have a
rubberized cable but they're also tangle
free as you guys can see now the Tara
prose and the other hand offers
something you don't normally see it's a
fabric braided cord that's what I have
in front of you now if I were to put
this in my hands and just you know mix
it up as well you can see they perform
just as good they're not to say the
x-force and the terrors have bad core
designs they're as good as the premium
offerings out there on the market but
once I tried the braided cord for the
first time I realized that the x-force
and the Tara's somewhat snags because of
its very grippy texture very grippy cord
that is it's more noticeable with those
with running jackets like the one I have
on right now or simply anything with a
collar the Tara prose eliminates that
fall together also love this about the
pros they're magnetic
basically sticking them together like so
and it sounds so minimum but during my
time of everyday use intestate it's very
practical when you're working bending
over moving around they stay on your
neck now as for comfort and fit the ex
fours improved a lot from all the
previous models they finally stay in my
ear but the x-force does have a two
silicon piece construction there's the
ear tip and of course the
wing how no sever asked this last time
hopefully this helps but yes the
previous x3 tips and air wings do fit
until the X force including the comply
from ear tips now in general the exports
are still not 100% the best fitting
support earphones for me although they
have their substantial improvements I
still felt the Jabra and JBL product
stayed in my ear the best but if we look
at the tear and tear of pros they're
completely different and it makes me
wonder if they'll ever phase out the X
line will there ever be an x5 the tear
and tear pros goes with one-piece
construction and at first they look
bulkier and I was terrified as I might
have fit issues again but honestly the
one-piece construction made these on the
best fitting sport earphones that I've
personally used with the X force the ear
flange helped a lot to keep them in but
there was an ever so slight amount of
play basically again not that it would
have been a bad product but compared to
the tear up and terror pros the extra
silicon passing the tube this also
provided not only more contact area in
the ears by grippy contact area keeping
the air phones even more so in place
during vigorous activities and without
that being said all three pairs of
earphones provided excellent passive
noise isolation blocking out most of the
outside world and to help those watching
my videos if you're looking for it your
front that you can hear your
surroundings for safety purposes such as
running in your city or cycling if you
have some sketch people in your park you
don't want someone sneaking up to you or
on you that is consider your front that
doesn't sit in your ear canal or create
a seal that blocks out the world you've
got to choose which one you prefer
better
there's not many brands that offers that
and honestly you might have to step up
to truly wireless earphones that pumps
in your environmental noises through the
built-in microphones alright getting
back here all ear fields are waterproof
I've drenched all of them they're
working from my quick test I've noticed
it's been hit or miss with my fans shout
out to team gyms review room if he had
Jaybirds before even the current models
how long have you had them and are they
still going today are they still working
today
some people say they were not
functioning well after a couple months
some say they haven't for years this
would help folks
down in that comment section now another
side note that many don't talk about is
their sounds transferred from the cable
rubbing or bouncing against my clothing
or into my ears and going into my ears
that is now while running all three
perform the same and within reason for
good support earphones
however while turning my head the Brady
coordinate era pros are just ever so
slightly more audible with rubbing and
sliding against my shirt or collar and
with music going on to be fair all three
earphones in rural practice here in
rural testing it wasn't a deal-breaker
you hear of course much less but again
just a be transparent the Terra pros did
transfer a little bit more audio with
the friction that was going on now one
last thing about comfort and wearing a
huge concern was this battery pack on
the side of your face it was a problem
for me and the j-bird freedoms when they
used to be around but with the X force
it is slightly moved back and I've never
had any issues it's the same for the
Terra - Terra pros it's the same
experience the control and the better
pack has moved back now with a speed
cinch adjustable cable shortener that's
on the back here as well it removes a
lot of the slack and prevents a
controller and better pack from bouncing
around as much some don't like that
speed sense from my other review
mentioning creates this longer cable in
the back but I didn't find any issues
with it myself if it does the terror
pros are the least cumbersome once again
because of that fabric cable it's a lot
more flexible next up let's talk about
battery life authoring uses a
proprietary download which I'm never
fond of here because what if I lose them
or what if I forget them at home
and with a lack of a micro USB port I
think what jaybird was doing was trying
to create a sealed system rather than
using flaps and covers to protect it
from water and rain now each attached is
pretty easily here but they terror pros
is the omen that offers a magnetic
connection you just snap it together I
love how this feels here this was never
a problem for me but because it is
magnetic and not clipped on like the
other ones if you're trying to charge
this in your bag let's say with a power
bank it can easily disconnect when
moving about as you guys can see it just
takes a light tug thankfully if you're
not in a crunch all three offers fast
charging the tears and the X fours have
10 minutes of charging for one hour of
playback but the Terra pros have just 5
minutes for two
hours of playback which was a little bit
more ideal a better life is on your
screen and the results are there for you
better life is somewhat varying here
regarding of how much they're claiming
with what the results are all three air
phones played the same music at the same
50% environment levels from full battery
to dead the last but not least Bluetooth
technology for those who want to
future-proof themselves both Terra's
have bluetooth 5.0 great for wireless
range and battery efficiency the ex
fours oddly only has bluetooth 4.1 and I
got the x-force on my neck here no
testing this we've already seen better
life but regarding wireless range the
distance is on your screen 4.1 is truly
enough for most in regards to signal
strength now with us intending on using
this for videos first with Android users
all three earphones had zero syncing
issues on both YouTube and Netflix fire
emojis for that with Apple however the
iPhone the exports had some slight
syncing issues with YouTube but pressing
pause then play again appears to resync
the connection not the best thing in the
world but it is what it is take away
fire mode you there now Tara and Tara
pros didn't have any issues with the
YouTube or Netflix on my iPhone so
alright folks let's talk about the audio
performance first the cheapest of the
three the terrors are good as all
rounders and comparable with others in
its price range $99 the fact that the
jaybird app is very good at tuning these
earphones and makes a Tara the more
budget pair shine with responsive tweets
to your liking now compared to the other
two the Tara's was noticeably not as
loud wide or expansive in its audio as
the x4 the Tara pros per spekt the x4
should technically perform closer to the
Tara's and the pros sounding the best
but from my experience the exports
actually sounded better stock from the
factory it's slightly more expansive
slightly more depth in its audio and
slightly having more bass the export is
the signature sound that I've known from
j-bert over all these years of reviewing
them that's including punchy bass
somewhat bright and Ford mids and a
lively in-your-face sound signature at
era pros are very close still very good
compared to the competition but it is
somewhat interest
to notice in its stock settings and a
little bit more reserved but to be fair
its minut and you won't notice this
until you have both again the x-force
and then the Terra pros side-by-side and
you're switching them back and forth
repeatedly in addition that app is again
one of the best and the pros also tunes
very well if you want it as base E as
the x-force and wanted to sound a little
better than the x4 is even add some on
the high frequencies as well bump up a
little bit of that base so the question
which one would you get for me either
the X floors or the Terra pros if you
can hit that price range is what I would
recommend the Terra pros in my opinion
I simply love the new design it makes me
rethink about those lay flat silicon
cables that you find on the x-force and
also on the regular Terrace and also
those one-piece ear tips helps big time
as well the Auto signature on either one
of those are some of the best on the
market hands down and if you own either
the X threes the freedoms I'd say save
your money those are still very good
especially if they're if they are still
working for you as for the Terra's it
doesn't sound as good but for the $99
price range it's as good as anyone
anyone else out there but now they fit
the comfort is really really good
alright folks down in the comment
section below let me know what you guys
think thank you guys for watching and
supporting my work I catch you guys
