another one of my vlogs here for those
who are new welcome just keep in mind
guys these vlogs do not look anything
like my reviews so keep in mind this is
just really raw really cut and paste and
piece together for you guys nothing too
special but original members welcome
back up you guys enjoying the content
here and hope you guys are enjoying the
vlogs as well but anyways I probably
look hot and sweaty as hell right now
last night I tweeted out I get home
around midnight you know shower turn up
the AC the AC was not working holy cow
so you last night not even exaggerate it
was like 90 degrees upstairs I never had
the AC off before so it was crazy how
hot it was upstairs and then downstairs
I slept down here on The Bachelor couch
kind of looks like the casting couch for
those who know but um but call the AC
guy this morning he literally just left
fixed it in like 45 minutes an hour
thank goodness depend and the ac's just
started to blow so like I said I'm just
starting to cool down at this very
moment but the reason why I hope needed
to do this video real quick here I mean
a little bit behind schedule I got it I
just got done painting the house I know
I don't want to talk about painting and
every one of my vlogs but Jim's review
room is moving down here well not this
area but this room right here and look
how massive the size is holy cow a
little bit more than double the size of
stairs upstairs didn't have the dark
grey which looks absolutely great in the
videos I don't know how the degree is
going to turn out I'll be a hundred
percent honestly guys so in the first
couple of videos that you guys would see
this weekend prime next week as well it
probably it mostly down shops where this
film on the black table but if the
lighting looks good you guys will
eventually see it but I gotta test it
out if I am needing more lights than out
of course on the weekend I've got their
store and try to get some rearrange some
see how that looks anyways another thing
right here to my left get closer for you
guys here this plaque this play button
is really really like that that's what
signifies this reflects not only again
the hard work but at the same time with
the hard work it's a
will experience actually have people
like your work I think that's that's the
key right there and like I said you know
one goes through anything alive in
business in life no one knows like hey
this is gonna be one hundred percent hit
the only thing you can do is just be
hopeful but just grateful very very
grateful so thank you very much there so
yeah that's really it on this room right
here I know you stand the TV up here
above the fireplace at how somebody guys
have imagined it it's kind of high up
there but because it's such an open
floor plan when I am you know I don't
cook but if I'm ever in the kitchen like
back here or just doing stuff for
entertaining or there's people over here
may be my kid fiance whatever you know
we can see the TV from here as well but
since the feed is going to be on the
ground now what I'm plan to do is most
likely i just have it here from now
you'll see but i can always put it back
up but maybe review some sound bars as i
did before a prob about a year ago or so
and did you review so i didn't review
some sound bars some audio stuff i like
audio stuff so we might we might see
more of that coming down the road so
there goes what it looks like i haven't
gotten everything yet i want to show you
in detail yet because everything's not
arranged i still have my eclipse tower
speakers which is still upstairs i
didn't bring them down yet there's just
so much stuff that has to go back into
this so it's not the finished product oh
and one more thing here in my amazon
echo video i love you guys on a couple
of you guys mentioned it's like why does
Jimmy have bread a slice of bread in his
video here on the nightstand all here
this is what it looks like and it's just
basically a cup coaster that i use on my
nightstand to prevent you know anyone
kind of water damage on my and the would
basically so it's made out of cork it's
not real bread but anyway it's something
you know quirky that assault the store
one day and I just decided to buy it but
