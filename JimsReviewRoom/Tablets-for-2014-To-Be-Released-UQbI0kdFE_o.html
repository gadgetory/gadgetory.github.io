first iPad was released and it's hard to
believe that we've come this far in just
four short years since 2010 and at least
to me it feels as tablets have been
around for a while mainstream tablets
that is it was until the iPad arrived on
scene in Android to provide competition
to what we have here today now what I'd
like to do is not a review as I
traditionally perform but an outlook on
what's to come for this year so sit back
and I hope you enjoy this as this is my
attempt at reporting on this industry
here's tablets for 2014
now it wasn't before long that Apple
dominated the tablet world and for other
companies to notice so what is currently
selling right now Apple tablets still
hold as a top seller all those sales are
slowly being lost to Android platforms
the second place individual company
holder is Samsung with 19 percent of
tablet sales for all of 2013 now as of
today samsung has released a wide range
of tablets from the budget-conscious to
the very high-end before I get deep into
future tablets to be released these
Samsung tablets had just hit the market
in the past month and I believe our new
enough and worth mentioning the Samsung
currently has two main tablet series the
Galaxy Tab line and the Galaxy Note line
both are very similar and specifications
and both functions like any other tablet
however the note line includes a stylus
pen with hand recognition software and
apps to take advantage of this feature
and recently this year Samsung
introduced an extension to both of their
series with the Tab pro and note Pro
lines the pro models features the
highest specifications and hardware that
Samsung can put in at the time with an
edition of productivity apps
pre-installed but besides this brief
breakdown of the galaxy tablet world
what's unique about Samsung in general
is their true multitasking capabilities
and haven't seen this feature out swear
it yet but you can split your screen in
simultaneously use two applications at a
time and up to four on the note Pro 12
inch tablet it's an amazing feature that
I hope other brand starts to adopt
several the note pros and tab pros are
currently available at their various
price points
now moving on to the first tablet yet to
be released is the Sony Xperia z2
tablets now as of this video Sony is
taking pre-orders for the UK but
tight-lipped on the exact date and
pricing for the u.s. versions it's one
of the most anticipated tablets because
of its promising features this tablet
Apple still has those big bezels which
I'm not too fond of but it actually
comes in as the thinnest and also the
lightest tablet in the world for a 10.1
inch model and Sony seems to be getting
back to being innovative again like they
were heavily back into 80s and 90s with
having built-in digital noise
cancellation a first for any tablet sony
claims the built-in noise cancellation
will reduce 98% of all ambient noises
when paired with their sony headset and
although an additional expense on the
headphones
first impressions from review sites
confirmed they do work and they work
well the Xperia line was the first to
receive official certification through
industry IP testing ip55 and ip57 of
this tab in fresh water for up to 30
minutes is doable and imagine taking
pictures in the pool underwater or let's
say worst-case scenario your child
spills her drink all over the tablet and
this rating also means it's the dust
resistance and lastly the z2 tablet will
feature one of Qualcomm latest and
fastest processor the Snapdragon 801 and
not only with a very fast processor but
sony claims to have accurate colors an
amazing screen color saturation through
their trial luminous display technology
so hopefully we'll see this tablet
sooner than later and sony addressing
some of the flaws from the previous
model that kept it from being a
near-perfect product look out for my
full test when this is released
Rugel made one of the very best bang for
the buck tablets for 2013 the Google
Nexus 7 I reviewed had amazing
performance the highest screen density
at the time for a 7-inch tablet
and being one the thinnest and lightest
devices around however with the rumor
mills spinning speculation as Google is
developing the Nexus 8 and not just the
bigger screen but likely Nexus 7 this
will have much more of the latest
features for a decent price
and I'm sure lower than what Apple and
Samsung is currently offering in their
flagship devices now from Sina comms
contact with IHS technology Nexus 8 is
currently under development and pricing
could be as low as 299 dollars with the
current market of 8-inch tablets that
includes the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 inch
that retails for 379 and these Samsung
Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 inch and 369 dollars
in considering those tablets as base
references it may be safe to say the
Nexus 8 will have at least eight 2560 by
1600 resolution but what's more
interesting is Google's developer
conference on June 25th through to 26th
which I'm assuming will be the
discussion of Android 5.0 and the
possibility of Nexus 8 going with the
new Intel 64-bit processor again at this
time the Nexus 8 has been confirmed but
hardware spec wise hasn't with the
previous Nexus 7 models offering premium
features for a good price I'm sure
Google will follow suit with this model
as well
recent photos have leads revealing these
Samsung Galaxy Tab four Samsung's
follow-up to the tab three
budget-friendly series you can say since
the proline is now offered and they come
in seven eight and 10.1 inch screen
sizes and for 2013 Gartner research firm
of IT specialist stated quote the market
is being driven by a shift to lower
priced devices in nearly odd device
categories and quote now this includes
PCs tablets and mobile phones the Galaxy
Tab four is on the lower end specs
however there's no question on market
for those looking for a workable and
usable device and for God's sakes
Apple's just stopped selling their iPad
2 which was released March of 2011 a 30
year old device and for my search on the
internet and a link on your screen the
tab for series will feature the same
resolution as last year's Tab 3 at 1280
by 800 the presser jumps up from 1.5
dual-core to a one-point to quad-core
and while the RAM stays at the one
gigabyte territory and everything else
remains practically intact but on the
plus side the latest android kitkat will
be pre-installed and as of this video
samsung has yet to even announce this
device so no pricing or availability has
been announced but based on the leaked
photos we might see an announcement
maybe I'm April 24th of 2014 the novo
has been gaining market share rapidly
and following up to last year's model is
the yoga tablet nhdplus which is
anticipated to go on sale this upcoming
April for the starting price of three
hundred and forty nine dollars the
exterior still remains practically the
same however last year's model had a
very original yet simple design that
absolutely works a metal kickstand on
the backdrop the tablet upright for
viewing or can be placed down to have
the tablet at an angle for typing and
this is convenient as consumers
typically pay extra for protective cases
that do the same thing for their
traditional slate like tablets the yoga
tablet had up to 18 hours of battery
life on last year's model which is
simply amazing and I would only
anticipate similar performance on this
year's or just a hair lower because of
the additional features and the new
processor nonetheless battery life is
still phenomenal though the only
downfall with last year's was the screen
resolution wasn't as clear and the
processor was not a
to run assembly more demanding games
this year however the resolution is
bumped up to a 1920 by 1200 display any
Snapdragon 400 processor is in place is
not a powerhouse processor but this
would definitely get majority of your
tasks done then I think Lenovo had a
very good foundation last year and this
year they're just building upon that so
look for the yoga tablet nhdplus in
april with a starting price again of
three hundred and forty nine dollars now
the following tablet if anything is more
rumor and speculation but the biggest
iPad dubbed the iPad pro has been in the
media for some time now techradar.com
has been keeping up with the latest
rumors suggesting a possible release or
at least an announcement in October of
2014 a little after the announcement of
the new iPhone 6 in September and
considering this tablet will have the
pro label on there I can only speculate
this will be the best of the best tablet
features from Apple now I'm a bit
worried since Apple in my opinion hasn't
been as innovative when compared to the
other competitors out there now if Apple
is to stand out and make a statement of
being a leader in design and innovation
again we need to see a tablet with the
first-ever 2k resolution and instead of
just having a larger screen with indeed
included productivity apps I'd rather
see a microSD card slot a built-in HDMI
out for video display for presentations
and if getting such a large screen I
highly doubt it but having two apps
split screen for working and viewing and
I'm sure this will be a pretty penny
considering that Samsung Galaxy Note
twelve point two is at least 750 dollars
again although rumor you never know an
Apple might come out with this one will
see this as time progresses so those are
just a few tablets that are unique in
their own way and some that you may not
have been aware of this goes without
saying there are honourable mentioning
switch currently have very limited to no
information at all such as the new CEO
of Barnes &amp;amp; Noble has confirmed there
will be a brand new nook HD for 2014 but
other than that there's no specs
manufacturer or even in announcement
dates there's speculation of a new
Microsoft Surface Mini to be reviewed
June of 2014 and considered the Kindle
Fire HD
and Nexus 7 has been hit last year we
should be expecting some news on the
release of their successors this summer
so the tablet's I believe this year are
now really starting to show signs of
going beyond just the multi-touch
high-resolution screens with cameras the
race is not just focused on being the
thinnest and the lightest anymore either
we're starting to see some innovative
features in those tablets like
multitasking from Samsung or
water-resistance features from Sony of
course there's other tablets I didn't
mention like some from Asus or HP but
please comment and let us know of other
tablets you're excited about that I
couldn't get around to so here's the
2014 and what comes ahead this is Jimmy
from Jim's review room of the year from
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
