review room welcome to another review
today we've been looking at the brand
new samsung galaxy tabpro the model I
have here is the 10.1 inch 16 gigabyte
Wi-Fi only version and a tapper products
at the moment comes in at 8.4 10.1
inches which is what I have here today
in 12.2 a samsung also has another
series of tablets called the Galaxy Note
pro which has almost identical
specifications but has features that
makes the news of a supplied stylus pen
and those only come in 10.1 and 12.2
inches and you can click on it with any
one of these videos playing to watch
them or find them on my channel so the
price is kind of on the expensive side
but after reviewing so many tablets
Samsung does strive to become a premium
tablet maker and a tab pro series is no
exception
so without further ado we'll get started
this tap Pro menu buttons are located on
the bottom here indicating this tablet
is designed to be used preferably in
landscape mode because so it measures in
at nine point five seven inches wide six
point seven four inches tall then only
0.28 inches thin and that's seven point
one millimeters to be exact making this
tide to be the finished tablet on the
market as of this review at least until
the Sony Xperia z2 is released here in
the States
and regarding the weight it's a here
over a pound at sixteen point five four
ounces still making this a very
lightweight tablet now going over its
physical features my medium size hands
we're still able to grab the 10.1 inch
tab pro comfortably and especially after
I reviewed the twelve inch model which
is a nice size to keep on the desk
the 10.1 inch model really became the
right size for me you can say not too
big and not too small and I'm still able
to maneuver and walk around with this
without fear of dropping it now if
you're making that transition from a
laptop to a tablet or intend on using
this for productivity movies and even
gaming this size is genuinely
comfortable the 8.4 inch I personally
liked very much as well it fits into one
palm easily but again for me personally
it just feels more suitable for and ego
applications you can say now looking at
the back real quick of the tempo and
note Pro products at least we'll have
the same backing which is imitation
leather with this faux stitching and the
layout is similar across most other
Samsung tablets as well with the power
button on top with vine rockers next an
infrared blaster in the middle to
control your TV once you set that up
rotating to the right here offers a
micro SD card slot which is highly
beneficial instead of buying a 32
gigabyte tablet and paying that premium
buying an SD card slot to expand its
member is much cheaper and you can
expand it up to 64 gigs in total now on
the very bottom is your mini USB power
port for charging and to the very left
is a three-and-a-half millimeter input
for your headphones on either side as
your speakers which does provide stereo
sound the placements aren't good as you
don't block them with your hands when
holding onto the tablet unlike the 8.4
inch models where sound was a bit
muffled by your palm the sound quality
is not bad but nothing stellar to speak
about as there's really no depth or
immersion
they were perfectly fine though and does
justice for casually watching movies and
listening to music now with the front
Samsung includes a touch-sensitive
recent apps and back button with a
physical home button right in the middle
and then finishing up the physical
features the front has a 2 megapixel
camera while the rear has a 8 megapixel
camera with a built-in LED flash which
is the same across the other pro models
as well including the note Pro line now
Apple has been known for taking some
good photos and I'm using an Apple iPad
which is a premium tablet using it as a
base to compare these samsung pro line
cameras and as you can see samsung has
more crisp images less noise and a bit
better color saturation in my opinion so
Samsung again really packed a lot into
its physical aspect but what about the
internals the display and any notable
features that makes this a pro model so
now we'll take a deeper look into the
world of Samsung and as stated earlier
this is the 10.1 inch model with the
same resolution as the bigger pro models
available at 2560 by 1600 giving a very
crisp and sharp image pixel density for
this 10.1 inch model comes in at 299
pixels per inch the more density of
pixels per inch the more crisp images
and lettering will be an ad or around
300 pixels per inch it's a very clear
image that I cannot distinguish from
other tablets that say it has 320 or 330
PPI is so that you'll be perfectly fine
I can't tell the difference the image
quality is still very well done though
with contrasting colors and deep blacks
and bright whites so with all that being
said how's the performance especially
considering this is labeled as a pro
model or is it just a name that Samsung
uses in its marketing the Galaxy Tab pro
10.1 uses Samsung's own developed Exynos
5 octa core processor as 4 cores that
runs at 1.9 gigahertz and the other four
runs at 1 point 3 gigahertz giving you a
total 4 cores in total now this is also
the same processor found in two 12.2
incheon now my third-party benchmarking
and testing found this was similar to
slightly slower performance by just a
hair though in some areas when compared
to the Snapdragon 800 processor which is
also found in the 8.4 inch model I just
reviewed a few weeks back
also the model surprisingly came in with
only two gigs of RAM considering more
flexion models are or will come with
three gigabytes as being the standard
now nonetheless for everyday tasks like
web browsing email music and movies all
ran perfectly fine gaming also did not
show any signs of slowing down and per
the benchmark tests it's still a very
powerful machine that's capable of doing
anything that you'd need done today
the only issue and this is notorious
amongst Samsung tablets there's always a
bit of lag in certain applications or
actions needed to be performed despite a
very powerful processor I'm certain it's
with the optimization by Samsung that
has certain actions stutter you don't
see it too often but once in a while you
do notice it it's definitely not a deal
breaker but it's worth mentioning though
now going through the interface here you
have the latest TouchWiz that many are
familiar with but what's new is magazine
UX it's a tile based interface in which
companies believe are becoming more
popular and demanding think windows 8
live tiles or the app Flipboard at
maximum each page can hold up to six
titles and you can edit or change your
newsfeed by holding down the icon then
dragging your desired topic to your page
layout now once loaded you can click on
either tile and flip through just like a
page in a magazine or an article now one
issue I've found so far with magazine UX
it looks quite limited as you can see
these social realm of apps there's no
Facebook no Instagram Tumblr Google
Hangouts etc and apps I've downloaded so
far through the Google Play Store or the
Samsung store does not show up here and
I would assume those apps have to be
compatible with magazine UX for them to
work it would have been real nice to see
a live feed in real time of all my
social networks email news etc all on
one screen
now with that being said I found myself
using these standard TouchWiz interface
more since all my information was on
there and quickly showcasing Flipboard I
preferred using this over magazine UX as
it does update automatically instead of
having to click refresh on magazine UX
all the time and just maybe down the
road hopefully in the near future
magazine UX will grow to be something a
little bit more
this tablet like the other Galaxy
products offers multitasking multi
window is available when you swipe from
the right to offer applications to drag
and drop onto your screen this tablet is
able to run two applications at the same
time without any issues I found playing
a movie on top while browsing the
internet on the bottom is my favorite
feature while relaxing and you can see
on the right side of the screen are some
of the apps that you can do this with
and there's more apps that can be added
down the road and because this is a pro
model there is a suite of
business-focused type apps pre-installed
such as having control over your
computer off-site with remote PC II
meeting lets you host and attend
meetings where people are on the same
network and having the e meeting
software as well and then there's the
hand comm viewer it's similar to your PC
office suite like Microsoft Word Excel
etc however none of these in particular
really interested me as Google products
provides similar or same product
offerings which are free as well but
more widely adapted across all operating
platforms so you just not limited the
Samsung products and with my testing
simulating casual and average news I was
able to achieve seven hours and 15
minutes with setting up the tablet
downloading all my programs leaving
auto-brightness
on and casual news including one movie
all while Samsung claims up to ten hours
of news on their website so after
testing what I believe the average
consumer would encounter the Tab pro
series is great in performance despite
the minor lagger stutters that would
occur like the other samsung tablet pro
models whether it be a tab pro or a note
pro model you do receive features that
are normally not found on other tablets
like the amazing multitasking
capabilities the ultra sharp screen that
is very good performing camera and an
amazingly thin and lightweight tablet so
