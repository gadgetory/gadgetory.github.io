Jimmy with Jim's review room this has to
be one of the most anticipated reviews
one of the most requested reviews for me
at the end of this year Google has
returned with the Nexus lineup of phones
with a 6p model I have here offering
some very impressive specs yet for a
very attractive price as of this video
they're suggested retail figures are on
your screen and when compared to the
competition pricing alone fares pretty
well and as a reference I personally
paid for this here and we'll be showing
the graphite model coming in at 64 gigs
of internal storage so with this video I
want to discuss what I found both
lighted disliked and how the average
consumer would feel coming to a nexus
for the first time so without further
ado my channel is here to help you make
a purchase decision
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room welcome
everyone to another review
since owning a nexus I really came to
the conclusion Nexus is all about
simplicity clean lines and just focusing
on what works at least with the 6p
there's no fuss no special back plates
just a pure simple yet solid aluminium
build in the rear and Gorilla Glass 4 on
the front now comparing size and weight
we're looking at numbers very close to
all other flexib phones in the markets
offered one of the thinnest phones out
there at seven point three millimeters
despite feeling great and unobtrusive in
the pockets the thinness and smooth
aluminium back did cause the phone to
feel quite slippery for my tastes having
me consider purchasing a skin or a low
profile case it's just a heads up on
that quickly looking at the front I'm
sure many reviewers have said that these
are some of the best speakers they've
heard on a phone and for those who do
file on my channel I do a lot of audio
reviews as well the quality sounds
similar to any other flagship phone but
in a big but the placement in the front
and having two speakers that's greatly
help with your immersion into the music
the speakers aren't there to offer
virtual surround sound and indeed there
is a much sound separation or fidelity
but this offers more full sound to the
ears direct sound instead of down firing
or covered by your palm because so the
speaker placement is what really shines
in my opinion making for one of the much
better audio experiences compared to the
competition looking closer and moving
around the physical phone the edges are
beveled and like most aluminum devices
they do show a parent Nick's over time
but having the 6p as my everyday work
phone and putting it through its paces
has shown no signs of wear or scratches
and the front rear and especially on a
transparent bezel on the back going
around the entire phone the top has your
3.5 millimeter headphone port on the
sides has your power button and two taps
on here will open your camera very fast
even if your screen is off and locked
vayan rocker buttons are directly below
and looking on the bottom is the latest
and greatest USB type-c connection and I
won't go into too much detail but for
the average consumer who are not aware
there are promises of this connection
offering to send and receive power more
power that is than previous USB types a
connection that can go in either way no
more guessing who which way is up and
lasts for the average consumer you are
future proofing yourself as you'll see
this connection more so in 2016
and on the support does offer rapid
charging and it does work fantastic
however despite being USB type-c the
fast charging who worked as fast as my
personal test with the LG v10 and the
newest Samsung s6 edge+ resulting in an
hour and 30 minutes from a 1% battery
remaining level again very impressive
but I was hoping for a faster charge
since type C has been receiving much
praise about its potential power
transfer abilities in addition there are
a few things that needs to be mentioned
as well and this is no way of me bashing
the 6p but information some consumers
are aware although while Qualcomm
processor is installed in this and
Qualcomm chipsets are the ones that
offers the quick charging ability if you
already own a quick charging wall
adapter they will not work here all of
the six p m-- a display rapid charge
being on the amount of power being
pushed to the phone is not equivalent to
the supplied wall adapter from Google
and in hindsight now many people have
USB type-c cables linked around so
buying a few new bars is recommended for
the car or maybe one for your workplace
now I ran into this hurdle several times
second type C is capable of offering
speeds up to 10 gigabytes per second and
is backwards compatible but for my tests
and doing some research online the Nexus
6p is only capable of moving data at USB
2.0 speeds as my video is demonstrating
although I have the wire connected to a
super speed USB 3.0 port in the end the
new port does make it future-proof but
its performance is really identical to
other phones out there not saying it's
bad but to the average consumer hearing
that this is having a new as the latest
and greatest technology they honestly
thought that there was something maybe
better better performance that is at
least I thought so but getting back to
the physical phone I gotta say I am used
to having the volume and power buttons
higher on most other devices and a month
into using the 6p I'm still accidentally
bumping the volume and power buns when
I'm grabbing my phone especially if I'm
running for exercising
I'm just essentially holding the main
and traditional grabbing areas which is
right in the middle now rotating to the
rear recessed in is the fastest
fingerprint scanner that I've ever used
at something so small and so little but
the difference in speed is actually
noticeable you don't need to turn on
your screen first to unlock your phone
you just simply tap and briefly hold and
it works with an extremely high success
rate
above that then going into detail about
the camera it's a twelve point three
megapixel that shoots in a four by three
aspect ratio and if we prefer the wider
sixteen by nine this is limited to eight
point three megapixels instead so just a
heads up on that a infrared laser
assisted autofocus works very fast here
dual LEDs to help light up the area and
a 2.0 f-stop rounds out the basic specs
now what I have on screen is not a
direct comparison with the v10 from LG
but something to engage your heavy
reference point all photos have been
rotated ever so slightly to align with
each other but everything else like
color brightness etc are unedited that
didn't touch them overall I'm very
impressed and this is hands-down one of
the best performing cameras I've used
it's sharp its saturated very similar to
these Samsung Galaxy phones I've tested
and the camera works very fast the 6p
does a great job at differentiating and
managing white balance on this cloudy
day you can see the wooden table and the
nap and you can see all the details in
there and how well the NEX is preserved
what the scene looked like in person not
an easy task inserting the camera has to
bounce the cool white and gloomy day
from the outside from the windows here
with the warmer tones indoors looking at
the dishes the warm halogen bulbs in
store did cast a more yellow tint or
tone to the dinnerware yet in general
the Nexus was still be more accurate
performer on what this looked like in
person and then here one last daytime
photo although on a cloudy day the
details and richness are present but it
did notice some shots would be a little
too dark and having a slight increase in
brightness would have performed a little
bit better but overall look at the glass
in the walkway and on the buildings
there's simply glassy and crispy to look
at regarding low-light shocked this
performed like a beast here's some
moderate low light with light only
coming in from that one window here to
the left with the LG phone it's at ISO
level 50 very low but you see some blown
out highlights on forehead and note with
the Nexus this does a phenomenal job of
preserving shadow details retaining
sharpness and the ISO levels are
actually higher at 250 both images were
taken within five seconds of each other
so lighting wasn't changed that much or
at all and Lassen the worst letting that
I had here obviously noise is introduced
obviously not a clear
photo to print unto a Christmas card or
so but I'm still impressed there's not
much more noise that is this was at a
crazy high ISO of 2300 a challenge for
any regular camera not just smartphones
now regarding camera features smart
burst is new to the scene taking the
traditional burst mode in one step
further holding down your shutter button
will allow your phone to continuously
take snapping photos and the Nexus will
automatically review and choose what it
thinks the best 8 are you can see on the
bottom of the screen there selecting the
best 8 in real time that's a great
feature so you don't have to sift
through 20-plus photos or so and find
the best one yourself and surprisingly
it works very well and you can always
turn this feature off and have 40 plus
photos or so taken in one burst shot no
other features which are is pretty
standard here are photosphere to make it
3 like image of your room panorama shots
and last is lens blur which I thought
was totally cool allowing you to take
shots like this here pretty much
standard and then make it into this
giving it a much more blurry background
having a sensor image be your focal
point regarding video recording this can
record up to 4k at 30 frames per second
there is some stabilization implemented
but this thing needs true optical image
stabilization Nexus did it implement
this at all
shakiness was indeed abundant as you can
see in the video but despite this
nausea-inducing image the video quote in
regards to colors brightness sharpness
did very well and sorry if I didn't make
anyone dizzy here and lastly camera is
capable of doing up to 240 frames per
second at a max resolution of 720p there
the price of considering the Nexus phone
is somewhat in the budget price category
so enough about cameras and video let's
talk about the display we'll get into
the performance very shortly Nexus is
offering a high-density 5.7 inch screen
with a quad HD resolution featuring
AMOLED technology colors do pop in like
the photos it takes colors are saturated
enough to give some colorization to the
skin and make the overall experience for
the average consumer enjoyable for those
who are a bit more technical AMOLED does
provide very deep blacks but the whites
have just a slight yellow tint from my
personal experience and if I were to do
a red color test not sure how this might
look on camera here but in person the
Nexus does have a slight orange tone
and lasted over I noticed the nexus
screen was not as bright as say these
Samsung s6 edge+ or the v10 that I've
tested in the past but again if you're
not comparing phones side-by-side the
screen is still a pleasure to look at
moving on to performance out there are
some specs on the screen real quick for
you guys but under heavy use of apps and
multitasking this thing runs perfectly
fine with barely any lag or stutters
whatsoever the phone does heat up like
any other phone so nothing's really out
the norm and performance does remain
relatively the same this one's almost
flawless from opening the camera
transitioning to the photo viewer and
jumping into any other app here which I
found some phones would struggle with
swiping the main screen left and right
repeatedly this transitions with no
effects here even with tons of apps
being open and loaded running the latest
games this does warm up a bit here who
like most phones again but I didn't
notice anything out the Normand
everything is still running smooth and
I'm surprised that Nexus still performs
as well as it did
considering the 6p has three gigs of ram
versus four that some other flagships
aren't coming with but besides
performance this software side of things
are as important one of the biggest
benefits of buying an Nexus phone you do
receive any updates from Android first
while other manufacturers may
reluctantly wait months before updating
as of this video we're running Android
6.0 or basically android marshmallow and
some new features give some substantial
benefits first one up here is google and
tap offering additional information on
any screen when you hold down the home
button whether you're a text messaging
looking up a YouTube video Google will
try to find some kind of relevant
information if you're talking with a
friend let's say about Star Wars all
done that home button give it a few
seconds and you're presented with some
movie information and links to more news
images etc I found this works more so
for general enquiries with times it just
simply doesn't provide any useful
information at all an example looking at
Google Maps and finding your go-to place
I was hoping using on tap would read the
screen and pop up several cars with
places that it can identify and turn
providing a phone number or maybe what
time the store or restaurant opens and
closes however if you did do a normal
Google search and then used an tap then
the Google Maps will basically show you
more information now a useful feature
but I think at the time this video is
not
light upon feature just yet another new
addition that is highly anticipated is
called doze this comes standard with
Android 6.0 and works right away behind
the scenes without you needing to turn
anything on from here when your phone is
laying on a table screen off and you're
not moving it for example when you're
asleep
doze will put nearly everything to sleep
specifically apps you'll still get
notified when high priority apps needs
to alert you like phone calls or text
messages in turn this essentially saving
your battery life when your phone is not
in action doze is essentially a power
management tool that works in the
background with my personal tests and
granted I've had the phone for a little
over a month now so most of the apps I
personally use are on the phone instead
of a clean slate when I just brought it
home and I think which would be a more
accurate representation of what
consumers will face down the road now
right before sleeping I did record 94%
remaining at 12:55 a.m. I know I've been
working a little bit late recently the
following morning and as soon as I woke
up I recorded the video as proof at 7:35
a.m. battery has dropped by 10 to 84
percent in total and just leaving my
video playing here I'm showing evidence
or proof that literally all my apps
except for two here for some other
reason are tagged as battery optimized
enabling those to have the apps fall
asleep during times of not movement and
although reading a lot of praise for
those and many articles saying it really
works I was expecting a bit more better
savings from my own personal use and I
did you do drain much less when the
phone is new and has less apps but in my
defense with nearly every one of my
personal apps having gos enabled I would
have thought regardless what app I have
installed those would have been more
effective again this is just my
experience in my video as proof of
what's going on I do actually want this
to work and keep in mind my personal
screen on time still has been considered
as very good for a large screen high
resolution phone at three to five hours
or more at times better life is still
great in my opinion on the Nexus 6p so
over offer my experience for the average
consumer there are some shortcomings
which I would consider as minor and
they're only shortcomings because
they're trying to achieve something
greater it's not that the phone is buggy
or anything negative that is not working
but the parts that matter most like
build quality super responsive
performance in nearly every aspect both
physical and software and
at that price point it's crazy good
really makes the Nexus as a great
alternative for those who are already
owning Nexus phone or fans of Nexus
phones they will not be disappointed if
you decide to upgrade this is the best
nexus film to date so how this review
helped you in some way as always like
