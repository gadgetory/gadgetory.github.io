room now both just released their newest
Fitness earbuds meant to stay in your
ear during your workouts be sweating
weather-resistant and of course provide
exceptional sound the sound sports I
just purchased are priced at $149 as of
this video Canon the pricey side but
we'll see how these perform both an
audio and fitment to help you make a
decision so without further ado welcome
to another review
the Sun sports are a new line Bose is
carrying coming in colours of green
orange and what I have here is blue but
it looks more like turquoise or seafoam
blue to me though now a lot of earbud
inline controllers only work for iOS
devices but Bose was very nice enough to
offer two versions one working for Apple
devices and the other for Samsung Galaxy
devices and overall the build
construction is very good with strong
plastics being used however the
connecting wire outputs being reinforced
with a flexible silicon rubber does flex
a little bit too much for me really
questioning the longevity of device now
it may last long but only time will tell
now these are of course a wired
connection and does not feature lay-flat
tangle free cords and I feel like for
sport earbuds these are a must
considering I may throw these in my
pockets or gym bag and they do somewhat
tangle from time to time and as stated
earlier in the introduction stating that
these are somewhat pricey for around the
same price both give or take you can
purchase wireless Bluetooth sport
earbuds from the likes of Jabra Jay Berg
Beats and several other manufacturers
out there but again that's a matter of
preference and I know some people don't
like to recharge their devices every so
often to news and last what you receive
in the package is a soft carrying case
which works perfectly fine and stays
secure with the inside felt line and
although a small feature but I think any
carrying case should have this is a
pocket to hold any accessories the last
physical feature and going into my
comfort and fitment test they sound
sports do come with three silicone or
what feels to almost be like gel ear
tips now there are these softest and
most flexible I felt on any earbuds that
I've tested hopping with comfort while
wearing however they do attract
unsightly dust over time though so just
a word of caution there
and I usually wear small on most other
earbuds but surprisingly when trying on
medium I'll stay in my ear during
workouts and runs they didn't feel as
secure as I'd like but the large ear
tips work the best and gave me the most
confidence with jumping up and down to
your normal workouts - jogging these
earbuds really stayed on and never fell
out or become loose requiring
readjustment overall they're very light
and very soft where all while staying on
the ear but the key word is on ear now
these ear tips are the type to sit on
the outside of your ear not inside the
ear canal as some people prefer these
don't sit on the opening of the ear
canal either but the protruding piece
here you can say shoots sound outwards
into the ear canal because of this
design sound isolation is almost
non-existent
now while at the park filming I can hear
lawn maintenance mowing and trimming the
fields of grass in the background here
and while at Starbucks in the city I can
hear business professionals and patrons
in the background talking and also
baristas working furiously yelling drink
orders again in the background but now
going into the sound test these do very
well sound is very crisp and clean with
deep enough lows in the bass range to
make most genres of music much
appreciated but it's not so deep where
it interferes or distorts the mids and
highs the mid-range has crisp vocals
distinct instruments and the highs are
high enough without being ear ringing
now listening to these for three hours
straight never left my ears or my
hearing fatigue overall a very balanced
sound which I personally enjoyed and if
you happen to test these or have already
bought them if you press the ear tips or
ear buds closer into your ear you can
hear how well they perform even much
more better than that what they are
naturally now if only they were designed
to sit in your ear canal or at least on
the opening creating that seal you would
get that exceptional sound quality I
think now these do get pretty loud and
listening to these at 65 to 70% volume
was loud enough to hear the audio
quality while still being comfortable
and for those who do watch movies on
earbuds or headphones volume how to be
about 70 to 75 percent to hear quiet
scenes well and appreciate the sound
movies the sound separation and
soundstage like some earbuds is not
separated or open as much as out like
you can't distinguish left and right
audio channels as well as some may want
but I find this the case more often than
not with earbuds so overall these do
well in some areas but using different
design practices might have been better
suited in my opinion they still sound
good but again the ear tip design
although stays and the ear as well they
do hinder and sound isolation see if you
prefer an in the ear canal or on the ear
canal or over the ear canal like the
sound sport being reviewed right now I
wouldn't say these are bad but if you're
looking into Wired sport earbuds that
protects against sweat and other water
related issues still give these a try so
hope this review helped you in some way
