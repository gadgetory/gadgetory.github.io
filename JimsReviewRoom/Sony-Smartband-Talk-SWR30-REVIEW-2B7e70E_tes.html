review room now Sony takes a different
approach with their wearable technology
it's not as focused on the health
aspects so much
instead it's focused on literally
everything else Sony smart bands can see
how long you've been watching movies for
- playing games - how long you've been
at social media and it's fascinating to
see those who are really active with
their smartphones and how their day
breaks down in detail and I don't think
there's anything else like this on the
market currently well besides the affer
mention I'll go into detail shortly
about its features and see how
everything performs on this $169
smartband talk so without further ado I
welcome you guys to Jim's review room
going over the physical features first
- bands come in the box so size
shouldn't be an issue the silicon is
very smooth and slick to the fingers
even on the textured side now it's a
very nice feeling that's comfortable on
the wrist and the screen in the brain to
the smart band talk surprisingly isn't
bigger than wearing a normal standard
size watch then although the glass
profile does seem wide and after testing
it's comfortable and doesn't snag long
sleeve shirts when worn at the office
now with this texture there's slight
dust accumulation less than some other
textured bands that I've tried when worn
with long sleeves but this can be easily
washed off just something to be aware
about if this is something that you do
look into now as for the glass used
after my testing and wearing this
through my daily routine and sadly found
the glass scratched now I haven't done
anything out the ordinary through an
office work but it's sad to see maybe a
slight bump or brush against a table may
have caused this now overall it's still
a very lightweight still a quality band
despite the glass being a little bit
more sensitive compared to other
competitors there rotating to the right
here and looking at the physical buttons
the longest button is for adjusting the
volume up and down and below is the
action or Menu button now rotating to
the underside there's a built-in
microphone with two speakers on either
side and as the name proceeds the
smartband talk is able to take phone
calls now more on that test and my
impressions shortly and last is the
microUSB port for charging which is a
huge welcome considering most other
activity bands have their
proprietary connections any micro USB
wire you have laying around the house
would just do now as for the battery
life this is something where it falls
short the battery life is claimed to be
three days and with my testing it truly
did last three days and possibly a few
hours before it completely died now
either way compared to other bands it's
quite low considering the average is
four to five days of life on the other
manufacturers now moving on to this
screen display in its on-screen menu the
band uses this technology called e ink
it's technology that you've seen a lot
on the classic e-readers like the Amazon
Kindle paperwhite now the text shown
on-screen would resemble what text would
look like on paper and with people
claiming it's easier on the eyes now for
a small screen like this and the brief
moment that you actually do look at it I
don't think it would matter too much but
the technology behind it sounds really
cool when doing some research but going
into its menu it's really
straightforward with the main screen
showing the time in a dhow below that
indicating your total progress in
regards to steps or running for that day
and now pressing the menu button opens
the following screen revealing your
total steps
how many minutes you've spent walking in
how much running and basically from the
factory events about it and records do
all the menu features but what's unique
is on the smartband app you can download
more apps than use and it downloaded
right into the band itself here I have
the weather showing right on my wrist
with the next menu option being able to
control my music and currently on your
screen are all the apps that are
available through the smart band app for
download now it's not much but there are
some useful ones on there now as stated
earlier you can take incoming phone
calls with this band which is quite
unique and a new experience the phone
number is displayed along with any
notifications from your phone like text
messages Facebook notifications or
tweets from Twitter but keep in mind any
messages are only shown briefly and you
can't scroll through them and read the
entire message and Sony does disclose
that in its instruction manual or music
guide and besides not being able to
scroll and read the entire message once
the band goes back to the main screen
you can't go back and look at previously
read messages but regarding answering
phone calls on your wrist here at first
I was a bit hesitant but after playing
around with this feature it's useful
actually for those really quick and
brief moments
now Sony states in its instructions to
hold this approximately 20 centimeters
from your mouth or close to eight inches
here and speak naturally and during my
testing I can hear the person on the
other end clearly through the two small
speakers right on my wrist and they can
hear me clearly as well now testing with
this someone said my voice did not sound
like I was on a speakerphone which is a
plus but just a very minor echo was
noticed but she said that it's actually
quite impressive for something that's
coming off of my wrist here now I know
this area will be subjective but it is
an option or an intern ative to whipping
out your phone that's stuck in your
pocket when driving let's say or when
your other hand is occupied in holding
something the band during these moments
seems the most convenient for me and
actually came in handy again it's
subjective on how useful this option may
be but nonetheless it is still an option
and before going deep into the app here
the screen is very much viewable in
bright sunlight which is great it's one
of the perks of having that e-ink
display and also in dim light settings
you can actually still see the band for
quite well from my experience the only
time that you can't see it is of course
in pitch black there's no Beth light
that you can turn on now last year when
switching in between screens you'll see
a faded image in the background which
persona is perfectly normal and just
part of this technology the white screen
displays much less but the black screen
does give the ghosting effect again this
is normal
per Sony and the last feature here is
smart alarms you can set your band to
provide a pretty strong vibration from
what I experienced or have a audible
alarm go off as well on your wrist to
wake you up in the mornings you can
break it down to only certain days for
the alarm to go off but what's more
unique within 30 minutes of your
absolute latest time of getting up here
if the band can detect you recently
entered into light sleep the band will
then wake you up that way you feel less
groggy and agitated versus waking up
from deep sleep now it's only a
30-minute window in which you can adjust
to 60 if you'd like but having this
feature is of course quite unique but
I'll be honest the band has always woken
me up at the latest hours as I'm sure
I'm always in the deepest sleep prior to
waking up again that's just me now the
previous menu here and a petticoat you
earlier in this video was the sony
smartband talk app
now Sony also has another app here that
you should download that works with
their smart bands in general called life
log and this is where it gets really
interesting this app will record almost
everything that you do on your smart
phone or device that you have it paired
to but with your smart band of course
the smart man would supplement data to
this app such as walking running and be
sleep quality now getting into the app
it's a one-stop shop for all of your
information the very top here is a
graphical timeline that shows your
actions throughout your day and its
activity and more on that shortly now
below is a very simple interface with
tiles that updates periodically with
your life bookmarks calories burned
steps taken for the day how much time
you've spent walking versus running how
much sleep you've had time you spent on
social media like Facebook or Twitter in
the second row here shows how many
photos you've taken for the day and the
photos itself once you click it next how
much time you spent listening to music
movies playing games reading a book and
the very last icon here I have is time
spent on the Internet and each category
can be clicked on and expanded for
further information here calories break
down your day to show where your most
active and the bar chart separates your
passive calories burned versus calories
burned when you're exercising you can
set up a goal to to try to achieve your
efforts in the top right and you have
the ability to compare your previous
days weeks and months worth of
performance now backing out here is the
same exact concept for steps taken
walking and running times with a bar
graph as well with goal-setting changes
and different time periods to view but
what is also very well done I believe is
the sleep mode the sleep mode is good to
determine if you're getting a good
night's rest the band just senses any
movements you have during your sleep and
associates that with either light sleep
deep sleep you can distinguish when you
get up and walk around and this feature
is just another tool to help you in
becoming more self-aware of your own
habits now going into the communication
and social media tile the life log app
breaks down which apps you are
specifically on and how much time was
devoted to each this is again the same
for the other tiles like music videos
gaming books and internet surfing the
only real different tile here is your
photos as stated earlier once you click
it you can see what photos you have
taken for that day and once you click on
a photo
it brings you to your built-in photo
viewer on your tablet or smartphone and
as stated earlier you have your visual
timeline above where you simply press
play on the top right corner here and
this will scroll through your day seeing
all the icons where you were active in
the activities performed and while this
is moving your metrics or numbers below
populates as well and with each icon in
the timeline you can tap this and as we
review what you had done at that very
time so that's it for these sony
smartband talk I hope this video helped
you in some way now if you do like my
work be sure to add me Jim's Rovira on
either Facebook Twitter or Google+ to
get updates for me and updates and items
I'm testing before I put them on the
website so this is Jimmy with Jim's
review room you guys take care and I'll
see you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
