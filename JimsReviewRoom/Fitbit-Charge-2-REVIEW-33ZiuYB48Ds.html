Jimmy with Jim's review room jumping
right into this Fitbit is introducing
the charge to to replace the most
popular fitness tracker based on market
sales that's their own Fitbit charge HR
there's some pretty big improvements in
my opinion especially the options to
swap out your wristbands but we'll
discuss all that pretty soon I
personally paid 150 dollars retail at
the time this video but I include my
links in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time you
never know when the prices might go down
so without further ado my channel is
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to jim's
review
going over the physical features first
some things to point out right away
there's now a new metal / plastic
housing to hold all your electronics in
there but sadly though it's still only
splash rain and sweat proof Fitbit
clearly discloses on the website this is
still not shower proof and for swimmers
again you're out of luck now the band
itself is nearly identical so those who
are familiar with the Fitbit charge HR
comfort wise it feels practically the
same same stretchiness or elasticity the
same secure locking mechanism and is
practically the same size if there is
any different than measurements it's
very minimal now what is truly different
though just like the Fitbit Alta and the
Fitbit blaze the bands are exchangeable
without the need of a special tool the
previous charge HR was plagued with
those defective bands coming apart or
bubbling from the adhesives failing that
seems to be gone with this particular
model the only issue that I've noticed
it's not a deal breaker but there is
some slight chatter that I noticed here
and oddly the longer band tends to miss
a line from the display again not a big
deal but something that I noticed on my
particular unit now rotating to the back
there's your heart rate sensor which
I'll show you how accurate this is later
in the video but there's also of course
you're charging pins now better life is
claimed to be up to five days just like
the previous model and from my testing
which included six separate runs at a
mile each to give you somewhat of a
comparison to how much you personally
run on it in any given week here but I
was able to get six days and four hours
worth of battery life now keep in mind
this is of course with the HR sensor on
using the GPS off of the phone and
receiving notifications not the actual
results I've gotten so far has been good
considering there's a bigger screen and
more features but compared to all other
mid-range trackers on the markets 5 to 7
days is usually the average or the norm
now recharging the band from dead takes
close to 2 hours in total from my
experience
moving on to the display it's larger
it's very fluid and offers much more
data to view the same arm gesture still
there so moving your arm up as you're
looking at a watch the screen does
automatically turn on and this function
as well as other good performing
displays on the market now in bright
sunlight it's still somewhat visible you
can still make it out but isn't that
super bright though and there's seven
total different displays here that you
can choose from through the Fitbit app
you can choose either and analog display
huge numbers or having two o'clock with
a date nearby but we still don't have
third-party apps our third-party
displays so hopefully Fitbit down the
road would continue to offer new watch
faces with their updates now going back
to the main and factory display you have
your time and date above tapping on the
lower half scrolls through your info and
element it's easier to do it on here
which is those hard taps they had to do
on the Fitbit Alta albeit firm but
somewhat accurate taps are still
required it's not too forgiving that is
now what is shown here their steps taken
heartrate estimated distance estimated
calories burned flights of stairs
climbed how many minutes you have been
active and last your hourly activity now
there's sadly no swiping gestures to
make things easier here you do have to
utilize the side button which I admit is
very tactile a lot of good feedback here
but out of display there's your
heartrate the next one is allowing you
to choose which exercise you want to do
and have recorded I'll have the
exercises on your screen at the moment a
stopwatch is offered however there's no
lap times to record it simply pause and
start and once the watch starts if you
don't move your arm or if there's no
action the display does turn off to
conserve battery so after the stopwatch
there's a new guided breathing feature
which shows unscrewed when to inhale and
exhale and helps provide mediation or
relaxation here it's pretty
straightforward and as gimmicky as it
sounds it's really a brief and simple
process that I felt does work if you do
apply it or give it a chance that this
feature is clearly subjective and very
less there's silent vibrating alarms
offered which can be adjusted within the
Fitbit app graciously you can set up
multiple alarms in one day and select
any combination of days within
now I asked for the vibrations and
having experience with the competitors
in the markets I would say the vibration
is moderate or medium it might work for
some heavy sleepers but I think most
heavy sleepers will have to look
elsewhere now on the indicators which
would have helped greatly would be
simply a battery indicator and that's
not on here as it's only viewable the
app after your band sinks so right
before showing you my heart rate test
and the charts the charge - does offer
reminders for you to get up and move
around a bit if you have been inactive
for an hour now the Fitbit can also auto
recognize certain exercises if you
perform a recognize movement for 15
minutes straight and that's adjustable
in the app Fitbit will record your steps
calories burned and estimated distance
then save that activity into the app as
an exercise or active session now it's
perfect for moments you're maybe playing
with your kid or if you're walking in
the mall for a while here the band
records those activities when you're not
really thinking about it or may have
forgotten to manually start a walking
workout now the other feature that I
absolutely desire on every general
consumer activity tracker these days
here are notifications now with the
Fitbit this is seriously a welcome
feature as phone calls and contacts will
vibrate and display in your band here
now the only flaw that I believe for
text messages you have to flip your hand
up into the watch position to see the
message however with those text messages
I noticed it's purely a summary in only
40 characters out of 160 are displayed
so unfortunately you're not able to read
the entire message or scroll through the
message itself in addition if the screen
turns off while reading or if you press
the button the message disappears
forever if one of you must have
notifications you might consider the
Fitbit plays it might be a better option
another last feature there's now GPS but
before you get too excited it's not
built in the band relies on you to bring
your phone and use your cell phone
signal to get your location-based
measurements now despite not being built
in a huge benefit though we get
real-time stats on the band like pace
and much much more accurate distance
being shown so to the point that you've
been waiting
for here how does the HR data look
risk-based trackers most of them that
I've tested so far there's always some
variability with the charge - I ran
against one of my chest straps which has
been tried and true very accurate and
with my first graph a smooth and
consistent run my experience it was
great for the most part the charge - was
very accurate and then performing
another run about 1/3 of the way through
I'm pretty sure I had adjusted the chest
strap so the hunt looked a little bit
funky there but the Fitbit charge
surprisingly did very well afterwards
the only thing I really noticed on a
consistent basis was at the beginning of
any run the band and a chest straps
would be off by a good bit but after a
minute or so their readings came in much
more within tolerance and then last year
a third chart as proof towards the end
here there were times I had just stopped
running to look down at the band and you
can see the heart rate dropping here and
then I would then pick up and continue
running now in the end there is still
some variability amongst all these
charts here but amazingly for a risk
based heart rate tracker it's pretty
accurate and it does perform well so in
the end here comparing to the old model
the charge HR this is seriously a huge
upgrade though with better wrist bands
we don't have to worry about those
defective bands anymore that's hoping
the display is bigger the extra feature
of notifications is a huge plus or
despite only being a summary but that's
better than nothing a guest and last GPS
as an option through your phone for more
accurate data and if you're ok with that
there's no increase in price Fitbit is
still offering that sweet spot of a
hundred and fifty dollars so in the end
here it's not perfect not revolutionary
but the upgrades the evolution is very
much welcomed making the charge HR to a
very much worthwhile purchase over the
original charge HR but one of the best
mid-range activity trackers on the
market as well so that's it for this
review hopefully this wasn't too long
here but enough detail to help you make
