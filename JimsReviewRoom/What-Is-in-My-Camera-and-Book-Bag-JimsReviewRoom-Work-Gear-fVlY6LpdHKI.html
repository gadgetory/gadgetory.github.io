room welcome back to another video for
the first time on my channel I'm showing
you guys what is in my tech bag but it's
a little bit over unique situation
actually carry two bags with me whenever
I go out into the field when I work
remotely and I'll explain why you think
it's more convenient when carrying two
bags maybe not but for me it just works
one bag is for my casual workflow of
practices and the other bag is basically
my camera equipment and all of its
accessories and I'll show you guys both
eventually here now keep in mind some of
these items they are some professional
equipment they're kind of expensive and
then what I'm proud of our items that
are very budget-friendly just get them
off of Amazon and they have been tried
and trued they work perfectly fine for
me and none of these items were
sponsored these are items I personally
use out in the field and basically put
them through hell if you guys have been
watching me for some time you guys see
me you know out in the woods trekking
through that perfect spot for filming
but anyways guys we'll get started here
and hope you guys enjoy this write down
a comment below what you guys think by
the end of this video I get up Jimmy
with Jim's review room we'll get started
all right first item I want to show you
guys is this Swiss skier book bag that I
have here it's about three years old but
what I want to say is Swiss care makes
them very very very good stuff I've
always felt like it's really lightweight
but at the same time it's rugged enough
from my experience one things that allow
people take for granted sometimes these
other nantes a cheaper bags even the
more expensive bags sometimes they just
get caught in the fabric right here but
this one Swiss in general makes these
very very refined fluid moving his
zipper is here and I know it's something
so small but I'm telling you guys it
makes a world of difference when you're
on the field and you just need to open
and close your bag repeatedly out in the
dirt out on the rain whatever it may be
it doesn't get stuck love it so one of
the first times I have here is the Sony
rx100 mark 4 this is the latest model
from Sony for 2016 this is if you guys
been following me my newest vlogging
camera headed for about maybe two or
three months or so since March and
starting to show some signs a little bit
scratches here but I love this thing
articulating screen you can see yourself
here recording 4k if you're into that
has slow motion and this has NFC Near
Field Communication and just tap your
phone on here the pictures will beam
onto your phone and then from there I
edit it and then I upload it to my
Instagram Facebook or Twitter regarding
these legs here
it's a Joby Gorillapod the model is
called focus
beautiful beautiful articulating leg
tripod here but what a lot of people use
this for is if you have a tree tree
branch or a lamppost or so wrap this bad
boy around Casey nice that uses the same
particular model and he mounts a crop
sensor bigger canon DSLR on top appears
well I'm just using this Sony camera
here but let me mount this and then what
you guys have a different camera angle
all right so let's go back to the bag
here next is my samsung series 5 laptop
ahem this for quite a while some battle
scars already here really basic just use
it for writing narratives research web
surfing next item here this is a huge
awesome item here Logitech m70 5 where
sometimes I think it's they call it the
logitech marathon mouse this thing works
like a beast had it for about three
years still works perfectly fine it's a
mid-sized Mouse so it's a little bit
smaller than my hand here but it's not
too small not too big but one of the
best things you can have here one of the
best features and uses double-a
batteries but the battery life is up to
three years it's crazy and the price is
ridiculously cheap as well again I'll
put the links in the good description
below that way you guys can check prices
down there next item is the snow here
rij earphones the t20 models if I am
using this to watch movies or basically
just need some entertainment from my
cell phone these are over ears and these
work perfectly fine I love these things
are h87
or rj t 20s next up is if I'm ever
testing headphones earphones I'm using
this file I believe that's how you
pronounce it put it right here for you
guys
file e 18 is the particular model it's a
back and am at the same time also and
you guys will notice eventually in my
bag I don't have a power bank I
basically use this this can charge your
phone or device if you need to but again
what a DAC is for those who don't know
it basically helps drives your
headphones or earphones and hopefully it
doesn't happen every time but on some
headphones or earphones it just produces
a cleaner sound a more fidelity sometime
it's worth it sometimes more headphones
or earphones are more subjective or more
sensitive to the data DAC when you do
purchase that so anyways that's that and
I think that's about it let me see if
there's anything else in here on in the
power cord of course so nothing special
there next section just basically a
notebook that I use to write notes I
keep most my notes on my phone but if
you ever need pen and paper there it
goes
last section I use this here is a
basically a travel multi USB charging
hub this is from I clever very cheap
here
you got this off of Amazon and it has
four ports as you can see there and the
reason why I have this I also have an
anchor one at home but the anchor one is
a fixed wire this connects right into
the wall when I go to Starbucks want to
go to the library so and I can charge my
phone I can charge the Sony rx100 and at
the same time and any other devices that
need to Bluetooth earphones whatever it
may be
this comes in very much handy instead of
using the two outlets or so at the cafe
or sometimes there's even you know
limited amount of outlets all you have
is just one again this comes in very
much hanging again from I clever really
cheap get that check out the video
description and sometimes I can use this
back for personal stuff too when I go
out running or jogging I have my sport
earphones in here of course I can't use
the RO J's because they're not sweat or
water resistant these are from Jabra
these things are very very comfortable I
believe it's the sports coach model and
again very very good sound for the price
very comfortable they stay in my ear
love these things the price isn't too
bad again Jarboe Sport I believe it's
the coach model again check out the
video description but I've been also
using the j-bird freedoms that I
recently got as well and these have very
light weight they've stay on when I
would do wear them behind my head I've
been using them a little bit more just
to ensure that it does stay in my head I
have had them sometimes fall out a
little bit I didn't mention that in the
review so I'm giving them a chance these
are much more expensive these were a
little bit more reasonably priced at
choppers that is okay let's see what
else is in here pen papers I got a USB
3.0 high-speed USB stick 64 gigs here
just to transfer files if I need to and
another USB cable
well that's here I basically converted a
microSD card converted to a full size I
need a stick stick that into the laptop
and more paper more pens and this here
is the tracker
Bravo they did send me this to review
summer months ago and I can't get it out
here give me a second there goes the
tracker Bravo and just in case if I ever
lose my bag or if they ever get stolen
so they I deal with this is I'm able to
find my bag my phone on my smartphone
through basically GPS and Bluetooth I
did test it I believe because there's
not so many people with this particular
brand just yet so it's hard for someone
else it relies on other people's cell
phones and other people with tracker
accounts to basically find your bag and
if they don't have account if you're not
in a major metropolitan area it makes it
a little bit difficult I've been
thinking I was switching over to tile to
see how it goes but again it's a little
bit more newer technologies some people
or know people consumers are slowly
getting on that so alright off to the
next bag here I'm sorry for going so
quick but because I have two bags it's
just a lot of information so there goes
part two alright folks looking into my
camera bag right here this is from
vivitar actually bought this off my
amazon it's nothing really special this
is one of the cheapo bags that I bought
when it first started but like I said
always on my channel
you don't need great exceptional
expensive stuff to get started this bag
has worked perfectly fine I believe is
anywhere from like 25 maybe 35 dollars
or so but going real quick here and just
going without those zippers again it's
reiterating this has caught before I
think it was this zipper along here
we're just caught along the fabric you
can see you know when me opening it it
is pretty smooth but comparing to that
Swiss bank earlier the Swiss bank was
was more fluent in general but what I
have in here just really basic stuff a
mini HDMI to full HDMI converter just in
case Stephanie to connect my DSLR to the
big screen and I do saw is in here I am
using the Sony rx100 so of course
there's a difference in camera and
probably the microphone might be a
little bit different as well
again micro SD adapter to a full size
micro SD card
to ever transfer stuff on my phone to
the laptop noise hush the NX 80s I've
reviewed this I personally bought this
several years ago two three years ago
and this is my work earphones basically
I don't care if I lose these break
whatever it was like 11 bucks or so I'll
put the link in the description below
you guys need to find it and these work
perfectly fine they've been really
rugged no audio problems and again it's
nothing not oh quality is still good
obviously they don't sound like the RH
A's but all I just need this is just a
monitor my audio just make sure my voice
isn't blown out or too low
whenever I record video so again noise
hush and x80 is right there Nikon
battery charger really simple really
basic USB cable some wind screens for my
lav mic that I'm wearing and this is a
USB 3.0 cable that I use to connect my
DSLR to my computer using again USB 3.0
which is really really fast there I like
that and oh every bag needs one of these
this is kind of old here so it's a
little bit rusted but the screwdriver
set just in case you ever need to adjust
your tripod in case you need to you know
mount your cameras change mounts video
heads whatever it may be I can't see
here I think that's about it here just
these random clips here this is a little
remote control that I've been using I'm
an old Nikon that is but this also works
with Canon cameras as well you just
basically point this at the camera press
this and it will take the photo for you
you don't need to use the timer on the
camera run back to the camera in a
certain amount of time that's about here
in another pen of course and that's it
for the accessory compartment and now
through the bread and butter right here
this is a cam bag so on the side most
camera bags have this is a quick slot to
basically pull out your DSLR you can
yank us out right now and basically have
access to it and instead of opening the
main compartment with all of your
accessories available oh let me just
leave this open here let me show you
guys front compartment opens up and
again camera here I just basically slide
it out and what I'm rocking for those
and we have guys always asking me it
Nikon d810 and then I'm using a Tamron
2470 and this is just basically what I
use this is the quality you guys see
again except for this this is the
exception we're using these Sony rx100
but what's really special about this
camera and this is why I chose it at
that time and it's only about a year old
or so a little bit more than a year low
light performance I try to be different
on this channel I try to do the dark
table the grey walls the dark lighting
whatever it may be this handles low
light like a beast and then the Tamron
2470 ultra sharp lens but the reason why
I got this lens it complements this
camera both are weather sealed if you
guys been watching me I have filmed in
the rain I have filmed you know around
water features and this is getting
drenched no problems again it's weather
shield does sealed nothing can penetrate
this it's amazing I don't wanna say
nothing I want to put that disclaimer
out there but again really really rugged
the only downfall it's heavy as hell
this thing is built like a freaking tank
and it does make for mobility a little
bit harder that's why I try to travel
with the least amount of stuff and
that's why I don't have headphones as
much as I love headphones that's why you
don't see headphones in here that's why
I do carry the RH s
T 20s in the other bag for that
entertainment value
the headphones are just too big for all
the stuff that I carry box I believe
that's how you pronounce this RP
pronounced incorrectly here laser
distance take measure I guess you can
say point this to the wall shoots out a
laser just like so
and you press it and it spits out a
measurement and it's very precise I was
using this back in a day when I used to
be a catastrophe or claims adjuster for
insurance companies we used to measure
walls whatever it may be but I use this
to now measure the distance of Bluetooth
signals and see where they blew through
the signal would cut off I just walk a
certain distance want to cut off shoot
that laser one time it gives me about
this certain amount of linear feet next
up is the roadie mic Pro of basically a
youtube youtubers standard microphone
with a very subtle windscreen here I
need a dead cat on here but it does this
justice mounts right onto the d810
some audio cables for video monitoring a
wind muff for my lav mic that I'm
wearing right now hopefully the audio is
not too bad and then there's another
windscreen or wooden muff in here for
other accessories that I may have and
that is literally its again rugged back
there's some other compartments here
that you can mount nothing too special
sometime I mount the tripod on here and
have it melt all the way down here that
like I said it's been holding up very
well in that tripod with the video head
is not light at all and they said that
the threads have been holding like I
said it's a rugged bookbag again this is
vivitar I'll put all the models if
they're still available in the video
description below that way you guys can
click on it and get more information if
you guys need it a lot of these things
are tried-and-true I kept them for this
long and they work perfectly fine and
really happy with it
I'm always want to try new stuff but
again this is my bread and butter for
now and that's about it
