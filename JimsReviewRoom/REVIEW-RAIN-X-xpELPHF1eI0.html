review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at rain-x and just letting
you know i'm not sponsored
nor have rain-x for myself contacted
each other I personally use this product
ever since I found out about it while I
was working part time at a detail shop
up north and that's about 2000 or 2001
so over a decade of using this stuff
personally I'm some in simplest form
what does rain-x do it basically repels
water on a micro-level glass is actually
porous so even if you have a new car or
an older one when it rains water
somewhat sits on your glass then I'm
certain you've seen this before
especially with your rear window if not
pay attention next time it really makes
it hard to see when it rains so in this
review we'll see how easy it is to apply
its performance
AMD pros and cons I've personally
encountered I purchase rain-x from
Walmart for about 4 dollars and their so
they were almost everywhere from gas
stations to your local convenience
stores and before you get started make
sure you wash your car or at least clean
the windows very well now applying
rain-x the right way is very important
for having your results last apply
rain-x with a clean sponge or a towel
and ensure you're going in small
circular motions that I'm doing here now
that it dries it will leave a slight
film on the windshield and that's fine
for now now you do have to give it
several minutes for it to dry to haze up
and typically by the time you're done
with the entire windshield you can go
back and apply a second coat now if this
is your first time applying right next
to the windows definitely do two coats
though if you're following up from my
experience one coat is actually fine
after the second coat dries come back
with a clean towel and buff it out it's
not hard to do and this is easier to
take off than waxing your car as an
option you can have a spray bottle with
plain water and miss the windshield then
buff it away and
practically it now be sure to do the
side and especially the rear windshield
as well so now you have windows that
beads off water as you can see the
treated versus the untreated side shows
a distinct difference it works even
better in larger rainstorms and from my
experience a new application on the
windows and at about 40 miles per hour
once you get the speed water then start
speeding off all by itself
now rightness claims it will last up to
three months from lying usage and
depending on how often you use your
windshield wipers typically the front
windshield lasts for about a month for
me personally now I wish lasted a bit
longer too as well but where I see
rain-x being worth it though is on the
side and especially those roof of that
rear window I'm assuming because there's
no rubbing or abrasion from the lack of
a windshield wiper it doesn't wear off
as fast in those areas
now other pros I should mention it house
with keeping the glass clean because
majority of the water beads off you'll
have less water spots after going
through a rainstorm or after your car
wash it tremendously helps with washing
the car in the future and if you're also
into automotive detailing and keeping
your car looking nice rain-x helped me
personally in that area by keeping the
glass looking slick and smooth the only
negative I can think about is again it's
only on that front windshield it only
lasts for about a month again it's me
personally but besides that it does take
a little bit of time just putting on but
again I still think it's worth it though
and the only other negative the bottle
sets don't apply this to plastic so no
acrylic windows or headlights other than
that if you apply it correctly you'll
see the results and for less than five
dollars it's not too bad just to give it
a try and that's it for my review and
hopefully this review did a better job
illustrating the product than me just
explaining it there I hope this review
helped you in some way or at least
answer your curiosity of what rain-x is
