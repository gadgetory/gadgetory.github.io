review by Jim's review room now
walkthrough Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond the other
day and I found one of these lint
lizards which I thought was really handy
it's an extension you connect to your
vacuum to remove lint and dust deposits
that you normally can't get to with your
standard vacuum attachments now priced
at only $11 I'd said hey why not now
Amazon actually has a cheaper though for
seven dollars before shipping at the
time of this review now every dryer in
every household over time accumulates
lint and dust buildup which in turns
restricts airflow and reduces your
dryers efficiency now rare in worst case
scenarios severe bill that may
eventually cause a fire in your dryer
exhaust vent again it's rare but it
could happen though but my main focus
here is maintenance and to keep my
energy-efficient dryer keep on being
efficient so without further ado I'll
show you my experience and results the
lint lizard claims their attachment
can't connect to any vacuum and it's
connected to my generic vacuum perfectly
fine there's also an end nozzle that
connects to the clear PVC hose which
extends 30 inches into your dryer not
acclaimed 43 inches on the box is with
the attachment connected it's a simple
design and the simple concept altogether
now putting everything together did take
less than a minute and everything fitted
properly and securely though the dryer
you see here was purchased new about
four years ago and had never once been
vacuumed the dryer has been used minimum
twice a week with three nooses being the
average among myself in my fiance now
hopefully that can give you a gauge
actually on where you might stand with
your dryer and it's lint buildup as you
can see in the video there's already a
decent amount of lint at least in its
opening where the lint trap is located
and trust me I've tried removing that
lint before with my bare hands and
chopsticks and it just doesn't work all
together I also cleaned and cleared my
vacuum to show how much dust and dirt
this may collect during my test as you
can see as soon as I slid in the tube it
did catch some lint right off the bat I
tried sliding in as far as I could and
soon ran into the end now forcing my way
in didn't help any further assuming
there was more than likely a 90 degree
turn I still continued moving the hose
around and periodically I would see some
lint get sucked through now although it
was somewhat tight to move the hose
around the lint lizard did get into
here's where no other tools have gone
before the one-inch diameter hose is
very sturdy though but being so made the
hose not as flexible as you'd like to
handle the entire process that had taken
about five minutes and majority of the
biglan had been removed there were still
some remnants but without actually
wiping it away it's gonna be there
regardless nonetheless a much
improvement compared to what it was
before and the results from the canister
as you can see here what lint was
actually caught again that's four years
of news now if you have a larger family
and or do more loads than I do just
imagine what you might find in yours the
tool worked and as you've seen did
collect most of the lens it's a simple
design in the price again it's only
eleven dollars although this tool can
fit on all vacuums the suction of the
vacuum will dictate how much lint can
actually be removed so be sure you have
a decent working back and for use the
last pound is because of the hose you
are working in a tight space so
maneuverability is at times difficult
the hose might not be able to fit into
your dryer but compared to the crevice
tool supplied by most vacuums the lint
lizard is possibly your best option for
the time being and in all fairness and
evident in this video the lint lizard
did do its job and soft lint so overall
for only $11 nothing it's worth it
to use as maintenance around the house
although you won't be using this tool
often but bring it to your mother's
house or some other relative or friend's
house to get its news so I hope you
