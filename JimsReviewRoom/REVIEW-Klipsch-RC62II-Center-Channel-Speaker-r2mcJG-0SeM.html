review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the Eclipse RC 62 - Center
speaker we'll look at the speaker's
construction style specifications and
features and lastly my pros and cons on
its performance and usage and be sure to
check out my other videos I do have the
floorstanding RF 82 twos and also the
subwoofer as well I believe is the SW
one 30s now let's get started on this
one here I purchased this Center speaker
from acoustic sound design comm and I
purchased it about a year ago
the exterior does come in cherry wood
grain and also black ash which what you
see here the dimensions are 23 point 5
inches wide it is twelve point eight
eight inches deep and the height is
eight inches high and I do have to admit
is part one the biggest sensor channels
ever seen it does require its own little
table and as you can see I have it
sitting on a box for the time being and
please be advised this is only
temporarily now the center channel does
feature if tracked X horn technology
which is featured on their reference
line series and it's basically a speaker
with a foghorn style kind of think of it
as when you're shouting you put your
hands at both sides of your mouth and in
turn it does create more clarity and
increase in sound by using less power as
well so it is proprietary to clips and
also the reference series speakers and a
speaker does feature a dual six and a
half inch ceramic metallic cone woofers
in the same color as the other reference
speakers as well which is copper alright
so I'll start with the pros and cons I
do have to admit that the RC 62 to
Center speaker does complement the
floor-standing speakers that I have the
RF 82 twos by providing just crisp and
clear sense of channel audio and with
the center channel you can hear vocals
and music that just much much more
clearer and better you hear the voices
in
the actors and movies much of the highs
are definitely pronounced and again like
I said this clarity is just what I want
to emphasize now originally I just had
the floor standing speakers only and
they were good enough already I mean the
clear audio as well but once you
accompanied the floor standing speakers
with this center channel it just gives
you another level of immersion into any
movie into any music that you're
listening to this is I have to admit a
must have besides that the the look and
finish is exceptional with the floor
standing speakers it's the same wood
finish in black ash very modern look you
can have the grilles down or remove the
grille for you know better aesthetics
either way it looks phenomenal it looks
high-end it looks modern I can't see
nothing but good things about the
aesthetics as for the connections it's
very simple it does take banana plugs if
you like which I have in the video it
just basically plug and play a positive
a negative red and black wires that's
for any negatives I'll be honest I don't
foresee any negatives it does what it's
supposed to do but exceeds your
expectations and I'm coming from a
standpoint where it used to have a home
theater box seven $800 you buy the
entire package from Best Buy or I guess
one Circuit City used to exist at
Walmart etc and this far exceeds the
expectation once you plug it in you'll
be amazed at how clear this thing can
just produce sound so in general I'll be
honest I don't foresee anything as a con
it is I guess it is somewhat of a big
size however I mean I guess it needs to
be the size to give you this type of
audio performance so all in all it's
worth a buy it's worth every penny
that's it for my review here I hope you
enjoyed it please check out my other
reviews as I featured the floor-standing
speakers and as I mentioned earlier and
also the subwoofer which I did purchase
afterwards as well so if you have not
please take your time to like in or

alerts on new products and this is Jimmy
