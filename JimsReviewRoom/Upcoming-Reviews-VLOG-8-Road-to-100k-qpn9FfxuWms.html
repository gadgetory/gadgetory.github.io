another vlog road to 100,000 subscribers
for Jim's review room a bunch of you
guys are new welcome old school guys
supporters welcome back the number today
is should be on your screen right here
but I think I checked it this morning
about around eighty six thousand
subscribers now so then it's just
mind-blowing crazy but more more
exciting news I guess well at least for
me I just don't on me before I got here
about a week ago October 12th or 14th
was actually my two year anniversary of
doing YouTube full time I two years ago
I was working you know like i said in my
other vlogs corporate america and i had
on youtube that is maybe nine videos and
maybe I 300 subscribers or so but uh
look at look at where it is today look
at the the products you know look at the
video quality look at all the stuff that
has grown to what it is today and it's
crazy just two years just blew by just
like that and more importantly of course
again this vlog this entire vlog was
taking my current subscribers anyone who
has been finally obviously no one's
looking at my vlogs but it's just my
subscribers it's a video for you guys to
follow you know along with me to my
journey 200,000 subscribers and just
look at where you guys are at right now
81 86,000 subs eighty-six thousand
followers that is phenomenal that is
crazy to imagine how many people
actually you know like the the videos
that produce and find value behind it so
right off the bat you start off this
video thank you thank you thank you you
guys are really just giving me an
opportunity that I couldn't I couldn't
find anywhere else to be honest with you
and I don't know it's very humbling
thank you once again but really good
stuff today in this vlog here right now
recording on the note for real quick
right off the bat I got the LG v10 that
I reviewed what last week or so let me
put on the
camera here to see if there is a
difference in the quality here so here
goes all right is there any difference
hopefully it looks good I noticed that
the video is not as wide as the as a
samsung note for that I got here Oh
update the note 4 was running really
laggy and now it is a little bit better
after freaking three days with the
Samsung support the best device that
they told me to do was delete apps one
by one and then see if it improves the
phone speed or reduces the lag by any
chance I just deleted a bunch of i'll be
on me three apps never in a bunch it's
three random apps that i know i don't
use anymore and it runs a little bit
better not a hundred percent but it's
not as crippling as before where i could
even use the phone very sketchy man but
i still love this note for though it's a
really darn good phone at love i still
love the screen regarding the s6 edge+
my fiance has that so that's why i don't
have it on me i'm still trying to
preorder the nexus 6p which is currently
out of stock i need at least 64 gigs and
there's no removable SD card on there
and if i'm doing vlogs on there I need
the the additional hard drive or the
additional space and i believe the
pricing is what five hundred dollars 40
32 gigs and just for fifty dollars more
you get 64 so hey why not even 128 gigs
are sold out so it's really unfortunate
but uh good stuff i am at the mall here
i'm actually about a walk-in I keep
telling you guys about removable
batteries I am still a fan of them you
never know just in case but thankfully
well unfortunately unfortunately this I
itouch that i bought several months ago
to review and of course I you know I use
it for work and whatnot it the bet it
doesn't turn anymore even when i leave
it in a charger it just doesn't turn on
and of course it's still under warranty
it's less than a year old of course so
i'm going to bring it into apple I never
used apple care before I believe that's
what's called I'm not too familiar with
apple and more of android guy i really
love android just for my purposes
although apple does make some damn good
stuff too i do it
that so no bias is here but it's my
first experience I'll see how it goes
and i'll report back to you guys for the
non apple followers are people who are
not too familiar with apple so we'll see
how this goes gotta go go in for a run
today and unfortunately starting to rain
and it is cold outside at least a little
cold for fall but we'll see how it goes
all right off to the next section
me
oh hell yes I'm waiting for this to come
out you know Daniel Craig hits plain fun
all right so it just got out of
applecare or the genius bar or so and
unfortunately they couldn't help me it's
about four and a half hours wait on a
Monday so that means i have to come back
here around seven thirty or so i gotta
pick up my little kid and I got to go
out film and work and whatnot so I had
unfortunate like gonna make it really
such a drag man for half hours wait god
I didn't know I know that they'll be
that busy I thought I could drop off the
device they said I couldn't leave the
device there I had to actually come back
during the appointment so I mean it is
what it is so I was a go on from there
yes alright folks so this week I don't
have any packages to unbox in the car
like I doing my other vlogs but I got a
special treat for you guys if you guys
have not been following me on facebook
twitter or instagram you guys don't know
about this yet so today is probably your
first time seeing me having this it's
the brand new gear s2 from samsung it's
the latest SmartWatch from Samsung and
it is pretty slick I did pre-order the
one with the leather band but the day
was released I said it was backordered I
was a trap already waited a week
that's what this came out I think a week
in advance before the leather strap came
out so I said forget it so I ordered
this one I didn't want to wait any
longer I don't know how long to wait
until this came out so got this bad boy
here that's why I'm out at the park
right now gorgeous parked on the
favorite places to run in film to got a
little stage right there and huge pond
in the middle some people fish in there
I don't know if there's any fish in
there to be honest with you but the huge
running trail and there's one trail on
this side that goes right into the city
and sometimes I filmed there too with
you guys have been found you guys
probably see some of that but got that
and a little unorthodox here but I got
the basis peak I'm also reviewing and
testing you know the running
capabilities heart rate tracking and all
that stuff so out in the field I am
freezing my bunions off I'm originally
from New York and I'm I was used to the
cold but being down south for what like
seven eight years now look at
freakin uh my asian hairless legs are
cold but I just joking i don't know
whatever but um but yeah that's about it
i got something else here for you guys I
mean it's just a sheet of paper to be
honest with you but uh if the measuring
guide for the Microsoft band I did I
need to pre-order this let me say that I
might not even get it on launch day to
be honest with you since I'm
pre-ordering so late I did pre-order the
microsoft surface pro 4 which I'm
excited about that's something I really
and I am intrigued in a lot of people
haven't asked me about the sorry about
the lighting I know a lot of people have
been asked me about the surface book and
I'll be honest I can't take another
thousand-dollar plus hit for the month
of October if you guys have been
watching my vlogs or have been found me
for a while and for those who don't know
I do pay for most of my products so I
hope you guys can understand that it
does take a huge financial hit you know
to buy these products and review them
and whatnot so I had decline on the
surface book I think the starting price
was like fifteen hundred dollars holy
cow but um surface pro 4 should be come
out this week today is money that I'm
filming this this video should be
uploaded on Tuesday so monday which is
today for me JBL flip three should be
out long is coming out as you guys are
watching us on tuesday and then i'm
going to try to finish this up by the
end of this week and then hopefully the
surface pro 4 comes in and I have you
know couple other products back at the
studio that i'm reviewing too so busy
busy week busy month of course October
has been great and man how these seasons
right around the corner holy cow I can't
believe how fast it's going right down
the comments below what are you guys
looking forward I know okay maybe
there's a little bit early well let me
know what you guys want um what do you
guys want for yourself for this
Christmas I still don't know what I want
for this christmas
I mean bus you know everyone works hard
all year and I feel like everyone needs
to just reward themselves somehow just
you know just once a year at least
something nice that you can just keep
your around and whatnot to remind you of
that hard work at all that's my
philosophy or go about for me personally
for my own Christmas I guess you can say
the gifts for you know your relatives or
whatever you know they can get the sacks
and whatnot so but um let me get to the
questions real quick is on the back of
this sheet here again like in all my
vlogs write down your questions below it
doesn't have to be YouTube related just
be personal if you want Bobby Ray 848
asked how did i start at my youtube
channel to what it is today I just start
man just like I said in the beginning of
this vlog here I I quit my job I don't
suggest everyone do that everyone's
circumstances are a little bit different
at that time you know I had an
opportunity to leave and it was ok so
just start man and listen to the viewers
see what they want and have very high
standards for yourself and every day
just continue to improve and I'm not
saying I'm perfect there's days where I
messed up but at least acknowledge that
you messed up and try to improve for the
next video in the next month next year
and whatnot and before you know you just
keep adding layers upon layers on top of
it and before you know it I am far from
it but one day you never know man you
might be one of the big you know players
in the game or they were you doing
YouTube whether there's you know guys
are they're doing twitch where there'd
be someone that's out there who owns or
wants to start up a marketing company or
videography or video recording anything
that you guys want to do that's the same
concept to start and gets continue
adding layers on it sorry this phone is
getting lower and lower my arms getting
tired um next question here I didn't get
that many questions compared to the last
vlog for some reason I really just jot
down just a really too literally I had
to get running this morning panel moker
I think that's how you pronounce it can
I review non-tech actually do normally
in the non busy seasons let's say after
I say about maybe january-february i
usually do non-tech and then spring a
little after spring like early summer I
start doing like non techie stuff it
still kind of revolves around tech I
guess by cnet electronics like I did the
dyson vacuum cleaner that came out I
wanted to do a Roomba at one point a
couple of like pull up bars I've done
fitness equipment fitness gadgets
whatever so it's not technically
electronics but it is hand on the techie
side so I've done a couple of those and
you'll see more of those down the road
but right now I mean there's so much
técnicas coming out I would say why am
I why would I not do them so man holiday
season is right around the corner so
alright folks oh that's it for this vlog
here I know it's a little bit of a short
one because I didn't have products to
unbox and whatnot but again follow me
facebook twitter or instagram follow me
