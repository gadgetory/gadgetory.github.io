review room welcome to another review
today we'll be looking at the newly
released Jabra rocks now there are
wireless Bluetooth earbuds cut it in
cord you can say that connects to your
phone and always light earbuds just for
the fact that they set right in your ear
canal for direct sound they block out
unwanted noise and of course the ease of
portability now I recently reviewed the
jaybird Blu bud X and they sounded
amazing but there's a good handful of
people including myself that have
experienced poor fitment they kept
falling out of my ear so with the Jabra
Rocks they're priced at only $130 retail
and we'll see if this more
budget-friendly pair not only fits
better but also determine its sound
quality so without further adieu we'll
get started so the first time you pick
up the rocks you'll notice the metal
construction right off the bat giving a
feeling of durability and longevity the
plastics are all lined with the slight
silicone texture to give it a bit more
grip and more of that rugged appearance
now testing this in my pocket and also
my gym bag has showed no signs of damage
or wear over time in pur Jabra they're
also dust and water resistant now one of
the biggest improvements over Bluetooth
ear monitors over the years is the
battery has gotten a lot smaller the
better is housed on the left earbud
behind an enclosed metal cap a micro USB
cord is provided for charging on any USB
charger or computer granted in my
opinion the cord was a bit short though
nonetheless charging from a dead battery
to fall took about two and a half hours
and then testing the earbuds all day
living it at about 50% value which was
enough for comfortable listening less
than me 6 hours as claimed by Jabra now
one of the unique features of the job
rose to put them on standby and save
power you put the two earbuds together
and they magnetized conveniently around
your neck to prolong its usage and of
course you can always turn them off
altogether with the inline controller
which also has your volume up and down
buttons now you're able to skip tracks
as well and one very worthy feature
worth mentioning when not listening to
audio you can tap the volume up and down
button simultaneously and Java tells you
how much battery is remaining something
I wished was at all Bluetooth speakers
and earbuds that I reviewed now Java
right out the box provides not three but
four silicon tips for fitment
now only one set offers a flange design
while all the others are the rounded
tips Jabra also includes three sets of
wings to put into the ball of your ear
for additional support the Jaybirds
which I just recently reviewed said a
bit more forward and also the wings were
a little bit more stiff which barely
worked out for me there now the job rows
on the other hand are much more pliable
flexible and more importantly
comfortable they sit in but sit a little
bit more back compared to the Jay birds
making this in the end fit amazingly
well now I guess I have small ears but
using these small wings with flange
design tips prevented the Jabra rocks
from moving at all now I went jogging
with these things in weight lifted and
mountain bikes and no issues personally
very very impressed but can the same
thing be said for the sound quality
though now through my testing here the
first thing that I noticed when I first
put this on was the bass now if you're a
bass lover low humming and resonating
sub bass to the punchy upper bass levels
are very apparent listening to songs
from Drake little Wayne into pop artists
like Katy Perry did very well the genres
of pop hip hop and rap to drum and bass
and dubstep you enjoy these very much
it's a very satisfying response but for
those who prefer a more balanced sound
range the bass is a bit dominant though
now mid-range levels where most sounds
the human ear is most familiar with
especially vocals are pronounced and
does offer enough clarity to be enjoyed
the upper mids and high frequencies were
good but you can tell these ear monitors
are a bit more focused on base where
cymbals and snares are being hit isn't
as pronounced or distinguished as much
as I'd like or at least they didn't hit
as high as the Jaybirds recently
reviewed now EDM trance techno in the
likes of my favorite cascade or black
mill still sounded good
due to the bass this may be more
immersive in the beat but this is just
my personal experience I wasn't as
immersed you can say into the song if I
can describe my experience there
altogether the volume is very loud and
mainly keeping this at about 52 possibly
60% loudness called for a very suitable
experience now regarding the Dolby
Digital Plus it's an app that's offered
through either the App Store or Google
Play Store whichever platform that
you're on the app allows you to play
your stored music and playlists or any
video on YouTube with Dolby Digital
price
see now although it does enhance the
sound quite a bit and does offer more
depth and in my opinion clarity this
feature is only exclusive within the app
I can't apply this while I'm using
Pandora or watching a movie for example
I got Netflix which is quite a letdown
though so overall I'd say these are
still very good earbuds especially for
those who enjoy bass
now although mention the highs were not
as pronounced but if you're not wearing
the Jaybirds
and then these draw bars right after
like I did as the average consumer you
probably won't notice the difference in
those highs it really comes down to
preference if you prefer bass though
with these these are very good ear buds
now if you prefer a more balanced
approach but still sounding great
overall consider some others but hands
down these dropper racks is the best
fitting ear buds I think for most people
with some amazing features like the
magnetized standby mode premium build
quality and a battery indicator and
although the Dolby Digital doesn't work
in other online services it's not a
deal-breaker so be sure to comment below
and tell me what you think about these
ear buds and as always be sure to
