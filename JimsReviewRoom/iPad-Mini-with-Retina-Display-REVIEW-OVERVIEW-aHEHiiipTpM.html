review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the iPad Mini with Retina
display now this is the successor to the
original iPad Mini which was released a
little over a year ago so without
further adieu we'll get started the
specific model I have here is the 16
gigabyte Wi-Fi only version that comes
in space grey and white now mine is
priced at 399 dollars at the time of
this review the new mini comes in at 16
32 64 and 128 gigabyte configurations
the new mini with Wi-Fi and 4G LTE
internet are priced on your screen as
well in all models comes with the same
performance such as the same processor
ram and screen resolution and we'll get
more into that a little bit later in
this review and lastly the iPad Mini is
a bit higher in price compared to other
tablets recently released in a segment
as shown on the screen now let's go over
its physical features first the old iPad
Mini and the new iPad Mini with Retina
are practically the same size as you can
see side-by-side they are literally the
same in both width and length with the
same screen size as well
now both offering a nice thin bezel
going down on either side the only
difference is the thickness for this
year has slightly gone up from 7.2
millimeters to 7.5 millimeters and the
same goes with for the weight as well
with a slight increase from 308 grams to
331 grams in either case the tablet is
still very thin and very light it's
actually one of the thinnest tablets
that's on the market today as well so
when holding the mini compared to the
previous generation it basically feels
exactly the same but being the same
isn't bad at all for Apple the previous
model was groundbreaking at that time
and beats some of the competitors still
today it still features an aluminum
chassis that's still very solid it has
no flex at all again a premium feel all
around with no concerns or corners cut
in build quality nor Apple's mentality
if it's not broken don't fix it now
compared to the previous generation
models it's identically the same
physical layout you still have your 3.5
millimeter headphone input and power
button on top screen lock and volume
buttons are on the side and your home
button on the front is still the same
the Thunderbolt 2 USB connection is here
to charge your iPad
and transfer data to computer and two
speakers centered on the bottom of the
iPad now the sound quality is still good
as the previous model and compared to
other tablets it still is one of the
best sounding tablets out there there's
still no distortion when vadym is at
maximum so there's no ting enos on the
high notes the Kindle Fire HDX with
Dolby Digital sound processing is still
my number one go-to with such immersion
and simulated surround sound provided
again ample speakers are very good
speakers for our tablet and lastly you
have your 1.2 megapixel camera on the
front that records in 720p resolution in
the rear having a 5 megapixel camera
that records in 1080p and as you can see
on the screen are actual photos I've
taken right from the new iPad with no
editing photos are at random and
consistent bright light low-light and
close-ups as well still with this year
there's no LED lighting in the back of
the tablet now what this model Apple is
finally back in the game in regards to
resolution display and now features
Retina display the screen now has a 2048
by 1536 resolution display and coming in
at 326 pixels per inch means it's as
good as the other good tablets on the
market today
it just basically means that you'll have
clear and crisp images and text now
comparing to the old generation that
only has 163 pixels per inch there is a
difference when you first gazed upon the
higher resolution screen now moving on
internally in regards to performance and
features this is where you'll see the
most notable upgrades and changes this
generation houses Apple's latest chip a
1.4 gigahertz dual-core processor with
one gig of ram onboard and currently
running iOS 7 Apple claims the processor
to be twice as powerful than the
previous generation if you're intending
on using this just for a basic email web
surfing and YouTube videos the many will
no question run this flawlessly now
personally my third-generation iPad can
run everything available on the market
right now
however the mini runs a bit more robust
and smoother from basic day to day
activities however the more CPU and
graphic demanding tasks such as
productivity apps 3d gaming and large
amounts of data processing in general
this is where I'd notice a big
difference everything just runs fast
around the mini as you
see on the screen I'm running the
toughest and most demanding graphics
test from 3d mark and you can see how
much smoother it runs next to the older
iPad again the processing power for your
tasks where the demanding or basic the
many will handle it in regards to
veteran usage Apple claims between nine
to ten hours of battery life while using
this device now while charging and use
my water meter and found the many
consumes anywhere from seven watts to 12
watts while charging that's not bad at
all
so for those considering of purchasing
an iPad the operating system makes this
possibly the easiest tablet to use the
operating system iOS 7 isn't usually
cross all of Apple's iPhones and both
the iPad air iPad minis so if you can
used an iPhone before it's the same
exact thing on the tablets the interface
is just apps on a grid there's no widget
or multiple windows running there's no
large icons that distract what you're
looking at everything is very uniformed
and collective it's easy access with all
the apps laid out in front of you and
there is no need to fiddle with anything
on the home page you can place your most
News icons on the bottom as I've done
here Internet YouTube music etc and you
can see on your screen right now
flipping in between apps opening and
closing them and lastly categorizing
apps by just holding down the icons and
dragging it's simple yet effective
enough so overall the iPad Mini is a
very good tablet no question both the
air and the mini with retina are both
the best tablets buy Apple today by
making what Apple has been doing right
and refining and already proven formula
it performs very well and even
outperforms the newer tablets with
quad-core processors and more RAM out
there and again typical of Apple to
provide a very solid product so knowing
this tablet can handle practically
anything you throw at it you'll be
owning your device that will be with you
for a long time the only downfall see
and I've been noticing this for some
time now with Apple it's slowing down in
offering features like I said earlier
it's taken and already proven formula
and refining it although the rest of the
hardware might be very impressive but it
also needs the software and internal
features to make the iPad continue to be
unique the Apple interface is the easier
interface to use which is great
but androids market share is growing
rapidly and I'm not a market analyst but
the market might need a breath of fresh
air from Apple's dominance and
simplicity maybe being too simple is
starting to become a little bit bland
but overall there's practically nothing
wrong per se with this iPad but it's a
matter of preference so if you decide on
purchasing the iPad Mini either way
you're still walking away with a very
good product with amazing power and
great build quality I don't think you'll
be disappointed at all so that's it for
