room today I'm doing a how-to video on
the Game Capture car the Elgato
connecting it to the PlayStation 3 now I
typically do reviews my channel here but
prior to doing this review I try to set
this up and unfortunately there is a
slight nuisance and I think it's only on
the PlayStation 3 there's a slight
hurdle or step you have to do on the out
Gatto just to have it work properly
there and it's because of the copyright
protection or I guess some kind of
security protocol whatever it is and
PlayStation put on their systems what
they do but I mean it is what it is
but in this video I'll tell you you know
give you I guess step-by-step
instructions on how to overcome that now
I currently connect my places three to
my TV directly with a HDMI cable if you
do so leave that in what you want to do
first is take the what I call the
audio/video cable that came with the
elgato connected to your PlayStation
three of course and then right into the
elgato AV input next is take your USB
cable connect it to the Alcatel of
course and then connect it to your
desktop or laptop PC now as you can see
in the video be sure to keep your AV
cable and also that HDMI cable connect
it in as you can see all my cables are
still connected on the top left you can
turn the system at the time at this time
if you want if not that's fine next
thing to do is go online to the Game
Capture website wtae.com slash download
and what you want to do is download
their free editing a live streaming
software there and the download takes a
couple minutes there's and it's not too
big of a file and it works again as you
can see on the screen both for Macs and
PCs as well now keep in mind again I
want to reiterate again keep the cables
inside the PlayStation 3 in the
PlayStation 3 do not disconnect your
HDMI so after you download and install
it
turn on the PlayStation 3 and then turn
on your laptop and the laptop you won't
see the PlayStation 3 screen in the
background like online but the first
thing one do is go to the settings which
is the wrench
and change it to Playstation and then
select your resolution and then on your
monitor or TV it should have of course
the PlayStation still playing through
directly with your HDMI cable and just
go to your display settings which I'm
doing here and it should be there pretty
shortly now what you want to do is well
on my screen here is going to say HDMI
because that's again it's directly
connected with that go down to a
component /d terminal which is the AV
cable that we're using and make sure
only 720p and or 1080i selected do not
select 1080p even if it's an option if
you do not select 1080p once you select
it the screen will go black on your TV
and you have 30 seconds to do this take
out that HDMI cable and then connect it
directly to your el gato it's usually
connected in your TV should flicker back
on and you will see the PlayStation
screen again and click X on your
controller of course to save that
setting now hopefully here your TV is
showing this through the video feed of
course wearing PlayStation 3 and then
your laptop will also also show what is
basically showing on your youtube video
right now the control panels on the
right your screens on the left and your
ready to record so I hope it works out
for you guys definitely if this did help
you like the video that would be greatly
appreciated check out my other videos as
you can see on the screen right now that
is the unboxing of the elgato itself and
hopefully I should have my review up
within the next day or two and be sure
to subscribe to see that video and get
alerted
thank you very time and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
