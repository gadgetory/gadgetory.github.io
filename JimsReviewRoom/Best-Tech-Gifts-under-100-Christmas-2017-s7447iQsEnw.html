welcome back to my buyer's guide for
items $100 or less for today and going
into 2018 every product has been tested
reviewed or personally I bought it to
use right here at the studio what I'm
trying to say there's basically no fluff
in this list these are the best of the
best that I personally hand-picked as
always I'll place my affiliate links
down in the video description below
click on those links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
you never know what these things might
go on sale so again I'm Jimmy with Jim's
review room and I'm here to help you
make that purchase decision welcome
everyone to another video now for those
who are budget conscious looking for
practicality something that's
interactive and can be techie for just
$50 I personally recommend a brand new
smart speaker they Google home in iam
sorry I'm pressing divine buttons here
now we've personally tested this at the
studio and in a natural speaking tone
you can ask for the weather if you have
chromecast you can use voice to turn on
Netflix or YouTube on your TV there or
have the Google home Mini double up as a
Bluetooth speaker for your bedroom
living room or kitchen and play music
right off of it hey Google play some
Tupac sure check out this 2-pack radio
mix on google play music now some of the
more advanced features you can tell this
to turn on your smart lights ask for
traffic conditions and how long your
commute would be from home to work and
vice versa and be able to turn up or
down your smart thermostat without the
need to run down stairs assuming that
you have one and for the average
consumer who are not aware you get the
same exact smart features on the home
MIDI as if you pay for the $200 and up
options out there the only difference is
sound quality and how loud each model
can get what I'm trying to say you're
not missing out on these smart features
by buying this cheaper mini model here
second Google assistant built-in is
ever-evolving so if you ever owned this
into the next year or two it's never
going to get old or outdated the Google
mini comes in at 50 dollars again check
might feel it links down into the
description below for the most
up-to-date prices now up next I review
ton of Bluetooth speakers right here on
the channel I have two options for you
guys the first one is super
budget-friendly it's the dass sound box
for $30.00 I've done the audio test on
this and you can listen to that indie
review
but for $30 it sounded great it's clear
non distorting the build quality is
solid it's metal here and did I mention
it's only $30 better life is also rated
at 12 hours and with my testing I was
able to get 14 hours at 50% fun the
better test proves and lasts as long as
the expensive models out there now if
you want thing some general audio and
don't want to spend a lot of money but
our friend cheaper speakers sound bad I
can confirm this one is good now if
you're on the upper spending limit of
this video I highly recommend the JBL
flip for retailing for $100 it's super
rugged you can submerge this underwater
if you accidentally drop this into the
lake course or a pool or so it's stain
proof the audio and this is the best in
class there's a lot of bass in this
thing compared to the competition and
better life is also rated at 12 hours
which is very very good and with JBL
connect plus you can sync over a hundred
of these speakers and have them all play
at the same time again my affiliate
links are in the video description now
the third item here let me pull this out
give me a second yeah I can get on my
way now the third item here these are my
personal Sport earphones I use these
more than my power beats three more than
my jaybird
it's Jabra sport pace now the reason why
I use these more than my expensive ones
it's because they're cheap and if I ever
lose them or break them I'm not flipping
out too much but I've had these ever
since I reviewed them which was about
January of 2016 so almost two years in
and you're still going strong the sort
of pace is similar to the power Pete's
three by offering a basic sound
signature and the audio quality is good
I will admit the power beats 3 do tend
to be clearer in slightly more detail
but the difference I don't think should
be a hundred dollars if anything the
power beats 3 should be around a hundred
thirty two hundred fifty to compete with
the jaybird x3 so now if you're on a
budget at a hundred dollars the sport
pace is the perfect alternative now the
last item on my list and let me take a
moment to explain the latest Samsung LG
and finally iPhones have wireless
charging let me tell you folks this is
hands down the most convenience the most
practical the most dumb moments that I
wish I purchased years ago instead of
just recently it's a Qi charger and come
into the office and or at home or so
literally slide this on just like that
and then you're done when you're
to go instead of reaching to pull out
the wire pick it up and basically leave
I know it sounds so simple but once you
actually own one I'm telling you it's
life changing it's super convenient this
one has been highly accurate I don't
have to drop it in you know precisely
and align it they just try putting a
little bit crooked and it still charges
you can also orientate this sideways and
watch videos while it's propped up just
like this and it will retain or charge
or could continue to charge your phone
your call this one charges up to 10
watts it's fast enough for me and my
daily use and last this item was maybe
around the low $20 range you saw it on
the screen here when a person bought it
again links in the video description so
again folks check these item out again
these are items that I personally owned
or tested the list should truly help
anyone out there that's on the fence on
what to buy and as always be sure to
LIKE subscribe and give me some fire
emojis down below to help support my
work here you guys take care I'll see
you guys on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
