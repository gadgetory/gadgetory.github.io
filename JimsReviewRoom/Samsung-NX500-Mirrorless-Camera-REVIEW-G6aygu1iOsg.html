review room samsung's latest mirrorless
camera replaces the nx300 and offers a
smaller package than the DSLR light and
x1 the nx500 that I'm reviewing today is
getting a lot of attention because some
of the mechanics and technology from the
NX one makes its way into this smaller
body camera and some may think of it as
a cheaper alternative as well now on the
flip side the price of the nx500 is on
the upper end of mirrorless cameras in
general but with its specs and
technology it might be well worth it
now I personally paid seven hundred and
ninety nine dollars for this as of this
video and it does come with these 16 250
millimeter varible lens now before
starting keep in mind I'll be reviewing
this for the average consumer mostly
with the settings on auto and this
review is targeted towards those who
don't know what F stops are ISO levels
and all that amazing timber jargon now
this is however for those who wants to
pick up a possibly great working camera
and using it to read out of the box and
maybe for video bloggers to thinking of
picking this up so without further ado
welcome everyone to Jim's review please
going over the physical layout first the
camera is 4.7 inches wide 1.7 inches
from front to back and stands tall at
two and a half inches the camera itself
weighs a little over half a pound but
still very light to work with the lens
itself I do admit it does protrude a bit
here but it does sit 100% flush or
parallel with the camera preventing the
camera from tipping over unlike these
Samsung and X Mini that I've tested
previously now part of the lens here
specifically most of the exterior is
made of plastics and because so it's not
front heavy making this camera well
balanced when holding for long periods
of time even when holding this with one
hand no again ideal for bloggers and
videographers the lens itself does
feature a very smooth rotating ring here
for zooming in and out but also on the
side of the lens are buttons to zoom in
and out as well now there's this eye
function button on the side which I'll
show you shortly
now looking at the cameras body I do
have the textured white which indeed has
gotten dirty from touching other
unsightly things and then touching the
camera afterwards the mess doesn't rub
away dry but with a little bit of water
and a cloth it rubs out just fine with
no staining at least for now
overall no squeaks or areas of flecks
just a very well-built and tightly
packed camera now going over to layouts
starting at the top right here we have
your on and off switch with shutter
button this small button to the right is
the auto exposure lock below that is a
very nice and stiff metal dial for
selecting your type of control whether
full auto manual aperture or shutter
priority etc but on Samsung you have SAS
abbreviated for samsung auto shot three
different types of action shots are able
to be taken automatically any jump shot
here for example is the easiest to
explain now once a person jumps into the
air the nx500 will take the photo when
the person is at its peak in its jump
now the same concept is applied to
baseball and trap shots only helping to
capture that exact moment that you want
now the S camera icon will allow you to
use presets such as portrait mode
panorama sunset fireworks etc that we've
seen on other cameras as well now going
back to the layout here the nx500 offers
what i think is highly beneficial with
setting dials just like DSLR cameras
where
your ma mode other than auto you can
adjust your exposure f-stop ISO levels
and navigate through your settings on
the fly and everything is displayed on
the screen in real time and with other
models you had to go through the menu
adjust the settings with the directional
pad in the back and whatnot this makes
for a very streamlined smoother process
now the center is your quick connection
button to link your camera directly to
your smartphone you can use your
smartphone as a viewfinder which I found
to be ok for photos the Bluetooth
connection wasn't as fluid as the main
LED display despite having a newer phone
and being right next to the camera
itself and to finish up the wireless
capabilities this is perfect for those
on social media that wants better photos
than what your phone may output photos
can be beamed to your smartphone
wirelessly and turned allowing you to
store the images or share them on
Instagram Twitter etc but back into the
physical layout here a hot shoe is
available and in the nx500 packaging you
do receive a mountable flash and sadly
with this camera I was hoping we were
now able to get a microphone jack so I
can mount my rode microphone to this but
there isn't instead on either side of
the hot shoe are the built-in
microphones which does surprisingly a
pretty darn good job picking up clear
audio now on the back side the video
record button is conveniently located on
the edge for thumb access while all the
other buttons on the back are placed in
this standard position like most of the
cameras now to the far left side and
protected by cover a microUSB port is
offered for charging and transferring
data no special cords needed and above
that is a micro HDMI connection now
rotating to the bottom NFC or near field
communication is present with a tripod
threaded mount and lasts to the far
right is a slot to hold your lithium ion
battery and regular sized SD card no
Samsung claims three hours and 20
minutes about to fully charge the
battery from a dead one and you can
achieve up to 370 images if you're using
this only for taking photos or up to 2
hours straight if you're using this to
record video at 1080 at 60 frames per
second now getting to the part that's
probably a little bit more interesting
Samsung uses Super AMOLED technology and
a 30 inch touch screen the camera has
the ability to flip up for yes those
selfie photos but better yet for
recording yourself
the screen also tilts facing downward if
you ever need to hold the camera above
your head to take some aerial shots now
regarding the display like most of the
AMOLED screens Samsung uses I personally
like them for entertainment purposes
it's very contrasting colors pop and
it's a pleasure to look at that is on a
TV tablet or smartphone I do have to say
if you're looking for color accuracy
either for taking photos or filming
video the AMOLED will provide an image
on screen that isn't what the real world
looks like it doesn't look like the
photos eventually that I'll show you on
screen in a moment example the grass in
this image is very green and looks to be
well watered and plush but the grass in
real life is in life that no Samsung
does provide an option to turn off Super
AMOLED and the saturation and contrast
is slightly reduced but it's still not
what your photos would look like once
you put them on your computer to view so
just be aware of that overall the screen
still though is very responsive to touch
execute menu selections and during
recording in photography you can
actually manually tell where the camera
to focus just by touching anywhere on
the touch screen now in the menu
settings the nx500 offers one of the
highest megapixel sensors available on
any mirrorless camera Samsung offers up
to 28 megapixels and in large variety of
smaller sizes to choose from but while
the menu options here everything is laid
out pretty straightforward easy to
understand read and scroll through now
regarding that i Function button and
lens that I showed you earlier it allows
a pop-up menu on the screen here for you
to change all your settings on the fly
using the scroll wheels on the back and
atop the camera now again just to make
sure that we're aware here this review
is for the average consumer looking for
a camera right out of the box using
mainly the auto settings unless I
specified otherwise in the following
photos unless you're the photos you'll
see are all unedited
but
so I decided to venture around the city
and came across the scooter first the
autofocus on this thing works amazing
that's one of the first things that I
noticed right off the bat this thing
locks onto my images fast but the
tracking face detection and the number
of areas that nx500 offers to focus on
is very impressive now this wouldn't be
a surprise as the same focusing system
comes from it's more expensive bigger
DSLR like mirrorless camera the NX one
now with this image overall a sharp
enough focus is on the scooter itself
but I do admit the colors are a bit
muted or flat with a very slight hint of
green to the overall image now here's
another example just in case you put on
a sunny day to make sure it's not the
auto white balance that's screwing
things around the photo on the right
again is the nx500 unedited and the
photo coming in on the left here is from
a nikon d50 100 an entry-level camera at
the time priced about $900 with the lens
the Nikon is also unedited and you can
see from the ground to the pine needles
just a bit more color that's present now
I'm not saying that Samsung is bad for
example my mother and friends first time
seeing this they would think the more
saturated picture is better and if
you're a point-and-shoot kind of a
person with no editing experience you
might think the same as well it's good
but for more avid photographer those who
actually edit their photos with a flat
color palette like the nx500 it does
make it easier to retain all the details
when editing in say Photoshop or
Lightroom and just real quick around
this image granting the Samsung does
have many more megapixels than the d50
100 is sharpness and clarity really
shows now here's another close-up with
the nx500 for your viewing pleasure
again no editing done on this here as
well and here's another indoor image
that is again on it's Auto settings but
still a great looking photo in my
opinion and in this image it does look
really rich so on a different day here
and yet again it's cloudy I had taken an
overall image of our local college
campus overall still a very sharp image
the colors again could use a little bit
more saturation for the brick and now
some things to point out here and this
kind of being nitpicky here
you do receive some band
in color shade transitions if you look
at the sky you'll notice bands of gray
when there should be a smooth linear
progression and second this is quite
common on smaller frame sensors you do
get a bit of Alison or what they call
more rave usually with very fine details
and lines at times you get these jagged
edges or lines that appears to bend
again this is pretty typical for smaller
frame cameras but if you're a blogger
and wear some fine line plaid or prints
this is something to look out for now
regarding low-light performance not to
get into too much jargon here at ISO
level 400 it's pretty equivalent both
pictures are on the same aperture
exposure time and ISO levels in the
lampshade chain and the lettering are
pretty much neck-and-neck
now for another picture once you start
going into ISO level 500 you starts to
see some noise being introduced and the
ceiling and on the edges of darker areas
so over on with low-light performance
shown it works well in lower levels of
course but once you start stretching the
performance in lower lit situations the
annex 500 doesn't really have a huge leg
up and perform similar to other cameras
now as for video this is one of the
biggest perks this is one of the few
merliss cameras on the market today in
this price range that can record in 4k
it is indeed ultra sharp ultra clear and
a pleasure to look at now these videos
shown has been down scale to 1080 but
even so the detail is still simply
amazing now this one thing I do have to
mention though when you do record in 4k
or UHD the screen image then zooms in to
a one to one ratio size and with the 4k
recording you are limited to the
cinematic 24 frames per second so prior
to filming you have to estimate how
close the crap will zoom in on your
image and then when you start recording
then you have to readjust a camera to be
in frame it's quite annoying after a
while though now watch what it looks
like once I move from you HD or 4k here
to 1080 and you can see the image is
pulled back you can see the railing on
the edge of the frame here where I had
my tripod leaning against it and not to
mention this is actually 1080p footage
at 60 frames per second from the nx500
and you can see a dramatic decrease in
image quality and just to be fair here's
another quick comparison of just 1080
better lit area you can see the
lettering the nx500 is not as sharp as
the three-year-old Nikon that I'm using
but one last item here I wanted to
mention for anyone thinking of getting
this for recording video and I want to
make this clear this is not necessarily
a flaw but Samsung has implemented the
latest high-definition recording codec
h.264 it's a high efficiency codec meant
to reduce file sizes dramatically and
other technological advances but with
most video players including the latest
video Land 2.2 or even the latest video
editing program as of this upload like
Premiere Pro CC you can't watch them or
edit the files instead you have to
convert them for the time being back to
h.264 then you're able to do what you
need to do now one program I found
that's free and does work is media
player classic if you need to please
google them and to edit this video I had
to use Rocky Mountains movie convertor
and not wondershare as some has
suggested this is the new codec and it's
the way of the future eventually but for
the time being there's just an extra
step of conversion or special players
needed to work with this media and this
does apply to the 4k recordings and even
down to the 1080 video so overall with
this camera I think it's still a good
camera for the price range it provides
sharp photos an amazing focused system
for such a small package the colors on
men are more subjective but I did notice
on darker and cloudy days the college
had a slight green tint and on bright
sunny days there's just a bit of
overexposure again it's all in the auto
settings now if you don't use Auto
settings the camera does work much
better and provide some great results as
for low lights from my experience this
was not the NX 500 strong suit it really
performed on average or worse both on
auto and manual mode than other cameras
on the market now regarding the video
recording capabilities now it's great to
have that hotshoe but we're still
missing that mic input then although the
built-in mics are still good but the
video recording ratio does impact my
workflow since there's not a dedicated
video mode as well the 4k like any 4k
the clarity is amazing but if you're
still in the 1080 world of videography
there's much better video recording
cameras out there today and I'd say once
the price goes down once the new video
codec becomes
more mainstream it may be worth a second
look but for the time being even with
the excitement of having parts from the
NX one carried over to this real-world
performance I still feel is somewhat
lacking so hope this video helped you in
some way if you like my work add me
