others not so much
I'm talking about students returning to
college in a month or less regardless
you should keep in mind some things that
you need before going back and I'm not
talking about foot flaps for the showers
or pepper spray in this case I'm talking
about essential tech that would
hopefully make your life a bit easier
now let's start with the absolute
essentials that everyone needs and drop
down to items which are optional but
still strongly recommended
now all the items discussed will be in
the video description below if you need
more information or updated pricing now
most if not all will be from Amazon
anyways and speaking of Amazon first up
get Amazon's version of Prime for
students student Prime works the same
exact way as the standard version free
two-day shipping unlimited photo storage
and Amazon's own collection of movies
shows and music just like other popular
apps like Netflix or Hulu now normally
$200 for an annual membership that's
what I paid here this since I'm not a
student anymore but Amazon is a beast
offering student Prime for free for the
first 6 months and after that it's 50%
off your membership if you decide to
continue and that's up to you again the
link is in the video description to sign
up now if you have been following me for
a while I'll review a lot of Bluetooth
speakers get yourself one either you're
jamming in your dorm room or with a
group of friends at the quad you gotta
have something light Wireless and
something that sounds better than your
smartphone speakers nowadays a boom
boxes are gone and getting harder the UE
boom or UE roll is the most ideal now
it's reasonably priced at $200 and $100
respectively they both offer nearly
indestructible water-resistant loud
audio if you value sophistication and
pure audio quality the new bose
soundlink mini tube is also priced at
$200 but if you want tons of features
here the best bang for the buck the
creative roar too is another option that
sounds practically like B sound like
Mini 2 but it's priced at $169 retail
now with the right range of options here
all of them have
3.5 millimeter ports so you can
physically connect this to your computer
when you're back home or back at your
dorm room now moving on if you have
multiple devices here that uses a USB
connection instead of using the one
phone charger for every device in your
room
get yourself a multi-port USB charger
but before you buy any pay very close
attention if you have a newer phone like
those listed on the screen currently
they all feature quick charge 2.0 built
right into the processor and I checked
and the number one seller on Amazon is
anchor and none of the anchor models
available as of this video offers quick
charge 2.0 unless you go with a single
port charger which I'm not recommending
here okey and I think that's how you
pronounce it is another comparable model
at just $30 and I haven't test this one
personally but the rating so far seemed
decent and they're officially licensed
by Qualcomm the makers of again the
quick charge 2.0 feature again the link
is in the video description
Ankur although it works great in the
number one seller Amazon Aki supports
today's devices
moving into entertainment those who
prefer to stay in on the weekend if
you're a gamer PlayStation 4 or an Xbox
is perfect but if you're on a budget or
not a gamer yourself get a chromecast
most college students I wouldn't think
would have a smart TV so if you want to
binge watch orange is the new black or
Game of Thrones Netflix Hulu YouTube HBO
GO and the list continues you get to
watch your media right on your TV with a
stick rather than watching it on your
smartphone or tablet
again the chromecast is priced at $35
retail now next up everyone needs a good
pair of earphones now riding the bus
walk into class or at the library sound
isolation I think is key I recommend
getting some in the ear earphones and if
you have the money get the $200 job or
support puls providing great audio sound
quality here or if you love bass be
powerbeats2 from Beats Audio now those
are water rain and sweat resistant for
those intending on taking these into the
gym as well now let's step down in
pricing Audio Technica see kr9 offers
one of the most comfortable in ear
earphones with some of the best audio
that I've heard and tested and for those
again who are wanting that bass the
Yamaha Eph m200 are for bass lovers
indeed those will be your standard wired
earphones with no water resistance and
they'll run you about 150 dollars
dropping down below the $100 range best
bang for the buck Wireless is the Jabra
step Wireless water-resistant good
battery life and good quality sound as
well and it's just $60 on sale it's
normally about $70 but click on a link
in the video description to double check
and for those I'm a bargain hunt I've
been using these for over a year now
really generic pair that I found on
Amazon and they do justice around $15
no crackling it's slightly more basic
than the others but there's still no
Distortion in addition having these for
over a year now the lay flat cables
hasn't disconnected from the earbuds
themselves really proving it's quality
build overall for the price it's my go
to I don't care if someone steals this
from me earbuds no next up in technology
if you already have Gmail or any kind of
a Google account you're already signed
up use Google Drive and it's
now for those who are unaware saving
files on to your computer emailing them
to yourself or even saving them onto a
thumb drive is old-school I personally
use Google Drive on a commercial level
and this does store almost any file that
you have online into the cloud and a
perfect example I work at home on my
desktop and let's say I leave in while
I'm on the bus I can still access my
Doc's on the go and once I arrive at
school or at work here I can still pull
it up on my laptop again all this can be
all done automatically as well so for
example in Google Drive there's Google
Docs as you type each word is literally
saved in real-time now the amount of
memory that you get it's 15 gigabytes
that is free to everyone as soon as you
sign up and 15 gigs that's pretty darn
big amount
it's ample enough for the average person
now next up are not required but still
highly recommended now if you have a
nice flagship phone
they do take some great looking photos
during the day and in bright light
situations but for those travelling
abroad or doing a lot of crazy cool
stuff in the labs or experiences you
want to keep for a lifetime not just
posting pictures on Facebook or
Instagram here get a digital camera if
you have the money
hands-down the canon t6i that was just
released
I personally tested this and it's a
beast it's an entry-level DSLR and if
you know nothing about cameras there's
always auto mode so don't be too
intimidated and it'll do most of the
work for you now if you're on a budget
the mirrorless Samsung nx-1 and compact
does justice and a great alternative is
the sony a 5100 or the sony a6000
pricing is available in the links in the
video description below
now I had two people mention ear eaters
if you're reading beyond reading your
text books more power to you
I recommend the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX
model the regular Kindle Fire will get
you by but I'm afraid the one gigabyte
of RAM on board will very much be
outdated soon the HDX model offers two
gigabytes for better multitasking
capabilities a premium screen resolution
with Amazon claiming the tablet to
feature 100% color accuracy which is a
huge plus and it also has longer battery
life now if you're winning an apple here
Apple may be releasing and they usually
release a tablet in September so if you
can hold out a little bit out say wait
until then I believe Samsung is also
possibly releasing a
tab s2 which is their flagship model and
that should probably be announced pretty
soon as well but there's really um no
official confirmation yet but it's all
really speculation and also based on
previous release dates as well and be
very less item I would say is
recommended yet optional our power banks
now there's a dime-a-dozen out there
they were very cheap and I've seen them
even so that like TJ Maxx or Marshalls
for a few dollars the power bank stores
enough power to sometime charge your
phone multiple times I'll keep one in
your bag your glove compartments your
locker wherever just in case you're not
indoors or on campus to charge your
phone plug this in and it will charge
your phone while you're on your way to
class or even driving the school for
example so that's it for this list you
can find more information or updated
prices on each one of these items again
in the video description for the
individual reviews you can find them all
right on my channel at Jim's reveal room
now if this video helped you in some way
be sure to share this video as it may
help others too
I'm Jimmy with jims review room comm
