review room welcome to another review
today we'll be looking at the UE mini
boom Bluetooth speaker
now this falls into the small bluetooth
speaker segment and retails for a very
good price of only $99 and it has to be
by far the smallest bluetooth speaker I
reviewed to date basically fitting into
the palm of my hand and UE claims this
little thing basically carries big sound
so without further ado we'll find out
the mini boom is indeed very small and
colorful nonetheless the speaker
measures four point four inches wide two
point four inches high and two point six
inches thick and weighing in about the
half a pound making this very
lightweight now although the mini boom
being so small and so lightweight the
unit was very solid though virtually no
flexing on the grill or frame of the
unit when I applied very firm pressure
the mini boom is also wrapped in the
silicone rubber like material for grip
and protection and the mini boom comes
in various colors of your choice either
purple orange green etc as you can see
I'm screen now all buttons are located
on top with a very simple design volume
buttons are here with the Bluetooth sync
button located in between and all
buttons are very firm and clicky during
use and showed no signs of initial wear
during testing the mini boom also has a
built-in mic so you can use this as a
speakerphone and during my test calling
family and friends no one complained and
stated the voice quality was very clear
and no signs of me sounding like I was
in the bathroom echoing now rotating to
the rear again a very simple design
first is the on and off switch next is
the micro USB port to charge the speaker
with the supplied USB cable and
unfortunately there is no wall charger
supplied so you do have to plug this
into your computer or what I did was
connect this to my phone charger not a
big nuisance but worth mentioning and
regarding the battery life the mini boom
has up to 10 hours of life which is good
when compared to its competitors and
last on the rear of the speaker although
this is a wireless speaker you can still
connect your device to play audio with a
three-and-a-half millimeter cord
now what's unique about this speaker in
the $99 price range
it does have some features which some of
the more expensive brands don't first as
an app you can download from either the
App Store for Apple users or the Google
Play Store for Android users now through
the app you can change settings to
further enhance your experience now to
be honest the only time I would go in
here is basically if I had to mini boom
speakers I can pair them together and
they both can play from your one device
in the end giving you stereo sound by
playing the left and right channel
separately or you can double up and play
sound equally from both speakers in my
opinion it is ideal for having one
speaker in the bathroom and the other in
the bedroom per se or basically one
upstairs and one downstairs to have
sounds somewhat throughout the house
again that's through the app now while
still on the app there is an equalizer
setting which isn't robust as I first
thought their predetermined settings of
out loud intimate for small rooms and
vocals which is of course
self-explanatory and not a fully
customizable equalizer
now each setting from my review had very
minor changes to the audio where I
didn't bother with the EQ any further
now lastly regarding the app this is the
only location where you can go see how
much better you have remaining now wish
there were some LEDs on the device
itself to tell me but again the app is
the only location that tells you this
information and the last notable
features if you have a NFC enabled
device you can just tap your device onto
the speaker and this will pair up the
speaker for you there's no need to go
through the settings to sync it's just a
nice feature to have just to make life a
little bit more simpler so what I'll do
to critique and demo the unit I'll play
several songs and give you my verdict
afterwards
he does it you're so fun tonight is your
doctor suit hi I'm a leave it all on the
floor tonight and you got fixed up to
the nines let me show you what you play
I pressed up in black and white and I'm
dressed in my dress you happy
love is swinging in the air tonight let
me show you
there we go go
a very habit folks I hope you enjoy the
sample there from these great artists
and all their information is in the
about description below now getting back
on topic here of course music heard in
person is much more clear in definition
but hence my review here the first thing
noticed right off the bat is the mini
boom is no question loud for such a
small unit it's perfect for personal
listening and decent for casual
listening in larger rooms again it's
loud and it didn't have any distortion
unlike some other smaller Bluetooth
speakers trying to sound big basically
the audio from the mini boom also has a
bit more bass overall compared to these
similar alternatives but with that being
said although loud and having some warm
notes to it it's not an open or
expansive sound the bass is just enough
again for casual listening you won't
mistaken the speaker for a large
speakers what I'm trying to say
however the audio quality is still very
good for a small Bluetooth speaker and
no question majority of consumers will
enjoy this if you're shopping in this
price range clear vocals clear sound no
raspy noises on the high notes it's not
much bass but there's just enough you
can't go wrong this product again for
only $99 in the last hit but although it
retails for $99 some locations have it
for just a little bit cheaper so be on
the lookout there so hope this review
