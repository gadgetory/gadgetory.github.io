attention when algebra least the 5.5
inch g4 model I thought that was it the
best of the best today LG is adding an
addition to their lineup it's a 5.7 inch
monster of a phone with a separate
independent second screen in addition a
friend being structurally reinforced and
possibly this smartphone having one of
the best cameras on the market currently
of course I'll go over all my tests here
on this review unit from LG and I'll see
how it fits into the average consumers
lifestyle so without further ado add me
on to Twitter Instagram or Facebook and
be sure to subscribe if you haven't
already
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review and I'm here
to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
going over the physical features first
this is a decent size phone ever so
slightly bigger and ever so slightly
heavier than the new Samsung Note 5 s6
edge+ and Nexus 6p just in case you're
in the market looking for a big phone
here with those slight differences it's
still not heavy but you will notice a
weight that makes us feel beefier more
rigid than other phones handled this is
mostly due to the stainless steel rails
going down on either side an internally
reinforced frame and of course that
second screen as mentioned earlier which
I'll detail shortly but overall this
thing is built like a beast even the
back cover is made of a synthetic
material to help with abrasion and
dissipating some shock when dropped
being honest I'm not fond of the
material in regards to its aesthetics
and me just being picky here there's a
very subtle styrofoam like feel to it
it's weird to describe it's not hard
plastic and I'm not sure if the camera
can pick this up but you can take your
nail increase a mark into this and give
it about 10 minutes and the crease will
disappear for more severe marks leave it
overnight and it will heal most of the
indentation
I thought the average consumer wouldn't
notice too much but knowing that the
back cover does heal itself it is a plus
but let's rotate through the phone here
on top you have a microphone and an IR
blaster which I give tons of points for
since you can turn on and control your
TV from your smartphone just like a
remote control to the right is nothing
and then rotating to the bottom here
left side has your 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack micro USB 2.0 port sadly
no USB 3 or type C here just yet
a microphone and last is the speaker now
located on the bottom the small speaker
is loud enough offering a bit more
direct sound compared to the g-force
rear facing speaker the sound quality is
very much like other phones to be honest
with you but on a very few occasions on
higher pitched music there is slight
raspy nasur droning from my experience
going to the left and nothing on the
side either but turning this around to
the rear here LED light on the left the
right has laser sensors that helps with
the v10 focusing system which I'll
demonstrate during the camera test the
middle is quite unique here as we don't
have the buttons on the sides but all
the buttons are located here just like
the g4 now although they did take some
getting used to and in a change in
muscle memory from other phones they
come in really convenient volume up and
down of course but from the factory if
you double tap down
twice the camera will instantly come up
and take a photo perfect for emergencies
when you need to get a photo ASAP now
this will even work if the phone is
locked as well same with a double press
up this will quickly open Notepad so you
can jot down any urgent information
right away directly in the middle is the
power button but now features a
fingerprint scanner for me it worked
every time and didn't have any
inconsistencies consider your naturally
holding your phone your finger
naturally resides around the scanner to
make this feature a bit more convenient
than other phones that requires you to
press on the front of the phone instead
now one minor issue and this isn't
detrimental but the home button has a
little bit of play to it making the
button feel not as firm or
well-put-together as the rest of the
phone again very minor and this wouldn't
hitter the purchase decision of course
last on the rear is the 16 megapixel
rear facing camera and before I get a
bit advanced here remember my channel is
catered to the average consumer like
myself this phone works great as a
simple point-and-shoot with minimal
settings needed to be adjusted with the
v10 in auto mode it does provide
accurate and more of a neutral color
palette nothing seems to be manipulated
now not a direct comparison but for
illustration purposes also brought along
my samsung galaxy s6 edge+ that I
recently reviewed just to see the v10s
characteristics the Samsung as you can
see here does increase its sharpness and
color saturation quite a bit all in its
auto settings and as you can see the LG
here leaves the photo more neutral some
may very well prefer this as the photos
do look more natural and either brand is
not wrong either way but it is a matter
of preference but from my experience in
general the v10 still does an amazing
job at obtaining details offering good
color accuracy and performs very well
with minimal interaction from the
end-user but where the v10 really shines
it's one of the few that has complete
manual controls like a full-blown DSLR
usually reserved for the professionals
but with the layout and simple trial and
error here you can learn to manually
control exposure color temperatures
eisah levels and much more menu controls
offers a custom setup that gives you the
ability to take the best shots when auto
mode at times can't the perfect examples
are times when you have the Sun in the
back or the side of the subjects here
and auto mode prevents the camera from
being overblown causing the object in
the
or front to be to dart with manual mode
in this particular scenario here I
increase the exposure time just a slight
bit here and was able to achieve Vader's
face as being viewable now when you
shoot in very dark areas Auto mode may
increase your ISO levels very high
causing noise and degradation into the
image quality
now with manual mode I turn down the ISO
levels bump up the exposure time once
again and achieve photos with much less
noise something that auto mode can not
do and if you want to really get
professional RAW files are an option if
you're serious about photography RAW
files captures an image as it implies
basically in raw formats no software
compression or any alterations unlike
JPEGs now if you typically edit photos
with Photoshop or Lightroom then yes
there's a huge advantage as if you
already know if you're not editing
photos to that extent and just sticking
with Instagram or an in phone editing
software then really raw is more of a
marketing term as many reviewers do
praise it as they should but in reality
for a consumer it might not be a feature
that you would use and just trying to
look out for you guys out there but
indeed RAW files are available for
photos and for the first time for video
editing as well and if you're intending
on using this to shoot video as I do
with my vlogs here and recording baby
moments with my family the optical
stabilization works wonders with
preventing jittery hands and movements
as well not to mention this can also
record in 4k at 30 frames per second
with a very high bitrate of 64 megabits
1080p of course is available and has the
ability to record up to 60 frames per
second now overall from my testing with
the camera here again very fast
performance very simple but still
offering tools and options that advanced
users can use as well but just real
quick going over some of the additional
features here there's time-lapse mode as
you can see as a sample on your screen
obviously you having a tripod would
produce a little bit better results slow
motion works out pretty well too in
capturing those awesome action shots and
last is multi-view the v10 has dual
front cameras which displays one
close-up one further away and the rear
camera being shown at all at the same
time I didn't see the three cameras set
up working at hangouts for video
chatting which was somewhat of a letdown
though now this disappears to only work
for video recording and you can imagine
what kind of videos that you would or
could produce with this an example
prob the first thing that comes to my
head here as may be filming your own
reaction or a groups reaction when
filming your subject with the rear
camera and finishing up the exterior of
the phone now the v10 is one of the few
phones with a removable back a 3000
milliamp battery with a nano sim and
microSD card slot comes standard with
the SD slot compatible up to a crazy 2
terabytes of extra storage which I don't
even think is available in the markets
just yet but if you need extra space
it's relatively cheap a 64 gigabyte card
is around $25 today on Amazon not too
bad at all now regarding better life
since were still back here I'm able to
achieve a day's worth of life having on
average around 15% remaining at the end
of the day overnight although the second
screen remains on for information
purposes the battery only drains by 5%
recharging the battery with its fast
charger takes a crazy here quick 30
minutes to achieve 50% in about an hour
and 21 minutes you basically reach a
hundred percent recharge the only thing
missing on this flagship phone is really
just wireless charging and maybe due to
its back cover here the phone only gets
warm not hot like other phones when
using their quick charging feature now
that's a slight plus right there
measuring at 5.7 inches for its main
display we're looking at a resolution of
2560 by 1440 a very sharp display a more
neutral display - that is indeed easy
and the eyes the only issue I really
found here the white appears to have
more of a bluish and green tint to it
when I had my other phones next to each
other all the other colors appeared to
do well and to be honest though if I
didn't compare the phone side-by-side
like I'm doing here being the average
consumer I didn't notice or question the
screens accuracy to be honest with you
but again everything else you did see
more feel fine but to the future that I
very much want to discuss they quote
second screen it's not huge but this
black strip up top here has some
convenient features if you're coming
from any of the Samsung edge products
with its curved display it's similar but
slightly different let me explain with
the second screen on the v10 it's always
on day or night and appears to not
affect better performance much if at all
when the phone is in your pocket the
proximity sensor turns off the display
to help conserve a bit of juice and
first up here you have a signature which
just displays your name that you can
customize by holding down nothing too
fancy to be honest with you but swiping
right offer
your most recent apps use Samsung does
have a similar feature offering app edge
for your most favorite apps but I like
this feature here that it's always on
and more importantly this keeps the most
recent open apps in the forefront now
swipe right one more time here and you
do have that similar app to app edge
where it does keep your favorite apps
and it's fixed therefore quick selecting
now customizing this is simple as
dragging and dropping icons to and from
your main screen so I've been right one
more time here offers media controls and
one more right offers quick contacts
save your girlfriend best friend or
emergency contact for quick access you
also receive notifications along the top
of the screen here too which is highly
convenient now when the screen is locked
you have a little weather icon with
date/time in the battery level a quick
swipe again offers you to put your phone
on vibrate or ring Wi-Fi on or off the
flashlight as well and last is the
camera mode but beyond notifications and
quick access the second screen offers
additional tools when in camera mode
allowing you to switch between auto or
manual mode on the fly for some apps
like I Heart Radio or Pandora they do
allow for pause and play with skipping
forward and back as well
the only thing lacking and add this
can't be done while the phone is locked
and the main screen is off those
controls are not available and the last
thing not a big issue but there is
slight screen bleeding here that is
visible at night you see this white
ambient glow on the corner where the
second screen is located by discussing
the other LG dedicated features that may
be useful to consumers multi window is
available here allowing for to select
apps to work simultaneously perfect for
looking up Google Maps while looking up
info on particular restaurants or maybe
chatting while watching your movie and
missing a scene LG brings back smart
settings which i think is genius you can
have your film turn on or off both Wi-Fi
and or Bluetooth when you leave your
house or return home even have your
sound profile change when you do leave
the house and the last major offer here
the v10 comes with a very nice set of
in-ear earphones the v10 does offer a
high definition digital to audio
converter built into the phone enabling
the listener to take advantage of higher
definition audio files now of course you
do need higher bitrate files such as the
lossless format flack but from my
testing listening to some flex files
myself and switching in between hi-fi on
and off
I couldn't even notice a difference if
anything the file themselves already
sounds great and with the LG earphones
which I found to work out very well
those two alone made for a very
enjoyable experience with hi-fi it
really didn't change anything and those
who follow me you would know I do a lot
of audio reviews for the average
consumers out there but last but
possibly the most important aspect of
the phone is the experience LG comes
with the specs currently on your screen
the biggest perk I have to say the four
gigabytes of RAM the 64 gigabyte
standard of storage space and as
mentioned earlier the removable battery
and micro SD card slot now with just
those features mention the v10 really
leads the pack in the core requirements
that some people are desiring the
processor is a Snapdragon 808 which is
still a great choice today and I think
technically better than the 810 which
did have heating issues but from overall
use android 5.1.1 that comes stack and
the ux overlay from LG all works
seemingly well doing my standard test
stuff scrolling through the main
interface 0 starters whatsoever opening
apps you can see on your screen
basically how fast this thing really
loads very impressive and of course the
camera being pulled up a photo taken
then jumping into the gallery to view
the photos practically seamless over
from normal phone use to heavy Internet
users and media consumers this thing
works well so in my opinion the v10
doesn't offer much on the premium looks
maybe even feel as it doesn't have that
full metal body or glass backs and I'm
not trying to knock it or anything like
that but the screen isn't visually in
your face Wow either but to be fair all
the information is done at least really
good where the phone really does shine
despite missing wireless charging
missing better USB connections and we go
with the rugged theme so far the lack of
water resistance as well the phone's
camera and the manual controls are a
huge plus if you're into that these if
eNOS of the interface the second screen
is slightly more useful and more readily
available versus Samsung's so it does
feel slightly less gimmicky my IR
blaster is still here to control my TV
and cuming stack with 64 gigs of
internal storage a micro SD card slot
and of course a removable battery just
in case the battery ever fails there's
so much bang for the buck in this phone
and all the features do work very well
in the end I do highly recommend for you
to
look into this phone regarding looks of
course that is subjective I'll leave
that really honestly up to you guys to
determine so that's it for the review I
know it's a long one here check out my
s6 edge+ review as well a great phone in
its own way and if you do like my work
as always like and subscribe and add me
on to Facebook Twitter and or into the
gram you guys take care I'll see you the
next one bye
