review room welcome to another review
the first solos debuted in 2008 and it's
been Dre's best-selling headset since
it's been a long time and finally the
solar tubes are here it's priced at $200
with some significant changes in both
looks and also performance and
considering the previous model has been
selling so well did beats really make
the right changes so without further
adieu we'll get started if you owned a
pair of solos before when you look at
the scylla twos in person you can tell
right off the bat a significant
improvement in design these look much
more up-to-date with today's sets while
the previous generation plastics now
look really cheap and although it's very
fingerprint Pro the glossy black finish
I have here looks deep practically an
automotive finish that's been polished
subtle branding of course stays with
beats on the headset and the words sole
on the sides without the number two and
more importantly the craftsmanship I
believe greatly improves with the old
headsets you can see screws on the sides
while the new ones removes them all
together but beyond aesthetics the
foldable ear-cups doesn't use plastic
lay the previous-generation button uses
metal to snap an unsnap for stowing away
with the old model over time it felt
like the plastic would wear out and a
snapping isn't as satisfying the
introduction of metal greatly improves
the clicking and also the sense of
durability and quality now moving up the
band the silicone padding has been
extended down further and the very top
of the headband provides just a little
bit more cushion compared to the
previous generation and regarding the
ear cups themselves the old solos were
just enough to get by but its
minimalistic style and material still
worked the new solos goes thicker with a
new premium leather that's much more
plush and also supple and staying on the
ear cups the solo ones moved a little
too free making the headset film flimsy
even here in the plastic move around
sounded pretty cheap the solo tooth does
provide more rigidity however the range
of motion has been very much limited it
doesn't pivot as much as I'd like to
ensure a fitted contour with different
sized heads and lastly the first thing
you'll notice when you pick up the
solitudes they do feel somewhat heavy
compared to the
other $200 headsets on the market they
also clamp your head a little bit more
firmly compared to the solo ones and
from my experience and this is just from
my experience alone I actually preferred
the lightness and the more versatile ear
cups on the original solos when you
first start wearing these new solos you
might notice some fatigue on your head
from the weight after several hours but
you at the same time I much highly
prefer the quality build and feel of the
solo twos though so that's something you
should consider if you're planning on
buying now in regards to content beats
also provides the three half millimeter
wire for your headset but it also has
your inline controller similar to the
same as the original so no one's it's
still the same quality with clicky
buttons and responsive controls there's
also a built-in mic so you can answer
your phone calls while using your
headset and phone and audio quality is
fine and it also sounds like you're on a
headset so nothing too special or
nothing too bad to speak of that's out
of the norm but beats also provides its
neoprene carrying case which is also a
plus and when stowing away your headset
is a small package overall which is
convenient inside there's unfortunately
not a separate pocket to hold your wires
now moving on to performance beats has
always received mixed reviews in regards
to audio quality now I personally grew
up listening to not only pop but also
really into the likes of hip-hop and rap
I was really getting into music when the
very first blueprint album dropped
Murder Inc was still around and Irv
Gotti didn't go to jail yet and before
Diddy and 50 cent really became moguls
and today I'm advert in techno and house
music but what I'm trying to say is I
listen to a good variety of music and I
don't want to be biased if I only listen
to let's say bluegrass folk or pop etc
and give a bad review I'm reviewing this
based on what beats aims for and if
demographic it's heavier and bass
tailored more towards rap and hip-hop so
with that being said yes songs from John
Mayer some songs from maroon 5 or One
Republic does sound a bit muddy there's
a bit too much bass that drones out over
the other instruments so those type of
genres they sound okay but clarity is
somewhat lost but for Drake wale even to
my favorite current genres with Cascade
and black Mill the music in my opinion
is amazing when you're needing a song
that's heavy on beats the solos
pronounces those beats with just enough
bass to make
immerse into that song when the beat
drops you really do start head-nodding a
bit at least mentally there the
immersion from the tempo is there now
when I compared these solo ones with
these solo twos by taking one off then
putting the other one right on I can
hear the solo twos more pronounced in
the mid-range with stronger more clear
vocals compared to the solo ones the
high notes are still good on both
headsets but again the lows and
mid-range levels of audio are the
highlights of these headsets here and
when putting the solo ones back on only
at that time you can hear the solo one
sounding a bit boxy and not as
pronounced so overall the solitudes in
my opinion is a pretty big improvement
over the last model leave a comment
below and when you started really
listening to music who's the artist and
