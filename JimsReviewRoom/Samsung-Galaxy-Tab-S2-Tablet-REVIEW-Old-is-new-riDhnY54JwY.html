down and Samsung themselves haven't even
updated some their other flagship
tablets they no pro in Tab pro series
nonetheless there's still some out there
that may need a media consumption device
or maybe a light use laptop replacement
whatever it may be we finally have the
Tab s - the newest and supposedly the
best of the best
considering Apple didn't even announced
a new nine point seven inch Apple iPad
air this year now this new tablet from
Samsung might take the cake now I
personally pay 499 dollars retail for
this and it comes with 32 gigabytes of
internal storage and the other premium
tablet the other Apple iPad air 2 as of
this video is offering bears for the
same price but it only comes with 16
gigabytes now you can click on the link
in the video description below for
updated pricing if you're watching this
later in the year so I'm here to help
you make a purchase decision so be sure

me on to your social media I'm Jimmy
with Jim's review room welcome everyone
to another review
going over the physical features first
two things you'll notice right from the
get-go it's crazy thin and crazy
lightweight and the funny thing I said
the same thing last year when they
finished tablets were introduced
how much thinner can these things get
the s2 comes in at nine point two eight
ounces with the chassis being five point
five millimeters thin and with that
being said Samsung has finally
incorporated an aluminum bezel that goes
all the way around giving a very nice
solid feel and grabbed the sharp edges
makes holding this in the palm secure
enough despite the tablet being so thin
and it's a nice touch in my opinion
giving the feel and appearance of an
upgraded device from a design and
engineering standpoint the a tab as two
back sides are slightly beveled and
although it is such a small design idea
it's about the experience and the little
details like this that gives an overall
impression when you first pick it up I
personally love this but let's go around
the physical features here starting at
the top Samsung gets rid of the IR
blaster which of last year's model
allows you to control your TV with your
device now moving through the right side
very cliquey power on and off with
volume rocker buttons below directly in
the middle is the built-in microphone
and to the right of that is the micro SD
card slot with the tab s2 you increase
your storage size up to a hundred and
twenty eight gigabytes which is amazing
which thankfully I am glad the Samsung
kept considering that both of their
flagship phones have done away with them
my biggest gripe I'm sure due to
engineering constraints it's not a
simple flap that you can rotate to
access like last year's model but now
you require a pin to stick in to pop
open the tray for something buying an SD
card and leaving it in there works great
but for those like myself where I
transfer movies back and forth from PC
to tablet it does pose an obstacle
moving downward the micro USB 2.0
charging port justify to the right the
3.5 millimeter headphone ports on the
left hand side and as you can see these
speakers are very much spaced apart for
portrait mode it's no problems at all
but in landscape there is no question
that you're blocking the bottom speaker
with your palm the speakers are loud
enough with the s2 and decent for a
tablet speaker however they're slightly
not retaining its clarity at maximum
volume when compared to the Apple iPad
air 2 in addition it does sound less
warm and bacey
and the air 2 does project voices louder
when I can
paired them side-by-side but back to the
physical features there's nothing on the
left side of the tablet but rotating to
the back it is plastic with an aluminum
paint light texture Samsung obviously
didn't go full aluminum which is fine by
me but the build quality all around is
still very well done despite being so
thin the bezel keeps the tablet feeling
stiff and the rear panel itself has very
minimal amounts of play and the rear you
have the same 8 megapixel camera and
this time with no LED light or an LED
flash like last year's model however one
improvement is the ability to film in 4k
resolution and very much less going to
the front samsung upgraded their
fingerprint scanner with a OneTouch
feature
versus the model from last year where
you had a swipe your thumb for my
experience this works better and it's
worked every time
getting into the meat and potatoes the
screen last year's model which has a ten
point five inch came with a resolution
of 2560 by 1600 that gorgeous display
this year's model a nine point seven
inch screen with a resolution of 2048 by
1536 identical to that of the Apple iPad
air 2 but shockingly Samsung has taken a
slight step back in pixel density
compared to last year's model at 264 PPI
s for those who are more peculiar in
stares at the screen looking for
imperfections the fine letters are just
not as crisp I guess to compare to the
other model for the average consumer
I'll admit you probably won't even tell
it all and again being honest I was
hoping for a bit more though for that
wow factor but the resolution is still
done well I mean it is working for Apple
of course but the biggest change is the
departure from a widescreen movie
friendly sixteen by ten aspect ratio to
a more square more traditional four by
three so yes those heavy into watching
movies and widescreen formats those
black bars are back again but the
trade-off if you're more of a website
reader news article connoisseur and
eReader
the new aspect ratio does benefit with
an entire page practically on one screen
no needing to flip to the next page and
so on so it's really a matter of
preference and I know some old favor one
over the other the tab S line so far as
of this video is the only tablet in the
Samsung lineup that offers AMOLED
technology the same technology as in
these smartphones these Samsung s6 note
5 and of course
last year's tablet the tap s now this
screen has crazy colors it pops like
crazy either by itself or when held to
another tablet the saturation might be a
little too intense when you have
brightness all the way up but of course
you can always down down the brightness
but surprisingly with the white
comparison it seems that the Tab s 2
does well with offering a pure white on
previous models sometimes it appears to
have a yellow or reddish tint or so and
not sure if it's showing well in the
video in the camera here but in person
it makes the iPad air to look slightly
gray actually and just real quick and
try not to get too technical before I
discussed using the tablet the system
specs are on your screen according to
tech times comm Samsung is not using
their latest processor found in these
Samsung phones the Exynos 7420 but it is
using the processor found in the samsung
galaxy note 4 the Exynos 5433 indeed it
is an older processor with quotes around
the word older it is still no slouch
either of course it's not as
energy-efficient roughly a 10% slower
clock speed or so and the Tab s2 is
using the familiar ddr3 ram while the
newer phones are using the latest ddr4
indeed not an apples to apples
comparison since it's a phone versus a
tablet but Samsung has typically placed
their best of the best and their
flagship devices regardless if it's a
tablet or phone yet with that being said
while running currently from the factory
android 5.1.1 and Samsung's overlay this
is still very zippy in a very fast
device and we're world use I didn't
notice this was any slower or faster
than other premium tablets on the market
regarding Samsung features you do have
multi window mode allowing up to two
select apps to open at the same time
handy for multitasking another feature
is from the home page you can swipe left
in Flipboard will always be available
basically curated news articles in
journalism based on your specific
selections overall from I use this is
still a very capable device zippy and
fast for all of your needs regarding
battery performance I ran two movies and
then the following day tested some games
downloaded some more apps here and of
course left the tablet on standby
overnight total time is one day in 28
minutes and screen on time was eight
hours and one minute Samsung claims up
to 12 hours of video and up to 8 hours
of Internet use so with my experience
with a mix of steady video and then text
graphics for games it appears to be
around the lower numbers that Samsung is
claiming now I do admit it does get
slightly warm when playing games on the
back here most likely due to being very
thin but not too hot to the point where
it is uncomfortable another feature that
I was shocked that Samsung did not
advance on there's no quick charging
despite the same processor allows for
Samsung's quick charging capabilities in
their smartphones now regarding
recharging the Tab s 2 had taken me
exactly 4 hours and 31 minutes from a
dead battery while the tablet was on and
the screen was off I'll be honest I'm
honestly spoiled by the quick charging
capabilities on the on the smart phones
that they have so with everything being
offered by Samsung in my humble opinion
it's still a great device by itself when
compared to the next premium tablet
maker as I've been compared moderately
in this video here the heir to Samsung
still offers more features and I still
believe it's a great design but when you
compare Samsung's culture with itself
for the past five years or so
compare this to even the last generation
tablet Samsung really made adjustments
based on market changes removing the LED
flash no IR blaster and didn't continue
their attempt in class-leading specs
example the processor in ram maybe they
knew that Apple was not intending on
announcing a new iPad air 3 in September
who knows but Samsung has clearly made
this more portrait mode friendly with a
43 aspect ratio to moving the speakers
from either side in landscape mode to
the bottom where the s2 stands
vertically possibly catering more
towards those who desire ear eaters
nonetheless the build is still fantastic
despite that SD card readers slot now
the screen quality is still one the best
to look at and I would say if you have
last year's Tab s I would say just keep
it no need to upgrade if you don't have
a tab S just yet
and looking for the best of the best
this might still be the one for you
but this time it really feels like
you're paying a premium price and I mean
really premium when there's so many
other tablets out there today and maybe
some down the road with better specs at
a cheaper price so hope this review
