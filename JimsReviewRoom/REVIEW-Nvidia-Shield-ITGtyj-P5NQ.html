review by Jim's review room I have here
the brand new portable gaming device
beating the vidya shield now retails for
299 dollars and can be bought from any
one of these following retailers now
what's unique about this device is
you're able to play android games now
with the controller which gives you the
player a totally different experience
and you can utilize this as a portable
pc rig as well no more on that later now
this is primarily a gaming machine but
has the functions and features nearly
identical to a tablet with apps emails
and entertainment now since this is new
videos go around at a gaming device how
does it work you know what are its
features and is it better than the other
portables out there right now we'll find
out on this review from Jim's review
alright folks what we're going to do is
start the run down this is a new segment
for me where I just run down the entire
list of specifications for this
particular product so the new video
shield comes with the latest and
greatest it comes with a new video Tegra
4 quad-core processor with two gigs of
RAM on board now it comes with 16 gigs
of storage space running on the latest
stock Android jelly bean now there's no
no video skins or overlays again this is
a hundred percent stock Android now the
screen size comes in at five inches with
a resolution of 1280 by 720 now that
translates to 296 pixels per inch now
the video calls this there retinal
display not retina but retinal the new
videos shield has theater speakers with
a built-in microphone on a controller
mini HDMI output to connect to your TV
or monitor micro USB 2.0 micro SD slot
to expand your memory and a
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack with microphone support now
wireless connections include the 802 11
n connection to your router and
Bluetooth 3.0 now the shield comes in at
one point 27 pounds with measurements of
six point two two inches wide two point
two four inches tall and 5.31 inches
deep so with all that being said the
next section of review is how does it
feel the device does feel very solid now
when holding on to the shield it truly
feels like a game controller and not
necessarily like a portable gaming
console now I like the other portables
like the PlayStation Vita but the
ergonomics is actually a bit better on
the shield not great though but at least
better however the nuance is to this
item it's a bit bulky compared to let's
say the PlayStation Vita or the 3ds now
the button layout though as you can see
resembles an Xbox controller with a few
other additions like the integrated
speaker which are pretty loud though but
when I do play someone maximum value
there is a slight distortion on the high
notes or it's a little bit tinny um
where it's a little bit high-pitched
where it's droned out a little bit but
again you always have your head
important news though now on the back of
the controller it does provide a rubber
texture for extra grip which I liked and
gaming on this thing for extended
periods of time did feel natural and at
ease now all the buns felt the
hundred-percent top-notch including the
trigger buttons and the shoulders all
the other buns were very responsive just
very good quality overall now regarding
the screen I thought the 5-inch screen
was actually small but it was actually
perfect for gaming now in certain
applications like Google Maps because of
the smaller screen real estate it did
make pinching in and out you know for
zooming a little bit more difficult I
just had just to get used to it but
again I'll remind you this is first a
gaming machine then a gaming machine
with tablet features second though so
overall it's somewhat bulky for a
portable gaming device but for what you
can do with it this thing has so much
potential in power so what can this
thing to do and what are its features so
as you can see the new video shield
functions identically like a tablet on
Android with all your Android apps being
accessible through google play now
considering this thing has Tegra 4 it's
the newest and most powerful moment from
nvidia at the moment now this thing
hauls this thing kicks but with
everything that you throw at it it is
lightning fast and there's times where
it's faster than the second generation
brand new Nexus 7 which I just did a
review in my channel now one of my
personal real-world tests is pretty
primitive or pretty quick and easy is to
see real-time loading from Google Earth
and as you can see image loads either
instantly or with minimal lag games
function perfectly fine as well the only
issue though there's a lack of games
that support the handheld controller and
there's games that lack the phone use of
Tegra 4 of course this is completely new
on the market today now the shield store
is accessible when you click on your new
video icon twice on the controller and
here you can browse what games are
specifically made for the shield or
Tegra belt specific now popular games
like dead trigger are great with the
controller scheme but another awesome
free game that i love is actually real
racing 3 it doesn't utilize the
joysticks or the buttons to break the
vehicle change the view or at least
steer the vehicle two joysticks that's
not even a veil
so I'm the limited available games only
a handful of those games are actually
worth really purchasing and playing too
but with that being said the she'll
definitely has the potential although it
is scared to me if the shield floats
that's great if if you know sinks if it
slowly disappears and it's forgotten you
know in the market you know it's
unfortunate we just wasted three hundred
dollars if it does great in sales it
would open the android community further
development of games they would just
take advantage of these features and so
going back to the screen here the screen
itself being what new video calls their
retinal display does feature 296 PBIS
that's pixels per inch now again pixels
per inch is the amount of detail in
every one square inch on your screen the
more you have the more densely packed
the pixels are giving you more detail in
every image so in this case 296 pixels
per inch looks perfectly fine on the
screen color saturation and contrast are
within accuracy with skin tones and
colors and everything looks generally
looks normal and not washed out play
netflix was fine and the image quality
was good although the main screen for
selecting the movie was not rotatable at
times which i found little bit weird
maybe it's a glitch on my end there so
one of the last yet notable features i
want to mention was the ability to play
your games from your pc wirelessly now
you do have at you have to have at least
a new Vidya GT 650 graphics card and
your main desktop to utilize this
feature now / new video you have to have
a compatible game as well you can go
directly to new videos website and see
the list of those games however i have
seen folks that have been able to play
games that are not on the list through
steams big picture mode so that's of
course you know worthy try if you can
now unfortunately i do apologize though
I personally don't own or have a GT 650
or higher so I personally am unable to
demonstrate that for you but I'm certain
there's other YouTube videos out there
that can review this for you a little
bit more in-depth than I came but with
such an original and unique feature I
still believe it will pretty much be
niche now if I want to play the same
battlefield 3 on my desktop computer and
then for some reason I want to play my
living room on my small Council here I
don't think many people do that I mean
that's just personal opinion I mean some
people obviously would but I think
mainstream general audience I would
think playing am a big gaming rig you
know with your keyboard with your
precision mouse with your you know
19-inch 24-inch whatever monitor people
going to go with that the thing is gonna
be a really tough transition to play it
on a 5-inch screen especially on a
console controller I mean you guys had
heard of the war you know consoles
versus pcs except except no give in to
that but again we said if people are you
know hardcore gamers on the gaming rig I
don't think that they would actually go
towards the small handheld console on a
daily basis that is um I think maybe
it's in need of an emergency if they
don't really want to play downstairs or
if they really need to play on the
living room chair but again that's just
my opinion one less than my new thing
here it's an important feature to me it
was missing the swiping and texting
message feature now I had to manually
key in letters not my Nexus 7 and my
android phone has swype texting with the
android operating system so i'm not sure
why it doesn't have it here at sense
it's basically the same version might be
nice to have though so overall this
machine i think is an amazing build and
I'm certainly can do well but only if
future games will support the shield but
yet again the shield needs to do well
itself so it's the case of the chicken
or the egg whichever comes first so
those considering of purchasing please
throw caution into this awesome product
though before buying alright folks and
that's it for this review here I know
it's a little bit longer than my
previous reviews but definitely thank
you for hanging in there if you can
definitely like the video just to show
you support and definitely if you have
not subscribed to my channel that way
you can see more future alerts to new
products coming out shortly again this
is Jimmy from Jim's review room take
everyone bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
