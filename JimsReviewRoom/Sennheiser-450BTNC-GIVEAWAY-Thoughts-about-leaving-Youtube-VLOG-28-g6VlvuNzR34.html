and welcome back to another one of my
blog fittings vlog number 28 or 29 I'll
put that the correct number that is on
the screen for you guys but really no
update on the office if you guys are new
to the vlogs you haven't seen some of
the recent vlogs I got a new office
space and I've been documenting the up
fit basically remodeling the space for
the next stage of Jim's review room so
today I don't have enough meat to really
show you guys the next vlog out pretty
I'm pretty sure I have more stuff for
you but today I'm doing a Q&amp;amp;A I haven't
done one of these in quite some time for
you I reached out onto my social media
and Facebook Twitter Instagram and asked
you guys to ask me questions any
questions you guys want to be personal
I'm Justin I'm Jimmy level official or
tech related and Jim's review room and I
have not read through most of these
questions so it should be pretty
interesting for me to free flow through
this and see what I answered another
awesome thing that's come down and
channel here I'm very ecstatic about for
the very first time dear Sennheiser and
partnered up with me they did sponsor
this vlog here they want to promote
their brand new active noise-cancelling
headphone these are the Sennheiser 450
BT and C's they're again active noise
canceling wireless headphones that just
hit the market here check them out all
you guys have to do to enter this to
possibly win one of these years is click
an eclaim i'll link down below and
they'll give you directions on basically
how to enter and very simple it just
really essentially tells you to follow
my channel if you haven't already and
basically follow Sennheiser's youtube
channel as well and that's basically it
that is it but again make sure you go
through that link though because it does
keep a record it counts as an entry for
me so it's 7 days from today I'll
basically randomly draw a winner the
computer is going to generate the random
winner for me and whoever that person is
that's outreach happens eventually get
your contact information alright so
getting started here let's go through
the questions alright so I know I'm
going to butcher a lot of these names so
I do apologize in advance a first up
here from Instagram that's Gideon hey
big fan say I want to give away
 my prized Africa yeah of course I
would it's an international giveaway
that fz4 rush again on Instagram which
car do you love and you want to get in

Rico and I do applaud again if I
pronounced it wrong were there times you
ever thought of going back to your
previous job while doing YouTube hell no
no no no not even close jatin zero four
two nine personal question have you
crossed the brick even point at Jim's
review room yes I did being transparent
with you guys after the first year I
barely broke even and of course I've
been compounding in trying to count on
my growth basically next one up here is
BG untamed off of Instagram who said
subtle voice subtle visuals subtle 60
frames per second I love the overall
subtlety you might not remember me Jim
but I've been with you from the time you
had only double-digit likes on your
videos holy cow how many comments
encouraging you and you've replied back
to me thank you so much for your awesome
content do you grow very big now times
have changed and you might not even read
this but if you do he says please give
me a shout out in the next vlog thank
you so much again continue be awesome
BG here you go man thank you very much
for your support
all this time holy cow double-digit life
that's way back in the day again again
again supporters like you supporters
like that who has been on my channel who
would like comment subscribe and all
that stuff
those are people who make this a reality
makes this a possibility there's no
investors there's no big conglomerate or
some big news company overhanging
YouTube in general but just talking
about Jim Sriram but that that this is
this what makes basically YouTube works
if people like you people who support
their favorite creators personalities
online so thank you very much thank you
holy cow that really means a lot and
really when I first started YouTube it
you know money was religiously low of
course I needed to grow the channel but
what fueled me to keep going with comics
exactly like this where they just showed
support they appreciate it
of course I receive the criticism but I
always looked at it as a positive
criticism and try to improve so with
that all that being said again thank you
I went out long enough I do apologize
for that
next up here Michael Maddy says please
reply you'll make my day there you go
dami one nine eight two one seven zero
three says love your reviews what last
hop being used apple or Windows I am a
windows person and I am planning to get
me Dell XPS 15 as the next word laptop
so be able to look up for that we're
still on Instagram actually Pamela says
one is the next giveaways actually this
video here hope you went you never know
only anchor says what are those speakers
in the back is probably referring to
those speakers over there those are my
clips are f82 tubes I had for probably
Wow five six years now actually they're
getting up there I think there's a new
model now the her nano says what did the
challenging thing that you ever faced as
a youtuber challenging would probably
when I first started obviously YouTube
three four years ago was obviously not
biggest today so it was a shot in the
dark
full full time investment and basically
took on that risk of just losing a bunch
of money basically and now today what is
challenging is the medium is changing as
you guys have heard YouTube pay has your
met
we drop down so we're doing you know
things like the sponsorship that you
guys see in this video here that is able
to supplement and help with providing
greater content and there's no different
from what the great out there does like
hardware conducts I know has like NZXT
is a big sponsor of theirs and you know
other various companies lana's tech tips
has a Squarespace and all those other
various companies that really help them
to showcase bigger better awesome things
and do you know experiments that no one
else could possibly do so only you know
would be angle or trajectory where Jim
Sriram is going that's where I want to
get to it basically has an awesome
project and show you guys some awesome
stuff and for me to get that kind of
experience this is getting me out of
that bedroom and like I said we're here
in the office right now so more content
look out look out for that let's jump
ship here that I believe it's mostly
Instagram you guys on Instagram deliver
you guys are have it follow me and
supporting me like crazy really on top
of the comments just sending me feedback
basically they're like said there are
some personal questions on here as well
let's see what they have here have you
had a time in your life when everything
was going against you how did you push
through cutting out all the BS and
pushing out all the people who don't
matter it does narrow a lot of your it
doesn't narrow down your circle of
friends basically and your circle of
people that you associate yourself with
and talk with but you freaking stay
focused and you move and like 100 miles
an hour when I was you know younger and
naive I guess you can say it's focusing
on just some of them stupidest things
basically took up a lot of time but now
I try I try really hard 24/7 is yes I'm
so busy right now but everything that I
do every minute is really either towards
my family my kids obviously for YouTube
learning knowledge I definitely and this
is something eventually what the office
is up is you know being a little bit
more Zen and giving time for myself and
time away from the business
and even time away from yes definitely
spent on family but also just me time I
haven't had that in a walk on long time
just meet taxes by myself aroma and just
drinking soda eating a pizza and playing
you know PC games or something like that
or just going to movies or mountain
biking which I normally do on the
weekends and just being then just being
this positive is to clear up my mind
aerith's
RS underscore peace an Instagram also
that's not my personal account actually
where were you born I was born in
western New York and how did your
upbringing influenced who you are today
I grew up poor as heck so I am still you
know somewhat have this kind of tendency
is to value everything that I have and
not take everything for granted if
anything I compared to the techie there
was really techie guys out there and
there's nothing wrong with it but I am
very practical I try to utilize some
things that I purchased for as long as I
can
the two cars that I've had one car was
about 13 years old and then the next
vehicle that it got I bought it used one
and I invest probably like 13 14 years
old
I did recently buy a new car but I'm
planning to keep that for the next shoot
maybe 13 years 14 years who knows the
last half in front of me that I'm
replacing I bought maybe four or five
years ago the PC that I had when I first
started YouTube was already three to
four years old and I used it for another
year or two so I had that PC for five
years editing on that thing
at the ladder at the end there and then
recently got this new PC or built this
new PC last year
so again just being very practical but
we just grew up poor but even something
simple as you know when I go out to eat
I I tried not to have leftovers to throw
away I just look at people minds that's
just me I just feel so bad because when
I was growing up we were eating ramen
noodles and camp soup because they're
the cans were like a dollar each and
Robin Raymond noodles ramen was however
he pronounced it at the time
10 15 cents 10 cents packet and that's
what would that was what we ate so now
you know I try not to take that for
granted and I try not to throw food away
so I guess I give up tangent here but
that's something that I you know keep to
myself strive to have you know uphold
for myself next one here is by with Jean
how important the gear that you use in
your videos if you look at my old videos
they are they the good ones that is they
still got 40 50 60 thousand views plus
whatever some of them three four five
hundred thousand views you know whatever
it is that was on an old camera now with
old editing techniques it looks nothing
like today you don't have to have
polished highly polished video to get
views if the content that matters and
there's other youtubers that does not do
anywhere close to the cinematics that I
do that are doing very well for
themselves if anything this is taking a
lot more time because I'm doing
cinematics rather than just doing
something a little more simple than the
pans and lighting and all that crap okay
anyways moving out here fuel gum raised
pronoun some user name you're on
Instagram but thank you for writing in
it says what changed in your life when
you decided to make Jim's review of your
full-time job love a channel by the way
thank you sir what changed in my life
really nothing I always wanted to be an
entrepreneur for such a long time it was
me being an entrepreneur I was already
selling candy I would buy candy from the
corner store in New York and then go
into school the next day and sell it
basically try to make a profit in high
school and consider the Fast and Furious
movies just coming out back in a day the
very first facet of favoritest came out
hooking up cars and modding cars is
really big at that time so I went to
Autozone which is a local parts store
chain store and I've bought strobe
lights and random other LED lights at
that time and bought it in cases through
the manager there and then I will go
back on eBay and sell it throughout the
week that I would ship it all one time
at the end of the week and that was my
part-time job did pretty well as a high
schooler and doing an internet business
one of the first ever internet
businesses to exist what for me that is
but yes that's what I did as a Patrick
preneur and then on the other side is
again going back here design art I
majored in communication with a focus at
marketing and advertising so I do like
design and just make you stuff look good
and working and emotion as you guys can
probably see the video in the reviews
that is just evoking some kind of
emotion through my through my thought
basically through my art you can say so
nothing really changed them on that is
just something that always been with me
I always disliked working for big
corporate America even the way for their
four years
but anyways Here I am now and I'm very
very happy
next up here let's jump over to Facebook
and last one here Wilfred says hey why
don't I see cheaper brands like Phillip
products why have it reviewed them
basically thank you more power to your
channel vote for the dark definitely a
good question I know sometimes people
have asked me this I have done budget
reviews last year it's something that I
have cut into waters in and there is
definitely a market out there for budget
reviews there are people who want to see
me review like something like Skullcandy
which cost maybe 30 50 100 bucks versus
the 2 3 400 L headphones and years of
the review in the beginning the first
two years to answer this quickly as
possible I wanted him to review what I
wanted to review which was very nice
high-end stuff or higher end stuff and
it's just something I wanted to review
want to attach a second and this
probably bigger hurdle that was someone
out of my control it was basically with
YouTube being a one-man band handling
everything regarding the channel itself
it was just limited on time and I do
focus so much on the content and testing
it and also the videography side does
both it's heavy on both sides where I
just had a limited amount of time I can
only produce so many reviews
I want to have to focus on doing what
what I like first of all and second was
products that basically generated of
course the most views now with that
being said last year you know I try to
do as much as I can with budget reviews
you guys did like it with the office and
there's one big reasons why I want to do
this office is eventually hiring some
help and then having more hands more
people review a variety of products
rather than just one niche category like
I said Jim's room is for the average
consumer and it doesn't mean just
high-end products it is for everybody
and that's eventually what I want to
expand on which is really important this
year and of course for the years to come
so then it is a good question I'm glad
that I am able to address it for you
guys for those who are unaware but yes I
have done but two reviews more of that
will be coming down the road for later
this year so I think that's it for these
questionable design has gone long enough
here if you have been watching this for
twenty minutes or so and I thank you
again follow me on Facebook Twitter or
Instagram click on that gleam I'll link
and basically enter in and your chance
to win Sennheiser's pair of headphones
again one week from today I'll announce
the winner and is about it alright let
me don't get this video again is low
enough catch you guys on the next one
