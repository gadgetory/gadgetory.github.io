review by Jim's review room so today
we'll be looking at the latest samsung
galaxy tab 3 not a model have here is
the 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi only version that
comes in either gold brown or white as
shown on your screen priced at two
hundred and forty-nine dollars the tab 3
is priced very well considering how many
features a tab 3 has beating most other
tablets in its segment like the g pad
and ipad mini now the tab 3 is also
available in 4G LTE through your chosen
wireless carrier as shown on your screen
so i hope with this review if you're in
the market for a new tablet we'll see if
this one suits your needs so let's go
over its physical features first the
tablet is comfortable comfortable to
hold in either one hand or both with an
8-inch screen some might think the
tablet as a whole is too wide but it
doesn't feel bulky at all and it fits in
my medium-sized hand well the tab 3
comes in at 4.8 eight inches wide 8.2
six inches tall and a crazy a little bit
over a quarter of an inch thick making
this one of the thinnest tablets on the
market today even thinner than the
latest ipad mini with retina that was
just released now with its physical
build this year's model is still all
plastic but no question still has a well
built quality crafted tablet with no
flexing in its chassis although the back
looks very smooth clean and glossy it
doesn't provide much grip and can be
slippery at times so just be aware of
that the layout is nearly identical with
all other Samsung tablets now starting
at the top here we have your
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
input to the right is your power and
volume buttons with an infrared blaster
to control your TV if you choose to set
that up now on the left side of the
tablet is a micro SD card slot to
further expand your memory up to 64 gigs
which is a huge plus since some tablets
don't even offer this and on the bottom
you have your micro USB port for
charging with the supplied USB wall
charger and for my use of testing this
product i left the brightness on at
fifty percent which is indeed bright
enough for most people i would believe
and i was able to achieve about 10 hours
of news that's great considering i was
running
games consistently playing video
multitasking etc and Samson claimed up
to 11 hours of news so it appears on par
and then the two speakers on each side
the speakers are good for music and
movie listening with no distortion when
it turned the volume all the way up now
they're not as good as the kindle fire
HD exes which has the dolby digital
processing and i wish they were a bit
louder but nonetheless these are
definitely good though lastly is the 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera with a 5
megapixel rear-facing camera on the back
now pictures on screen or actual photos
taken right off the galaxy tab 3 with no
photo editing photos are taken at random
in low light outdoors and also close-up
conditions and the pictures came out ok
but nothing really stellar low light and
even in moderate lighting there are
still some noise in the photos all
close-ups looks well and color
saturation what's okay from the camera
itself and you can view the photos right
now on the screen and make judgement for
yourself again the tab 3 I have here is
the 8 inch model and this one comes with
a resolution of 1280 by 800 which
translates to a hundred and eighty nine
pixels per inch that I do have to
mention when it first started testing
the product the screen looked amazing
the tablet does have beautiful color
reproduction skin tones look accurate
colors look warm and not washed out
which is huge in today's tablets and of
course your big screen TVs now with that
being said I'm a bit shocked though that
Samsung decided to go with a lower
resolution screen it's not detrimental
and to emphasize the screen does look
very good though but if you were to
place one of the new tablets side by
side let's say like the Nexus 7 or the
kindle fire HDX or even the ipad mini
the newest one you'll notice that the
tab theories image is not as crisp and
sharp compared to the higher density
pixel tablets you can actually see some
of the jagged edges on text and graphic
logos but again most people won't be
holding a tablet side by side so i think
you'll be fine now going internally with
performance and features the tab 3 comes
with a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor
with
gigs of ram on board and the operating
system right now is Android jellybean
4.2 point2 now for my news the tablet
will run everything that you throw at it
today doing basic tasks such as web
surfing email to youtube and web
chatting those were run with no problems
at all and to be honest if not all
tablets can actually do that today but I
downloaded several free games from the
google play store and all games ran
however they graphically intense games
such as Real Racing 3 which utilizes
three graphics with simulated physics
ran a bit choppy at times now there are
times when the games frame rate would
drop a bit and you didn't see such
smooth gameplay now in doing a benchmark
test did yield a lower score though
compared to all other tablets they are
more recently released and that's pretty
obvious with new technology that keeps
continually coming out so in general the
tablet works perfectly fine today and no
question this tablet should last you
several years for doing the basics as
mentioned earlier but as we're gaming if
you're a gamer there's other tablets out
there that are just cheaper and it works
a little bit better now regarding its
features this is where Samsung really
shines and makes the galaxy product
lineup different from the other tablet
on the market today the most notable is
multi window which enables you to truly
multitask by running two applications on
the screen at the same time a tab on the
left once pressed reviews what apps you
can do this with common ones i
personally news are a web browser up top
and google maps on the bottom for
looking at directions as you can see on
your screen or sometimes for
entertainment you can also watch movies
youtube or netflix etc on the bottom
while doing your web surfing and work on
top a continuing with multitasking i was
able to pull up a video on my samsung
and make that into a small wonder that
plays in the foreground which is a
little bit different from a multi window
nonetheless an excellent feature when it
comes to multitasking and
entertainment so samsung also includes
proprietary hand gestures as seen on the
galaxy s4 smartphone such as doing a
screenshot by sliding your hand across
the screen as I'm doing here so with all
these features it's a very good tablet
all around and I would thinking
multitasking capabilities this is a
start to hopefully future tablets and
companies to follow however once in a
while I would notice an occasional
hiccup or stutter now this would happen
at random times during my news and more
often actually when i'm downloading an
app from the Play Store and then
performing other tasks now the odd part
is during multi window when I would
think the tablet would be under the most
stress the tablet doesn't stutter any
more than when it's not using multi
window it's possibly in the coding from
Samsung and it's it's not a big deal but
I just wanted to point that out there so
overall this samsung galaxy tab 3 is a
very good tablet although it's priced
twenty dollars more than the nexus 7 or
the kindle fire HDX which by the way are
excellent tablets in their own way the
tab threes multitasking capabilities
makes this tablet worth it the form and
function of the tablet is amazing as
it's one of the thinnest maybe the
fittest tablet on the market and beating
even the newest products that have came
out recently battery life is simply
amazing and the color reproduction is
done very well the only downsides I can
think of is the screen resolution
compared to its competitors is a little
bit lower you won't notice it unless you
place a high resolution tablet
side-by-side or look very closely at the
screen the little jitters and stutters
are apparent but it's not enough to kill
the user experience have two hundred
fifty dollars if you're planning on
utilizing the multitasking capabilities
this is a well worth it tablet if you're
not using the multitasking features
there will be cheaper options out there
for you of course so I hope you enjoyed
