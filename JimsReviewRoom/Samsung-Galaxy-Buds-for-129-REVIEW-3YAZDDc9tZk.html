folks so on the surface the Samsung
Galaxy buds feels like it's a no-brainer
with claimed exceptional better life
tuned by AKG for exceptional sound and
the price it's only a hundred and twenty
nine dollars retail but let's see if
it's worth a purchase
I personally paid for these but as
always I'll leave my affiliate links
down in that video description below
click on those links to get the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
I'm Jimmy with jims review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
video hey folks so I literally have over
50 passwords for my personal at the
business down to my entertainment
account and I've been guilty I used to
have the same password for some of those
accounts and some were very easy just so
I can remember all of it
LastPass relieves your mental capacity
so that way you don't have to come up
with something crazy and new every few
months to be secure you don't have to
write it down you have to keep a huge
spreadsheet either like I just do
LastPass stores it and if anything they
store an unlimited amount of passwords
for you one huge convenience factor
LastPass also auto fills your
credentials on sites and also within
your apps for iOS and Android
no more manually typing capital Jay no
more typing in % lowercase I all that
stuff it's secure it's convenient and it
cross syncs across my devices folks
click on my link down in that video
description below for more info I'm
telling you it's something that I
personally use that has been a huge huge
help thanks once again for LastPass for
making this video possible
folks let's get back to that review so
starting off with your physical features
these Samsung Galaxy buds are one of
these smallest if not the smallest truly
wireless earphones that I've tested on
the channel if you're having trouble
with other competitors because they're
so large the Galaxy buds are ultra
lightweight they're very comfortable in
here and that's important they stay in
my ears I know I'm looking crazy right
now doing this here
but as proof they are staying in very
very well aside from
functional they look good too from a
very low profile that they provide
thankfully they don't stick out of my
ears as you guys can see that the
controls are once again touch sensitive
and they work great here you have your
standard pause and play skip and going
back on songs but the touch and hold
option not everything is there and the
previous Samson icon X is a swipe up or
down changes volume but this time you
have to lose a feature or two to have
vine work through touching and holding
now by default either earbud when held
down will activate Google assistant now
after you download their app you'll be
able to customise them left earbud can
be Vaughn down with the front year but
it can be vine up if you choose to but
if you want to use Google assistance
again you have to lose one of those
volume actions there's also the option
to add quick ambient sound in exchange
for one of the previous ever mentioned
settings as well but quick ambient sound
takes three seconds to activate now if I
need to hear flight information someone
yelling at me or if I just simply need a
situation or over awareness right then
in there it's actually faster for me
just to take off the earbud quick
ambient sound simply wasn't fast enough
in a non entitled way not trying to be a
text nap or anything like that if
anything more of a consumer it just
didn't seem practical but regarding
ambient sound for those who are not
familiar it turns out the microphones to
pump in your environmental noises so you
can hear what's going on around you
instead of having passive noise
isolation on at all times but instead of
quick ambient sound which afar is a hold
of the earbud within the app you can
actually turn it on and keep it on right
here you can also control how much to
let in as well with this little meter
within the app now of course you can use
this while listening to music ambient
sound in general from my personal
testing has been really good on the
Galaxy buds it sounds natural without
sounding too
amplified where you can tell sometimes
with other competitors is just louder
than what it really is in person it's
one of the best in my opinion now the
last physical aspect before going into
the internal features a huge fire emoji
for Samsung providing the slimmest
charging case yet it's practically half
the size of some of its competitors
they're also magna
ties to help keep the buds in place and
there's an LED indicator in here which
could have used more lights to indicate
power green simply means it's 60% or
higher and yellow is 30 to 60% life
remaining that's somewhat not too useful
especially when considering the case
only hold enough power for one full
recharge other competitors are offering
at least two or more full recharges but
to be fair it's a trade-off for size
versus performance now on the plus side
at least there's a USB type-c port which
will future-proof your case for some
time here for emojis for that and if you
have the new samsung s10 phone or a Qi
charger you can work let's charge the
case which is pretty cool
it's pretty innovative and new but going
into the features and I'll give you a
quick rundown here battery life is
claimed to be up to 6 hours with the ear
buds itself which is the best that I've
at least tested on the channel with my
testing I'll have that result on the
screen for you now again you get one
more full charge with the case giving
you a total of 12 hours now which makes
the overall better life average to the
competitors now quick charge is
available 15 minutes equals one point 7
hours of playback per Samsung this
performs average to others on the market
as most competitors claimed 10 minutes
on the charger gives them back an hour
if you were to add five minutes to those
competitors then you would roughly have
about an hour and a half returned in
fast charging as well again similar to
samsung bluetooth 5.0 is featured which
is the latest version samsung claims
fast pairing and from my experience as
soon as I take the buds out of the case
it takes four seconds to completely pair
with my existing device it is fast or at
least fast enough for my needs as by the
time I'm turning the earbuds into my
ears to have to fit it's basically done
Perry testing this for distance I did
this once at my apartment and once here
at the studio I was sad since I'm
getting about 30 to 40 linear feet with
a wall or two in the way here in my
apartment it started to crackle there at
the office I got a maximum of 60 linear
feet out into the hallway with a wall in
between again but they blew through the
signal I was expecting something better
for
reference I am using my sensor si plus
which I have here which also has
bluetooth 5.0 but testing this with
video YouTube my Netflix YouTube played
fine but Netflix might have give me a
very very ever so slight delay it's
minut but it is there if you pay close
attention now having a DD syncing issues
between the left and right earbud cross
talking with each other and I've also
confirmed you can leave are there one of
these earbuds in your ear and they'll
still work with some truly wireless
earphones you take off the right earbud
and then nothing comes out on the left
one now as a side note the Samsung icon
X 2018 editions had onboard memory
allowing you to save music right onto
the earphones themselves and giving you
the ability to leave your phone at home
or in the locker from a fare perspective
the Galaxy buds are priced much cheaper
than most other reputable and popular
brands out there seeing a feature that
made the icon X iconic seeing it missing
was really sad for me but again we have
to give it up for the pricing next is
Samsung's microphone performance they're
calling it next-generation adaptive dual
microphone technology indoors in a quiet
room it sounded okay but when outdoors
it sounded like utter crap with my voice
cutting in and out but here here's a
quick sample you guys can be the judge
hey this is a test in a very quiet room
indoors let's see how my voice sounds
maybe when I was outdoors
it was just fighting to pick up that
background noise but Here I am again
inside my studio with really not much
going on so last but not least kind of
shot not many are talking about this but
the Galaxy buds are only IPX to rated
the more expensive options like Jabra
jaybird and even the bose sound sports
have at least a ipx4 rating or higher
with some having as much as a 7 mini
that they can withstand Adam
a splash of water with a I px 2 rating
no splashes and no sprays allowed if
you're wearing this on a commute at work
at home and such it's not a problem but
if you're a sweaty runner or plan on
using these on a possibly rainy day I
would throw some caution the galaxy buds
IPX 2 rating designates you to basically
be able to drop water on this but only
at a maximum of 15 degrees in laymen
terms if you're getting caught in the
rain you might be ok but getting caught
in the rain and you happen to bend over
to pick something up you might be
screwed there I personally think this is
something that any consumer should take
into consideration alright folks let's
jump into the audio performance starting
with bass these are definitely not bassy
at all bass is neutral or flat they're
not even bass boosted then if anything
played very casual bass the positive of
being flat or neutral there's much more
or less of a chance of being muddy or
distorted but if they did tune it right
you can have bass enhance the experience
greatly but for the Galaxy buds others
some will be fine with us or find these
underwhelming depending on your
preference now the mid-range provided
clear vocals and easy to listen to
performance because of very much neutral
bass vocals and instruments were never
recessed or it was never droned out the
mid-range were never bright either were
pushed forward again very neutral from
my experience the high notes are kept
within check and never over reaching
causing listening fatigue either now is
it high resolution is it - led as though
I'm sitting at the front row on at a gig
here not really the galaxy buds felt
more like everyday earphones and it did
an exceptional job there they don't
sound cheap but I feel like it's missing
that sparkle that would make these
earphones stand out a little bit more
compared to the best ones out there and
I know it's not a fair comparison they
are a little bit more expensive but
every other brand is memorable for
something whether it's jaybird for being
loud bright alive and heavily bass
boosted to these Sennheiser momentum
providing ridiculous amounts of quality
and fidelity to the bose sound sports
which has such an impeccable soundstage
that once again
makes it memorable now I'm not saying
again to reiterate Samsung Galaxy bugs
are not bad but the auto signature is
very mellow and for being one of the
cheapest big name-brand truly wireless
earphones out there I can't knock it
really because of its price if something
more memorable is at the 150 to 170
dollar price range and up then so be it
I just want you to understand as a
consumer that just come in with your
expectations for the Galaxy buds now
take it a quick look at the galaxy
wearable app you do get battery life up
top an equalizer in the middle which
does slightly alter the audio signature
but for example turning on bass and
boost barely did anything in the bass
Department the next category is
notifications which is really unique
here you can select which applications
that you want to go off in the earphones
for example if I get a message through
Instagram I'll hear the earbuds simply
say Instagram it's convenient when I'm
away from my phone it's convenient when
someone's calling and it'll alert me on
who is trying to reach me now backing up
we've touched base on ambient sound
earlier but this is possibly one of the
biggest highlights we find my earbuds a
feature the find my earbuds feature is
finally for the first time here I've
seen a company implement this is an
audio beep here's a quick sample once I
press that I could hear these bad boys
go off that's pretty cool now j-bert
also offers a fun my earphone option as
well and it gradually tells you the last
location of the earphones via GPS which
does help tremendously but there's
nothing audible like these ones right
here let me turn off this if Samsung or
even jaybird had both of these features
GPS and the audible sound that would be
amazing so in the end here the Samsung
Galaxy buds overall are good and in bold
for the price is one of the cheapest big
name brand products out there and again
to be fair although they are cheaper
there are some features that is
impressive
like battery life the size of the case
and maybe quick pairing Samsung set the
bar on that but due to its price you
gotta let some things go like stronger
water protection maybe
Bluetooth performance and some sort of
audio signature that's memorable now
even if you have a samsung s10 and
utilize power share you're buying the
audio piece first though if you can
spend about $50 more go job or jaybird
or both just the name of you that has
something unique characteristics that
defines a brand now if your budget
conscious which is totally
understandable
these are good but just know it's not
going to be out of this world regarding
audio so team gyms review room down in
that comment section below let me know
