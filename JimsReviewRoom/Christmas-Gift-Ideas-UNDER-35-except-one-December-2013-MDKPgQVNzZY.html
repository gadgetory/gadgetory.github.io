review room you know if you're watching
this you're probably stumped on what to
get that one person this holiday season
now hopefully my list can help though
and if it does please share this video
on your facebook or twitter account now
this list is in no particular order as
it depends on your preference they are
all products i've personally used and
tested on my youtube channel they are
all performed very good and they're all
popular enough to be an appreciated gift
and most importantly they're all under
$35 except for one item we'll get to
that later so without further ado we'll
get started now number five it's the
hamilton beach breakfast sandwich maker
priced at thirty dollars on sale at
times for twenty four dollars at
amazon.com or target so be on the
lookout now this product has individual
trays that toast your english muffin
mini bagel and croissant and it also
melts your cheese and even cooks a raw
egg now cook time only takes about five
minutes and you just slide this metal
plate and your egg drops right into your
sandwich now lift the remaining
compartments to assemble your sandwich
together and cleanup is very easy for my
test and is dishwasher safe as well it's
perfect for the bachelor or bachelorette
friends a college student will no
question find this awesome or a
co-workers secret santa gift now if
you're on a desktop or laptop computer
right now you can click on this video
right now you can watch my actual review
and now moving on to the next one here
and number four is the chromecast
chromecast is from google and priced at
$35 and it's also sold on amazon com and
Best Buy you can watch your paid
subscriptions like Netflix Hulu Plus and
most recently added HBO Go and of course
Game of Thrones will be returning this
spring so don't miss that though and
YouTube is also available so this device
makes any TV with an HDMI input play
those aforementioned apps you can use
your tablet computer or even cell phone
to control what content you want to
watch now what's really convenient and
let's say for example and this is what
makes the device unique i'm currently
watching something on netflix from my
tablet i can press the cast button any
content starts playing at itv
automatically
it's convenient fast and be rest assured
it's very easy to use this gift is
perfect for those who would like to
watch their streaming services and their
TV instead of a tablet or cell phone
this item is perfect for all ages and
again it's only thirty-five dollars so
be sure to go to facebook.com slash
Jim's review room and like my fan page
for more alerts now on to the next one
here number three it's the perfect multi
gym the company is called perfect and
it's basically a pull-up bar with
multiple or variations on pull ups that
you can do now fitness is always a big
topic especially right after the new
year now this pull-up bar is tested and
better than the popular iron gym which I
personally news at my house as well now
this bar is adjustable to fit most doors
and from my news is more secure this
pull-up bar is reasonably priced at only
thirty dollars you can find it on
amazon.com and some walmarts have this
as well there's no screwing or vaulting
this pull-up bar into your doorframe so
there's no installation damage instance
it's not screwed into the house the pull
up bar easily dismounts for stoning it's
better than the gimmicky ab rollers and
get fit novelty items this item actually
works so it's perfect for most males and
females who always wanted a pull-up bar
for news and to be honest with you most
guys always want one maybe they haven't
had a chance to go out and buy one but
it's nice and convenient to have I know
teenagers love this thing the gift is
not so great for coworkers or in laws of
course but definitely click on this
video right now if you're interested in
watching the full review next up number
two is the magic bullet now this is the
one and only gift on my list that is
higher than $35 its price at 50 and it's
an excellent appliance that's not
overpriced I personally use this for
over a year now making smoothies and
other random drinks almost on a weekly
basis basically never once that I
noticed the motor become weaker or did
it die on me now priced at fifty dollars
blend your drink in that cup then take
it off the magic bullet and drink right
out of it it has a hand on the side and
also includes a lid to have it you look
a little bit more legitimate and besides
smoothies you can beat eggs very quickly
and make omelets on there and it's the
fluffiest how much you'll ever make and
for my test anything liquid
the magic bullet will work perfectly or
great Oh the only downfall though it
doesn't chop food that well and although
the magic bullet claims that it does
again if all you're making this just
drinks this thing is the best bang for
your buck my full review can be found on
youtube com / Jim's review room and then
way you can keep up with my videos
coming out as well and lastly and like I
said there's really no particular order
and significance of each gift this last
one is actually a card game called cards
against humanity priced at $25 and it's
not like any other card game out there
matter of fact most of the advertising
is done by word of mouth because of how
controversial this game is now it's sold
on Amazon or you can get it at cards
against humanity calm now this game is
growing in popularity especially with
young adults or whoever that has a sick
sense of humor but I have personally
played this with groups of all ages and
from what I've seen everyone has enjoyed
the content now as a warning this game
does have crude humor dirty topics and
even a bit racy at times so this game is
in no question not suitable for children
you can stop the video here if you
choose to but if not i'll show you how
to play and it's very easy and i'll show
some of the tame cards instead now every
player is dealt a certain amount of
white cards as their hand now one at a
time a player picks up one black card
and reads it out loud now let's say it's
my turn to pick up a black card mine
says this now after reading it out loud
all other players will choose their best
white card to complete the black card
sentence now once i receive all white
cards i choose one that i think fits the
black card best not either being logical
or a all out in st. answer now typically
it's the latter note read each white
card out loud just to hear other
people's reactions eventually the chosen
white card that person receives a point
the person with the most points
basically wins again there's really
these really are just the same cards
I've shown but they get much more
sadistic you can say again you can go to
their website for more information cards
against humanity calm I can see how much
more in-depth it becomes so I hope you
enjoyed my top 5 list of gifts for
December of 2013 don't forget to share
