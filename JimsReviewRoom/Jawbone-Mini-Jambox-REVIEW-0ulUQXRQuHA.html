review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the Jawbone Jambox mini a
wireless bluetooth speaker that has its
own battery pack inside so you can bring
the speaker anywhere without any of the
wires now the mini although smaller than
the original job on jambox it actually
retails more at a hundred and seventy
nine dollars but after the review of the
original jam box that sound quality was
possibly the worst speaker that i've
reviewed so far so hopefully with this
mini here a sound quality might justify
the price so without further adieu we'll
get started
now the jam box mini lives up to its
name by providing a very small
form-factor measuring only six inches
wide a little bit over two and a quarter
inches tall and less than an inch thick
at a gem box mini itself is made
entirely out of aluminum with rubber on
each side and it's bottom for grip and
stability
now I applied very decent force onto the
front speaker grille and the aluminum
didn't dent nor any structural
compromises occur a very solid build all
around now buttons on the unit are a
rubber-like material in our quality
oriented on tap you have a play and
pause button with varying buttons to the
right on the other side you have your
power button a time that glows red when
charging and white while in use and I'm
always bummed when these devices come
out and they don't have a battery
remaining indicator now below that is
your pairing button with a built-in
microphone for speakerphone
functionality a microUSB port for
charging the jam box mini and although
the speaker will play wirelessly via
bluetooth the unit does provide a 3.5
millimeter port to physically connect
your device to play audio and with all
these connections don't worry as Jawbone
does provide all the wires to connect to
those ports so far with its physical
features I'm really liking the speaker
especially it being so portable and
before I go into the audio test I do
want to mention the battery life as
having a good rating for my review
playing up to 10 hours of audio per
Jawbone's website the only downfall I
have here is it doesn't provide a USB
wall charger it's not detrimental since
more than likely you can use your phone
adapter to charge but having an
additional separate cord would have been
really handy so what I'll do now is to
critique and demo the unit I'll play
several songs and give you my verdict
afterwards so first up is time flies
rendition of Jamie Foxx's alpha
cuz I got it like that oh so smooth like
I got it on tap
yeah and I'm a Sikh it'd be a good night
while I'm on my giggling while I'm
drinking Bud Light huh can you get it
when you miss me like I'm wit whiskey
drinking Jim Beam me baby do you do it
do it that way
do you do that did you take a brain you
know that I'm a beast when I kill it on
the piece like a sex on the beach like
it's not lagoon Jason the California way
we do we get baby she could californica
we on it I stir yeah all the flowers get
it Mike I put it down like this 24/7 and
they had the get in secret leave
it on tonight and you got fixed up to
the nines let me show you what UK
pressed up in black and white and I'm
dressed in the dress you love is
swinging in the air tonight let me show
you
now what in the swing of shame
and there you have it folks
I hope you enjoyed the sample there from
these artists now please visit their
YouTube channels to show your support as
they do heavily rely on YouTube to gain
awareness and other information can be
found in the item description now
getting back on topic here of course
music heard in person is much more clear
in definition so for me recording the
sample from the speaker and then you're
applying the sample and your speakers
now are probably not the best conditions
but hence my review here the audio
quality is better than the original jam
box although the Mini is smaller though
now bass is there but it's only great
for casual listening don't expect a warm
sound or a pounding when you're
listening to mark today's pop techno or
bass heavy hip-hop or rap but that can
be said with most small bluetooth
speakers today now as for the high notes
my entire time testing unit I did leave
it on maximum valium and being a plus
there wasn't any distortion in the audio
quality even on the very high notes
high-pitched sounds wasn't ear ringing
or droning but with that being said the
reason why there isn't any distortion
detected is because the valium isn't as
loud although a maximum at times I would
go over and click the volume up again
eventually finding them already at the
loudest setting the speaker is really
perfect for small and just possibly
medium sized rooms so you don't really
receive that fullness of sound when
you're in a medium-sized room
nonetheless your bathroom bedroom home
office or let's a dorm room this is a
good speaker again for casual listening
the jam box mini had decent range and
what I did is I left the mini on one
side of the house upstairs and walked to
the complete other side of the house
downstairs and about 50% of the time it
did remain connected the other 50% sound
would start to cut out when I'm halfway
through the house on the lower level
either or it's decent for going through
several walls and the first floor
ceiling at times and lastly one of the
features the mini has like its other
models it's offering a speakerphone
functionality now making a test call
perform like any other speakerphone the
person on the other end said that they
can tell that I was on a speakerphone
and was able to pick up some of the
background noise as well and the voice
that I heard on my end was clear and
again set it like your typical
speakerphone not bad but nothing stellar
to mention but it is a nice function or
feature to have though so as a summary
and going into my pros and cons if
you're not an audio file or as
scrutinising as I am an antenna I'm
using this for casual listening for
yourself the sound quality is good the
size of this thing is amazing and it's a
real pleasure carrying this around and
for the price it is cheaper than some of
the competitors but if you do want a bit
more warmth depth a little bit more bass
consider the Bose Soundlink mini for
$199 retail now the jam box mini is also
a bit low on value when it comes to
filling up a room the only thing that
this thing is missing is a USB wall
charger not detrimental but would have
been nice to have so overall with its
good battery life good sound quality
Portability and speakerphone option if
you choose to use the job on jam box
mini is definitely a good choice so I
hope this review helped you in some way
