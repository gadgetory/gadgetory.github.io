Ultimate Ears or what many people call
Yui has recently made available the Yui
roll to now unfortunately we don't have
the redesigned mega boom just yet I'll
keep you guys updated now jumping right
into this review these second generation
comes in at the same retail price off
last year's model at $99 and as always
I'll place my amazon links in the video
description below if you're watching
this video later in the year prices
could fluctuate my links will give you
the most updated prices so without
further adieu my channels here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to gems review going over the
physical features it is identical to
last year's model it's literally the
same thing the size is the same with
fitting in one's palm and it's still
super lightweight coming in at 330 grams
or about three-quarters of a pound now
if you're looking for a slim profile
something light for portability the roll
is perfect in that sense and I guess
with Yui if it's not broken why fix it
now you includes a very simple design
with volume up and down with buttons
being slightly improved over the last
years though being a bit more sensitive
and tactile I'm pressing both buttons at
the same time gives you your battery
life which is highly convenient 60%
charge more I'm a battery test a little
bit later now rotating through the rear
a bungee cord is offered so you can hang
this in a shower or wrap this around a
pole if you ever need to power on an
office also in the rear with the
bluetooth pairing button below moving
all the way down lifting up the cap
offers a two and a half millimeter input
for physical connections at a microUSB
port for charging the roll - since we're
touching on better life here the roll -
still takes a crazy five and a half
hours to recharge from a dead battery
which is quite long compared to the
competition and better life stays the
same as last years with up to nine hours
of use for my testing leaving this on at
50% bottom until the unit died just like
get a medium result here very similar
results again with last year's model I
was able to achieve 10 hours and 50
five minutes to be exact now looking at
other small portable Bluetooth speakers
the roll is up there with a competition
except for the fugu of course that
thing's a freak of nature but one of the
biggest selling points of the roll -
this thing is built like a tank though
it's ipx7 certified meaning you can
submerge this in water up to one meter
or basically three point three feet of
depth for up to thirty minutes
not only that the rugged melon bread
shell encasing is stain resistant and
tossing this into mud spreading it down
the speaker isn't stained and a speaker
keeps going with no issues now the one
and only feature that I would think
should be on every ipx7 certified
Bluetooth speaker the roll -
unfortunately doesn't float it actually
sinks if you ever drop this into the
lake but Julie does include this little
flotation device here in the package and
great for the pool but again if you're
at the lake this thing might be a goner
so just a heads up on that now other
features of roll 2 includes comparing
with last year's model the only thing
that I can find that is an improvement
is the Bluetooth range it has increased
from up to 65 feet or basically 20
meters and it's now been increased to up
to a hundred feet or thirty meters worth
of range now my testing I was able to
get about 75 to 80 linear feet until the
signal started to die and last year
youie offers an app available for both
Apple and Android devices you can double
up and have two of these speakers going
on at the same time which does help
tremendously an equaliser makes a return
which works okay and there's an alarm
feature to wake you up in the morning so
very simple here very rugged speaker all
around but let's test the audio quality
I'm sure you guys have been waiting for
that here's my sound test I play several
songs and I'll give you my verdict
afterwards
shadows something
yeah
and there you have it folks now sound of
course recorded on my end and then play
through your speakers are not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence my
review here now the speaker sounds very
familiar with the role one when
comparing this to the JBL flip three
fugu and these small and portable Sony
speakers the roll has the least amount
of bass but there's not enough authority
to make music as immersive or as
enjoyable from my experience when you do
compare this with the aforementioned
letting mid-range however at moderate
volume does well with great vocals it's
clean crisp you can say and the high
notes isn't screeching and high-pitched
now when you do blast us at maximum
volume though for entertaining outdoors
let's say be very high it gets a little
jumbled so you do lose a slight bit of
clarity now there isn't any audio
separation or a soundstage but how loud
this can get though for a small speaker
it's still great for general use and
general family entertaining
from my experience the biggest selling
point though is how rugged this thing is
how slim and how portable it can be the
attached bungee cord does help with
attaching this to let's say your bike
your boat or some sort of pole or even
hang this in your shower if you already
own the original roll there's absolutely
no reason to upgrade since nearly
everything is identical if you're not
needing a super rugged speaker but
looking for something that may have
better audio quality the JBL flip 3 can
be had for the same price so looking out
for you guys here I hope this review
