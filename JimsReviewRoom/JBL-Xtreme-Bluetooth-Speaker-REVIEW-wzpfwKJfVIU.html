room many of you guys overseas have been
asking me about this speaker for several
months now and have had my eyes on it
since this speaker has yet to be
available in America until recently and
I'm pleased to test this and see how it
even stacks up with what I think is the
best of the Bluetooth speakers on the
market the Bose Soundlink 3 and if you
guys look at the information in the
video the JBL extreme looks to compete
with many of the heavyweights in the
Bluetooth speaker market as always you
can check updated pricing in the video
description below I put a link in there
for your convenience
but getting straight into this without
further ado up here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
Jim's
review room
as always going over the physical
features first this is a very decent
size 9 inches wide 5 inches tall in 4.8
inches deep all while weighing in at 4
point 7 pounds making this slightly
bigger and just slightly heavier than
the other two heavy weights the UE mega
boom and the Bose Soundlink 3
now although bigger and heavier it's
still mobile just not as easy in
someone's bag JBL does include a simple
carrying strap attach this to both sides
of the speaker for over the shoulder
carrying but being big and heavy isn't
such a negative trait if you're looking
for big sound you can see this on either
side with the massive here base
radiators when music is being pushed but
before getting it to sound the top
features your very sturdy very tactile
bluetooth pairing button volume down
power on and off and to the right is
what they call the JBL connect feature
you can change other newer JBL speakers
like another extreme the flip 3 or the
soon-to-be-released pulse 2 and have
those basically play at the same time
from this same source
offering more room filling music or have
music in different parts of the house
volume up is to follow with less the
pause and play button now rest assured
here everything on the extreme is rock
solid from my testing no flexing metal
frames seams are tightly assembled and
materials all around looks top-notch but
besides being built tough it's also rain
and splash proof with a very rugged and
tough nylon braided like exterior you
just can't submerge this underwater so
no dropping this into the lake or into
the pool either intentionally or
accidentally unlike the UE mega boom I
tested a few months back that however
can be immersed into water up to one
meter for up to 30 minutes of course the
Bose Soundlink 3 can't get one at all
now I'm going to the bottom of the
extreme just enough white rubber feet
are provided to prevent the speaker from
shaking off the table and behind this
orange zipper here or all of your
physical connections now I do have to
admit this is a bit tight to the very
first time trying to connect the wires
but after the second or third time and
then realizing pressing the upper flap
was actually key to the left is a
microUSB port for servicing only I tried
charging this with a USB cable that
didn't work a 3 and 1/2 millimeter input
to USB ports to charge two devices
simultaneously such as your smart phone
and/or
tablets just to keep the music going and
playing and less to the right is the
power ports for the supplied wall
charger indeed this has a large charging
brick for a Bluetooth speaker but inside
is a mass of 10,000 milliamp battery the
extreme claims it can be powered for up
to 15 hours and with my personal testing
the same test that I do on all my
Bluetooth speakers leaving this playing
at 50% volume as a middle-of-the-road
standardized test the extreme lasted me
a crazy 18 hours and 16 minutes to be
precise soo until it basically shut off
on me and when compared to the UE mega
boom although it's claimed to have 20
hours my same test yielded 17 hours and
30 minutes of on time regardless both of
these speakers does ridiculously well in
battery performance compared to what's
out there now in regards to recharging
JBL claims three-and-a-half hours I was
able to achieve from a dead battery to
full in 3 hours and 20 minutes as shown
in the video so that's everything
physical wise about the extreme here I
do admit it is missing NFC or near field
communication for easy pairing a feature
that I think is really underrated but
highly convenient for Android users now
one last thing before doing the sound
test there is a built-in speakerphone
option JBL claims to offer noise and
echo canceling technology but let's do a
real test here here's a sample hello
it's me hey what's up a guy another
speaker I want you to test the
speakerphone on so how do I stop what do
you think I sound a little bit muffled
but you're verbally clear at least what
a muffled answer about maybe three feet
away from the speakerphone right now let
me step back a little bit maybe that
made them row too close you never know
what I'm about maybe five six feet I
succeed away from the speaker how do I
sound right now ice I'm a little bit
echo a like your voice is kind of e
throwing off the walls in the room
possibly oh no really
yeah I mean you're understandable but it
just sounds a little bit echo ease okay
alright then well that's it for the test
real quick thank you very much free time
alright no problem bye bye bye
and now to the moment that you've been
waiting for I'll play several songs and
we'll be switching back and forth from
time to time of different speakers and
afterwards I'll give you my verdict baby
baby Tony who's got you feeling dizzy
blame it on blame it on yeah cuz I got
it like it go so smooth like I got it on
tap yeah and I'm a sick it'd be a good
night while I'm on my Qinglin while I'm
drinking Bud Light ah can you get it
when you miss me like I'm with whiskey
drinking Jim Beam yeah baby do you do it
do it that way do you do that
did you take a brain you know that I'm a
beast when I kill it on the beach like a
sex on the beach it's like it's Malibu
Jersey City California way we do
business in California Kayla Brianna I
stuck yeah all the flowers get it my
turn I put it down like this 24/7 and
here's the minute sequence ever man
it on
dizzi
syncopate my skin to your heart beating
is one good for you good
let me show you how proud I am to be
yours leave this dress a mess on the
floor
for you good for you i'm a marquise
diamond i'm a marquise diamond could
even make that tiffany july's say give
it to you hard so bad so bad make you
never gonna leave don't wear that dress
you like skin side and there you have it
folks of course music recorded on my end
then played through your speakers are
not the best depiction of audio quality
hence my review here now to get this one
out the way the ue mega boom a very good
speaker by itself but when compared to
the other two does sound the weakest of
them all lacking in most sound
characteristics that i'm about to
discuss the extreme hands-down provided
the most fulfilling sound richer deeper
bass than these selling three and most
other speakers on the market but with
its combination of ford and clear mids
the extreme provides more immersion into
each song and each movie that i've
tested now don't get me wrong the both
selling three is still a very well-done
speaker but there is an enough
noticeable difference when you compare
the two in person the selling three
sounds a bit more recessed kind of like
a glass ceiling if i can give you an
illustration it reaches a certain
limitation the one and only area where
they notice a slight downfall on the
extreme and it's a very faint and very
Manute I can hear the Bose Soundlink
three providing a slightly better open
soundstage you can hear in songs and
more so in movies where sound is coming
from more specifically from the front to
back an example when the chorus is heard
in the back while the main vocalist is
singing in the forefront or in movies
when you hear shooting and explosions in
the distance this can be experienced
more so on these sounding three but
again the extreme pushes everything else
and gives you a direct feel and
experience with the audio I personally
did not experience any distortion either
in bass or any kind of tennis in the
high notes as well the sound signature I
see as being very much fitting for all
genres from rap hip-hop pop EDM music
and down to classic rock and I can say
the extreme fills up large open areas
the best of the three here so I hope
that helped you
in some way if you did enjoy my work be
sure to add me on Instagram Facebook or
Twitter and if you're watching the video
