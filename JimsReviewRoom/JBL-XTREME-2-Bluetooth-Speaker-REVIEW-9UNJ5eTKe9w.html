shirt in every one of my videos well
that's not the same shirt just like the
speaker that I have here today this is
the extreme two and it looks very
similar to the extreme one that are
reviewed three years back holy cow
but are there changes better yet are
there improvements we'll find out as
always being transparent JBL did send us
over for review but my assessment was
not altered in any way I'll go over both
pros and cons extreme to it is kind of
pricey here this is the first con I
guess you can say at $299 retail at the
time this video but click on my links
down in that video description below
click on those links for the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
I'm Jimmy with jims rooby-roo and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone all right
folks getting started here although this
has a pretty good amount of weight and
size compared to its main competitor
these sony xba-40 one that supplied
carrying strap tremendously helps offset
the weight and how large this thing is
now based on the size it could have been
better audio we just have to wait and
see in the audio test a little bit later
but aesthetically I love the subtle
changes or refreshes some of the
translucent pieces here and there with
subtle amount of branding and if you
look at the older model you can see how
the new extreme - looks more like a
blimp and it did before it's just
slightly a little bit bigger now the
same durable fabric grill like most
mainstream outdoor speakers makes a
return and with my testing of dunking
this into water it's still ipx7
certified and yes it still does float
awesome plus there now we have the
famous passive bass Raiders that moves
during music keep in mind for those who
are new this doesn't push out audio
matter of fact although this is in case
in that fabric even on the rear here
there is no audio coming out this way
it's just front directional audio look
at the very top buttons are identical
with all the other JBL speakers with
easily identifiable raised buttons
there's bluetooth pairing volume up and
down or of their of course similar to
Sony or Sony is similar to JBL but
there's this feature called JBL connect
plus
allows you to pair to JBL speakers
together to achieve stereo sound this
always worked well for me or compared
over a hundred JBL kinect speakers
together and have them all play at the
same time the function works quick and
efficient and they've always been easier
to pair than my sony XP speakers now
over to the very far right right here
you can use the play button to only skip
a song you alley can't go back with a
triple press which is common among other
brands now the same button can be
changed to your voice assistance such as
a google assistant or siri but oddly you
lose the pause play feature which
doesn't make much sense to me on the
other hand the voice assistant does work
but you do have to walk up to the
speaker to press it to ask it a question
you can't stand from like 10 feet away
and ask hey what's 53 plus 16 you know
those kind of questions now moving on to
the back side onto this cat
water-resistant flap you simply have a
3.5 millimeter port for physical
connections a reduction to only one USB
charge out port and last is simply the
AC power cord connection the extremes
who can only be charged with this wall
cord which was my gripe back in the day
then not to say Sony is better or at
least I don't want to set that tone but
Sony did introduce the second option of
charging this speaker with a micro USB
cord it's the perfect alternative well
you don't want to lug that big cord that
was supplied by JBL and instead use your
friends like phone charger or such now
the topics of battery life this is rated
at just 15 hours of playback which is
somewhat on the low end but over the
years testing the JBL flip speaker the
JBL charged speakers JBL for the most
part for or have been very conservative
about what they claim which is great
which is what I like with the extreme
two I got a full 25 hours in 36 minutes
until the speaker died
the older extreme at 50% fine back in a
day whoops he also claimed 15 hours but
three years ago I achieved 18 hours in
16 minutes with my test to recharge this
thing it took 2 hours and 42 minutes
from dead to full now Bluetooth
connection was perfectly fine again
we're still not yet at Bluetooth 5.0 but
I have always stated Bluetooth 4.2 is
still great for average consumers I got
a total length of 80 linear feet here at
the office before T signal
to cut out now the last feature is the
speakerphone option giving this a quick
go around here I confirm the speaker
works best within just three feet though
any further the person I tested this
with said they can hear an echo right
away and five feet and further there's
just a bigger echo on my voice and I
sounded of course a bit further speak
from wise it's usable obviously but
clearly I sounded like I was on a
speakerphone in a bathroom just let it
echo a lot of hollowness in general so
that's really about it for the extreme
to no frills no gimmicks just straight
to the point really good visible quality
speaker so let's see how this does in
the audio test please put on your
headphones or earphones as I'll be using
my binaural microphones and before I let
you go be sure to follow me on social
media at Jimmy little official or Jim's
review room and Instagram and Facebook
here we go
to my friends like cash else I just
wanted me to lose you and I was like -
on the phone I'm percent wouldn't butter
he would understand and I just never
fall out I just wanna win I'm in it for
the long run and do this on my fam
calling number digits in my mother all
line up speed like a rod someone falling
and I'm a whip our backpacks going hard
in the yeah I still fall in the pitch
yeah something wrong with the picture
alright folks welcome back I'm shocked
since other brands have tweaked their
audio over the years and then me
revisiting the extreme and the extreme -
it's crazy how this sounds better than
the competition not to get this out the
way if you have the old extreme I would
not recommend to upgrade it they sound
practically the same the extreme - just
ever so slightly sounds a little bit
clearer maybe a little bit more refined
but it's very very minimal comparing to
the competition
JBL sounds it's so much more refined
though the base hits and doesn't distort
or drill it doesn't muddle that
mid-range base is punchy stronger than
the UE speakers and cleaner than these
sony xba-40 one it gets you into the
music without sacrificing other
frequency bands now if you like bass
just know you're not getting deep sub
bass like some of these standing
portable speakers from like Sonos or the
ionic studio speakers from harman kardon
but if your priority is portability
xtreme 2 has the best amount of bass to
quality ratio if that makes sense here
but the vocals are bright and forward
with that person in love it's clear
distinct in-your-face at times but
without being harsh or overdone this is
good for entertaining since it's not
just about bass but you want your vocals
to stand out you can also hear some
depth with the extreme - as there's some
sense of audio being in the forefront
and an audio a little bit more rearward
of that the soundstage isn't impeccable
like most polluted speakers but compared
to others
a single dimensional experience actually
does a little bit better as for the high
notes for a Bluetooth speaker the audio
has just enough clarity
not too much roll-off is there but it
surely doesn't hit a high-pitched
screech or it doesn't ring my ears I
personally didn't have any kind of
listening fatigue over time of me
testing so overall this speaker doesn't
have a lot of that buzz or extra cool
stuff that other speakers have there's
no LEDs it's no extra bass button
there's no sound profiles and the fact
that other brands have gone down and
priced at $200 or less one can say that
this $300 retail price tag might be a
bit high my viewpoint if you want the
best audio no frills no gimmicks again
you just want great sounding audio in
this particular size though this big
volume loudspeaker I think it's worth it
I like the Sony XP 41 for its bass but
for the past month or so of testing and
even casual use extrema - has been more
of my most well rounded speakers I
should go to this more often now again
click on my links for the most updated
prices they might have dropped since its
release so that's about it folks find me
on my personal Instagram or Facebook
pages at Jimmy lone official or if you
want to follow just the techie stuff
follow me at Jim's review room you guys
take care I'll catch you guys on the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
