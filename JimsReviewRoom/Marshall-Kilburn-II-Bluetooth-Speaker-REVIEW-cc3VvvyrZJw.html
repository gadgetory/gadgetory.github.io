I've reviewed a Marshall speaker if you
don't know of them if you look back at
some old photos of concerts some
concerts today you probably see their
amplifiers in the background it's a very
iconic look and for years Marshall makes
their consumer and at-home speakers in
that same design it's pretty sick this
is a kill burn to the newest portable
Bluetooth speaker from Marshall coming
in at 299 dollars as always being
transparent Marshall did send us over
for a review however my assessment was
not altered in any way I'll go over both
pros and cons as always my affiliate
links are down in that video description
below click on those for the most
updated prices
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review the physical features first this
thing is quite portable the Coburn 2
features a guitar care and inspired
strap made of what feels to be leather
and lying with this red felt the lower
feeling material on the inside it's a
nice touch the front features a pretty
strong girl that resembles a classic
microphone of course with that iconic
Marshall branding the entire enclosure
is wrapped in vinyl with a leather like
texture if you run your nail against it
you'll notice it's not solid plastic
pretty cool the top features a bluetooth
pairing button the NAB's are practically
identical to the amps they offer they
have a lot of resistance with a lot of
good feedback when turning the dials
volume bass and treble or up top the
only thing I don't want to say
necessarily is a negative since Marshall
sticks with more of a classic design but
I do miss the ability to skip and go
back on songs that's common on many
other Bluetooth speakers today but to be
fair who offers these awesome knobs here
for you to adjust on the fly now on the
far right I've always give good praise
for any brand that offers this it's
their battery level indicator glowing in
red that lasted Coburn to is meant to be
their most durable portable bluetooth
speaker in their lineup from my testing
the speaker is usable for
upto moderates outdoor use they have
endcaps of course on either end here on
all four ends that is and the speaker
itself is water-resistant with an IP x2
rating the speaker is not meant for the
pool though but with the IP x2 rating it
means that it's fine against dripping
water with my testing especially around
the knobs in this recessed area right
here this speaker still works fine today
although I do wish for a stronger
water-resistant rating I can see this
being enough to withstand entertaining
your friend at the backyard barbecue
camping those kind of outdoor activities
now speaking of entertaining rotating
this to the back the Coburn 2 does offer
multi-directional audio as there's a
Twitter and a bass port in the back here
placing this in the middle of the table
doesn't matter where you are you're
going to hear some form of music but
more my audio test a little bit later on
the bottom left is an axillary port for
your 3.5 millimeter connections and on
the bottom right under this
water-resistant flap is your power plug
ports now I gotta say every speaker that
I reviewed around the 250 to 300 dollar
prices every large bluetooth speaker
usually comes with a pretty big power
brick
woody Kilburn - it just comes with a
simple cord for connection something
small but it is convenient though for
transports as we're better life this has
quick charging 20 minutes it gives you 3
hours of playback recharging this from a
dead battery to full I'd take me 2 hours
and 34 minutes and doing my battery test
of playing this at 50% volume and having
the base of the treble up top here at
50% as well for the middle-of-the-road
result I got 14 hours and 19 minutes the
marshal claimed the Coburn's who can
achieve 20 hours of playback well this
is average among the industry and
average footing category of large
Bluetooth speakers now the last test I
did was being bluetooth connection the
kilburn 2 features Bluetooth 5.0 which
is awesome this is the latest Bluetooth
technology as of this video while some
competitors are at least so sticking
with Bluetooth 4 points you testing this
with my Samsung si+ and the iPhone 10 I
was able to get me maximum length on my
office building right here of a hundred
and twenty feet of distance it's the
best performing Bluetooth speaker for a
distance that I've tested so far and
this speaker can connect up to two
devices
at the same time on that that's really
about it for the speaker very
straightforward not intended to be super
techie and there's no app there's no RGB
lights that doesn't pair with other
Marshall speakers for stereo sound what
Marshall does in my interpretation is
sticking true to its luck its heritage
and if I can't I if I can tie it all
together basically this really feels
timeless now up next please put on your
headphones or earphones as I'll be using
my binder all microphones for the audio
test and folks be sure to line up that
comment section down below with fire
emojis as always I appreciate everything
you guys do to help me up alright folks
here we go alright folks put on your
headphones or earphones and get ready
only you could see
just
all right first up this speaker is loud
enough for small to medium sized rooms
for large areas this figure tends to
struggle a bit with providing room
filling music I can put this up to
maximum volume both on my phone and the
speaker and it's still comfortable but
I'm not really jamming out or feel like
it's hitting hard as I would have hoped
in those large open areas now with that
being said if you remember this has
multi-directional
audio so there's again that little
speaker on the rear with its base port
it does output audio and it does help if
anyone is walking back here basically
but the front firing speakers are
stronger of course and in contrast the
rears don't provide that same experience
unfortunately you do get some audio but
it's not the same immersion as of course
standing in front of it at the end of
the day it's better than nothing but
what is to follow my back up for it the
audio in general testing this over and
over again
hands down the Kilburn's who has some of
the best quality out there for a
Bluetooth speaker there's clarity
adalian frequency separation but first
let's talk about bass this sounds
obvious I know but I want to emphasize
the foundation the stack settings the
heart of the speaker before any
adjustments there's a lot of quality in
its signature with nothing too extreme
on one end or the other and tweaking it
with the tune abs up top you have a much
better chance of having it sound the way
that you want to without affecting other
parts of the audio spectrum now
adjusting bass with the knob hits
practically every nail in the head if
you feel it's too busy turning it down
and you have a flatter sound signature
turning this up to 3/4 of the way which
is what I person lights gave me a bass
boosted audio signature without muffling
the vocals turning it to maximum will do
that though but then some people prefer
the bass over a strong mid-range either
or
I left mine being punchy it's non
distorting it's not deep sub bass either
but there's enough for a good experience
across all genres of music now for the
mid-range it's very clear quite
surprising as not many Bluetooth
speakers hit this you could hear little
details nuances and breaths from the
vocalist quite clearly actually I placed
the mid-range around 50% and
to be a little forward and a little
bright for me this makes the majority of
the audio heard by the human ear pretty
distinct now for a Bluetooth speaker
there's a bit of depth heard from front
to back separating instruments from
others and the audio never sounded boxy
or enclosed again you can control the
amount that you want neutral to vary for
dim bright is an option as well so you
have a variety it's also no adjustments
but the adjustments goes a long way now
the high notes experience was mutual to
me it wasn't underwhelming but it was
never sharpen every ear piercing I wish
I had a little bit more sparkle up top
there if anything it's pretty mellow
with some roll-off then with everything
discussed this is a well balanced
speaker with the ability of tuning it to
make it fit your listening preference
with quality from the get-go that's
where this speaker shines the audio
performance is well the best out there
hands-down no question about it the only
thing though I just wish it was just a
little bit louder so last but not least
I did test this with video on both again
my iPhone and my Samsung phone I didn't
have any syncing issues across YouTube
twitch and Netflix so overall do I
recommend this no question yes I think
being aware of the heritage from
Marshall over two decades remaining time
fists here to the quality of
craftsmanship to the quality of audio
output this is surely a speaker worth
looking into no gimmicks just some damn
good audio alright folks find me on
Facebook and Instagram
