review room now Garman earlier this year
made the Garmin vivofit a lightweight
very simple activity band that does well
in reporting your activity well with
garment now second activity band the
garmin vivosmart that is priced at $169
retail at the time this video that
brings in new features and also a new
design so we'll go into its physical
build and comfort and then it's a pin
detail to see if this bin might be for
you so without further ado welcome to
another review
although the vivosmart weight is similar
to other bands at 19 grams which is
light it's actually one of the most
comfortable bands I've worn to date it's
because of this very smooth silicone
finish refraining from using any
textures and the addition of using
notches to fit your wrist perfectly and
just something to be aware about I have
about medium sized wrists and the only
sizes are available are small and large
now I did buy the small though and you
can see I'm nearly on the very last
notch here again take into consideration
when buying you might have to jump up to
the large now on the budget-friendly
view fit a small handful of consumers
didn't mention at times the band would
unsnap so the view of smart actually
does address this by offering what they
dubbed the vivo keeper preventing the
band from becoming undone but using the
band I have yet to have the band unsnap
on me without the view of a keeper but
the device is still fairly new so take
that with a grain of salt
overall it's very subtle but I still
think it's fashionable the silicon has
been very durable and showed no signs of
wear and to stress again this is very
comfortable from everyday use to working
out and running now it's also water
resistant up to 50 meters per garments
website allowing you to do some light
water activities without worrying about
any issues now moving on to the screen
here the vivosmart doesn't have any
physical buttons but it's touch
activated tap twice and this turns on
the OLED screen now touch screens are
hit or miss on some activity bands but
you can see turning it on it's not as
fluid or responsive at times however and
a big however
once it's on scrolling either left or
right my experience and testing showed
it to be very responsive even lightly
swiping yielded perfect results and this
could be intentional by Garmin to
prevent accidentally bumping the band
during the day and especially of course
when you're wearing this at night
sleeping now starting on the very first
bit of information here not only use
your time displayed but the band
distinguishes the particular weekday or
weekend and the numeric day now
scrolling to the right reveals messages
and notifications in the band of course
pairs and syncs with your tablet or
smartphone both on Apple and Android
powered devices and whenever you receive
a notification on your device it
vibrates and shows a band as well next
up our controls to control your media
the next is your distance measured
through your steps calories burned and
the next section I wanted to discuss is
the move bar identical to the vivofit
this screen over time shows you how long
you've been consecutively inactive for
now the first bar once filled will blink
in the band will vibrate indicating one
hour of not really moving around
reminding you to get up and move now the
following bars will blink and indicate
every 15 minutes of an activity after
that again this is a great feature and a
great reminder to keep moving now next
are your smart goals
now after you setup your app with your
age weight etc garment sets a goal for
you over time Garmin learns you're
walking habits basically how many steps
you actually take throughout the day and
adjust your goal on a daily basis
now the last bit of info is the total
steps taken which is self-explanatory
and then now holding down the band for
two seconds reveals additional features
which goes a bit beyond the standard
measurements mentioned above when
compared to other manufacturers or bands
now there's a stopwatch feature right in
the band itself with the band estimating
your running distance now backing out
here the crescent moon is to activate
sleep mode right before you sleep which
measures your movement throughout the
night and I'll show that in the app
shortcut in the brightest settings and
direct sunlight it's still quite
difficult to see now I'm going over to
the next page here privacy settings for
notifications is the triangle with the
exclamation
point and then to the right of that is a
nifty feature as well
have you ever misplaced your phone or
tablet you're connected to to find it
press that middle icon and it will cause
your phone or tablet to beep loudly for
you to find in the house now the band
itself also has a strength meter
indicating you're getting warmer to your
loss device and last are the arrows
indicating to sync your band's
information and the very last menu of
items here are really self-explanatory
with toggling your Bluetooth on or off
next is changing the time on your band
and be very less indicates what version
of the band you're using with the
battery level now the moment you've been
waiting for
going through the Garmin Connect app
it's the same exact app that the Garmin
vivofit uses now starting with the home
page all the menu blocks or windows are
movable so if your screen looks a little
bit different than mine that's exactly
why but I personally have my
notifications on top with these step
indicator next you can see on your
screen reviews the amount of steps so
far taken your distance calories burn
and your auto goal set by Garmin now if
you click on details this breaks down
with a nice bar graph revealing when you
were the most and least active and you
can pause the video just to get a
glimpse of my days here now backing out
here and moving to the next window is
the calories burned and what's great
about the Garmin app here it syncs with
a very popular MyFitnessPal app and you
can log in your food intake measuring
calories now it's a great way not only
for the band to do work and just
calories burn but if you use My Fitness
Pal it's also very important to lock in
your consumption too and both apps work
with each other now backing out once
again here next are activities you can
by Garmin's heart rate monitor with this
band for a total of two hundred dollars
as a package and you can log in your
workouts heart rate which I always say
if a band room manufacturer offers a
heart rate recording feature by the
heart rate monitor now it's much more
accurate and during your workout it
really does help you by indicating when
your heart rate drops when you're
actually trying to keep up a certain
level and if you already have a heart
rate monitor or can get one cheaper just
purchase one or news one that's using a
mt+
technology which should be compatible
with this band now returning to the home
page here a quick glance at your recent
sleep is shown
clicking on details will give you a bit
better indication on what kind of sleep
you're actually getting with the
fluctuations indicating the amount of
movement recorded throughout the night a
good way to see if you're getting good
rest now backing out to the main
homepage again you have badges basically
achievement icons for reaching certain
milestones in regards to steps that's
pretty self-explanatory but the
following is very intriguing segments
allows you to pull up on the map of
other individuals we have ran that same
trail and it indicates their best times
showing their total time distance and
their speed per mile to measure pace now
if you're a runner this is a great tool
to see where you stand against others
right in your own area or part of town
and that's it basically essentially my
homepage and the most predominant
features I think people are likely
interested in or to news now if you
click on edit you can remove your
established windows but if you want to
add other informational windows tap that
plus sign right there and you have some
other windows which I personally didn't
use workouts and courses allows you to
create your own courses in your area and
workouts customized by you through the
Garmin Connect website and PRS and your
weight is manually inputted at your
discretion now other than the home page
if you click on the menu button here on
the top left you can try to make friends
and compare and challenge them through
community with the ability to look up
random people and send them friend
requests hopefully your friends your
personal friends that is or other family
members have government products too and
you can see their info here as well it's
a great way to see who's on top of the
leaderboards and it motivates you to do
better in another way now going back to
the menu here devices are shown which is
self-explanatory
and last is live track which is
basically sharing your activity on to
social media sites like Facebook or
Twitter so the entire time of using the
device in Garmin claims about seven days
of battery life and considering how many
notifications I received which is a lot
I mean using this device pretty
extensively I can confirm that the
battery lasted six days in almost twelve
hours not bad at all
the vivofit will last the whole year
though but the view fit does use a
different technology overall now the
charging cradle at first looked bulky
and odd considering no other band really
as this design it's usually just a
plug-and-play basically using a micro
USB cord and then you're done but with
this cradle after a while and only using
it once every 6 to 7 days it wasn't a
big deal and was fine to use to be
honest with you and if you're interested
in there's many other activity bands
that reviewed at my channel at Jim's
review room if you want to compare
features and also my experience so I
personally have been very happy with as
vivosmart
having the ability to pair this with the
heartrate monitor the very comfortable
band and the many other features this
thing has I really believe it really
makes it worth the 170 to 200 dollar
price tag and again at the time of this
video not many bands offer all these
features in one package so hope this
video helped you in some way if you did
like my work please take your time and
like and subscribe to my channel as it
does help me providing you more content
like this and be sure to share this and
also find me on Facebook Twitter and
Google+ for behind the scenes
information this is Jimmy with Jim's
review room you guys take care bye
