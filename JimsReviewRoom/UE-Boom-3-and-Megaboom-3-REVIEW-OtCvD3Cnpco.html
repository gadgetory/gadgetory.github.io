welcome back to another one of my videos
so this might be my last Bluetooth
speaker review for the year and next
week I'll be doing my top 5 so subscribe
and turn on those notifications or
speaking to the future right now if
you're in 2019
be sure to YouTube search it on your end
this is the UE boom 3 and mega boom 3
video has always been transparent you
did send these over for review but my
assessment was not altered in any way
I'll be going over both pros and cons
I'll leave my affiliate links down in
that video description below click on
those for the most updated prices in
real time you never know when these
things might go on sale happen to me
when gyms review them and I'm here to
help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone to another video all
right don't over the physical features
first this is the first time at least
for me instead of that thicker fabric
mesh grille that we have Yui has had for
a long time it's now a thinner and
slightly reflective material everyone's
a pins are a little bit different but I
really like it it's so subtle but it
more importantly to me that feels a
little bit more modern now both speakers
retains the ip67 certification meaning
it's passed the test for being dust
proof and water resistant for up to 30
minutes and up to 3 feet of water
now the other mainstream competitors
have the same certification as well but
one thing that's big you've got to make
sure that these things float with my
testing thankfully both Bluetooth
speakers are good to bring to the pool
or to the lake now with boom speakers
these things are built like tanks every
Yui speaker I've done a drop test with
they've never broken or failed to keep
these numbers in mind the mega boom 3 is
dropped proof from 3 feet or 1 meter and
the boom 3 the smaller one is a bit more
robust though at 5 feet or 1.5 meters
watch this
all right let's take a look at the
features and buttons the front heads
your volume up and down pretty obvious
here they're huge but pressing both of
them at the same time
graciously gives you your battery life
70 percent charge now looking at the
rear is still stuck with microUSB for
some reason I wish to use the new
connection USB C to have all my devices
future-proof the one feature that is
possibly somewhat out here wide earth
would you put the charging light
indicator located down here in the back
recessed in and kind of under this flap
as well why not have it on the power
button up top so it can glow when it's
charging or fully charged that was my
only gripe now as a side note the boom
speakers do offer a wireless charging
dock that does come in handy but it is
sold separately
but the convenience of dropping the
speaker down then just picking R it
right up and just going that really
comes in handy now better life is rated
at up to 15 hours for the boom 3 and the
mega boom 3 is rated at up to 20 hours
and with my test I achieved 12 hours and
50 minutes in 14 hours and 4 minutes
respectively the claimed numbers might
seem small but in real world testing at
50% vine that JBL charge for claimed up
to 20 hours but instead I received a low
nine hours and 14 minutes and for the
sony xba-1 they also claimed up to 24
hours but I achieved 10 hours in 15
minutes the UE speakers actually did the
best like getting back to the physical
features the last part are the buttons
up top you got power and pairing and
right in the middle is this quote magic
button what does it do now you have your
basics like pause play and skip your
music oddly you can only go forward you
can't go back on your songs
the magic is really the ability to play
your playlist with the convenience of
not needing to pull out your phone now
through the Yui app you have to do this
beforehand you set it up through there
and then Jesus phone and the next time
around you press and hold us down for
three seconds and then your playlist
will start playing even if your
speaker's off holding it down for three
seconds to start the playlist your
speaker will automatically turn on and
that's really it for the magic now oddly
I noticed holding down any of these
buttons at four she doesn't pull up
assistant or Siri that's possibly where
you need to look at their mega blast and
blast line but they only have Amazon
Alexa built-in so we might be out of
luck but since we're touching base on
the app other features Yui includes are
the ability to pair 100 plus of these
speakers and have them all play at the
same time very similar to JBL connect
plus now I did confirm for those who
have older speakers likely boom-boom to
an Audi boom three mega boom and mega
boom three can group these speakers
together the Yui role and the Wonder
boom and such are not able to group with
each other now last time there is a
built-in equalizer which you can alter
the audio performance your liking and
also on the app there's this feature
where you can make these speakers act
like a wake up alarm now before we get
into the audio test really quick
Bluetooth strength Yui claims up to a
hundred and fifty feet which is insane
that's bigger than my office building
here but I did test this I got a hundred
thirty five feet of straight line of
sight so very very impressive here with
both of these speakers I'm able to pair
two different devices at the same time
and less about connection I confirmed
video did work great my Samsung and
iPhone just as an FYI if you do pair
these three together group them together
put them in party mode and have these
both play at the same time video would
then be out of sync that's pretty common
with a lot of Bluetooth speakers with
the pairing feature so folks please put
on your earphones or a headphones for
the 3d audio experience I'll be using my
professional binaural microphones and
that's the only way that you can listen
to that spatial sound and the last bit
here for those supporting my work please
light up that comment section with those
fire mode use and find me on Instagram
all right folks here we go
because it's
and there you have folks now both Yui
speakers do get very very loud
matter-of-fact --boom three felt as
though it had the same loudness as the
bigger mega boom three the only
difference though the bigger mega boom
offered more base as to be expected
while the boom focused more on the mid
and high frequencies both speakers are
able to fill medium to somewhat large
sized rooms starting with the mega boom
if you don't have this speaker side by
side with another competitor the speaker
has good reasonable base but when you do
have them side by side with a competitor
you'll notice the speaker doesn't give
off deep resonating bass I know it's
weird as Yui promotes thunderous bass on
their webpage well you can hear it in my
audio test and this is not a bad thing
testing Yui products in general for the
last shoot four to five years or so this
is uese audio signature it's hitting and
the upper end of low frequencies now I
would have preferred a little bit more
bass to compete with the JBL Xtreme -
and the bose sound like revolve + which
also offers 360-degree sound but keep in
mind the mega boom 3 has over JBL is
that even disbursement of audio again
360 degrees and what Yui has over boast
though is this is much more rugged than
what the Soundlink offers the answer the
boom 3 there is less base and less base
compared to those competitors as well
but enough to still have this speaker
enjoyable the boom 3 leans towards light
punchy bass simply a flatter signature
and the bottom end now as you get into
the mid-range both of these speakers
feels to be made for the outdoors
because there's slightly less bass but a
stronger emphasis on the mid-range it
cuts through the air having music heard
in big open fields see in the park side
of the pool on the boat the audio is
interpreted as being much more audible
now the quality on the other hand at
personal listening levels it's perfectly
fun and I'm sure you'll enjoy the
speaker but at near and at maximum
volume both of these speakers do get
jumbled and even a little raspy at the
upper mid to high frequencies the Yui
speakers are also missing a bit of
dimension and depth in favor for that
360 degree audio and
when you do places in the middle of the
room here anywhere you walk you're
getting this same amount of vine with no
dead spots so my designation my
consensus I guess you can say it's not
meant to be an audiophile bluetooth
speaker if anything it's meant to be
this bulletproof rugged tossus anywhere
get dirt sand water all over this thing
and still have good music for general
entertaining if you're looking for a bit
more immersive audio with the other
major competitors out there you're going
to lose out on the amount of ruggedness
this speaker provides all right folks
hopefully this video helped you in some
way be sure to find me on Facebook or
Instagram I'll catch you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
