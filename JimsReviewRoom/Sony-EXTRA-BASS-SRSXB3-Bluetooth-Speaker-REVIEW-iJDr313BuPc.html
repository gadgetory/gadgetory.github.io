room Bluetooth speaker technology is
really making some headwind with better
battery performance rugged build and
audio quality that's been improving over
the years Sony just released their new
lineup of Bluetooth speakers for 2016
the SRS XP series with the xB three that
I personally paid here it retails for a
hundred and forty nine dollars at the
time this video but I'll place several
links in the video description below as
prices I'm sure will change throughout
the year so without further ado guys my
channels here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review going over the physical
features first
it measures 8.3 inches wide a little
over three inches from front to back and
a little over three and a quarter inches
in diameter it does feel a bit heavy
though when you compare it to other
products on the market like the UE boom
- or the JBL charge - plus now if
portability is your focus take this into
consideration now quality wise sony has
burgundy glossy and straight line
designs and now features what feels to
be a ruggedized plastic you can lay this
flat if you want to or you can stand it
up for your personal enjoyment now
there's no claim that this is shockproof
but it does feel pretty beefy and the
entire unit hasn't shown any signs of
wear or scuffs from everyday use on the
top bottom and sides has very grippy
silicon texture while the front offers a
very minimal flexing Grill along the
newest features for those who are active
the xp3 is claimed to be water-resistant
and in the fine print it's IP x5
certified now it's water resistant
against fresh water tap water and also
sweat enforcement you can't submerge
this underwater like a Yui or fugu
products that are on the market now only
when you get to about a ipx7 rating
those products now can be submerged but
spring water for my test here the
speaker still works perfectly fine now
going over the buttons and features up
top you have your power on and off vibe
up and down far left has your speaker
options who answer phone calls when
paired to your phone and sadly all those
sitting about three feet away from the
speaker here
my voice did sound like I was very far
away and if I'm not sitting directly in
front of the speaker and about three
feet or further out my voice would
become crackling during my tests now
moving down there's an extra base
function and Sony's clearly marking this
towards base lovers here but I'll
discuss that in my sound test shortly
now bluetooth pairing button is in the
middle and last and I wish Sony
emphasizes more on their websites you
can pair two of these and get more room
filling music and better sound
separation it's very similar to the JBL
connect feature or the ue double-up now
last and what you can't see is NFC for
easy pairing just tap your NFC device
here and your phone is then paired now
rotating to the back there is a woofer
to help push bass out the rear here may
be against the wall if you plan on
putting it there but behind this flap
you have a 3.5 millimeter input for
physical connections a powerline in and
this will use Sony's wall charger unlike
many other Bluetooth speakers on the
market they instead use a micro USB port
and last is a charge out port meaning
you can connect basically your devices
to the speaker and use it just like a
power bank it will charge your phone and
since we're on the topic of power Sony
claims a very impressive up to 24 hours
of use and the fine print Sony did
indicate it from their test they use a
volume level set of 10 and from my
review from my testing here the amount
of volume taps from silent to maximum
was actually 30 so when they tested
their speaker it was a little bit less
than 50 percent so I set mine at 15 taps
for mute and left my phone volume level
at maximum now as with any Bluetooth
speaker review that I personally do here
again I left it at 50% Vaughn through
the entire night and into the following
day I was able to achieve in 19 hours
and 53 minutes on day two at maximum
volume again from a full battery to dead
I was able to get four hours in 32
minutes now the very last test that I
did was basically range in the same
standard test here I placed this on one
side of my house and walked to the other
side and downstairs no problems with the
signal going through a wall and the
first floor ceiling the only thing that
I really found missing here on this sony
was oddly they didn't include a true
battery level indicator the light does
glow red when you're close to a basic
being dead the battery here in green
when it's full but other than that
there's really no prompts to find out
what my battery levels are so to the
moment here that you've been waiting for
this
I'll test I'll play several songs and
then I'll give you my verdict afterwards
first up is a Lenin's fortress featuring
John
you can
and there you have it folks now sound
recorded on my end and then play through
your speakers are not the best depiction
of audio quality but hence my review
here now the xb3 gets plenty loud and
for sure fills up a medium-sized room in
my room here is roughly about sixteen by
18 feet now this mid sized speaker is
also pushing the threshold of being
suitable for large open rooms or even
outdoors as well if you have two of
these this works very well for
entertaining
now as stated earlier bass is the main
focus for the xp3 and this for sure has
it now I believe it has more so than the
beats pill plus that I recently reviewed
but for being loud though not for heavy
hitting low frequencies now it's not
that deep sub bass levels that we've
known from the beats lineup but for the
price the bass is more so than any other
speaker at this price range but talking
about the quality here of the bass this
is where it dips a slightly here though
now at times on the top band of bass and
the low end of mids out here the slight
flutter this distortion that isn't
pleasant now with the extra bass and at
higher volumes critical listeners will
for sure hear it and for the average
consumer
you may notice it too but if you're in a
store again you'll notice this Sony will
be louder and impressive at first don't
get me wrong the bass will sound deep
compared to the competition again that
price range of $149 but stand there a
bit and you'll notice this is droning
this bass fluttering noise is probably
the best way that I can describe it
now the mid-range and general vocals
does well I believe for a bass heavy
speaker there is some slight spill over
again from bass though but again it's
really your preference and lastly highs
do work well without being earring or
teen at all spatial sound is pretty much
absent like most Bluetooth speakers and
audio separation isn't there unless you
pair two of these together so with my
conclusion here sound quality wise if
you're a bass head and don't mind that
slight distortion at times it's a
serious consideration because all the
features that you're getting here and
how loud it can actually get now if
you're a bit more critical I'd say wait
until the JBL charge 3 comes out here
should be coming up pretty shortly
that's also a mid sized speaker at the
very same price point so that's it for
this review here be sure to subscribe of
course I'm gonna get the JBL charge 3
pretty soon here remember to add me on
to Facebook Twitter and/or
Instagram I'm Jimmy with Jim's review
room you guys
here and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
