review room I finally got this unboxing
here it's the xbox one its
much-anticipated and I normally don't do
unboxings on my channel but to be honest
with you this specifically deserves
special attention so this will be in
depth tour of the actual box on the
outside you can fast-forward that if you
like and then eventually go through all
the contents within the box as well be
sure to visit facebook.com slash Jim's
review room and I do basically a photo
shoot on all the products that I review
so there's a lot of in-depth photos on
there definitely check that out
facebook.com slash Jim's review room so
regarding the xbox here I have yet to
open it it still has the factory soon on
here as you can see so I personally have
yet to see it myself so we're gonna take
a look at the box like I said um again
this is the front basically not much'
graphically the box is surprisingly a
pretty decent weight it's pretty heavy
one who brought out the store even the
best buy guys I was walking out bringing
it to me to the counter was leading a
little bit there I don't know how much
the whole package weighs but again it's
a pretty hefty weight again the box is
pretty minimalistic pretty cool just all
black looks really a badass you can say
to the right here just have all your
items that are included in the box the
back nothing again and to the left here
just a big picture of that beautiful
controller and again like I said this is
my first time unboxing it so he is
second hearing let me get the blade out
oh yes everything is neatly packaged
here let's see what we got here this
generation start that blacks game course
with a kind of like a neon green glow
there or neon green exit Wow an
improvement over last year's more last
generations model it's still you know
really thin really lightweight though
which is a good thing of course but it
does feel a little bit bulkier a flat
matte black finish here with the Xbox
logo right here and it's a little bit
shiny as well if you guys can see that
in the video there we go and the other
end of the connection as you can see
okay so they go with the headset for you
guys let me see what else is in the box
here quick startup guide I'm pretty sure
with the years of people playing xbox
they know how to turn that on the
stickers on your car window an Xbox
sticker promos get equip promos and
other warranty information let's see
here and that's the control i'm going to
go with that pretty shortly there hdmi
cables there you go
and next item here is the power cord
okay then you got your massive brick
monster um shocked that you know they
couldn't put this into the system I
guess considering how big the xbox is
and sorry for fun when it does here but
the place that you for actually has a
built-in power brick so it's just an
extension cord just sticking out the
system but I mean nonetheless you're
gonna put this behind your TV anyway so
I guess it's not really a big deal but
this thing is massive see here you go
okay and go on NESN let's take a look at
this controller let's see if there's any
improvements over to feel and here we go
guys oh that's really nice wow this
looks really good actually kind of
shocked the controller the d-pad right
here it's chromed out basically also
with the Xbox logo or the Quick Menu
button there matte black finish the
buttons while they look really nice
this still feels very familiar still
actually feels similar to the current
xbox where you can say the older
generation xbox now in regards to
aerodynamics when I squeezed here it
actually feels it feels very comfortable
it fits obviously my entire hand about
and i have about medium sized hands so
that's a good fit the joysticks alone
they're very much dimpled i like them a
lot actually in the middle it's like i
said it's just concave din out of it the
camera can pick that up there and it
just perfectly seats my finger in there
and then the outer ring i guess you can
say of the joysticks they are very much
texture I can feel my thumbs as gripping
they're very good comfort feels really
really good actually trigger buttons all
the are much Waterloo that it includes
this extra piece of plastic right here
you can say where when I tap it I just
get more contact actually to be honest
with you if I'm you know in a shooter a
first person shooter call duty
battlefield etc and my reaction goes
down pushing this trigger you actually
get probably a faster response probably
just a couple of milliseconds actually
as soon as I quit click this you know of
course my gun go off but again just
offering that extra piece of plastic
right there I really think that's that's
highly beneficial that's something that
playstation 4 does not have wow that's
really nice and how do i love these
buttons while trigger bots are really
good shoulder buns feel pretty typical
um solid feedback same thing with the
buttons really uh really I don't know
similar to last year's but again more
refined so over on me it's a huge plus
similar familiar T hands but again it
just feels much more refined I wouldn't
say this is like a total redesign kind
of like what PlayStation 4 did with
their controller but um this definitely
definitely feels heck of a lot better
than what it was before but anyways let
me continue showing you the controller
itself and use a micro USB charging
ports just let the ps4's
battery hold it right there and that's
the one flaw I didn't like about
batteries usually get the recharging kit
but they're as much as we play I mean
guys sometimes those batteries
eventually go bad you know after a year
or so then we gotta get new batteries
but nonetheless really good controller
um lightweight I like it a lot d-pads
really smooth which there is a dimple on
here just to keep my thumb you know they
are guests but it's really smooth
nothing too detrimental again really
really nice it looks really good to god
it looks like something Batman what
happiness house I don't know let me see
where's the headset let me connect the
headset real quick here and see how this
looks okay so it slides in just like so
which I get a good better angle there it
just locks in there and there you have
it looks really diesel actually and got
the day 1 2013 indication right there
which is really cool just to make you
stand out a little bit there that's
really awesome okay oh now really like
this controller actually really like it
and just for you know comparison
purposes it goes the PlayStation 4
controller that was released last week
it goes the xbox controller you can see
slightly the difference there and that's
the thing let me show you about those
trigger buttons now ps4 did it improve
their trigger buttons as well but like I
said it doesn't it's a little bit of a
smaller touch or feel yeah this just
feels so much more beef here Wow
beef here but at the same time I guess
it takes less effort I guess you know
mentally you may could just save you a
couple of milliseconds but I don't know
it just seems so much more smoothly on
the excess I'm really shocked man i'm
really impressed okay so let's see what
else is in the bag here so let's see
what else here we've got a huge massive
connect cable here and pull that out
here and there girls your Xbox Kinect so
front face it's just basically glass you
have a little pride microphone and
speaker on probably just a microphone in
general I'm sorry and on the back and
the top you got some air vents matte
black plastic finish sides are bent it
as well both sides and then the rear has
actually a little mini fan here that
basically blows out that hot air just
keep it cool you do have a pivoting
stand so let's see how much of pivots by
just in case you never know yeah that's
you bad pivots down down up okay perfect
okay so really nice apart looks nice on
a set-top box or on top of your TV as
well not too bad alright guys so this is
the moment that you guys been waiting
for here we go
all right ladies and gentlemen here it
goes the unveiling of the xbox one god
this thing is beefy so first impressions
it looks nice its gargantuan I gotta
admit it is it looks like a old-school
VCR and be like in the pictures I'm
sorry Xbox people but um it's it's nice
but again it is it's really basic I just
a big square it actually looks like a
old-school like desktop PC one then you
still have them horizontally like this I
mean that's I don't I'm just being
honest with you guys but nonetheless I'm
pretty sure it'll fit you know within
your audio video equipment it's gonna
fit right enemy it's like I said it's
really minimalistic but because of that
it's gonna fit in you know more easier
than I guess all the products but other
than other than that I mean I'll be
honest man it is it is pretty big so you
have your power cable it says hdmi out
to TV your digital audio HDMI in from
either your satellite or cable set-top
box super speed or basically a USB 3.0
your connect goes here you have a ir
blaster and of course your land
connection or internet connection if you
want to go wired of course it does have
wireless internet built in as well so
very very minimal events on the back
surprisingly but most of the vents you
can see are on the side it is freaking
tons of vents which is good hopefully
there's no such thing as red ring of
death or red lights in general and
hopefully xbox this time around you know
basically addresses that situation of
overheating but other than that that's
about it um the whole top bass plays
vents to I don't know if you guys
the video here just massive amounts
events tons events so yeah I this thing
is going to keep cool it means if it's
not going to blow in the back there's
God Jesus part like 75 percent of the
system has been so probably even more I
don't know but this thing is going to
keep cool i'm pretty short will and then
you got the glossy black finish very
similar to the PlayStation 4's where
they do the matte black and also the
glossy have that half the system's
glossy as well so and yes here goes the
ps4 just for comparison purposes and
since we got both systems here already
might as well just show it to you guys
playstation 4 and then you got your xbox
one which is another one two or three
inches longer so two inches I don't know
but I'm just guessing right now and
let's see here
now you can see if the PlayStation 4 is
thinner the places for is thinner than
the xbox by pride about half of its size
maybe a little bit less but again they
goes a side-by-side comparison as I
don't want to make this into a
comparison video but the only said if I
have both systems here I might as well
just show it to you guys for comparison
purposes but on that that's about it
that's the xbox one I'm going to be
doing the review on this shortly here of
course I'm finishing up the PlayStation
4 review as we speak and hopefully I'll
have it up either today or tomorrow and
I don't know let's definitely like and
