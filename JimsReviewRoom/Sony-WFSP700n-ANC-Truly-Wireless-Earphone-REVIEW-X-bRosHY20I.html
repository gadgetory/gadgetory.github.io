several weeks ago and saw these funky
looking truly wireless earphones from
Sony now I wasn't going to buy them but
looking at the box
obviously I noticed that it has active
noise-cancelling now passive noise
isolation is already great on most
in-ear earphones so I said let me spend
the money here let's see how good these
are trying to help you guys at home
watching to see if these are even worth
it or is that a and C basically gimmicky
and whatnot so besides I'm still testing
the Bose headphones so stay tuned for
that as always being transparent I did
personally buy these but for the price
of one hundred and fifty dollars but I
think the prices have gone up to about a
hundred and eighty I think that's the
retail price so be sure to click on my
affiliate links down in the description
below check out my links and it will
give you the most updated prices in real
time of course it does help support me
as well you never know when these things
might go back on sale how do you mean
when gyms review them and I'm here to
help you guys make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
all right so going over the physical
features first these things do indeed
look quite unique here kind of like a
beam but it's much different than most
other truly wireless earphones that just
simply stick out of your ears now it's
all plastic construction with silicone
ear tips and your wings with the
extended part right here to help
stabilize the earphones now the little
circle here isn't a button at all but
this is where the microphone is located
during my time testing these sony 700
ends tends to be the earphones you have
to kind of push it a little deeper into
the ear canal for for them to not lose
at the seal they don't fall out during
vigorous movements which is a huge plus
as you guys can see they're just dropped
but they're stable during running and
working out but if you want as much
passive noise isolation as it can plus
taking advantage of ANC at least with my
ears here I felt I had to push them
quite firmly in and even at time they
still lose that nice seal that blocks
out the world and I did swap out
different ear tips as well now these
things are IP 4 rate admitting they are
able to take splashes of water from any
direction this is enough for most people
but if you're looking for something more
rugged the IP 5 can take on jet sprays
instead of splashes and IP 6 and IP 7
can be dropped into water up to a
certain amount of time and certain
amount of depth as well your call on if
IP 4 is enough for you and with my
testing with splashing water and these
are they're still working perfectly fine
today now taking a closer look here the
buttons are easily identifiable and
offers a very clicky response the right
earbud allows you to pause and play with
a single press 2 taps to skip forward 3
taps to go back now the left ear bud you
can cycle through ambient sound active
noise-cancelling and basically leaving
everything off you're listening to your
music like a traditional pair of
earphones now with ambient sound the
sony SP 700 ends turns on the built-in
microphones and lets your environment
kind of basically be pumped in perfect
for running safety or when you want to
hear what's going on
around you and when I tested this Sony
did a great job with audio not being too
amplified and everything's sounding very
natural the only downside though I do
hear this slight hiss when I don't have
music playing now if I turn off ambient
sound control it does go away not a big
deal but just not a clean sound testing
active noise cancelling and this is the
one the main reasons why I wanted to
test these besides of course the audio
performance at first being upfront here
it didn't sound too impressive since
passive noise isolation seemed to be
doing most of the work now there was a
slight improvement but nothing major and
very initial first impressions not on
the second day and wearing them all day
now wearing them everywhere I can
appreciate this a little bit more
especially outdoors this does cut out a
lot of the airiness around you cars
driving by the sound of just how open
maybe a park is etc now going indoors
the air conditioner is cut down a bit
here as well you don't hear that
whooshing noise with people who speak
you're nearby especially at a coffee
shop where it can be loud at times at
certain locations there's slight
suppression but I can still hear
conversations anything loud in general
that they have doesn't sound to have
been cancelled or even some frequencies
doesn't sound to be canceled at all
now the ANC does work and it does offer
something more than what passive noise
isolation alone offers just don't come
into this thinking that this was life
changing like the Sony 1000 xm3
headphones now coming to this expecting
moderate levels of sound cancellation
with the ear tube doing most of the work
and it works the best with softer
sounding areas and keep in mind you
still have this weird hiss going on
there as well now moving on within the
app you can change that same bun that
left one on the left ear tip or earbud
that is to access Google assistant now
with the press you can get the time
notifications and such which is really
handy it's 224 p.m. you don't have new
notifications right now no Google
assistant is not built into the
earphones themselves so you have to have
your phone nearby for the feature to
work now also test this with Siri and
the
didn't do anything at all unfortunately
now touching base on phone call
performance their microphones and these
are really good my voice comes across
very clear and natural no echoes hurt at
all here there is some background noise
being picked up but most speaker phones
do that already
but when using this for phone calls it's
only played through the left ear bud an
ambient sound does automatically turn on
so that way it sound like you're
isolated and that when you're not
shouting out in public
touching based on bluetooth and battery
performance Bluetooth is a 4.04 don't we
don't even tip Bluetooth the 4.2 you can
listen to one earbud at a time while
leaving the other one distant away
basically I'm getting about 85% coverage
in general with the Bluetooth
performance on both of these earbuds
which is not bad but competitors are
getting about five to ten more feet in
distance before this signal starts to
cut out and they do have bluetooth 4.2
at least some of them with Bluetooth 5.0
a test in this one video though YouTube
played perfectly fine on my samsung s A+
but on my iPhone it was completely off
sync testing Netflix both Samsung and
Apple phones played perfectly in sync
kind of surprising for Bluetooth 4.1 now
in addition I did confirm you can pair
this to more than one device at a time
let's go into your bluetooth menu and
click or tap on the earphones and it'll
switch over now
touching base on battery life these are
rated at a low three hours of
performance per charge with an
additional six hours from the case
giving you a total of nine hours to give
you some perspective four to five hours
per charge as the norm and total use the
average is usually around 12 to 15 hours
Sony falls short in this area and with
my test I did this twice here once
without ambient sound or ANC on strictly
passive noise isolation just like any
other pair of earphones and I got 2
hours and 44 minutes with ANC I'm at 50%
bum until it died I got 2 hours in 26
minutes this does feel quite short if
you're intending on wearing these for
long walks or simply worried them at the
office now as a side note the case to
charge them it's simply not as intuitive
as some of the competitors you have to
slide it in at a certain angle
like so and also press it down to ensure
contact and charging and I'm not trying
to be a text them I'm not hitting on
Sony actually really like Sony the being
realistic the competitors offers a
magnetic click and you can just
literally just drop them in and go so
folks let's get into the audio test
please put on your own headphones or
earphones to experience my bide neural
recordings please show your support for
my work bring you the best reviews to
help you make that purchase decision
like give me some fire emojis down below
and subscribe it all helps the channel
thanks just one that there's one is
simple from mr. Denmark Netherlands from
you
how you feel as long as you can show me
a good time
and there you have it folks
of course audio recorded on my end here
and then play through your own
headphones or earphones is not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence my
review here and Lisa guys got some form
of samples now first off make sure you
download these Sony app called
headphones connect and you can control
your settings and there's a little
equalizer on there that does help a bit
to tune these the way that you would
like and i personal eft this at stock
settings for my test now first thing
you'll notice these things are nice and
loud a fifty to sixty percent in volume
the seven hundred n is capable of
getting you grooving to your music any
higher the sound quality does become a
little too aggressive some might not
mine some may some with more sensitive
ears will experience a little listening
fatigue listening at those higher
volumes now the bass is really nice with
punchy lows we're not touching sub based
levels but there's a nice thumb enough
depth to make most genres enjoyable
especially pop and EDM enough for hip
hop for bass heavy songs there isn't
muddiness experience in the vocals
that's a plus but the bass does ever so
slightly overshadow the vocals just by a
bit here just by a little smidge but for
the most part the mid-range is present
and clear audio separation is very much
a present with these earphones voice is
standing more so in the forefront versus
the beats going on in the background
never did I notice the mid-range being
recessed or dull yep never too bright
either there's not even really bright
these slight Fordyce is a nice touch and
gives the audio a bit more dimension in
the audio experience the high
frequencies are played safe here so
those sharp high plucks on strings
aren't as sharp or detail
as much as I was hoping for snares
cymbal crashes those kind of things I
wish there was a bit more sparkle up
there same with soundstage I wish it was
slightly wider or bigger but it's hard
to experienced soundstage and truly
rowlf's earphones for some reason here
there's only a very few that even offer
that but overall I think the audio is
very good in my opinion and that 50 to
60 percent environment it's probably the
biggest Pro or plus I can give to these
earphones everything else was really
okay and some of them were a complete
miss I'll be honest with you with these
earphones do I recommend these yeah not
so much I know some people will be
disappointed with my verdict here but
you at the same time I feel as though
there's so many other competitors
offered so much more the active
noise-cancelling is a huge perk on here
and it does help somewhat but honestly
this is unbiased here obviously I'm
biased but if you listen to any other
truly wireless earphones or even just
any pair of in-ear earphones and you
have music going and you of course you
have a good seal on your ears it's gonna
block up most for you already if you're
listening at very low volumes then yes
then the ANC does kick in it does help
to an extent there on that that's about
it folks comment down below let me know
what you guys think I'll be very eager
to hear what you say also those who have
purchased this already I do want to hear
your opinions let us know what you think
of your own personal product you
assessment could be very different than
mine again comment down below

haven't already and I will catch you
guys on the next video
