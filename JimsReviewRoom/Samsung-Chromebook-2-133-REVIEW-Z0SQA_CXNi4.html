review room welcome to another review
now we're looking at Samsung's latest
the chromebook 2 coming in at thirteen
point three inches I just reviewed the
11.6 inch model about two weeks ago and
you can watch that video on my channel
or by clicking this small video playing
currently now this one here is priced at
399 dollars and the 11 inch model is
priced at 319 now there are some
differences that makes up for the price
difference besides just the larger
screen so without further ado we'll get
started
if you're not familiar with Chromebook I
suggest watching my video what is a
Chromebook for more information on why
it's different from Windows and Apple
now this is Samsung's first 13-inch
Chromebook to hit the market coming in
the color of luminous Titan the 13 inch
mono Chromebook retains its thinness at
16 and a half millimeters which is
practically identical to the 11 inch
model the weight is slightly higher
compared to the 11 inch coming in a hair
over three pounds but to put this into
perspective the Apple MacBook Air
13-inch model which is ridiculously thin
weighs in at 2.96 pounds it's literally
just an ounce and a half difference so
yes the Chromebook is light enough for
portability and comparable with other
manufacturers now if you've watched my
review of the 11 inch model from Samsung
I mentioned the build quality
significantly improves from its previous
generation from more than a year ago the
construction is much better overall
Albia plastic the chassis seems that
more stiff and rigid with much less flex
the hinge lid is also more secure and
overall the quality of the Chromebook is
on par with other Chromebook makers on
the market and I know this part is
subjective but the 13-inch model I'll
admit I was not feeling the gray almost
silver like color that they used and I
really don't mind that Samsung in
general and uses the imitation leather
and faux stitching on their tablets and
Chromebooks but this color and Sheen
gives it a more plastic look when
compared to black especially on these
edges here but moving on here sometimes
you get a laptop that's just too
sensitive at the touch pad and while
typing your palm accidentally hits that
touchpad and causing your cursor to move
on the screen the touchpad to me seems
very well-balanced and those issues
mentioned did not occur and although the
following feature has been seen on other
manufacturers similar to Apple with
Chromebooks and in this case Samsung
they do provide a good handful of touch
pad usefulness like tapping with two
fingers for right click hold down with
two fingers to scroll a webpage and
swiping with two fingers in general to
basically go back on a webpage so some
small little features like this makes
the touchpad a bit more than useful in
my opinion now going over its physical
ports the left side has a power adapter
input USB 3.0 a full HDMI connection two
as to your TV or monitor and you can
mirror your screen or have a monitor
become an extension of your Chromebooks
desktop and lastly is a micro SD card
slot for physical storage of items
rather than using the cloud now going to
the right side there is a security slot
USB 2.0 and last is a three-and-a-half
millimeter headset ports for both
microphone and headphones and there's
nothing on either the front or the rear
of the Chromebook to the webcam gets
bumped up to a 720p resolution which is
huge when compared to the VGA webcams
they were using previously you can see
on your screen the left side is the old
model and what many competitors have
right now and the right side is the
Samsung Chromebook 2 in regards to
resolution the Acer c720 which is a
fabulous Chromebook the HP Chromebook 14
inch and Toshiba scroll model also
featured that 768 resolution which is
good enough when you're not comparing
laptop screens side-by-side but first
glance at this 13-inch model which
features a 1080 display you'll
definitely see the difference this to me
is possibly the biggest benefit that
Samsung has over the competition
everything looks much sharper clearer
and it makes this display look and feel
in a sense more expensive now moving on
internally the 13-inch model does
receive a slight boost in performance
when compared to the 11 inch model with
a different processor the 11 inch model
uses the same processor found in some of
the more current Samsung tablets and
also in the note 3 smartphone from
Samsung but this 13 inch model here uses
an octa-core exynos 5800 which is more
powerful than the aforementioned with 4
cores running at 2 gigahertz and the
last four runs at one point 3 gigahertz
and Samsung was nice enough to now
include 4 gigs of memory as basically
being the standard other notable
features are bluetooth 4.0 and wireless
a B G and n Wi-Fi connections with
wireless AC which is the latest and
fastest technology soon to be available
in a system update / Samsung now I
normally don't focus too much on
benchmarking but consider these two
processors are very close to each other
I compared them across three different
web-based programs to see on a match
level its difference
as you can see on the screen the 13-inch
model had a 10% 12% in five percent
increase respectively in d3 benchmarks
performed now with that being said
Samsung's performance yielded perfectly
fine for everyday average consumer use
despite being very laggy when I first
fired up the Chromebook which album it
was pretty weird but after about maybe
15 minutes or so
possibly finishing downloading my
profile and apps the Chromebook 2 ran
perfectly fine now pulling up email
going up to Facebook browsing photos
went without a hitch
watching youtube videos in high
definition wasn't a problem at all and
Netflix ran smooth thanks to now the 4
gigs of RAM I can browse the internet
with a reasonable amount of chrome tabs
open and similar to the 11 inch model I
could open 11 standard web pages at the
same time before very minor stuttering
would occur at 12 or more pages load
slightly slower and video became barely
possible to watch and Samsung also
claims up to eight and a half hours of
battery life and through my testing
running through what appears to be a
typical day of emails web surfing
watching a Netflix video etc real-world
testing yielded seven hours and a little
over 20 minutes of use and while testing
the unit remained cool with only warm
when leaving this on my lap so the wrap
things up Samsung did really increase
their prices on these Chromebooks and
they're higher than the competitors out
there but for this 13-inch model having
this resolution and of course a bigger
screen size and having the 4 gigs of RAM
as being the standard and may justify
its price and of course that's
subjective though but let me know your
thoughts below so hope this video helped
you in some way definitely check out the
11 inch review on the screen here if you
haven't done so and be sure to find me
