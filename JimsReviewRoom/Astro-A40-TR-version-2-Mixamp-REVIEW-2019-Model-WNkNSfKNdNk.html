second and even high-dynamic-range
I'm no question confident that audio
will be the next major focus at least
I'm hoping so that's why I want to
review these these are the new Astro a40
tournament ready headsets with the
tournament ready mix and pro this is the
upgrade to the previous model now this
is on the upper end meant for a
competitive play retelling at two
hundred and forty nine dollars at the
time this video but being transparent as
always Astro did send us over for review
my assessment was not altered in any way
I'll be going over both pros and cons
I'll leave my affiliate links down in
that video description down there as
well click on those links for the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
I'm Jimmy with jims review and I'm here
to help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone to another video
it's a really quick sidenote right here
a lot of questions have been coming in
asking me where I get my music from for
the audio test and also my background
music it's from epidemic sound and it is
perfect for youtubers content creators I
used to get copyright strikes all the
time but for the past year I've been
using them it's been great and it's
crazy cheap as well use my link down in
that video description below
it gets you free 30-days again with that
link they're not sponsoring this video
but again I've been getting a lot of
questions about that check them out
anyways I'm going over the physical
features first on these Astros they make
some quality components the aluminum
rail up top for adjusting is nice and
thick the magnets that holds the
backplate and also the ear pads are
super nice and strong and for some
reason man that clicking Center this
gives me so much confidence now the fact
that they offer their own mod kit to
change out the mic headband ear pads and
ear cut back plates are nice there's
some more unique back plates on their
website here goes one of them right here
so check them out it's super easy to do
and to replace same thing with the ear
pads you just pull them out and slide
the next one back in BAM got blue going
on right here
alright let me swap them back here I'd
actually like black better but anyways
getting into comfort you have to find
that right balance and the ass or a 40s
will then work out well quite obvious
but I found if you're slightly off such
as extending the arms a little too much
then there's too much weight right here
at the jaw line if it's not extended
enough I do notice that there's a
pinching feeling right here at the crown
of the head and as much as I like the
design of the aluminum rails it's quite
hard to retract them or basically make
them shorter while they're on your head
you got to take off the headset shorten
them like so and then once you put them
on your head then you can't actually
extend them once you get into that sweet
spot I can wear these for several hours
but just to be transparent right here if
you're trying to adjust these on the fly
while gaming again a little bit
cumbersome right there now for an
objective number wearing these on my
scale they do weigh very similar to most
other premium headsets on the market
coming in close to three hundred and
sixty grams with the fact three
accessories so weight wasn't something
huge to speak on and if you were to use
the mod kit and you
leatherhead bam the earpads the denser
back plates etc the weight does jump to
400 grams which is now on the upper end
now as for heat build up the Astro a40
SR over-ear headsets leaving my ears
feeling quite airy and free inside now
this also helps with keeping
temperatures at a reasonable level
leaving these on for two hours straight
in a 71 to 72 degree room I never felt
my ears warm up or heat up to the point
where I noticed now another feature I
wanted to speak on these are open back
headsets meaning you can hear others in
the room but they trade off with open
back headsets you might get a better
sound stage we'll see in the audio test
and the cool thing though with the mod
kit the back plates are thicker and
seals the back of the drivers giving us
a closed back design you can have
options here now with the passive noise
isolation you can sense the difference
and the amount of noise that it blocks
out the back plates do work now taking a
closer look the headset themselves don't
have any buttons at all the mute button
is actually on the very nice cord that
they provide right here the
three-and-a-half millimeter input into
the headset is quite sturdy as well and
takes a good bit of effort to yank this
thing out Lee probably yank off my
headset first before the cord actually
goes out okay just showing you guys is
proof so the microphone here itself is
detachable which is awesome and has the
ability to swivel up and down as you
guys can see to get it out of the way
and trying to get it in the right
position for your mouth man this thing
is like play-doh mold it in any way and
it will stay look at this
alright take a look at the mix am very
straightforward with a huge volume knob
on the left voice and gaming audio
controlled and be right the middle
button up top toggles Dolby audio on and
off and the button on the bottom
switches your equalizers settings
there's four settings in total which you
can adjust later in the command center
which I'll show you
rotating to the rear daisy-chaining mix
amps are on either side opting in for
optical in for console users micro USB
for PC the auxiliary port and last is
that stream output with the Astro a40
tournament with the addition the mix F
does allow you to output Dolby audio as
well to your viewers
very cool here but again very good bill
quality premium feel all around the only
gripe I wish that the grip and the
underside of this thing was a bit sticky
or sometimes when I just volume it just
moves around a little bit on the table a
little bit let down by that alright
let's get into the good stuff here let's
do the microphone test real quick it
goes an unedited version get ready
alright folks here goes the microphone
test completely unedited for you guys
this has to be the best so far on the
channel that tested so far beating out
this steel series art this Pro that are
reviewed several months back those were
really good as well but listen to this
this makes my voice sound the least
amazingly as well go ahead and make some
noise make some noise in the background
I got my little girl back there doing
some I don't trying to unbox one of my
stuff right now but let's see if it
picks up anything in the background just
got the sink running just now and that's
really about it oh wait back to the
review here we go alright folks
and now for in-game audio before you
start download the Astro command center
so you can have fine tuning capabilities
and additional features as well do not
and I repeat do not download the command
center from Astros website for some
reason it doesn't work I didn't find
those directions on their website into
much later it just seemed common sense
to go to their websites but if you open
up the Microsoft Store and download it
from there
that was not an issue that's the key
they're trying to update the firmware
for some reason it didn't take out the
first two times after restarting my
computer twice twice that is without
changing anything the app did find the
Asch nor a 40's then and then i was able
to update everything from there so just
keep an eye out for that
now there's four presets available as I
mentioned earlier that you can fine tune
and then save to the mix amp
everything's very streamlined very easy
to do are they mix amp itself you can
toggle through those four in real time
while playing to hear what suits your
needs the fine tuning is expensive and
answer does provide an advanced option
as well I left it at it's four stock
settings to be honest with you guys for
the time being since I thought they were
already great how great well put on your
headphones and earphones folks if you're
new to the channel I do use professional
binaural microphones they are about two
thousand dollars and that's not to brag
but hopefully to give you authentically
on what I use to give you the best 3d
audio experience possible
and you get as close to the experience
of these headsets as possible as well
here it goes folks here's the demo
how's it go
or something
you sir me how's it going
that's cute
yes sir even after the fiasco in Brazil
no one questions your leadership of the
organization yes sir
they're ready for anything Jona
Dominguez is not just the leader of the
cell I think he's the leader of Trinity
all right folks
audio recorded through my microphones
and then play through your devices or
not the best depiction of audio quality
but hence my review here it's gotta give
you guys that disclaimer but wow this is
where the a40 really shines toggling the
Dolby button on the mix amp generates
such an airy and open soundstage I get
this immersive super immersive ambiance
through my surroundings and that's what
I try to demonstrate in the Tomb Raider
audio demo the sounds of the atmosphere
around you but beyond that it's also the
clarity the fidelity the resolution in
the amount of detail that you can hear
this was the biggest highlight for me
now it's one of the most balanced
headsets as well that I've tested on the
channel to area that I do need to
critique though regarding soundstage in
detail once in a while depending on the
area I hear this
tinny very hollow metallic sound you can
hear a little bit of that again in that
game Tomb Raider while I was inside that
cave
now I hear it more in person and I was
hoping the microphones would have picked
it up a little bit better but that's why
I paused for a minute to listen I'm sure
that's what the Dolby processing or the
Dolby Atmos that I have running it on
Windows 10 but it's something that I
didn't notice now jumping into the audio
characteristics the a 40's are very
balanced headphones in my personal
opinion if you want balance we got a
flat slate go is steel series the artist
Pro models and such that reviewed a
while ago those are very flat but then
you have tons of EQ options then for
these they're not neutral and even
leaving it on the neutral profile
provides a nice punchy bass the thumps
bangs explosions are adequate from my
taste and can always be bumped slightly
up here through that command center app
the vocals and most of the mid-range
where the human ear interprets most
audio it's super clear high resolution
again I think I said this already but
overall crisp clean just forward enough
to be present yet not bright and not
recessed either I loved it and as for
the highs I get this on some of the
lower end headsets when they try to over
blow mids and highs making gunshot sound
louder but the Aster a 40s again super
clean and zero listening fatigue as for
directional sounds spatial recognition
in slower and very quiet games
essentially most battle royale games
today I'm talking about a pub G blackout
apex you can hear those footsteps quite
well and get a general sense on where
your enemies are and where they're
moving to they are good and up there
with some of the best if you really want
to get the upper hand go into the
command center and bump up those mids
and you can hear them much better the
only gret though I honestly had even
though I had Dolby Atmos enabled and
played a Dobby headphone enabled game
again such as Tomb Raider I was hoping
to hear more height in my playthrough
you can hear some of it but I was hoping
that there would be a bit more though
so at the end of the day the audio
quality on these are really darn good in
my opinion one of the most balanced yet
not flat audio signatures it's clean
detailed zero listening fatigue head
shots I mean head
she's headsets I'm hoping for Dolby
Atmos and 3d audio to further expand in
both PC and eventually with the next
generation it consoles but in the
meantime the astro a40 tournament ready
headsets are highly recommended if
anything their future proofing you guys
is well don't think that's not Future
prefers maybe that micro USB connection
or port that is but folks leave some
fire mode just down below subscribe if
you haven't already and find me on
Instagram I'll talk to you guys later
