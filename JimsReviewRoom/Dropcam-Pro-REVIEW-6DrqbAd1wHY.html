review room welcome to another review
today we'll be looking at the Dropcam
Pro that I'll be personally using in the
baby room and for the folks that have
been following me on YouTube I'm a
soon-to-be father in about two weeks as
of this video so if I disappear off a
YouTube for a week or so you'll know
exactly why but this Dropcam I'm
intending on using this as a substitute
to a baby monitor as it does provide
live streaming of video and audio to
your smartphone tablet or computer while
you're away and of course there's tons
of other uses as well like home security
surveillance on your kids and babysitter
keeping an eye on your elderly parents
watching your pets or commercial
applications such as keeping this at the
office or warehouse
now there's the regular drop cam and the
drop cam pro which I'm reviewing today
and you can see the difference is on
your screen right now they're priced at
one hundred and forty nine dollars and
two hundred dollars respectively so
without further ado we'll get started
now in the box you do receive the drop
cam itself with a wall mount and drywall
screws which I'll show you how to
install shortly er a USB power cord /
USB cable with the USB power plug and a
Quick Start Guide are all included in
the package and on their website they
did not disclose the length of the cord
which I thought was important though but
it measures 9 foot 6 inches long which I
thought was enough for most rooms the
unit is small enough in my opinion
standing at 4.5 inches tall and having
the option of tilting a full 180 degrees
the camera itself is detachable you can
place this in a more discreet location
if you desire to do so now wall mounting
is very easy with the wall plate just
dot the holes with a pencil pre-drill
with the drill bit and basically push in
the drywall anchors in afterwards put
the wall plate back on and screw in the
screws and then take the Dropcam with a
base and snap it in and that's basically
it it's very simple the wall plate also
allows you to swivel the camera as well
so it's not in a fixed position and keep
in mind it also tilts so you have full
range of motion
now once you have the Dropcam in its
location let's download the app on
either your Apple or Android power
device and connect the Dropcam to your
Wi-Fi network create your account which
is free and your streaming as you can
see on your screen is actual footage
from the camera itself without any
editing now the Dropcam pro features a
hundred and thirty degrees field of
vision while the regular Dropcam offers
a hundred and seven degrees so you get a
bit more viewing angles in the pro model
now I found this a bit on but on the box
it states to offer full 1080p display at
a fluid 30 frames per second but on
their website States a 720p resolution
for both their regular and pro models
now it might be a typo at this time but
either or the video quality is still
stunning colors are vibrant and a detail
looks amazing now it also comes with
eight times zoom which just stretches
the image it's not an optical zoom and
you do this either on your smartphone or
tablet by pinching or stretching your
screen with your fingers and as stated
earlier I'm using this as more of a baby
monitor and the Dropcam does come with
audio capabilities you can hear what's
going on and also communicate through
this with its built-in speakerphone
which you can either turn on or off at
your discretion and through my testing
the audio quality is done very well it
picks up small ambient noises - so the
mic is sensitive enough to pick up baby
noises even though the Dropcam isn't too
close to the source but what also makes
this Dropcam great is it's night vision
this works in pitch black no nightlight
no lamps on nothing and as you can see
on the screen it works well and the
video quality is still very fluid the
night vision is automatic so if the room
gets too dark night vision kicks on
without you needing to remember now all
the features I've mentioned so far are
free the Dropcam works over your Wi-Fi
so there's no service for video being
streamed to your phone or tablet while
away from your home and as long as you
have Wi-Fi on you'll have 24/7 in
real-time viewership a drop cam does
offer video recording through their
cloud service for either up to 7 days or
up to 30 days at a time and it's perfect
for security or video playback in an
event of let's say a theft vandalism or
just re watching a video feed for
reference it's stored into dropcam's
cloud service so it's off-site and you
can retrieve video files later at
different location you can choose a
monthly or annual fee and yearly again
for up to those seven days of video
recording is $99 a year which isn't too
bad but the 30-day recording being
stored is 299 dollars a year and is 50%
off for additional cameras that you may
want to record as well and last Dropcam
continues to offer other small features
like scheduling specific times when the
camera will be on or off and alerts are
provided as well which is a huge benefit
the camera when it detects motion will
send an alert to your phone or email
indicating there was movement in the
vicinity and this can also be done with
the Dropcam detecting sound as well now
the app at least on my iPad can display
four camera feeds at the same time
there's also live cameras where people
are streaming their feeds from different
parts of the world as well and last but
not least you can invite your friends to
view your stream or make your video
public just like what I'm showing here
so with all these features and the drum
camp being very easy to use and as
evident as you can see on the video the
quality is amazing it's no wonder why
this is the number one best seller of
surveillance equipment on amazon.com
currently so you really do get what you
pay for so that's about it I hope this
video helped you in some way please be

me for more videos in the near future
