room welcome back to another video my
car is now faced with you get back with
the show here welcome to episode number
three on let's talk to
all right folks oh there's tons of stuff
to talk about considering last week was
a bunch of headlines first topic AT&amp;amp;T in
Time Warner I want to see how it affects
the average consumer considering Time
Warner basically if you guys don't know
they offer a cable TV and at home
internet and AT&amp;amp;T basically provides
cell phone service and data but what do
they do what are they doing basically
Time Warner is a content provider and
for those who don't know besides their
TV and Internet they own Warner Brothers
CNN TNT the own DC Entertainment the
guys who makes Batman vs Superman the
movies in the theaters they basically
own that they have a 10% stake or share
in Hulu small stake there but anyways
they own a lot of content what I believe
and this is my personal opinion here
guys in the comment section below let me
know what you guys think and how this
could impact you guys considering that
people are moving away from TV
traditional TV and moving onto here 18c
I believe can provide that medium that
platform for Time Warner to take
advantage of and provide content to us
and then if you guys think about it with
Facebook as great as it is as a social
platform we're able to share pictures
and check up on each other whatever it
may be but Facebook's huge huge
moneymaker is data collection learning
learning about the human psychology and
18t is no question of course doing that
as well all these companies Google is a
collecting data in how we use our
devices and with those two combined
together we're getting much more
effective ads and that's what I think is
going to happen of course and the
positive side of things just thinking
optimistically more content on our
phones since we're not consuming so much
on our TVs anymore which is great for us
since we're always on the go
and of course technology's gonna
continue improving on these cell phones
especially cell phone data transfer
rates but at the same time on the
horrible side of things for consumers
like I talked about time warner a lot
they have won monopoly in certain
regions of the united states and there's
expensive prices the prices this goes up
for us and it's really really
unfortunate so good side content bad
side monopoly prices may go up they
control more the data more of the
content so
petition is basically that much more
restricted
so anyways any comment section below
what do you guys think about that of
these two companies of course it has it
goes through regulation we'll see if it
gets passed second thing here
Nintendo switch that thing looks crazy
sick that was just announced this past
week it's gonna be really interesting
and I'm glad that Nintendo is staying
original I believe that they're not
trying to fight and be a mainstream
console like a playstation like an Xbox
they want to be a niche group
I do wish though that they further
expanded beyond their core team like
Mario and Zelda they're great characters
great stories very nostalgic but also we
I think we need more content to attract
more people to Nintendo overall but the
concept of having a tablet where the
brains are in there you can travel
anywhere and use it and having two
controllers basically attached to the
side that's great
my question this wasn't announced yet
what is the battery life on that tablet
so that'd be really interesting let me
know if you guys are excited about that
I know a lot of people are like holy cow
this is really original it's really cool
I'm hoping that content comes along with
that as well and as a niche console but
also a console just like what the
original we did where a lot of people
enjoyed playing it so we'll see I'm
wishing the best for them it's a system
that I grew up with way back when
Nintendo was wasn't it it was just a
Nintendo before Super Nintendo before
all these fancy names and numbers next
topic here Bose has released a new pair
of earphones I'm gonna definitely be
checking that out for you guys also the
Bose Soundlink color 2 is coming as well
definitely trying to get that on the
calendar here that came to him surprise
for me also I have these Sony headphones
a lot of you guys have it ask me about
this I have finished reviewing these
testing these specifically but I am in
the city right now about to go filming
and trying to get that video up and
ready for you guys this week also Google
pixel is at home right now been testing
playing around with that when I'm not
but when I wasn't fixing my car over the
weekend and oh and of course the LGV 20
still debating the car situation kind of
threw my budget out of whack here so
we'll see anyway guys let me know in the
comment section below what you guys
think of these topics here and
I'll see you guys on the next episode
the next few videos coming out later
this week and we're back rollin talk to
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
