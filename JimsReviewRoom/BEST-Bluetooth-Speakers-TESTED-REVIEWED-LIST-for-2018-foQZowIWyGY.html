everyone
so starting with these small category
first you gotta get the JBL flip for
this is one of the best Bluetooth
speakers in its class it's one of the
most rugged and this seriously looks
great
wrapped in nylon fabric that is
extremely rugged and with an ipx7 rating
it's capable of being submerged under
water for up to 30 minutes in up to a
meter of water basically now keep in
mind though it's sadly and unfortunately
doesn't float now I tested Bluetooth
range this has about 50 linear feet of
range and fatter life is also impressive
with my testing of 50% vom at the 14
hour mark I still had 50% a better at
life remaining also JBL connect plus
also comes with the JBL flip before
allowing you to connect up to a hundred
or actually more compatible JBL speakers
and have them all play at the same time
for $100 this is one of the best out
there as much as I want to put these
sony xba-1 ahead and pass because the
LEDs on those only shined one color it
only had an IP x4 rating meaning it was
only splash proof and the better life a
tested
these sony xba-1 inow errs versus again
the 14 hours that had got here not to
mention the XP 20 did put up pretty
sweet audio but it sounded very similar
to the flip for in the end the JBL had
more value in my personal opinion
now the second best small bluetooth
speaker on the list is the ue wonder
boom now all of the UE products can take
a beating the one herb room after
numerous drops their numerous drops that
is and after being buried in mud can
survive after repeated abuse also
considering the flip floor and the xB xx
it doesn't float this thankfully Kim
it's ipx7 certified mini it can be
submerged and up to a meter of water
again for up to 30 minutes making this
perfect for those taking this to the
lake or bringing this near the pool a
better life is good with 10 hours and 20
minutes at 50% Vaughn and Bluetooth
range is claimed at a hundred feet and
worked throughout my entire house inside
the office here it was perfectly fine
going through the floors and walls now
as far as the audio experience goes the
wonder boom isn't as bassy or deep as
the other small class speakers not even
close so you do lose that but it
provides for mids and an enjoyable
casual sound not to mention this thing
outputs 360 degree audio while most
other speakers can't this one is going
for $99 but again I'll leave my links in
that better description check out those
for the most updated prices now moving
on to the medium-size speakers JBL does
kill it with Bluetooth speakers at least
for the last year or two I personally
recommend each charge three with it's
amazing better life at 20 hours and 48
minutes of testing time
the speaker is IP 7 rated so it can be
submerged in water but better yep it
does float with my test in the same time
it's braided just like the other flip
floor here to give it that strong
abrasion resistant coating the charge
story does have the new JBL connect plus
feature allowing you to connect to
practically an infinite amount of
speakers so they can all play at the
same time it does have to have JBL
connect plus the additional benefit of
getting this over the others you can
charge your phone as there's a USB out
on the back behind this little flap or
cover right here having a speaker will
work just like a power bank now both
with ranges reaching 40 linear feets but
if you want a wired connection there is
a 3.5 millimeter port on the back
here as well no audio wise isn't that
360 degrees
I'll put basically but the charge three
is one of the most direct fiery speakers
that is available this would surely fill
up a small to medium-sized room and
somewhat pushes large rooms as well the
audio signature is bright and forward
and the highs are never too harsh to
become distorting this one goes for $150
and it's the mids here I highly
recommend that has tons of value now
second I'm a mid tier speakers this is
the time I'll recommend the Sony speaker
it's the sony xba-1 as does the durable
housing like the rest of the lineup
unfortunately speakers only splash-proof
with an IP x4 rating you cannot submerge
this thing I said it does offer
something similar to you ease develop or
JBL connect plus but Sony is limited to
10 speakers which is surely enough
honestly for most people Bluetooth range
you get about 60 linear feet from my
testing here and as for a better life
you'll be getting around 15 hours at
moderate volume with the LEDs um the
biggest perk or reason why you would get
these is because of those LEDs they
pulsating strobe like the smaller model
but they now come in a variety of colors
that can be customized with the app now
lastly with the XP 30 you get a punchy
bass boosted sound signature that's
slightly deeper than a charged three
foot Ford and bright mids as well the
highs were slightly rolled back but
overall this speaker has great audio
especially here comes for $89 and yes
this is a mid tier I'll repeat its going
for $89 and Sony's websites or again you
can check out my Amazon affiliate links
in that video description now last up
and yes it's another JBL speaker but I'm
sure it's going to be a conversation
starter and I don't have at my desk here
I'll be right back give me a second
alright there we go I think I got it
working now so all these colors can be
customized the patterns can be
customized as well and the upholstery
this will surely be a conversation
starter for friends and guests that are
stopping by
now this speaker is super glossy and
feels but like hard plastic up top it
might be class so it's something to be
careful about it is also a fingerprint
prone as well though it's hard to tell
when it's it when it is illuminated
basically Bluetooth range is right
around sixty four linear feet and the
better life does take a hit here as the
speaker has to power all these LEDs in
my testing it reached just over seven
hours it's really a trade-off between
lighting in the battery life now as for
these sound experience the pulse is
slightly above neutral but not quite
bass boosted as the JBL charge three I
can't quite hit the depth of the xB
thirty as well but again what you're
paying for is the light show basically
although the audio is not at the level
of the two other speakers it's still
good audio in general now the mids are
very much forward as well
you do get 360 degree sound you do lose
a little bit of that attack I guess you
can say but it's still very much capable
of filling up small to medium sized
rooms again at $200 I still recommend
this thing it's a conversation piece no
matter what wherever you place this in
your household so jumping into big
speakers if you're on the fence of the
revolve or the revolve Plus from Bose
spend a little extra money I highly
recommend to get the Plus model now this
sounds much better
the speaker is compact especially for
our large speaker category and the
aluminum body and handle makes the
overall shape very convenient it's also
bump resistant it has an IP x4
certification it's somewhat durable but
perhaps better as an indoor speaker and
basically for light outdoor use as where
Bluetooth I did reach 40 litre feet in
my testing and the better died after 10
hours of playing at 50% finally our
recent updates allows the bose revolved
plus to interact with Amazon Alexa
providing a better alternative to the UE
mega blast now in a large room the Raval
plus fills up that space very adequately
here especially when paired with an
another Bose speaker in party mode
overall this speaker is it as durable as
some of the other speakers on the list
I'll omit that but it does provide loud
bounce amp with 360 degree audio and
that most recent firmer offering
amazon's assistance is seriously a plus
it boasts roof all plus is going for
$300 now next up on my list here if
you're wanting something
ultra rugged the fugu XL after my
testing proves that it's a tank it's an
older speaker but it's ipx7 rated which
means that I can submerge this
underwater but once I was done with my
testing I did confirm that it could
float the mega
doesn't and the JBL extreme is only
splash-proof as well
now the fugu excel it's rock solid dust
proof and shock resistant to prove this
I dropped this repeatedly and nothing
came about from it it's still working
perfectly fine today a better life is
one of the best here at 37 and a half
hours with medium volume the other big
speakers are not even close to that
unless this is perfect for an outdoor
speaker there's 360-degree audio this
because I'm literally every side now
fugu does have a basic sound signature
and once in a while may muddle the
mid-range of bits on bass heavy music
the mid-range is neutral and it isn't
bright too overpowered and the high
frequencies plays without Distortion now
with a price tag of $200 it's on the
cheaper end of large bluetooth speakers
in my list but comes with tons of
features for those looking for something
absolutely rugged so alright folks to
the very last one here I know the Jay
Bell extreme is what you thinking of
it's honestly an amazing speaker I still
highly recommend it and if you don't
purchase the one I'm about to show you
the extreme is the perfect alternative
but keep in mind the extreme is honestly
starting to show its age though it's
only splash proof the extreme only has
15 hours of battery life while others
are offering much born now and last
there's a cheaper option out there the
biggest reason why I still recommend the
extreme it is or has one of the best
audio quality characteristics coming out
of a portable bluetooth speaker
it's basically bright forward and simply
in-your-face audio while keeping most of
the audio quality intact now with that
being said though I gotta hand it over
to this here this is the sony xba-40
it's going for a hundred and fifty
dollars right now offers up to 24 hours
of battery life and the audio signature
it sounds very similar to the extreme
it's only splash resistant though as
well just like the JBL extreme but
considering pricing the battery life and
obviously these crazy LEDs which I'm
probably showing on the screen right now
I think the xB 40 wins with this year's
round up now the xB 40 is loud for
medium to large rooms this looks great
with the ability to adjust the colors of
the lights here too having a strobe
effect that's not available on the xB 30
and the fact that it can go longer than
other speakers is a huge plus
now this speaker is the
best for some of my favorite genres here
EDM hip-hop pop music it accentuate the
beats and makes the music exciting and
explosive and the mid-range complements
the bass clearing detail and the highs
have no ear tinging or listening fatigue
it's perfect for small to medium sized
rooms but even pushes large room
territory overall it is my highest
recommendation of the year here and at
$150 at least at the time this video
it's a great deal if it if it goes up to
$200 I still think it's worth it alright
folks that's it for my list here I hope
it helped you in some way I know there
are tons of speakers out there to choose
from but with my testing these are the
best of the best be sure to help support
