review room welcome back to another
unboxing here so I finally ordered and
received the Sennheiser urbanite
headphones now these are new to the
market Sennheiser's really basically
aiming for beats headphones here with a
strong emphasis on bass but still of
course retain that clarity and a sound
quad that's really known for Sennheiser
now the version I have here is black it
does come in multiple colors as well and
it does currently retail for a hundred
and ninety-nine dollars now these are
the pioneers and I do actually have I
ordered these over ear ones as well and
you can check the unboxing on that a
little bit later maybe there should be a
little box that you can click or the
link is in the description once that
video is uploaded but let's take a look
around the box here and see what they do
have to offer and of course we'll go
through the unboxing so like in Jim's
review room fashion I'm gonna zoom in
just give me a second guys let me just
flip over all the way over to the back
here and then we'll look at the sides
last and it's give me a second here let
me zoom in on the the information here
alright and there's just multiple
languages on here from English all the
way down to the espanol as well but
basically it says take your club with
you massive base and clear treble tough
companion it's extra rugged for robust
urban living and it says they connected
control your music and calls I'm
assuming that's through the the wire
that's supplied and his basis as a fifth
your life fold them up and go so it pops
you in the picture here does fold and go
for you going down here is the technical
specifications and let's see what we got
here at least I'm not too focused
normally on the technical specs here and
I basically when I do the review I
basically listen it as as a standpoint
of the average consumer just looking for
a good product but all the information
is right there for you it looks like
does get pretty loud 118 decibels I
think that's a little bit higher than
some of the other headphones out there
that I review but like I said I don't
focus too much on the numbers here let's
look at the sides here just give me a
second we're gonna zoom out and alright
folks it goes the right side of the box
here again starting with a two year
warranty that is offered by Sennheiser
these are made for Apple products on
here that basically that's what the
controller is you
for I believe if you go on these
Sennheiser website you can select not
only of course Apple products but there
are other Android products like the
Samsung Galaxy the HTC phones etc so you
definitely check out their website if
you need a headset or headphone that is
compatible with your device but again
this is the you can say the Apple
version here that works with iOS going
down here a little bit a little diagram
of just showing it's collapsible and
another diagram here just showing that
is on your headphones now rotating all
the way to the left here again this I
guess goes into a little bit more detail
regarding the microphone that works for
your iOS device it says easily control
your iPhone with Smart Remote and inline
mic turn volume up and down play pause
answer end and reject phone calls skip
to the next to previous track activate
voice control which is pretty standard
this is another language here and let's
see down here exchangeable cable of
course that comes with the box here and
a nice little feature here indicating
what comes in the box of course the
headphones themselves the audio cable
and it looks like a carrying case here
as well so we'll take a look at this
here and all the information is right
there as well for you in English and
let's get to unboxing this just give me
a second I'm gonna zoom out for you guys
alright and let's get unboxing for you
guys here
of course inside you have your
instruction manual here with all your
good information to read upon the
carrying case it comes actually in a
neoprene kind of materia here it looks
like a with a mix of cotton as well
no Sennheiser up there is the
senate-house your logo here it's pretty
subtle on the top left here and you can
see how big it is right there for you
guys so I'll just leave that to the side
here
very simple box no hard case
kind of shocking usually the with the
other headphones that I've reviewed from
ascent headset Sennheiser I'm sorry does
come with a little bit of a harder
carrying case instead of a neoprene bag
you can say oh these are tangle free
cords here as you can see they are lay
flat cables they're not your typical
round cable and of course your
three-and-a-half millimeter input ports
here and give you thing I'm gonna zoom
in for you guys just so you can see a
little bit more detail and one of the
most is with a ninety degree angle the
other side doesn't like it has a little
small locking mechanism as well that
probably goes into the headset just to
prevent it from falling out it's a nice
feature that actually some of the
headsets don't even provide then here
goes the inline volume control this
looks actually pretty diesel it's one of
the bigger ones that I've seen and let's
see how it feels here very clicky
buttons very nice tactile feedback
there's an also in the middle here as
well it's like a rubberized button for
answering phone calls probably and
pausing and playing music now on the
back here there's several holes here
especially one right here I'm sure
that's the inline mic as well for
answering phone calls and whatnot
alright and there you go folks and
really cool design I wasn't expecting
this it's actually white stitched here
with a white band on the inside and it's
actually not Hardy there's like a slight
little cushion in there that's really
unique it's a very very smooth finish
here I mean it's like cool to the touch
as well
very smooth a little bit of padding I
love the white stitching it gives it a
little bit more contrast there and
especially with the the white bands
around the ear cups of themselves so let
me move this box out the way here I
think that should be it give me this
like I'm going to zoom out
not bad at all it's a definitely unique
style they are focusing more towards the
the urban side you can say of of
headphone designs and in particular
lightweight in general Sennheiser
doesn't make pretty lightweight
headphones overall the feel of this is
actually diesel I mean just holding this
part here it's like solid plastic up
even to the band it's very it's pretty
stiff as I still flexible but pretty
stiff let's just see hopefully it
doesn't snap on me here not too bad at
all no cracking didn't feel anything a
compromise day you can say let's pull
this out here Oh actually slides on this
mechanism very similar to the an ear
Momentum's that I reviewed a couple of
months ago you can say I'm gonna zoom in
a little bit for you guys and it does
feature that sliding up and down
mechanism so a little bit more of a
groove here so he can once it once it's
on your head you can slide it down so
that's a nice little touch there and it
does stay pretty firm here too
barely any sliding there for you guys
and let's see wires are enclosed here
and it is adjustable that looks like
that's good metal construction here what
six screws or so same thing on the other
side overall the build quality seems
really top-notch and they at least how
they do fold in as shown so it doesn't
you know does get a little bit compact
here for you guys
Sennheiser logos on the left and
urbanite on the right side here with
these Sennheiser logo and there goes
through ports to inputs the
three-and-a-half millimeter poor here
just slide that in I just twist that
there you go and it is a locking
mechanism indeed doesn't slide off with
you guys all right so I think that
should be it they're very very nice
rugged design there's no question about
it it's a little bit thicker when
compared to other headbands but like I
said I'll give it the test of course
wear it for for a good bit here I'm
gonna have to break these in and for a
couple hours straight and then we'll
test out the audio quality and test out
the fitment hopefully um these do fit my
head pretty well normally with headsets
or headphones in general sometimes they
do clamp a little bit too much on a
jawline David's a little
- pressure on the crown of the head so
those are the things that I particularly
look out for I want to make sure that
these are comfortable for long extended
wear time but again very nice finish I
mean there's like a little chrome accent
right here as well it's like these
little subtle details that really makes
these shine you can say regarding the
ear cups ear pads and sorry I didn't
discuss that earlier but these got a
feel like a really smooth velour
material here not as plush as I thought
it would be but overall it's a very soft
texture so it should feel good on the
ears but like I said the only way I can
tell this is by wearing these for you
know for a couple hours straight and
just seeing how the comfort test feels
so that's about it of course light
subscribe to Jim's review room here find
me on Facebook Twitter and Google+ and
like I said look out for the urbanite
over ears or the urbanite unboxing and
we'll get that I'll get that out to you
guys pretty shortly here but more to
come later this month here I'm excited
to tell you guys I got a job or Sport+
where as it gave me a second here no I
got it someone let me see if I can find
it here these are the Jabra pulse and
these are brand new to the market as
well this actually records your
heartbeat in-ear so these are pretty
interesting just got back from Jaybirds
press-conference awesome people out
there they was nice enough to give me a
set of brand new blue blood X camo
editions yet to be released on the
market for me to test out and see how
those go and of course I have I think
two or three other audio products coming
on Monday and of course the jaybird rain
which is brand-new as well that's to be
unboxed and reviewed pretty shortly as
