a few days ago I had reviewed the bigger
brother the revolve + I very much
enjoyed it it sounded great in my
opinion and despite some of its
shortcomings I still highly recommended
it today we're looking at the smaller
version the revolve that I personally
paid for at the retail price of $199 at
the time this video and as always I'll
leave my Amazon affiliate links down in
the video description below click on my
links and they'll give you the most
updated prices in real time you never
know when these things might go on sale
so without further ado I'm here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to another review
going over the physical features first
this thing is perfect for traveling and
small and compact it's shorter than the
JBL tip 4 and the diameter is nearly the
same just to give you some reference or
context of how small this speaker is and
for those wondering what are the main
differences between this model and the
$300 bose revolve plus model you get a
carrying handle on the bigger version
the bigger speaker of course is larger
for improved audio performance and last
the plus model gets up to 16 hours a
better life versus 12 this particular
one that I'm reviewing here today and
besides just those three differences
everything else is practically identical
now what you do get is the same metal
build quality which is exceptional all
the way around you get the same ipx4
rated splash resistance which I would
have preferred full waterproofing just
in case this drops into the pool or
having it on the boat does give you more
peace of mind and last the same drop
resistance is available and offered here
as well as with my other reviews I've
dropped this thing several times here to
demo for you guys and it is still going
strong now I'm taking a look at the top
all of your buttons are labeled on your
Street and pause if you need to but the
very bottom button here the
multifunction button that is allows you
to skip and go back and songs and answer
phone calls for a speakerphone it does
do better than most other Bluetooth
speakers on the market especially when
you move further away from the speaker
the audio does not get worse here and
your voice for the most part still stays
at the same volume levels now getting
back to the tactile buttons and features
holding both volume up and down will
turn on or off voice prompts which some
do prefer and when turning on the
speaker you will receive battery level
remaining which is always a huge plus in
my book and holding down bluetooth
pairing and vibe up or down will enable
party mode or stereo mode allowing for
two compatible Bose speakers to play at
the same time or left and right audio
channels respectively the very last
button is the input selector you can
toggle between aux audio or USB audio
both of those connections are on the
rear and the micro USB cord when
connected to your PC of course can play
music here but it also recharges your
speaker at the same time now touching
based on battery performance Bose claims
up to 12 hours of life I was able to get
10 hours and 50 minutes of use to be
exact at
50% volume when comparing to the
competition at the $200 price tag
there's many other speakers that does
better and cheaper too but for its size
which Alma is very portable it performs
on average so - the moment you've been
waiting for here I'll play several
samples of audio for you guys and then
I'll give you my verdict afterwards
and there you have it folks as a side
note I know many of you were asking for
a direct comparison between this speaker
versus the Soundlink mini to since they
were similar in price I will have a
versus video up in the next day or two
so be on the lookout but for now here
evolve on its own and comparing in
general to the competition it's indeed
loud for such a small speaker here it
provides ample sound for small to medium
sized rooms for sure large open rooms
about 40 linear feet in all directions
the signal never cuts out here and a
speaker is still capable of providing an
entertaining experience which is highly
impressive again for its small size no
one caveat though when you're trying to
fill up a large room bass can be
overwhelming when volume is all the way
up if you happen to walk by and be
around 7 to 10 feet away from the
speaker there's a significant amount of
distortion that can be heard now outside
of that 10 foot radius or more it's not
quite as bad but I also tested this at
medium volume again uncertain bass heavy
tracks the base is still unfortunately
overpowering where you do lose some
quality in the vocals now with that
being said those standing further away
and not so basic tracks the speaker does
sound great though in my opinion and it
has more impact than the JBL flip for
the JBL charge 3 and the ue boom - all
those speakers of course i have tested
and compared right here on this channel
now getting into vocal performance and
the mid-range frequencies when bass is
not spilling over the vocals do provide
a warmer more resonating tone which i
know some would prefer for non-basic
tracks the vocals are clear and
pronounced not as for - some of the
other speakers on the markets I do wish
it was a bit more forward though for my
personal taste but it's still very much
enjoyable last are the high notes which
were not tinny or ear ringing even at
high volumes which is always a huge plus
here and because of the full 360 degrees
sound that you get here which helps
greatly in filling up a room you do lose
the open soundstage that you'd get with
other Bose Bluetooth products it's
essentially give or take last up in
briefly showing you the Bose app it
gives you better life provides a list of
devices connected and switching to party
or stereo mode is done remotely which is
convenient what is missing though our
sound profiles
a built-in equalizer if you prefer to
have everything done in one app so in
the end here yes the base is quite
overwhelming where you do lose some
audio quality but hundred the right
circumstances again medium vibe more
using this preferably outdoors it does
sound great I would at least hear it for
myself first as the speaker does offer
much more punch than the competitors and
offers 360 degrees sound I think those
who prefer a flatter sound signature or
they are a bit more analytical they
might not enjoy the speaker too much but
the average consumer I think most will
find this speaker enjoyable so that's it
