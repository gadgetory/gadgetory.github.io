room considering I've gotten my gaming
rig built here on this channel I also
have that 4k TV in the back for my
consoles the last missing piece is it
gave me headset to bridge the gap I'm
huge at audio as you guys can tell him
to channel here and some of my headsets
in the past we're great on PC but they
all converted to a 35-millimeter plug
that connected into my controller with
my PlayStation 4 the best audio output
now a SteelSeries released their newest
artist Pro line their best of the best
headsets available at the time of this
video and it comes with a digital to
analog converter as always being
transparent with you guys they did
sponsor this video but I'm going to go
through both pros and cons I'll leave
links down in that video description
below the link will take you to
SteelSeries comm for more information
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
now I have both the artist Pro Plus game
deck and the artist Pro Wireless both of
these were for PC and PlayStation 4 now
both these headsets look nearly
identical same metal band up top here
wrapped in a soft and stretching ski
goggles in here matte black finish all
the way around same plastic yet durable
arms extending to the ear cups now doing
my vent test which I'm aware is overkill
but not trying to break these I'm trying
to see if there's any kind of chatter
creaking rattling that would show any
kind of weak spots or cheap build
quality I don't see any or hear any
issues whatsoever but ear cups are
closed back with back plates which are
easily removable the Pro Plus model that
I have run mine neck here it does have
RGB lighting partially controllable
within the deck fully customizable
though with any SteelSeries engine
software which unfortunately was not
available during the time of me testing
the wireless model does not have our
jeebies
now both headsets features nearly
identical buttons the craftsmanship and
detail are one of the best for sure here
for my assessment all are very premium
feeling super grippy with no issues
whatsoever in determining where you are
trying to button locate during gameplay
now on screen are basically what all the
features are offered but the wireless
model having an additional micro USB
port for charging the headsets and then
on their right ear cup and you have
power and bluetooth pairing now with the
pro wireless model I did confirm you are
able to use the headset with the
wireless transmitter for in-game audio
of course and you're able to activate
bluetooth at the same time to let's say
listen to music in the background or for
those who use discord you can use the
chat feature on discord while playing
PlayStation 4 for those who might intend
on using these for or as regular
headphones basically for music listening
away from home and transit with your
smartphone I was able to verify
Bluetooth signal 64 linear feet was how
far I could get before the signal
started to crackle and for gaming for
the wireless transmitter on the wireless
model it does use 2.4 gigahertz
frequency with low latency I was able to
confirm 48 linear feet before the audio
started to crackle so right before I
started talking about comfort I
absolutely love this feature here you
can share your audio from one of these
headsets
to any other pair of headphones for this
is a first time for me but could
acting at 3 1/2 millimeter chord from
one headset to another brand it doesn't
have to be SteelSeries you're able to
split the audio connection your friend
just won't have these same surround
sound performance but at least both you
guys can sit there and hear what's going
on on the screen now getting back to
that physical features let's talk about
comfort and both headsets are average in
weight with other premiums here at
headsets the wired version comes in at
350 gram the wireless version comes in
at 375 grams not making these any
lighter or heavier than most of the
other headsets on the market now a
slight partner for me here I was hoping
there'd be lighter now while wearing
these for several hours straight it took
some time to get used to at first I did
feel a slight pinch at the crown of my
head here but after extending the band
and finding that sweet spot these
performed on par with the competitors
comfortable enough but I was again
hoping for hence if these days to feel
even lighter now although the wireless
model was heavier though than these are
wired ones there wasn't much of a
difference in experience the ear pads
are comfortable for me and work in a 72
degree room office basically for a
little over 2 hours straight gaming I've
never had any kind of ear sweats or
weird fatigue around the ears
now last up on the probe wireless model
thankfully behind this backplate here
there is a replaceable battery the
retail package does offer two batteries
and each one of these lasts up to 10
hours which is great a huge benefit when
one battery dies there's already another
one that's pushed in or inside the
gaming wireless transmitter itself so
that way you'll never have to recharge
your batteries essentially you might
never have to be encountered or
encounter a dead battery situation now
these headsets included a retractable
mic highly positionable both headsets
features RGB lighting at the end here
for you to customize here's a quick
audio sample alright folks here is the
microphone test is completely unedited
completely natural here now we've tested
some pretty darn good headsets with some
very good mics in the past I've noticed
even the good ones these sound nasally
they make me sound a little bit
congested you guys hearing a 100%
natural here this is probably the least
congested that I've sounded so far this
one the best microphones for gaming that
I have used now it's a test out
background noise just case you have
like your I don't know your mom yelling
you in the background your brother's
playing around your dad's you know not
being quiet while you're playing let's
test out some background noise Ian can
just say something in the background I
don't know I'm are you good at fortnight
man by any chance
he said he's pretty terrible I don't
have you guys heard that but we'll find
out in post-production but he had this
is the most natural test here completely
unedited back to the review alright
folks getting into the digital to analog
converter on the Pro Plus model now
SteelSeries offers their own DAC but
this is gaming first certified high res
audio system SteelSeries is claiming up
to 40,000 Hertz are reproduced while
standard headsets produced 20 mm they
also claimed their ESS saber chip gives
off high fidelity full resolution audio
Plus this is the first ever headset to
offer DTS X version 2 sounds amazing and
sounds promising but let's see what the
deck offers first and then I'll give you
my audio test right afterwards
now the Pro Plus game deck model is a
small module that's connected via USB no
need to connect the supplied optical
cable if you're using this on
PlayStation 4 you need to then connect
both connections now everything feels
high-quality and responsive just like
the headset themselves but the plastic
screen covering the OLED display it's
unfortunately very easily scratch Apple
the informational screen is very much
viewable in even bright rooms situations
bright light situation and it's very
straightforward and easy to use both
headsets do offer a built-in equalizer
and these headsets tune very well here
making subtle adjustments does reflect
in the audio experience and thankfully
it doesn't distort the audio mixer makes
for fine tuning the in-game chat and
your gaming audio very easy as well I'll
take a closer look at the Pro Bowlers
model it is slightly different it's a
slightly different interface that
utilize err is still present and like on
both headsets you can control own
allowing you to control how much you can
hear your own voice in game so alright
folks please put on your headphones and
earphones for the audio test I'll be
using binaural microphones to give you
the best the 3d audio experience as a
heads up and then use their built-in
equalizer to give the best audio
experience that I could here it goes
traveling I could select you're here
I've got you in my sights
and there you have it folks
first up both headsets perform very
similar to each other despite one being
on a dedicated deck while the other one
is on a wireless transmitter now both
were able to get loud enough for
comfortable and just enough for
competitive gaming that if they were not
loud enough for you be sure to adjust
the vibe limiter on the deck or wireless
transmitter now seconds when you're
putting these on for the first time
they're going to sound extremely well
balanced but also very flats gonna be
flat across the board and I would highly
recommend to customize the equalizer to
the way that you want it to here's a
quick demo
now once I tuned it the base was much
deeper for explosions footsteps and
objects dropping in-game the mid-range
and high notes were pushed a bit more
forward making me more my new details
much more appearance not to mention my
spacial awareness was increased quite a
bit the audio from footsteps to
directions of gunshots were improved and
maybe immersion that much more enjoyable
and it does give you a much more
competitive edge the fortnight worked
well with hearing gunshots off in a
distance and hearing where it was coming
from identifying where the competition
might be perched up and sniping from
during my time testing it's no question
highly detailed from my experience with
no listening fatigue no screeching
pierces from bullets here overall a very
balanced headset one flat but also
highly tuneable when you use the EQ now
overall the biggest highlight from the
artists Pro line is how clean the audio
is and how accurate it can be now the
only critique is wishing there was more
of an open soundstage in general I
wanted just a little bit more audio
separation and just a airiness that you
get some from games at times now the
last benefit these headsets also work on
the PlayStation 4 and it makes a world
of difference I had the same performance
on my PlayStation 4 as I did on my PC
but I've been using a typical 3.5
millimeter pair of headphones or
earphones and when playing over the
years making that transition over to the
DAC for the first time tremendously
helps your or bring out the surround
sound experience by considering this is
an all-in-one audio system that works
across the board here there's value
there rather than buying two separate
headsets so I hope this video helped you
in some way be sure to LIKE and
subscribe if you haven't already visit
SteelSeries comm for more information on
these headsets again I'll have my links
down below
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision you guys take care now see you
on the next one bye
