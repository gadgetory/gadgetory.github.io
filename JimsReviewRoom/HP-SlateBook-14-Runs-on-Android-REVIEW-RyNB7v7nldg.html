reviewer welcome to another review that
finally got something new for this month
to showcase its HP's latest the
slatebook 14 and unlike other laptops
Chromebooks and hybrids and the market
it runs on androids the same operating
system as your Android powered
smartphone or tablets the model I have
here retails for four hundred and twenty
nine dollars and accompanies some unique
specs that makes it stand out from the
rest but won't get deep into that pretty
shortly so without further adieu we'll
get stuff
size comes in at thirteen point five
four inches wide
nine point four five inches deep and
within the realm of other light fourteen
inch laptops the sleep book comes in at
just point six three inches thin and
carrying a weight of three and
three-quarters of a pound now going over
its physical construction imports it
looks almost identical with the HP
Chromebook 11
I reviewed sometime ago but with a
larger screen coming in at 14 inches the
slate gray and yellow color combination
and some other additional features I've
discussed soon now starting on your left
has a full size HDMI out USB 3.0 a
headset port and a micro SD card reader
to expand memory and transfer files and
rotating to the right side here has two
USB 2.0 inputs and the ports for the
supplied AC charger and nothing on the
front do it to its slim profile and
nothing on the back yard due to the lid
now HP offers not two but four speakers
tuned or at least labeled by Beats here
suggesting amazing sound quality and
performance and I gotta admit these
speakers are very good for a laptop that
is there's two speakers on top facing up
in two speakers under the laptop down
firing they're pretty loud for a laptop
and because there's two sets of spaced
apart you get more of that spatial sound
more full sound in general now for the
quality they're not based at all and
you're not getting that fidelity or
crisp sound as if you were by separate
speakers but at maximum volume there's
no Distortion
again the biggest benefit is that
they're loud for a laptop overall it's
truly my favorite speakers for a laptop
in this price range but overall over the
time I physically tested and experienced
the units the build quality is very well
done at this price point it's to be
expected to have an all plastic
construction and mostly everything is
solid with no real flexing of the
chassis and typically with this hinge
style for the lid the lid does stay
firmly in place the one thing that stood
out to me was when I grabbed the laptop
although it wasn't a big deal the lid
does flex a bit when pressed down a bit
more than usual that actually made me
notice again not a big deal but were
thank goodness this 14-inch screen comes
with a 1080p display and I'm almost
shocked at this price point to $400 most
laptops and Chromebooks still comes in
at a 768 resolution but not only that HP
includes a touchscreen which works well
in my opinion and I didn't find any
issues with the finger recognition the
screen is a glossy finish though which
does reflect light sources like windows
and table lamps directly behind you but
the trade-off glossy screens let more
light pass through and in turn the slate
book 14 does have a bit more vibrancy or
contrast to its picture quality the
colors are accurate and a pleasure to
look at when watching something in full
1080p now moving on to its internal
specifications this is where HP
differentiates itself from many of the
laptops and Chromebooks available today
instead of an intel or AMD processor
which is pretty common HP has chosen to
go with a 1.8 gigahertz quad-core Tegra
4 processor from Nvidia an Nvidia makes
amazing graphic cards for gamers great
for professionals in 3d rendering
drawing and engineering but they're also
one of the leaders heading into
automobile infotainment sensors and
video in general is a reputable company
but how does it perform what the other
specs included but a slate book 14 also
comes with just two gigs of RAM which I
was hoping for three as being the
standard nowadays 32 gigabytes of
internal storage and last it runs on the
older operating system Android version
4.3 jelly bean hoping that an upgrade to
4.4 or when Android L will be released
later this year that Google and HP can
offer an update to us now for
connectivity Bluetooth comes standard
and so does wireless a B G and n
connections unfortunately the latest
wireless AC technologies in that present
here but Wireless M is still a great
standard for the time being and as
stated before my channels never too
techie but benchmarks are on your screen
right now that I performed and you can
perform them yourself and compare some
numbers to your liking pause the video
if you need to but my test involves real
world usage for the average consumer now
this includes a randomly surfing the
internet
playing a movie streaming Pandora or
SoundCloud the actual use the average
person would encounter now overall the
speed and fluid miss is there for the
most part incurring really no issues
when using it normally the only time is
slowed down somewhat was when I had two
games open while downloading a large app
and having another seven apps open I
believe a bit overkill but nonetheless
it works perfectly fine for casual to
even decent workloads please feel free
to watch the random examples on the
screen while I discuss the Android
experience now being familiar with
Android on either a phone or tablet
popping over to a laptop format through
the slate book has been a difference but
still a very good experience it feels
almost like a cross between a Chromebook
and a tablet it really takes the best of
both worlds though at the same time for
example from Chromebooks you have a full
keyboard and trackpad built in for
increased productivity a huge screen
when compared to tablets and you have
all these PC connections as well connect
on external hard drive or use a USB
flash drive at your discretion but from
the tablet world you'd get the huge
amounts of apps and games that are
available in the Google Play Store
unlike Google OS and it's anonymous
operating system to your current phone
or tablet and coming from Windows 7 or
Windows 8 if you're looking for a casual
laptop with the fluidity of Android and
its robust lineup of apps this is the
way to go now if I could sum this all up
the slate book makes Android feel like a
productivity powerhouse while still
offering that fun aspect of all your
well known apps and out like Chromebooks
but the Android experience in my opinion
for the average consumer opens up much
more doors with what's currently
available again in the Google Play Store
but coming from Windows it's a matter of
preference and budgets and just $400 you
get a 1080p touchscreen a thin build and
if you're all into just typing papers
watching movies surfing the internet
it's perfectly fine all for four hundred
and twenty nine dollars cheaper than any
Windows laptop with similar screen
resolutions now going over its layout
the main desktop looks identical to your
phone or tablet with the back button
recent apps and home button on the
bottom of the screen a top left and
right are pulled down to review your
and access your settings either by using
the trackpad and clicking on it twice
and on the second click you pull down
but pulling down the screen works much
faster now with the trackpad you can use
two fingers to swipe left or right to
access other parts of your desktop and
considering this is a laptop having the
simple feature alone makes it very
convenient to organize all of your
information one page can be of your
productivity widgets including calendar
notes and notifications while the other
page can be reserved for things like
your office or productivity apps or
gaming related kind of like live tiles
for Windows 8 but with more useful
information displayed with your own
customization now another huge benefit
as stated earlier I can connect a
peripheral to this using a Bluetooth
mouse when using Android apps opens a
brand new experience specifically in
gaming and any game that works with a
mouse works pretty amazing the Minecraft
Pocket Edition is a perfect example it
does give you a little bit more freedom
with the mouse but again these apps most
of these apps are still tailored for
that touchscreen experience so just keep
that in mind now typing on the keyboard
is very quiet with the tic-tac keys
performing as normal with no issues or
nothing stellar to speak of at the same
time the trackpad on the other hand
though was a slight nuisance for me as
it's quite firm if you ever need to
press down for a click a trackpad is
more sensitive on the bottom and
sometimes clicking on the middle of the
trackpad doesn't do anything at all and
one thing I wanted to mention the
keyboard has your home button and recent
apps button right on the keyboard making
you able to switch between apps very
quick and I know it's such a simple yet
in my new feature but it does make the
experience that much faster and fluid in
my opinion so overall with the unit in
use and on my lap because it's fanless
and virtually silent though when in use
very slight heat does build up like a
normal laptop though found on the top
rear with no sensations of feeling
uncomfortable but when gaming however it
does get a little bit warm in that area
now with all that being said HP claims
up to nine hours of news with me testing
a unit LF brightness on at 50% to get an
equal base and we can make judgment from
there Wi-Fi is on the entire time
leaving Pandora on as well running at
least one movie and the rest of the time
randomly surfing the internet with some
random downloads and games being played
now real-world testing was able to
achieve
hours and 45 minutes of news from a full
charge with 5% battery remaining
and the unit does shut down when only 4%
is left so if you had a little bit of a
lower brightness you might be able to
achieve a little bit more time and if
you're more into gaming and possibly
video watching you might get a little
bit less than what I achieved so overall
this is a unique concept that I believe
personally works and for the price of
four hundred and $29 you get 1080p
resolution with a touchscreen a good
build for its price the Android
experience although I'm looking for an
upgrade to the latest Android that is
and the experience of having the best of
both worlds tablets and Chromebooks so
