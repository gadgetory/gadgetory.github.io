they're positive or negative but the
iPhone 6 will more than likely be here
in less than a month then no question
the world once again has its eyes on it
I'm per the Wall Street Journal Apple
reported strong sales in the most recent
quarter which just ended June 28th the
company sold thirty five point two
million iPhones which is up twelve point
seven percent compared to last year and
reporting agencies are anticipating this
iPhone 6 will sell more iPhones than any
other previous iPhone in the past so
just for fun I want you to like this
video if you like apple or playing on
buying the iPhone 6 or dislike this
video if you don't like Apple at all and
share this video and we'll try to take a
massive poll if we can I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room welcome to another
video
in this video I'll show you what's
currently going around the internet to
get you up to speed and keep in mind all
information that follows are not
confirmed by Apple just yet but what we
have here so far is Apple more than
likely announcing the iPhone 6 this
upcoming Tuesday September 9th 2014
and all my research suggested a bunch of
random dates but that's the most
predominant time frame that has seen
show up I also looked into any events
going on and the only description I
found so far was once again from The
Wall Street Journal indicating Apple is
holding a quote unquote media event on a
9th no other notes or titles were given
for this event that I could find and
given the fact that Apple has received
some criticism for being lackluster or
not being as innovative in the past with
the recent generations of iPhones that's
really hard to say considering every
iPhone has sold more units than his
predecessors and not to mention more
recently Apple is the first to offer
64-bit processing last year and this
year nearly indestructible glass again
you have to admit for us average
consumers those two products going
mainstream our market and Industry
influencers for future products to come
and given that this is the iPhone 6 and
not a s model we're looking at a pretty
big change to device the first and most
popular feature is the sapphire glass
now going back to my high school earth
science class notes the Sapphire mineral
based on Mohs scale of hardness is
nearly scratch proof with diamonds being
the only thing available to damage this
mineral
however the ever-popular mkbhd video
scratch test who is able to scratch or
create some scuffs with sandpaper ran
out in a glass which makes it very
logical or reasonable to say this is a
sapphire slash glass combination but
nonetheless however a worry-free screen
is huge alleviating majority of the
everyday encounters the phone in the
pocket the phone in the bag etc etc now
the next biggest change most likely to
come from Apple is the increase in size
from the current Apple 5s 4-inch display
and bumping it up to a 4.7 inch display
getting closer to other premium phones
and not be honest I like the small form
factor which made it easy to place in
your pocket and it really made the phone
a fuel I guess you can say even more
simple but the market is indeed wanting
more screen
real estate and if the 4.7 inch which is
on par with the HTC m8 and Galaxy s5 is
not enough ample for the first time is
possibly offering another screen option
coming in at 5.5 inches bring it into
phablet territory now that goes without
saying
high-resolution screens are a must for
the increase in screen size currently
the 5s is 11 36 by 640 giving a 326
pixel density and with my research the
numbers are all over the place so I
personally can't say what it may be but
I would only suspect the pixel density
would either remain the same maybe or
increase slightly now I don't foresee
Apple offering a quad HD screen or even
a 1080p display just yet knowing Apple
just does enough to make it visually
appealing to the masses however if fo
does offer a 1080p display on a 4.7 inch
screen we're looking at a 468 pixel
density which is phenomenal but again
we're talking about processors resources
being taken up faster battery drain etc
again limited information on this one
but I'm suspecting somewhat of an
increase regardless but speaking of
processors reporting agencies are
suspecting and all new a8 processor most
likely to be installed despite the
current a7 which hasn't been used to its
full potential yet but regardless it's
to be expected a continuing use of the
64-bit architecture and of course the
increase in performance across the board
but the thing with Apple they never been
much of a specs driven company with all
the products and correct me if I'm wrong
but they all have one gigabyte up over
him or less all the I devices that is
and the most recent chips inside only
boast a dual-core processor but at the
end of day per benchmarks and also
real-world news it's one of the better
if not best performers out there until
of course new tech comes along it's
pretty amazing to witness just half the
specs of what other manufacturers are
offering in their flagship devices and
you can still get very impressive
benchmarks it really does prove that you
don't buy device just based on megahertz
or by a camera just based on megapixels
you just can't hate Apple for that now
other leaks includes different mock-ups
of its outer aluminum casing which hints
at a slimmer phone coming in between 6
and 7 millimeters which is very thin
once you get below that 7 mm
mark even more thinner bezels on the
side which some people like or don't
like and the new operating software
which I'm sure you've seen already which
is iOS 8 the new operating system does
bring some new useful features like
extensions to help with multitasking and
interactive notifications to make the
usability more streamlined but these
features aren't necessarily original but
have been seen on existing Android
operating systems
now other possibilities that we'll see
in the iPhone 6 which aren't widely
discussed is NFC it's near field
communication offering instant pairing
to your devices and accessories but more
interesting is Apple may push forward
integrating making payments with your
iPhone obviously this has been around
for some time now but we may see Apple
again trying to make this more
mainstream that is but even more
importantly the other day I was
listening to NPR news about how phone
makers are working with health providers
to offer more health programs similar to
Samsung's s health I see Apple investing
and researching more health-related
features now keep in mind Apple back in
April of 2014 did hire two Nike FuelBand
engineers and considering an iWatch is
imminent
I think it's inevitable until we start
seeing health tracking and health
monitoring features built into the
iPhone itself but other than that all
other leaks or speculations are not as
predominant so it's hard to say if it's
even likely to come to the market items
I would like to see especially on the
iPhone is better better life and maybe a
wireless charging
I hope the iPhone like some other
competitors at the moment offers IP
certifications to ensure the iPhone will
be dust and water resistant but other
than that I'll just leave it as that so
hope you enjoyed this video there wasn't
much meat you can say since then that
much else has been leaked that's a
little bit more concrete but be sure to
like this video if you support Apple or
dislike this video if you think Apple is
just overrated or so be sure to find me
