room the skull candy crusher Wireless
has been a pair of headphones you guys
have been asking me to review for quite
some time so thanks for bring that to my
attention but getting right into this I
personally bought these at the retail
price of 199 dollars however they are on
sale through Amazon for 149 at the time
this video as always I'll place my
Amazon affiliate links in the video
description below click on my links and
they'll give you the most updated prices
in real time you never know when these
things might go on sale again so without
further ado my channels here to help you
make a purchase decision welcome
everyone
to jim's review
nor of the physical features first this
thing is built very well headphone gives
a lot of confidence when handling with
its super thick metal band on the sides
the plastics feels toughen not cheap or
flimsy here and pulling these apart
although more than the average consumer
would encounter you don't hear or feel
any plastic chattering or cracking under
stress the buttons on the right side
including down through the plus and
minus sign called the other one of these
for three seconds allows you to skip or
go back on songs the middle circle
pauses and plays your music here in
addition a DoubleTap it does activate
Siri or Google assistance on both my
Apple and Android devices respectively
now on the left ear cup you do have a
very smooth slider to adjust how much
bass you want more on that a little bit
later but this was one of my biggest
downfalls aesthetically here over time
the slider will show streaks of wear and
tear you'll see that something very
first day that you'll use these
headphones but beyond that on the bottom
is your three-and-a-half millimeter port
for physical connections and a microUSB
port for charging the headphones no
silicon is claiming up to 40 hours of
use which is insane here and left this
on for a full 48 hours at 50 percent
volume and I still had about 60 to about
70 percent battery life remaining one of
the best if not the best in the industry
from high standard tests no jumping
right into comfort comparing to other
headphones I've tested on Jim's review
these are on the heavier side when
compared to the competition while
wearing T things that I look out for is
pressure that I can feel at the crown of
the head which on the first day after
about our work and fortunately did feel
it it was more noticeable on day one
when I tested them but after the second
and third day it was a minor nuisance
and I'm now able to wear them for two
hours straight with no issues really
whatsoever and then the other area that
I look at is the jaw line and clamping
force a brand new it is firm you do feel
slight pressure right below the ear here
but after two days of testing and using
I was acclimated and didn't have any
issues there after I do which the foam
padding was a bit thicker on top and if
the ear cups could swivel a bit more
than they do currently
I think the headphones would have worked
out slightly better from the get-go
now with that being said here don't
expect these to feel like 230 grams Bose
headphones but thankfully they don't
feel like wearing bricks either now the
ear cups do feel comfortable like most
headphones my ear
do warm up but nothing alarming while
wearing these in the gyms review room
office or at home touching base quickly
on phone calls here the Skullcandy does
well for a headset hear my voice and
gives off a slight echo but my voice is
always in the forefront same with
background noises it is audible from the
recipient at the other end but my voice
does stand out and never sounded as
though I was far away the wireless
signal is superb here with walking
exactly 40 linear feet away the signal
never dropped and very last sound
leaking is apparent and these
unfortunately in a quiet room at 50%
vibe it's not super loud but someone
sitting next to you can easily hear the
vocals on the flipside here passive
sound isolation basically how much sound
is blocked out from your environment
does very well here for a passive pair
of headphones so jumping into the sound
test of course all audio is clearly
subjective but I can tell for sure these
do fall into a very niche category these
are not for everyone and with all my
reviews I strive to be completely
unbiased as I know there are definitely
those out there they would very much
enjoy these skull candies marketing
includes stereo haptic feedback and the
ability to adjust this as well so in
laymen terms simply these are bass heavy
headphones I could call it hyper bass
headphones if I could with these things
here it's seriously on a totally
different level I can only describe the
experience as if you have ever been in a
car with aftermarket subwoofers in the
trunk but getting started here with its
lowest base setting the crusher Wireless
already gives a deeper punch than bass
boosted headphones more than my Sony 650
BTS more than he Sennheiser urbanite
more than the V motocross phase that I
personally tested on the channel so far
the vocals are still pushed forward it's
a very much in your face kind of a sound
signature that is and some like this
experience as it is loud it's present
the audio doesn't need to be turned up
so loud to be enjoyable but then on the
flip side here because of that the audio
signature are of course and not accurate
since certain frequencies are severely
emphasized over the others still at its
lowest base settings the soundstage
though and the audio separation ultimate
is still very good here and you're very
much aware of where audio is coming from
left and right audio channels is a
perfect example now once you move the
bass letter up bass gets deeper
obviously
you start to feel more vibrations on
your ears here or what skill can is
calling haptic feedback the mid do
become muddy though and loses some of
that forward miss and base clearly
becomes dominant at this point if you
look into equalizer or a frequency curve
it tends to form a u-shape where there's
strong emphasis on bass mids are
slightly recessed here and highs are
still elevated if you move the slider up
3/4 to maximum there's a droning that
starts to occur and a lot of vibrations
that you can actually feel and it goes
back with my analogy of those having
aftermarket subwoofers in their cars
some do like that it's pretty intense
here of what Skullcandy offers so that
haptic feedback monitor it is there you
do get these physical vibrations in
response to audio mixing your audio a
little bit more immersive it's quite
unique here it's a bit original but it
is more of an after effect of the bass
experience that again Skullcandy
provides it wasn't a separate motor that
spun and vibrated like an Xbox or
Playstation controller like the haptic
feedback or feedback in general that an
iPhone provides now one last thing and
I'm aware this review is been quite long
here I personally didn't enjoy this so
much with music and again that's just my
personal opinion here but with movies
simply watching Netflix here Wow
that's where these headphones really did
shine though the bass was much more
tolerable but the explosion - punches
and Falls of actors here it sounded as
though I was watching a movie in IMAX a
lot of that bass will emphasize a lot of
that bass was even felt in the ears as
well I actually love these for use with
movies so at the end of the day here
even if you're a bass it I still highly
recommend to test these out first before
making a purchase if you can if you do
enjoy them Skullcandy I'm sure is going
to give you quite a unique experience
not to mention excellent build quality
and insane battery life and on the flip
side
those who prefer natural and maybe some
bass boosted audio signatures I would
think you'd be very far away from these
as much as possible these might not be
for you so write down in the comment
section below what do you think of the
skull candy crush or Wireless I'll be
very intrigued to hear what you guys
