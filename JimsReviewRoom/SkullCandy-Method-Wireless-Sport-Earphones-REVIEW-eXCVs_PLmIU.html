room a few days ago I reviewed the
Skullcandy ink you might have seen it on
the channel very similar design slightly
cheaper in price and it was super basic
today we're looking at the method
Wireless geared towards those who are
more sport oriented or those simply
wanting water resistance for peace of
mind I personally bought this at the
retail price of $59 making these one of
the cheapest pair of brand-name big-box
retailers sport earphones that I've
reviewed on the channel what I'll do is
I'll place my links in the video
description below click on my link and
they'll give you the most updated prices
as of today so without further ado the
channels here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another
going over the physical features first
compared with other brand Skullcandy is
really stepping up their game in regards
to the physical quality and feel and
although I met they're not 100% there
because they're not a high-end brand
which is very much understandable but
they usually undercut the competition
with retail prices the method Wireless
brings a lot of value it regards to its
physical build now they are flexible and
durable with a rubberized coating for
the neck band much better than the
awesome with plastic seal the wires are
somewhat thin for some but it is
adequate and slightly better than the
inked earphones the wires can also be
tucked away in the neck band itself this
shorten the cables which is a nifty
feature to have
you can also have them go all the way up
to help protect the wires a bit more
when they are in transport now looking
at the inline controller very
straightforward there's volume up and
down holding either one for three
seconds or skip or go back and a song
and the middle button is to turn on pair
and to answer phone calls the phone
calls the end we're very similar with
most other headsets with clear audio
when speaking but it does pick up
background and when noises there's not
much noise cancelling from the
microphone itself now a double tap on
that same button does activate Google
Voice Command for your Android devices
moving on through the earbuds they are
slightly rubberized giving a bit more
grip giving it more of a quality feel to
them something that I mentioned was
lacking on the ink models while wearing
this they do stay in the air for running
and jogging but one problem I usually
find on the over the neck wearing south
they do tend to bounce with the method
Wireless here I'm happy to say it barely
if moved at all while running compared
to the competition if you look at the
side profile they're built to counter
around your neck and some of those down
here to how your upper chest or clavicle
bone area there's super lightweight not
cumbersome and stable during your
activities now keep in mind these are
supported ear films and Skullcandy
promotes these are sweat resistant and
with my quick testing of spring water
all over these they still function
perfectly fine I would of course not get
these wet too often but there is some
protection nonetheless in regards to
comfort there's only two ear tips
included and somewhat limiting for
people however I did find these small
ear tips works perfectly fine for my
small ear canals but one thing I did
notice though the port designs is quite
unique here they're oblong and again
they wet in the ear fine but
because of this design it causes more
noise to leak out and more noise from my
surrounding environment to leak in not
by much for comparing these back-to-back
with other earphones I can tell a slight
difference now those who are more active
may prefer this for safety reasons while
running and trying to hear your
surroundings while others may want
something more sealed for more immersion
into their audio the last up here
regarding better lifestyle can is
claiming up to nine hours of use like
all my audio reviews at 50% volume to
get a middle of the ground result I was
able to get 11 hours and about thirty
minutes worth of use which is not bad at
all
recharging is done with the supplied
microUSB cable and recharging on average
takes upwards over two hours to do from
a dead battery so last but not least
here how is the audio performance right
off the bat these are better than the
Inked wireless noun say get these over
those these do get loud and for sure
enough for most people the methods are
also not based focused earphones but
does offer somewhat of a bass boosted
sound signature its punchy and direct
for most generous while offering some
deep bass for basic tracks it doesn't
hit sub bass levels likely $200 power
beats and the bass boost sound Center
isn't likely jaybird X 3s but it's a
slight boost over a balanced or flat
signature in my opinion I personally
enjoyed it for the mid-range it is clear
and direct and thankfully the bass
doesn't cause the mids to be muddy but
one area I did find lacking just like
the inked Wireless left and right audio
channels are very much distinguishable
that's great but the methods are also
lacking that open soundstage that would
complement its performance regarding
those high notes
there is roll-off where you don't hear
the high notes to make snares at higher
frequencies Sparkle or have much detail
but the trade-off
it does prevent the earphones from being
high-pitched or your ringing wearing
these for two hours straight
never did I have listening fatigue which
is quite common on budget pair of
earphones so in the end here I would
hand sound get this over the inked
models also I would say this is a worthy
contender to others on the market
despite other brands being on sale for
around the same price as the methods
here but finish on these how lightweight
they are over the others and the sound
quality I would say is definitely worth
a look if that's your number one
priority
I'm sure look into the method Wireless
