review room now as of 2015 it seems like
nearly every activity band is jumping on
the heart rate tracking craze but caught
what you like I am a big advocate of
heart rate tracking and training and any
band as understanding your heart rate
can mean the difference of just burning
fat or improving your cardiovascular
health now with that being said one of
the very early manufacturers to offer
heart rate tracking right on the wrist
is Mayo global limiting the use of the
chest heart rate monitor now they
reached out to me and was very nice
enough to let me borrow the latest Mayo
alpha-2 that was just announced at CES
of 2015 so without further ado welcome
to Jim's review room now I have reviewed
a lot of mainstream bands like those
from Fitbit and jawbone now as a
precursor meal for the most part has
been a fitness focused company and
majority of products have been dedicated
to workout and sports related monitoring
not all-day activity tracking the
company polar Garmin and soon toe to
name a few are in a similar boat where
majority their bands are Fitness focused
with one or two bands that's more
mainstream offering 24/7 activity
tracking and the reason why I mentioned
this I know many of my viewers are more
of the average consumer like myself it
might not be too familiar with the mio
brand so with that being said and keep
that in mind and let's go over the
physical features first now this is a
size large that I'm wearing here and all
sizes features a soft silicone band
which is really comfortable because it's
elastic offering freedom of movement and
flexibility especially during weight
lifting where I flex my wrist back and
forth now the silicon itself does
attract a moderate amount of dust and
lint especially while wearing long
sleeve shirts but of course this can be
remedied real quick with a quick rinse
and speaking of water here this band
confirmed by me oh you can go swimming
with this up to 30 meters in depth which
is a huge plus considering that many
manufacturers offer swimming
capabilities now the band itself is wide
and of course this is subjective but the
size looks fine
my opinion now it's about an inch and a
half wide and just a little bit bigger
than the Fitbit surge now this is a
latch style band which does hold
securely during runs and normal daily
routines but one thing that I say is
flawed though is at the end of the strap
the snapping nubs are a bit too
sensitive for me sometimes it catches
onto a shirt sometimes it catches on to
just normal day activities and then I
have to resit in a total nuisance at
times though but moving on to the screen
meal utilizes mineral glass similar
material found on some watches today as
an alternative to sapphire crystal and
from my testing I haven't seen any deep
or even fine scratches from wearing now
going over the non touch display it's
really straightforward and with a screen
that stays on 24/7 it's a perfect
alternative to wearing a watch even at
night or dark situations tapping twice
on the screen will shine the backlight
for viewing now the band is very simple
offering just two buttons here on either
side and in the middle is a light
indicating certain heart rate levels
which I'll show shortly now pressing on
the Left button cycles you through your
most recent workout and keep in mind
this is not an all-day tracker so
there's no indications of steps taken
that some of you may be more familiar
with but pressing and holding the left
button lets you go through the settings
menu where you can set your date/time
weight height etc and now here for the
right button when you hold down
initiates the heart rate monitor to find
your heartbeat on average it takes less
than a minute to find at times as fast
as 10 seconds now once your heart rate
is found you can start the workout with
one more press and it timer starts now
your heart rate will always be displayed
once you're in a workout session the
screen does not go dark which is another
plus as some bands require you to read
tap the screen or or basically repress a
button now during your run you can press
and scroll through the information being
displayed first up is that timer
next is calories burn with distance to
follow pace is also revealed with the
clock being last now this will
eventually cycle you back to your heart
rate once again now moving to the button
on the right each press will create a
new lap for you to eventually compare
your laps or split times now as
mentioned earlier there is a little LED
light on the front that blinks certain
colors to indicate which heart rate
on your in now while jogging you can
quickly glance down and see if you need
to pick up the pace or slow down a bit
to achieve your desired workouts
the colors are indicative to the heart
rate zones set in the app which we'll
see soon but let's now discuss heart
rate accuracy before going deep into the
app now I tested this against my in real
time chest heart rate monitor the polar
h6
now I typically do a straight forward
run with no rest and in red is the Polar
h6 with smooth lines in a consistent
reading now with the Alpha 2 in blue you
can see this was practically identical
with the chest strap and that's very
impressive for a band using optical
sensors right on the wrist now more for
my second test here I attempted to
simulate sports related activities like
playing baseball and running to first
base then resting for the next play or
in tennis after you score or I don't
have the ball hit the net or so players
return to their serving positions where
the heart takes a slight rest and then
you're back into the game and as you can
see with both the Mia alpha 2 and polar
again nearly identical the deviation
from each other is very minimal and
compared to all other bands that I've
tested so far the Alpha tube for a wrist
tracker has been the most accurate and
consistent and I'm very impressed it
held up that well my second test where
most bands shows the most differences so
the band collecting all this data let's
see how it translates into the app now
and see how it looks
the ban of the app works for both Apple
and Android powered devices if you have
an iPhone 4s or higher or Android 4.3 or
higher this should work now on the main
page it's pretty straightforward the
upper part of the screen features your
current weeks total workouts performed
with the most frequent heart rate zone
that you're in and your average heart
rate again all this data is just for
this week only now more information is
displayed by swiping to the right
showing time distance and calories
burned
now one last swipe here shows
numerically how long I was in my most
frequent heart rate zone now you can
toggle between just last weeks and this
week's data on the main page as there's
no further history and the app for you
to explore sadly I wish there was more
information such as month-over-month
performance so I can visually see if I'm
doing better or not throughout the year
now moving to the lower half of the app
you'll see a combination of me wearing
the meal views and the alpha to the
daily activities are from the fuse of
course as it measures your entire day's
activity you can see more of the fuse
and they review actually at my channel
if you'd like but clicking on the Alpha
to work out that I logged you'll see
familiar information once again average
heart rate total time and set activity
distance calories burned most frequent
heart rate zone and how long you're in
that particular zone now sliding down
are all self explanatory information
numerically but at the very end is your
heart rate zone graph detailing a linear
progression of that moment and this is
where the android version is missing
information compared to the Apple
devices the the graph is actually
missing now me Oded explain Android will
have this bit of information soon
through an update other than that that's
about it for the app as I've stated in
the Meo fuse review since then use the
same program it's really limited for
what mio offers right out the gate I
would have loved at least a history that
compares my performance week over week
or month over month just to see if I'm
progressing over the year or not but
after addressing this lacking feature
with mio they responded by stating the
mio go app well down the road offer much
more with updates now they couldn't
disclose what or when but as of today
mio is suggesting that I use third-party
apps like run keeper which I already use
my
his pal Strava and this even works with
cycling apps like map my ride but i'll
mitt the apps that they're working with
are very well respected it works great
and better yet they're free the syncing
with those apps will then provide you
with a history then maps and even heart
rate coaching now me also disclose
they'll have their app available to sync
with apple health kits and google fit
down the road again no timeframe was
provided so in general the meal alpha-2
is great and i think it needs to be
addressed who this ban is for for to
really receive credit though now it's
clearly not for everyone if you're
looking for an overall health band with
daily life features such as all-day
tracking media controls food logging
social sharing message notifications etc
there's plenty of other bands no
question that offers that for a similar
price now this band really wouldn't mean
much to you then basically but for those
who are more fitness focused already
know their sleeping habits watches their
food intake or really doesn't need an
all-day tracker but a tracker for those
specific moments of running while
valuing accuracy this banish'd the right
one for you not to mention this is one
of the few bands on the market that you
can actually swim with at this price
range so in the end just like the Emidio
fuse for what it does it does great for
the average consumer
is it enough let me know in the comments
below so hope this video helped you in
some way if you like my work add me gems
review and to Facebook Twitter Instagram
or Google+ as I normally post updates
and items I'm currently testing before I
put them on the website again this is
Jimmy with gems review room you guys
take care and I'll see you on the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
