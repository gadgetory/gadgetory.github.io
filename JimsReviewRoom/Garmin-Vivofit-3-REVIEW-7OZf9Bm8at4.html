the last two generations the view fit
series had a great price point it was
simple to use but it just offered the
right amount of features to make it one
of the best lower $100 activity trackers
to own now with the view fit three
there's been several changes but we'll
see if those changes are worth it I
personally paid $99 retail at the time
this video but I'll include my Amazon
links in the video description below
click on those and you get updated
prices you never know when these things
might go on sale so without further ado
my channels here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review
go over the physical features first I
usually have everything blacken my
channel but I switched it up to white
this time though the bands are
interchangeable with squeezing and
pushing out the tracker itself here and
Garmin does continue of making the view
of it waterproof up to 5 atm meaning
that you can swim with us on now the
only thing though water does get into
the band itself at time so just make
sure you leave it out to air dry before
putting the tracker back in
so overall the van is super soft it's
lightweight and it does hold on very
secure it's using the snapping button
method but with this unique turn of a
dial here the slack the connection into
place it's pretty original and it
seriously works unless thing and what
makes this very ideal like the misfit
shine and a few other trackers out there
this uses a cell battery that lasts up
to a year Pro Garmin
you don't have to recharge this thing
every five days or so now moving on to
the display this is the biggest change
instead of that horizontal screen that
we've seen on the past two generations
which I do admit offered a bigger and
easier to read display the new vertical
display is more ideal for most people
the orientation of your wrist is just
more natural the screen is very much
visible outdoors and in bright sunlight
in dim lighting it's still readable it's
a little bit harder and if you need that
backlight to turn on just hold down the
button on the tracker now one of the
newest features that we haven't seen on
the previous models there's five
different watch faces from the factory
that can be easily changed or selected
from within the app you can decide which
one looks best to you but going over the
display here you do have your time
tapping on the very tactile button ear
reveals your date steps taken steps
remaining to hit your daily goal
estimated distance estimated calories
burn for that day there and less are
your intensity minutes or basically the
moments that you've been very active if
you press and hold the view fit button
down and option to start a stopwatch is
offered but this will manually start a
recorded activity for you as well while
steps are recorded estimated distance
remaining steps to go for that day and
if you do have an A and t plus or an
aunt plus heart rate chest strap you can
pair it with your vivofit three now to
stop the activity just simply hold down
the button once again and once you sync
this to your phone that activity show up
in the Garmin Connect
now the view of it 3 does offer
automatic detection on some workouts
here through what they call move IQ even
if you don't start that stopwatch option
I just showed you if you just start
walking running biking swimming or
elliptical training the V 153 will sense
this and start recording and segmenting
this activity now it works for the most
part but there are a few occasions where
it may be off by several minutes usually
at the start of a run but overall if you
forget to set if you forget to use that
stopwatch it's nice that Garmin does
offer a back up other things the view of
it 3 does automatically attract sleep
which has worked accurate from my test
it also provides auto goal which based
on your previous day's steps the Garmin
will adjust or go up or down so every
day you can strive to do more it's
seriously an underrated feature and more
bands are now offering this too now this
like the other Garmin products here has
the move bar it's somewhat small on this
particular band here on the V will fit
three but if you have been inactive for
a while this red bar will extend across
the screen and basically tell you to get
up and move so with everything being
discussed the only one little downside
here that I've seen so far there's an
alarm that you can set up through the
Garmin Connect app and the band will
emit this little beep here but what we
don't have is a vibrating alarm which is
very common of an other activity band
now although the screen is smaller the
screen still works with providing the
necessary information but I do admit the
new orientation makes the view fit three
more user-friendly so with the options
of replaceable bands intensity minutes
now being offered new watch faces and
move I cube making its way here there is
a good number of upgrades or new
features being offered now I'd say if
you have the view fit 2 already it's not
a big jump over to the v1 v 3 the view
fit 2 is already great but if you're
looking for a well run activity tracker
that does provide a very good amount of
features with a very attractive price
and you don't have anything just yet
you're just looking for a new tracker in
general the new boot fit might be
perfect for you
