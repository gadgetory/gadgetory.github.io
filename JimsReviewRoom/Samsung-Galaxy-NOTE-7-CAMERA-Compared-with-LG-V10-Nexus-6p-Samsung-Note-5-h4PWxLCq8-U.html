room several of you asked me to go a bit
more in depth with the camera on the
samsung galaxy note 7 now looking what
we have here today I'll of course be
focusing on the note 7 but also
comparing some others that I own here at
the Nexus 6p LG v10 and the note 5 I
don't own any other phones at the moment
as I'm seriously maxed out on my budget
for now but hey some of you might still
own some of these phones out here today
but going into the experience in
software first here Samsung and LG
brands has the most options and features
built in and most of these phones that I
have tested so far during the video they
loaded as fast as with each other here
without a hitch however I did notice
that random times samsung phones just in
general for some odd reason they do
slightly give me that hiccup or maybe a
1 second delay in opening the app from
time to time now I couldn't get it to
repeat that process during this test
here but I'm pretty sure those who owns
am cell phones you guys have seen it
before but with all that being said this
is where really Samsung shines both the
s7 and note 7 as it had demonstrated in
my most recent review the auto focusing
system is the fastest that I've
personally experienced and because of
the auto focus alone it seriously
redeemed itself from the slower load up
like I said earlier for the average
consumer that's slightly slow delay
there to open the app for the first time
it's not a big deal but once consumers
are in the app man I can seriously tell
you it's a serious difference and this
makes for an amazing streamlined
experience but let's go over quickly
what features this has and towards the
end of the video I'll show you some
comparison photos as well first things
first the note 7 s7 and the Nexus 6p
does indeed take 12 megapixel photos
while most other cameras aren't
promoting a higher resolution of like 16
and up
Samsung's defense or at least they're
the only ones marketing this less
megapixels means bigger pixels on the
camera sensor in turn more light is
captured in the end resulting in better
low-light performance again I'll show
you some photos samples later and see if
there's a real difference or not now I'm
not going through every mode here by
giving you the biggest selling points if
you swipe left here while in your camera
app you can find pro mode or what some
folks would consider manual mode now you
can control your white balance focus ISO
levels and shutter speed allowing you to
get that perfect
shot when auto mode might overcompensate
brightness or overdo it on the ISIL
levels causing noise in your image now
also keep in mind menu mode does allow
you to capture in raw file formats and
for those photographers out there
intending on editing in Adobe Lightroom
or Photoshop this is the perfect option
for you now getting back to the list air
food shop basically blurs out your
surrounding and focuses on your plate
and virtual shot creates this somewhat
3d image where you can rotate your phone
here around the object not a mainstream
feature to be honest with you and you
can't share this three image and have
other users tilt their phone to
experience it on their end so it's a
little bit niche in that aspect briefly
going into video performance slow motion
makes it return however across all these
phones here we're still stuck at 720p
and not a full 1080 resolution similar
experience with 4k it's across the board
however none of these phones offers
image stabilization at this high of a
resolution so when walking you do get
some jitters here and some camera
bouncing movements now with all these
cameras except the 6p image
stabilization does work when you do
select 1080p at 30 frames per second and
as you can see here Samsung does an okay
job with this not too much of a
difference between 4k with no image
stabilization but the v10 does a better
job in my opinion the video quality
between the two as you can see here is
very much different but enough talking
about video here let's take a look at
photo since most consumers are using
these phones for photo taking anyways in
general Samsung and a consistent basis
has been taking much more vibrance
contrasting and at times sharper images
and I'm using two dell ultrasharp here
both monitors with factory calibrated
99% s RGB color accuracy for my
comparisons here and I get it again the
note 7 even over the note 5 simply looks
better now some may argue the note 7 can
look a little warm it's not perfect but
overall average consumer preference I'm
confident the note 7 provides a better
photo overall with the least amount of
retouching now for example and hopefully
eco lies eradicated here but at Chipotle
look at the lettuce from the LG v10 and
now look at the lettuce I mean note 7 in
person and Chipotle usually
provides fresh ingredients here the
Samsung had taken a much more accurate
photo in this case my lettuce was
definitely not looking nasty or yellow
like the v10 over there but he'll G
oddly consistently they would take a
slightly washed out photo or a flatter
photo in auto mode and again it's pretty
consistent and for those with a note
file the photo quality is very similar
and you can tell only a difference if
you do put the images side-by-side as
I'm doing here but as stated in my note
7 review the note 5 at times would take
a slightly more saturated picture at
times not by much but it is there you
can be the judge which one looks better
the Nexus 6p
I will admit does great with the least
amount of blowouts of brightness and
white balance as you can see especially
the clouds yet at times it's
underpowered in highlights causing a dim
looking photo now when you look at the
note 7 although there's a Sun blow out
here again the note 7 is not perfect but
again for the average consumer
you know it's have an image that seems
to pop more than the Nexus now it's more
visually appealing now in addition the
Nexus is showing its age as low-light
performance introduced the most noise
out of all the cameras that I've tested
here and this is a perfect segue into
Samsung's a low-light performance the
note 7 does offer better color and
brightness management and a slight
improvement in offering less noise but
when you do zoom out I feel like the
color management and brightness levels
are the features that really shines as
the noise reduction was present but not
as drastically done as I would have
hoped nonetheless it's still the best
performer no less and but not least here
and there's front-facing selfie photos
my apologies and events my face is
plastered all over your screen right now
it's not the prettiest thing I know but
Samsung and LG offers what they call
beauty face and left it on here in stock
settings I didn't adjust it and you can
see it smooths out the face pretty well
sometimes a little too much so it does
look a little fake but you can always
adjust it or even turn it off altogether
but we're again focusing on overall
picture quality now as for the Nexus it
doesn't have the feature at all so get
ready here you're about to see my face
in its most natural state and as you
guys can see here I don't look as young
as the other photos here but who knows
anyways just like the rear camera it
does look a little bit darker a much
more saturated image and the images in
general just much more closer up a more
narrow profile now the note 7 in general
and
distantly did provide a better photo
overall it's not perfect but one of the
better performers out there and oddly
I'd never noticed this after owning the
v10 for all this time here the
front-facing camera
reverses your image every time here so
it's a little bit interesting
now last is the front-facing camera
video performance I use these cameras in
my vlogs before on my channel except the
note 7 since it's still new and I can
say next is the most jittery it does
horrendous and bright light situations
LG would be second but it did suffer
from the bright lighting conditions as
well and the note 5 and note 7 were
nearly identical in performance
so overall the note 7 to have easily be
unbiased it's not a perfect camera but
compared to what we have so far on the
market over our performance it does very
well offering some of the best shots you
can get on a smartphone now as you
already know Nexus Apple LG are all
coming out with their phones this fall
so be on the lookout I might do another
one of these roundups towards the end of
the year now let me know in the comments
below which model phone you guys really
want to see so that way I'll be sure to
get that one like and subscribe if you
haven't share this video to someone if
they have a phone that I have presented
here and add me on through social media
you guys take care and I'll see in the
next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
