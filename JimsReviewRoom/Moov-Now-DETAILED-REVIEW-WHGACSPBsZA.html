room move offers an activity band that
is unlike anything I've seen in the past
the second generation move claims that
record movements in 3d offer audio
feedback in real time to improve your
performance and coaching like no other
not bad in theory considering the move
now is only $79 retail you can click on
the link in the video description below
for the most updated pricing regardless
I'll test the band and show you what
works and what doesn't so without
further ado my channel is here to help
you make a purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's review room
go over the physical features the retail
package will include two straps one for
your wrist and the other one for your
ankle both straps are super smooth very
easy to wear and elastic for comfort
more importantly for me they are
breathable the move itself goes inside
the band and is essentially just the
tracker and I'm not saying this is as a
negative or so but so that you're aware
there's no clock or display no silent
alarms or vibrations from this the
tracker itself when worn properly snug
has never fallen out but if I had to
critique one area when taking the band
off the move snapping buttons here tends
to fall out easily so be cautious about
that but while wearing this has been
perfectly fine in no issues whatsoever
the band has never come undone during my
workouts despite using this snapping
button style and before I forget to
mention the move now it does have
all-day tracking capabilities but the
focus and wear this does really shine is
during your recorded workout sessions
let me jump into the app and I'll show
you exactly what I mean
on the main page move now focuses on
active minutes taking numbers from the
World Health Organization 30 minutes is
the minimum daily recommended number for
a healthy lifestyle tapping on this
shows your general activity with those
active minutes being colored and as you
can see there isn't much information or
data like distance calories and so on
like other bands and it's very similar
for sleep as well this does
automatically and accurately tell you
when you fell asleep in for how long but
the information and how it is displayed
it isn't as robust as other bands at the
markets regardless it is something
though for you to look at but backing
out on the very top offers the different
exercises that this can track starting
with running and walking during my test
I quickly realized this tremendously
helps beginners and amateur runners all
the way up to enthusiasts and maybe even
pros each of running exercise offer can
be adjusted to match your skill level
where they swipe up and each swipe you
can see the cadence and interval time
change but while running here you'll
hear audio cues from your coach
indicating your pace and if you need to
pick up speed how many more minutes are
left in your interval how much distance
has elapsed and how much time you have
left to go the app also tells you if
your feet is hitting the ground too hard
and yes the move somehow is able to
measure the g-forces and impact in the
audio cube advice to either shorten or
lengthen your stride as
can measure the range of motion of your
feet the sensors in this thing is pretty
intense now during my run here where
this works for beginners are audio cues
of subtle reminders to relax your arms
or shoulders something that the band
doesn't recognize obviously but those
reminders will trigger your mind to
become more self-aware
once again the during your strenuous run
when your mind could be focused on
something else here's a real audio
sample dirt my run to give you an idea
what this can do for you alright the
first interval will start in a moment
we're aiming for at least a nine minutes
51 seconds per mile time today
get ready 7 half mile interval starts
now you are 7 meters behind the goal
your face is just right great work
we are 170 meters into the interval the
target pace for this difficulty is 9
minutes 51 seconds per mile and you are
at nine-thirty land directly underneath
your body so that you don't over stride
overall I love the running portion of
this app as the metric focuses on your
runs performance the key components and
helping to make you a better rudder and
one thing that I'm always afraid of with
these coaching type programs the
suggestions can get repetitive now for
the most part we move now is that as
different running exercises from
efficiency running to brisk walking
sprinting they all have a good variety
of suggestions it really does feel
tailored to those challenges a huge plus
in my book for that now next up is
cycling which doesn't offer any workout
programs which is understandable since
your location or terrain would dictate
your performance but the app does show
in real time if you're pedaling too slow
or too fast in turn the app would then
suggest for you to switch gears and
explain if this would basically save
your knees from the extra stress or
maybe insist that you're taking it a
little too easy
second the app enables your GPS allowing
for the app to record your speed and
distance very accurately it last is move
power which is a proprietary number here
based on your weight cadence speed etc
it's a measurement of the power you're
using and in gauge of how hard you
should be working the bike here's some
audio samples on what the biking portion
of the app can advise
this cadence is very low and easier gear
will help you increase cadence and
reduce nice train this is a very low
cadence and easier gear will give you a
better cardio workout for this same
speed
one mile complete total time 9 minutes
16 seconds moving speed for this mile 12
point 0 miles per hour average cadence
56 revolution per minute moved power 96
moving on to at home coaching there's
exercises consisting of jumping jacks
squats push-ups setups etc the app will
display that workout needed to be
performed up top here so you can imitate
if you're really unsure and while I'm
doing each exercise you can see the
green lines move up and down or back and
forth registering my movement in real
time each time the band wraps around
that circle it's a completed action like
I said it's pretty accurate but on some
occasions although I do the exercise and
may not register completely some
exercises did require a bit more
precision on my end to have correct for
some reason now this didn't happen too
frequent for this to become a
malfunctioning unit or in bad user
experience but overall on the more
difficult levels it did become
challenging but I must say even skipping
ahead and unlocking levels 12 and above
it's the same repetitive exercises over
and over again the 3d movements being
registered in real time looks cool but
the repetitiveness gets a bit dull after
a while so hopefully more workouts will
be available down the road later last
and this is only available on Apple
devices for the time being and move did
disclose to me that Android users will
eventually have this early of 2016 it's
cardio boxing now I didn't have anywhere
else to really display my iPad here so
using the night stand still worked out
great but this is really the most fun
that I've had with penny ban this does
require to move now trackers one for
each wrist of course and the exercise
works kind of like a tower hero or rock
band that you see on Playstation or Xbox
you jab cross hook and uppercut while
switching stands periodically hitting
the air whenever the target crosses the
line indeed you can just swing your arm
anywhere you can swing gently and it
will still register and move but to help
alleviate those who may kind of cheat
the system here and become numb to this
game the tracker does measure your speed
of each punch the amount of g-forces
that you put in and also the accuracy
and response times the more aggressive
you are the more
once you do accumulate and it's pretty
fun overtime and once the difficulty
levels does increase the speed will
increase as well ensuring that you will
be sweating by the end now some things
that I want to discuss an address which
are definitely pluses for now only on
iOS and Android later you can pair a
bluetooth 4.0 chest heart rate tracker
for walking running and biking
there is no rechargeable battery but
they sell better inside last up to six
months per move here and you can also
adjust the coaching frequency within the
app to basically reduce the coaching
audio cues so it wouldn't be as frequent
and last being honest I didn't test this
while in the swimming pool however
briefly looking into a swimming session
the phone does not need to be nearby you
just basically leave the tracker on your
wrist and when you're done you basically
stop the tracker with the app the app
will ask you for your pool length when
you're done and will calculate your
distance lapse pace and stroke count so
overall I honestly love this thing
especially for running and biking for
its data and little reminders while I'm
out the only thing that I would have to
critique and they're really minor
compared to what this has to offer as
you have heard some of the coaching the
voice does get pretty mechanical over
time now wish there were more updates or
downloadable home workouts considering
that this is moves 2nd generation and
again this is just me being picky you do
have to carry your phone while running
and biking may be wearing a phone
armband or Camelback backpack would
definitely help and now it also suggests
getting some wireless earphones too and
this is clearly not moves fault at all
but just a pro tip biting within ear
earbuds is somewhat dangerous as you
can't hear your surroundings as well at
least from my experience I should learn
the hard way consider getting some
earphones that basically sit on the
outside of your ear canal instead of the
inside with previous safer bet but for
just $79 I do highly recommend the move
now and I'm really shocked it's not more
widely known to the mainstream consumer
so this review helped you in some way I
am so sorry my no sound so nasally I do
have a one and a half year old daughter
that goes to daycare and it is December
so she's getting sick then I'm getting
sick so I do apologize but you know I am
a one-man band here I guess you can say
I have the old one running this so I do
have to get these videos out I do
apologize but if you can't be sure too
I can subscribe if you haven't already
and add me on to Facebook Twitter or
Instagram again I'm Jimmy with Jim's
review room and my channel is here to
help you make your purchase decision
you guys take care and I'll see you the
next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
