room you guys once of all asked me to
review some budget-friendly stuff and
today ghost tech asked me to review one
of their newest earphones in the markets
the ghost tech turbines they asked me to
review these and I agreed only after
confirming that they were just $39 and
I've seen them on Amazon for about
thirty-four dollars at the time this
review so I'll place my links in the
video description below as always click
on those and it should give you the most
up-to-date prices for today and it does
help support the channel if you do
decide to purchase so I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room welcome everyone to
another review going over what's in the
box you get the caring hardshell pouch
which comes in handy here inside you
have your assortment of ear tips there's
three gel tips from small medium to
large there's three more pairs of double
flange tips and if you have smaller ear
canal there's two triple flange designs
which fit snugly into your ears which
i've been very comfortable and stays in
the ear very well while sitting at the
desk or when I'm up and walking around
now looking at the earphones themselves
one of the main selling points is the
design of the turbines as it's made out
of ceramic when you do hold them for the
first time being ceramic it feels quite
different as the plastic ear phones on
the market feels somewhat cheap and
Hollow however with these they're very
smooth to the touch almost feeling like
they're made out of glass they're also
very lightweight and it doesn't tuck on
your ears at all now moving down the
wires do offer a grippy texture despite
looking like a smoother braided cord
however they work perfectly fine doing
my entangle test very minimal issues
encountered here wrapping these to fit
into the case and then pulling them out
later as you can see not bad it actually
frees itself pretty well there's also an
inline controller and built-in
microphone but oddly there's no volume
controls there's literally one button to
pause and play music a double tap does
skip a track which is nice but the lack
of vom controls was a bit of a letdown
however testing these on a simple phone
call because of the influence my crow
phone here my brother said I sounded
perfectly clear and not far away that
worked without hitch and outlast jumping
into the audio performance these
performs well for its price point for
bass e tracks let's say something from
Chris Brown or acres
the turbines are bassy making those
generous sound that much more impactful
who can say if you are more analytical
and more of an audiophile I do admit
though the bass isn't hid and deep as my
sennheiser in-ear Momentum's at the
studio regardless these are still
considered as basic earphones when
listening to Basie tracks now the
mid-range is fine with a little bit of
spillover during bass heavy songs
however performed fine with pop music
EDM and other similar genres and now
regarding the highs here it didn't ting
or pierced to eardrums however for some
pop songs they do get pretty high and
loud and some may not enjoy that and I
do wish however there was a bigger
soundstage and the mid range was a bit
more clear maybe a little bit more
direct as well however after comparing
these two my $11 earphones from Amazon
which were great earphones for $11 and
then comparing them with my sennheiser
in-ear Momentum's and also the rh 80 20s
i can say the ghost tech turbines is
worth the price that goes Tech is
selling them for not an audiophile pair
of earphones obviously but they do
perform better than the cheaper brands
and models out there so hope this review
helped you in some way if you can follow
me on my social media accounts and be
sure to like and subscribe if you
haven't done so already I'm Jimmy with
Jim's review room you guys take care and
I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
