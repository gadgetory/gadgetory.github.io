review by Jim's review room I just want
to take my time real quick and just say
thanks to everyone that has commented
subscribed and liked the videos that I
have put up there I just think I'm
purely an amateur dude this if anything
I'm just doing this only as a hobby
right now and just going back to my old
videos just reading through the comments
and the feedback I'm just shocked that I
just have such positive review and
support so I only have a few videos up
and like I said I do go back and look at
them I just want to say thank you that's
all
and it's greatly appreciated and
definitely keeps me inspired to keep
going and doing more again this one I
say thanks real quick that's all well
without further ado today we'll be
looking at the ninja professional
blender with the single serve function
and its containers this model is the BL
6 X 3 so let's get started here I
purchased this ninja from Macy's around
Christmas time for about $120 it was
definitely on sale at that time this
professional model has the 1100 watt
motor comes with two single serve
containers with lids and it's connecting
blade the 72-ounce picture and the
iconic six-bladed spindle and a sample
recipe booklet now as you can see here I
noticed the rubber and hard plastic and
used to spin the unit it was a bit
afraid of its durability and longevity
but I've been using this blender
prymaat with two or three times a week
blending specifically frozen fruit and
so far it's been holding up with no
signs of wear or failure the exterior
features comes with a locking and easily
detachable picture suction cups are also
found on the bottom of the blender and
it really sticks them all to the
countertops as you can see here once I
plant it down and give it a little shake
it's not going anywhere at all now the
lid has a small flip up cap to pour
whatever you choose down like any other
blender I really spun to release the
locking mechanism and a handle to pull
off that tight lid and shortly here I'll
show you a close-up of the blades and
the spindles construction now again I
personally use this blender just to make
smoothies probably in this video here I
make a really thick smoothie and I I
prefer to thicker kind where I can
actually eat with a spoon surprisingly
where you don't have to sip it that's
just personal preference but through all
that abuse of
using frozen fruits the blades are still
sharp there honestly were definitely
sharp pretty shockingly or surprisingly
for a blender in my opinion now what I
plan on doing next was blending a whole
picture of ice and just see how well it
evenly blends anyone buying a blender
will consider how consistent and smooth
their blends comes out again now this is
just my personal opinion if you're using
the right ingredients and the right
amounts that drinks will come out smooth
as you desire so there have been times
where I had to play around the mix a
little bit where the adding in more
juice or yogurt just have everything to
the right consistency but to be honest I
mainly bought this ninja and believed in
it for its durability and its powerful
motive now I didn't have a KitchenAid
mixer some time ago I at the time was
about 300 bucks this is before the days
of the ninjas or even Vitamix before you
becoming popular but after casting you
sound that old KitchenAid mixer or
blender the motor gave a slight burning
smell and of course eventually died so
this blender here after its constant use
again there's no signs of fatigue yet at
all
the results of the ice test as you can
see here came out even and consistent
throughout it's in my opinion perfect
for making mixed drinks so if you desire
to do so next up is the self-serve
containers I was a bit bummed the lids
had a permanent opening though and not a
closable cap similar to those you know
protein shaped containers and I think it
would definitely would have been more
ideal I used to own a magic bullet as
well for over a year and that thing was
great suppressant that didn't burn out
either but it was just too small these
containers you can see here they
actually hold 16 ounces so in this part
of the video
that's my leo this is not a recipe at
all and actually came out pretty
disgusting after adding in that milk I
usually don't make this kind of smoothie
here but by this point you can see
basically how the blender works in
general I should have added yogurt or
more juice or something as you can see
the consistencies a little bit frothy so
again this is not a recipe just want to
make sure that's clear
as you can see you in this video now
this is the recipe book itself it gives
you some recipes on or in tips and ideas
and blending processing juicing itself
it's pretty simple and straightforward I
personally haven't tried some of these
myself I don't know I just want to make
a fruit smoothie simple quick and easy
so in the end here so is it it by I
would say hell yeah give it a thumbs up
it's a powerful machine lasted through
all my and my normal usage and I think
for those who may use this more
frequently
I believe this machine will last for
some time the functions and the hue
picture itself will make this worthwhile
for you so I hope you enjoyed this
