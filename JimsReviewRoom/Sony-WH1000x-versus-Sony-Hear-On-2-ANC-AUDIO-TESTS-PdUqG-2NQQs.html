welcome back to another one of these
videos today I got to heavy hitting
headphones both from Sony both that I
personally paid for just to clear up the
air here this is the Sony here on Tues
this one's priced at $300 and this is a
Sony WH 1000 X priced at 350 dollars
retail the reason why I want to do this
video is to see if you can save 50
dollars to get these instead are the
equivalent in performance as these or if
not were does this kind of stack up
basically as always I'll leave my
affiliate links down in that video

review room be sure to follow me at
Jim's review on Facebook Twitter in or
Instagram or follow me on my personal
motivational count at Jimmy long
official I'm here to help you make that
purchase decision welcome everyone to
another video
all right folks going over the physical
build first both of these are an
excellent excellent build quality here
have basically bending and twisting them
whatever I want to do with these these
are basically stink intact
they don't chatter they don't make these
funky noises kind of like the Beats
headphones out there they're both
quality headphones the only word of
caution I would throw out there for you
guys the MDR 1000 basically the first
generation to these they did have that
issue where at the pivot right here some
headphone some earphones
we're basically snapping right there now
in my review for the WH 1000 X I didn't
mention and I'm showing you or telling
you guys again if you guys didn't watch
it this is practically the same
identical build as the previous first
generation now the build quality the
build materials that is I don't know if
it has changed fortunately either my
first generations the NPR 1000s or the
WH 1000 X's generation 2 here has not
broken or showed any kind of fatigue or
any kind of issues whatsoever these
things are for me at least built like
tanks so that's not an issue
going into comfort now out of these two
I do prefer the WH 1000 X's they're
lighter they're more comfortable they
look better they're heavy a much thinner
headband up top here so they don't look
as chunky or clunky but both these
headphones do look good though just
matter of preference here but I do
personally prefer the 1000 axis they put
these on for you guys now one of the big
factors here they are very much
comfortable after long-term wear if you
have the long flight if you plan on
wearing this at the office for several
hours straight I don't have any kind of
wearing fee to basically no download
that sharp pain at the crown of the head
and the clamping force is very much
gentle you can say with the here on Tues
fortunately after just an hour of
wearing this you do feel a little bit of
pressure right at the jawline right here
where your jaw pivots basically and you
do have some wearing fatigue also with
the ear pads these didn't cause my ears
to sweat which is a great thing but they
do heat up my ears more so than the WH
1000 X's also inside the ear cups the WH
1000 access feels a little bit more Airy
a little bit more room in my big ears
here can basically fit inside of these
no problem with the here on twos it's
not bad and especially compared to other
headphones on the market
they're not bad at all but again this
head head comparison here
I believe the WH 1000 Nexus does a
better job now moving on to touch
controls both of these headphones offers
very responsive very intuitive touch
controls on the right ear cup gently
swipe forward back up and down you can
adjust a vine can skip and go back in
songs what you also have on both these
headphones is ambient but where you can
take your right hand come put over your
ear and basically the microphones and
the headphones turns on and your
environmental noises gets pumped in this
is perfect if you're let's say working
at the office you want to isolate
yourself amongst everybody I say your
boss walks up hey what's going on you
can answer him like that again this is a
feature on both headphones now there are
physical buttons as well on the left ear
cup and they both practically identical
the same you can turn on and cycle
through ambient aware you can turn off
active noise-cancelling on both these
headphones you can have passive noise
isolation instead and turn off all the
extra features and still get your audio
there is NFC or near field communication
of both of these just tap your phone in
here and they'll basically pair it with
your Bluetooth device there's also a USB
2.0 port for charging your headphones
and both these headphones do offer fast
charging ten minutes on each one of
these headphones the WH 1000 X gives you
70 minutes back and this one gives you
65 minutes back so pretty much
equivalent in that aspect the biggest
difference is battery life
WH 1000 X gives you up to 30 hours of
use with ANC on with our testing here at
the office playing it at 50 percent bump
from full to dead basically I got 27
hours with the here on twos they're
claiming 20 hours again with a and C on
just to make sure that's clear we do the
same test we got 22 hours instead so a
pretty drastic difference compared to
one another but at 20 hours plus just
they're perfectly fine a student do a
very very good job now moving out here
both is do feature a three-and-a-half
millimeter plug for those physical
connections now both of these headphones
do include bluetooth for we don't have
bluetooth 5.0 just yet for some odd
reason so need in it like to choose that
technology but one of the biggest
benefits is that both these headphones
do feature
l Tech which is a very very high
basically audio codec for Bluetooth
transmission higher than apdex higher
than apdex HD of course higher than SBC
which is basically CV quality you're
going to get the best audio wireless
transmission with the less degradation
to your audio signal where these two
headphones now with that being said when
I did test either one of these
headphones but a tested L deck it didn't
really make a big difference when I
switched from just SBC over to the high
compression basically technology I
really didn't notice at all and I did
use Android 8.0 on a pixel XL phone now
with that being said both these did
provide exceptional audio performance
but I'll get more into that later first
on touch base on active noise-cancelling
performance let me play a couple of
samples for you guys please put on your
headphones and earphones because I'll be
using professional binaural microphones
please take your time to LIKE and
subscribe
throat was someone fired Modi's down
below to help support my work
here we go
1000x with active noise canceling on
right now
all right folks hopefully enjoying that
sample right there with my personal
assessment trying to take these on and
off trying in different environments I
know there was a short test I found that
the here on Tues performed a little bit
under just a smidge under WH 1000 X's
now compared to other headphones on the
market these two do very good very well
and again this is number one of my top 5
list here but the here on Tuesday just
it's a little bit under the Sony WH 1000
X's and where you do hear the difference
is mostly around vocal performance when
you hear people around you sitting
around you they're talking you're
chit-chatting and such you do hear it
more so and the here on to the WH 1000
X's a second thing and it's probably
this is the reason why it does somewhat
underperform for some reason with the
here on twos you do have a lot more
sound leaking or occurring someone
that's sitting next to you if you're in
a little quiet setting a library let's
say and you have your headphones going
even have 60 or 70% but that person next
to you is going to hear what you're
listening to you don't have that problem
you don't have that issue with the WH
1000 X's passive noise isolation might
not be as good as the WH 1000 X's now
moving on here let's do some audio test
please again put on your headphones and
influency if you haven't done so already
and here goes several samples for you to
make judgment on
here is very cold you were to get it at
the time walk me to my healer forget you
all I know it can't be done
only asking once would you let me take a
minute of your time
my chess piece of Pfizer Larry gets you

all right if I was hopefully you guys
enjoyed that audio test again putting on
your own headphones and earphones it's
not the most accurate representation but
using these binaural microphones this is
the closest performs that you guys can
get without actually holding one of
these in your hands so the biggest
difference is that the WH 1000 X's
provides a little bit more deeper much
more resonating bass over sorry about
that's my phone going off over being
here on twos here on seasoned does
provide very good bass here but if you
are base heads this provides just a
little bit more performance this offers
a little bit more neutral base you can
say this provides a little bit more of a
bass boosted sound signature other than
that both of these sound very loud 70 to
75 maybe 80 percent bob is very much
loud for me they sounded absolutely
great they're the mid-range clear Ford
detailed article it's a pretty good
resolution here on both of these
headphones the only difference in that
aspect in WH 1000 X is provided a little
bit wider limit bigger soundstage over
the here on Tues we're going to hide
frequencies
both of these didn't have any kind of
ear ringing irritating this know
listening fatigue whatsoever on both of
these headphones both these provide a
very good audio quality again for this
head head to comparison but here on C's
was just a little bit a little bit
lesson base and soundstage was just a
little bit less as well so to conclude
the $50 price difference I believe is
very much justified for $50 more you can
get the again the WH 1000 X's which
basically is the flagship it's still
outperforms everything out there in
regards to 8c headphones for the time
being at least for the headphones I
tested on this channel B here on Sue's
if you want to save $50 if you like this
look and I do personally like it the w
HT 1000 X do look a little bit more
premium looks a little bit more
luxurious but the 100 I'm sorry the
nothing 180s these are the H 900 ends
Sony's named I swear to god it's so
complex but the here on sees basically
they are no no question worth of
purchase the only other thing that
prices forgot to mention the here on
Sue's do collapse like so which is
pretty convenient
compactive or snowing but it does come
with this little felt you clean lining
bag here or so but other than that it
doesn't provide that much protection
against being crushed in your bag or if
you're traveling and such as perfectly
protected against scuff step and the
flip side would be 1000 X's here if you
provide a soft shell hard shell kind of
carrying case now these do collapse as
well but they also fold in so if you
have it run your next you can lay it
flat like so or you can have it tilted
up like this but the reason why these
lay flat is that they can stow in this
carrying pouch like this right here
again these are traveling headphones
your Tecla traveling headphones so they
do provide a little bit more protection
this case right here i do prefer this
case over in this fabric bag basically
so again it's a matter of preference yes
you can save $50 and get very close
performance to the WH 1000 X save your
money if you like the style I can save
your money again but if you absolutely
want the best of the best what a little
bit more bass in you don't want to mess
with equalizers and tuning the WH 1000 X
is your best bet
