a year ago I later dubbed it the best
bang for the buck Bluetooth speaker
there were had practically every feature
that a Bluetooth speaker would have and
it was usually on sale for about a
hundred and fifty dollars now with that
price point I had amazing audio that
would say was close or equivalent to
what Bose provided now what a heavier
today is the creative roar - with a MSRP
of a hundred and $69 no creative claims
this to be 20% smaller 10% lighter yet
providing the same audio quality so
without further ado here
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room comm
welcome everyone
so
going over the physical features first
it is indeed smaller measuring 7.4
inches wide 4.3 inches deep and 2 inches
high and I do admit it's on the heavier
side when compared to the competition
nonetheless it's still portable coming
in at 2.2 pounds or exactly one kilogram
now from handling and testing it's an
absolute quality build with zero flexing
in the top grille the five drivers
housed inside are the same that's found
on the original roar hence the same
audio quality that creative is claiming
now the only difference really the high
frequency drivers are now top firing
instead of front firing and the passive
radiators that helps with offering a
deeper bass and a water sound stage here
on the side are designed different but
as different as they are they offer such
a cool and unique look here while music
is blasting now more on the quality
during my sound test later but moving to
the top here and the back buttons as
well these have improved considerably
offering less play and a more rigid
quality feel to them but let's go over
the buttons here and the extensive list
of features available now on the top are
power volume up and down and the
bluetooth pairing button which is also
used to answer phone calls when
connected to your smartphone now testing
the smart phone functionality sitting
two feet in front of the speaker was
fine
sitting just at three feet now on the
other line one person said my voice was
starting to echo and appear to be
sitting somewhat further away the other
person I tested this with said I sounded
very much far away
despite speaking even louder at 7:00 to
about eight feet away basically on the
other side of the studio here I sounded
even further testing this with two
different people confirm these same
findings unfortunately now going back to
the right are three battery indicator
lights which I wish had more considering
it's somewhat difficult to gauge of how
much better you have remaining here
based on those three lights and lasts to
the right is NFC abbreviated for
near-field communication at the time NFC
is predominantly found on Android
devices and if you have it just tap on
the right side of the speaker and this
will pair your phone or tablet just like
that a very convenient feature to have
now rotating to the rear a power port
for the supplied AC wall adapter is
located here a three and half millimeter
port to physically connect your devices
charge out port that is is also provided
which comes in handy for those tight
situations if you're running low on
power
say at the beach or at the park plug a
USB cable in and the award's internal
battery will charge your phone now to
the right a micro USB port is available
and this is not just for updating your
firmware like most other Bluetooth
speakers but this port alone allows you
to recharge your roar with your computer
or even your phone charger it allows you
to connect to your PlayStation 4 and
have audio from that or again have this
connected to your Mac or PC and you can
play music directly from your computer
and the last option now is using music
that you've placed onto a micro SD card
now from my testing its straightforward
enough where you put songs onto the car
enter this into the back of the roar to
hear and use the pause and play buttons
on the right side of the speaker to
control your audio or you control your
music but before skipping ahead here
there is also a record button where you
can record your own voice for playback
for narration purposes or self reminders
this option is available for use and it
does record pretty clearly too and it
lasts to the far right here the roll
button enhances audio characteristics
providing a louder and more open sound
stage with another person that button
here activates terror bass which as you
might be able to tell increases bass
characteristics so with all those
features listed there are some that you
may find very useful while others not so
much
but having them as options available I
think is a huge plus especially charged
out and even microUSB features and
before I forget here during my time
testing battery life to have a median or
middle-of-the-road result here I love
the unit playing at 50% volume basically
till it died
creative claims up to eight hours of use
and on my end here I was able to achieve
exactly eight hours in 25 minutes
now compared to other small Bluetooth
speakers it is somewhat on the low end
for today's competition but to the
moment that you've probably been waiting
for here here's the sound test with me
toggling back and forth between tera
bass and the wolf feature first up is
yet again of all
cuz I got it like that oh so smooth like
I got it on tap yeah and I'm a Sikh it'd
be a good night while I'm on my gangland
while I'm drinking Bud Light uh can you
get it when you miss me like I'm will
Sarah Bay's on if you do you do it do it
that way do you do that did you take a
brain you know that I'm a beast when I
kill it on the beach like a sex on the
beach like it's Malibu chase you see the
California way we do it yeah baby she
could California king
he's done yeah all the flowers get it
Mike I put it down like this 24/7 and
they had the get in secret seven
eight
at around Aleppo I have my name is Jojo
hey baby
we don't mind all the watching cuz if
the sudden close real close they my love
and some taro base on you're nothing but
a little to do it he does it
you're so fine
i'ma leave it on robot we got mixed up -
let me show you love is swinging in the
air tonight let me show you and there
you have it folks
now audio recorded through my microphone
and then play through your speakers or
not the best depiction of audio quality
but hence my review here regarding audio
testing I do admit without the terror
base and roar the sound signature is
good though when compared to the
competitors but once you turn on tera
base and the roar features Wow comparing
to my recently reviewed Bose Soundlink
mini 2 which holds the crown for small
Bluetooth speakers in regards the audio
quality the Aurore 2 is equivalent bass
levels hit harder on the road to than
other small bluetooth speakers in its
segment the tera base does make a
difference in making this a very much
enjoyable listening experience
especially those listening to EDM rap
hip-hop and of course pop music those
intending on using this to watch movies
on your laptop or other devices here
this helps tremendously over those
standard built-in speakers now with that
much bass from such a small package
surprisingly and thankfully there's no
drowning or muddled bass experienced now
regard the mid-tones they are clear and
vivid from voices and movies while
vocals of music are pushed slightly
forward not too bright but just enough
where they're distinct and not
overshadowed genres of rock and down to
modern classical music was pleasant to
the ears as well and regard those highs
cymbal crashes those high notes on
repetitive EDM beats they all hold on
tight with no distortion now leaving
this on in my small studio for several
hours didn't provide any listening
fatigue as well and there just overall
very easy to listen to very easy on the
ears and considering it's such a small
package the volume will no question fill
up small to medium sized rooms the
interesting part we're starting to see
small bluetooth speakers being able to
provide room filling music in larger
areas for personal listening that is in
the roar and a roar - does that the only
thing that I can critique about this
speaker is indeed the drivers are
not front firing anymore so sound is it
as direct as the first generation in
creatives defense though certain
specifications had to be moved to
compensate for the smaller size and like
most if not all Bluetooth speakers big
and small the audio separation of left
and right audio channels is not distinct
here as well and if you are intending on
using the speakerphone option
extensively I would also look elsewhere
but overall the build quality is
excellent and improved over the last
model the sound quality is great for a
portable Bluetooth speaker the future
filled list surpasses the competition
and most importantly you're getting
sound quality equivalent to the Bose
Soundlink speakers for a more
wallet-friendly price this just like the
original roar is the best bang for the
buck Bluetooth speaker at the moment and
possibly who will be for a long time so
