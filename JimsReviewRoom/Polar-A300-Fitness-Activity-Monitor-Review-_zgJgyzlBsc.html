room so the other week I finished
reviewing the polar m400 it's a
fantastic watch for runners with very
good set of features but today polar
sent me their a 300 a budget-friendly
fitness and Activity Monitor coming in
at a hundred and fifty nine dollars
without the heart rate monitor and it's
a hundred and ninety nine dollars with
one the polar h7 chest strap as of this
video now if you were to buy that same
chest strap separately the h7 is priced
at $80 MSRP so you get a bit of a
savings if you buy the two and one of
course click on the link below in the
video description for updated pricing on
amazon.com or if you're interested in
buying you can buy there as well now I'm
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to jim's
review room
now I know this thing looks almost
identical to the M 400 at first glance
but it's very much different the
silicone band is very comfortable to
wear it's soft
it stretches it's very much flexible now
putting the band on and off isn't as
much of an issue as compared to the M
400 and of course with this buckle type
lock here this thing stays on very
securely
now as for a fashion statement it's a
subtle watch style that isn't as big as
the Fitbit surge and I believe is of a
very reasonable size and for those
wearing long sleeve shirts to the office
this doesn't snag the cuff too bad but
one thing I did notice when wearing long
sleeves this does collect a bit of dust
and whatnot over time now of course a
quick rinse under the faucet does get it
all off though but since we're on a
topic of water here you can say this
tracker is water resistant up to 30
meters or 98 feet when converted now
this will have no problems if you're
swimming or sweating like crazy now one
last thing here about the general
physical build unlike the M 400 the
actual face or display is removable
offering the ability of switching to
different colored bands or replacing the
band if it ever is damaged and although
it's detachable the device does sit very
well into the band itself with nothing
loose to speak of and once I take this
out here it's quite unique as one end
offers a full-size USB connection for
physically syncing your data and for
charging purposes as well no special
proprietary cords now speaking of
charging in battery life Poehler offers
an astonishing claim up to four weeks a
better life before needing a charge now
other more mainstream bands Fitbit
Garmin etc in this price range on
average lasts about five days now from
my testing of the a 300 wearing this for
two weeks straight now with several runs
recorded my battery level indicates 50%
is remaining testing this further I
would be confident that this would last
a full four weeks or give it take a day
or two
overall the better life is much better
than most bands on the market but let's
look at the display here and what
everything else does now the main screen
shows the time and date with an activity
bar below indicating your progress for
that particular day the screen is very
visible in bright light situations and
even in dark environments with the help
of a back
light and although the USB port is used
to sync your information holding the
bottom-left button does sync your a 300
to your chosen device now this does work
for both Apple and Android devices and
unfortunately not for window mobile
users and I forgot to mention earlier
this does work on windows and Macs as
well now the upper right and
bottom-right our navigation buttons to
scroll through the menu and the center
button here is to execute actions and to
view options so let's say here for
example I'm about to perform a workout I
press the Enter button and as you can
see this will track running cycling
other outdoor activities other indoor
mountain biking walking strength
training group exercises and very last
here which a lot of people ask for while
very few offers is swimming now any time
you record an activity it saved and
labeled as that specific activity with
it's pertinent information now let's say
I'll start running as it's the most
popular choice here press that sensor
button once and a timer starts press
down and you'll see your heart rate in
real-time with the timer below now next
page includes again real-time HR
information with what polar calls the HR
pointer the number on the horizontal
line is determined by polar based on the
readings of your heart rates and other
information that you've already put into
your profile now when your heart rate is
on the left side of the line here it's
burning fat anything above that or to
the right of that it's improving your
cardiovascular health now that when
training right on that middle line there
you can imagine you're optimizing your
efforts of burning fats a very useful
feature to have here another following
screens here shows the amount of time
you've been in your current fat-burning
zone versus a fitness zone and you can
see that small arrow top pointing to
that left side and the very last screen
here is the time of day and the calories
burned now if you don't have the heart
rate chest strap on you'll see your
duration time of day and calories burned
only that's practically it obviously no
HR information would be shown but
finishing up the band here before going
into the app from the main menu pressing
down once will offer a percentage of
that activity bar shown earlier now this
is where a lot of your information is
stored press enter one more time and
more information we'll see on the app
shortly are displayed
here active time calories burned steps
taken so far distance traveled and
what's very unique real-time information
on what you can do to reach your daily
goals now I can walk for the duration
that's suggested on the screen or if I
don't have much time or feel like
pushing a little bit harder a screen
suggests that I jog for the time shown
again to reach my activity goal for that
particular day now back into the main
menu again here pressing down once more
offers a history of all the recorded
sports and activities with its
corresponding data like duration
calories burn and HR information now
next up our settings in which you can
customize your own profile like height
weight and age to changing imperial
units to measuring in metrics instead
now one more display can be selected
which isn't too much of a difference the
one that you've already seen so far
includes the activity bar while the
other one just plain doesn't now the one
last setting here is being able to set
up a vibrating and audible alarm right
on your wrist select your time and have
it go off either once every day or just
Monday through Friday individual days
were not able to be selected and it's a
nice alarm generating vibrations and
setting off a small audio beep to get me
up in the morning now last item here in
the menu is a fitness test which i think
is great to include now this will
measure your cardiovascular fitness at
rest
polar measures everything you've entered
into the system age height weight Plus
heart rate variability and with this
test it measures how well your body
works at transporting oxygen throughout
your body it in turn gives you a vo2 max
level which indicates either its low
moderate very good or even at an elite
level but besides all that jargon there
it's just a great way to see on a
monthly basis how your internal health
is doing of course you can do a google
search on what vo2 levels are for more
information so that's everything that I
want to discuss about the band for now
and what we're gonna do is take a look
at the app and see how good it is
on the main page polar provides a huge
activity wheel with corresponding colors
indicating your type of activity now
this is where the polar products
including this band really stands out it
has the ability to differentiate you
laying down and/or sleeping to sitting
standing walking and running and it's
all done automatically now below the
wheel you'll see its corresponding
colors and the amount of time you spent
in doing each one and you can see my
days are spent
unfortunately in front of a computer
here editing video and uploading to
YouTube now on the wheel itself the
orange icons indicating moments that you
have been inactive for too long similar
to what we discussed earlier and these
heart icons here shows the times that
I've recorded a workout now down below
is your activity bar once again and if
you click on the I to the right here
polar provides information on how much
more activity is needed by intensity in
time to reach your daily goals but
backing out here a small box here shows
other alternatives basically that you
can take to reach your goals once again
and by tapping it offers even more
options now closer to the bottom
calories steps moments active and how
much sleep obtained are all shown and
tapping on any information with these
red tags here reveals additional
information such as my sleep quality
based on my percentage now the last two
here are the inactivity moments once
again and last is my daily weight I
would manually enter to keep track of
the last important bit of information is
on the top right offering weekly and
monthly comparisons that way I can
compare my habits and results over time
and I'm not sure why it's not showing
activity for March 16th through the 22nd
considering there's like tip is shown on
the daily side of things but regarding
accuracy the polar a 300 has been very
favorable it measures very accurately
and differentiates me sitting and
standing well even my sleep is pretty
much spot-on with when I fell asleep and
for sure when I got up overall the a300
offers a good set of features as well
that does reflect its price point now
the only big issue that I found was
oddly the HR training zone setup was
only done through the polar app website
and not done on the rest
like the m400 now despite that polar in
general still offers what a lot of other
bands don't
that's differentiation of activity
sitting sleeping walking and running all
automatically that is swimming
capabilities crazy good battery life and
not to mention on the best heartrate
trackers on the market offering accuracy
and comfort for a chest strap now if you
value heart rate tracking I'll be honest
this is the way to go if you want more
features pace distance GPS additional
training tools look into the m400 as
well I'm over all this very pleased with
this product so hope this review helped
you in some way be sure to watch the
polar m4 100 video so you can compare
and contrast and if you like my work be
sure to add me gems review room to
either Facebook Twitter or Instagram for
some good info behind the scenes again
this is Jimmy with Jim's review room you
guys take care and I'll see you on the
next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
