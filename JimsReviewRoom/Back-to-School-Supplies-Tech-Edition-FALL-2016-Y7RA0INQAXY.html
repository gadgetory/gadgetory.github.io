another year of school whether you want
to or not but today I want to share my
buyer's guide of some free services and
some tech products that will most likely
come in handy as a disclaimer all these
products I'm showcasing or items I
personally use on a commercial level for
my business basically so they've been
used tested beaten up here and none of
these items are sponsored this is not a
sponsored video keep in mind I'll place
links of every product in the video
description right under the title there
that way you can get all the model
numbers and you don't have to remember
each product that I mentioned and I will
do my best here to showcase both
expensive stuff here which has a lot of
quality versus budget-friendly stuff
which still gives you the best bang for
the buck
still quality that is as well and it
will give you guys some options so
without further adieu I'm Jimmy with
jims review room welcome everyone to
another video first and foremost you
have to get this if you don't have it
already
get Amazon Prime specifically the
student prime version it's free for the
first six months so buy all of your
school stuff right now at the end of six
months if you want to cancel your
membership you go ahead or if you decide
to continue prime student it's 50% off I
personally paid $100 since I'm not a
student anymore but you would only pay
$50 for an entire year
some of the benefits you get with Prime
you get free two-day shipping unlimited
photo storage Amazon movies just like
Netflix or Hulu it's an alternative
service you also get Amazon music just
like Pandora or such but you get an
unlimited amount of songs that you can
actually skip now for a student again
it's free and even if you do decide to
pay the $50 it works out less than five
dollars per month making this cheaper
than any other movie streaming service
out there but you get extras along the
way again I'll leave the student prime
link in the video description below now
next up here are some bags if you guys
have been following me you guys would
know I am a big swiss bad guy and I have
a real basic one but it's comfortably
padded for heavy loads or books
in your case and most of their bags have
their built-in airflow system to help
keep your back cool but very important
to me are the zippers being very smooth
and they never get caught either next up
you gotta get some sound in your life
here whether you in your dorm room or on
the go if you're on a budget the JBL
clip 2 was just released it's built to
be rugged it's waterproof comes with a
carabiner to easily clip this on the
outside or inside of your bag and it
provides just enough audio for personal
listening this was about $60 or so if I
recall but if you want something bigger
hands down get the JBL flip 3 for about
$100 it has the best audio in its class
the flip 3 is much more louder over the
JBL clip too but it's only
water-resistant though from splashes now
if you absolutely need something that's
completely waterproof the UE roll 2 is
another option if you want to go ultra
cheap but need portability with good
audio I review the DOS Touch bluetooth
speaker a few months ago and for just
$30 it sounds great in my review I did
demonstrate its sound quality and I'm
very pleased by it
there's no waterproofing for this
particular model but again guys there's
other Bluetooth speakers out there get
something around this price range
there's plenty of options again links
are in the video description below
once again
moving on and I know many folks can say
you can get a power bank literally from
anywhere from maybe TJ Maxx Marshalls -
of course Walmart very true for me I
personally use one from Vince ik but
there's others out there from anchor
easy act ravpower that are all reputable
- but the reason why I've got this one
and didn't go with something from
Marshalls let's say you should consider
this as well this has quick charging
support most new phones coming out today
will have quick charge or if you have a
Samsung it's called rapid charge we can
charge your phone in about an hour and a
half from a dead battery if you're
spending money on a power bank get one
with these features the first time it
should last you for a good bit of time
now additionally this is one of the few
that has a digital readout on how much
battery life I have left in the power
bank while most others don't have
anything at all or best-case scenario
they have several LEDs which isn't as
precise third both ports here offers
quick charging not just one and last
this particular model here it's slim and
it holds 15,000 mill amps which is right
in the middle for me 10,000 mil answer
was a little too small 20,000 mill amps
those power banks were just huge and I
didn't want to carry those around now
the next item here and for about 10 to
15 dollars it's such an afterthought but
we have so many devices today that
connects or charges using a micro USB
port get a USB wall adapter now I
personally have one from anchor and the
other one here is from I clever which is
a little bit more compact it's for when
I'm away from home working and I can
charge my camera my cell phone of course
my bluetooth earphones all at the same
time now the ones I have here do not
have quick charging options but I'll put
several individual scription below that
does have that feature again it's really
just simple and basic but guys get out
there and look for the quick charging
options so back in my college days I
would personally go to the gym a lot I
didn't see much results but it did go
though and I've seen of course many
males and females going and I'm pretty
sure today it's more than ever before
since health is such a big focus and
besides Gold's gyms and one of those
Planet Fitness is growing and building
up like crazy around here in the city
but anyways get a pair of sweat and
water resistant earphones
now I'm really fun of the
j-bert freedom's super small and compact
amazing sound quality and again water
and sweat resistant the only issue
though there are $200 if you can't get
those because they're quite expensive
I'll admit that I personally use the job
or sport pace which is on sale right now
for $80 versus $100 at its retail price
there bassy they have good quality water
resistant once again and a great
alternative to the powerbeats2 if you're
on a budget now last but not least here
there's two Mouse or mice that I think
everyone should use in general the first
one is expensive it's either the MX
performance or MX master Mouse both from
Logitech for those on the computer most
of the day like I am or maybe majoring
in IT or working graphic design either
one of these will fill your palm is a
pretty decent in size that max
performance I would prefer a slightly
more narrow I can pinch it to control my
movements a little bit more for photo
editing and video but the MX master is a
perfect option for those wanting a wider
Mouse experience - very well made
quality built mice that's completely
wireless
if you're looking for something that's a
bit cheaper here I highly recommend
hands down here be marathon Mouse also
from Logitech it's wireless but uses
double-a batteries however the batteries
last up to three years it's crazy
now I've personally had mine for three
years as well and I personally use this
when I'm out working in a cafe the field
or the library it's a medium sized Mouse
it's reliable it's Wireless of course
and around just $30 or so it's worth the
investment so there goes my buyer's
guide of course this doesn't have
laptops as I don't review laptops and I
rather not showcase something that I
personally haven't used or reviewed
again links are in the video description
below with prices and model numbers if
