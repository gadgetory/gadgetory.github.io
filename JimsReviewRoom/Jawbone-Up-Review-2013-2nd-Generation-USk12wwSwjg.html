review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the jawbone up this is an
activity bracelet that monitors your
movement and even your sleep patterns so
we're gonna go over its features
construction and styling and determine
if it's easy to use so without further
delay let's get started so I purchased
the up for a hundred and twenty nine
dollars at the time of this review the
pricing is the same across all sizes
small medium and large in regards to
size you can find your fit product to
buying the back packaging came with this
really simple yet convenient wrist
measure as demonstrated here and as you
can see it works fairly well I
personally would the medium and I found
it to be the right size just for your
information in regards to aesthetics the
jawbone up features this rubberized rib
like zigzag design which looks pretty
good in my opinion and you can choose
from a variety of colors navy like grey
mint blue and red placing the wristband
on isn't bad at all not repeatedly doing
this during my trials and tests and
firmly flexing the product over the palm
showed no signs of wear damage or
stretch it's been a very durable product
and continue with its physical build the
up unfortunately is not Wireless like
the Fitbit flex which I haven't done a
review on and you can check that out by
clicking this pop up video here but for
the jawbone up to sync to your device
you do utilize this three-and-a-half
millimeter jack that's covered by the
jawbone cap now it wasn't too thrilled
with this design since I have left the
cap in places where I forget and if I
were to lose this thing altogether of
course it would be exposed to damage
dust water you name it the other side of
the band has a button when held
indicates if it's in sleep mode or
activity mode a status light shines to
indicate which one you're in now wearing
the jawbone up on a daily basis is very
comfortable though it's super light and
it weighs in at 22 grams wearing this to
the office to wearing this outdoors
while walking felt very natural and at
times I even forget that Stephen bear
you've been when I'm sleeping and I had
this on throughout the night I don't
even notice it on and the wristband is
water-resistant as well and I have been
wearing this every time I shower so it
there's no water damages and it's no
water seeping in something
design of course the only downfall here
is where the button is located the edge
is slightly sharp it won't cut your skin
but it does cause some pain if you bump
and rub it accidentally on yourself or
someone else surprisingly this has
happened more often than I thought
especially if you're playing physical
sports or laying in bed with your loved
one and it rubs against their body so
besides the activity bracelet monitoring
your steps like a pedometer it also
monitors your sleep the up does this by
monitoring your movement throughout the
night now before I go to sleep I just
hold the button down and until it
vibrates and glows a moon icon to
indicate that I'm in sleep mode that's
definitely one feature I really like
compared to the competing Fitbit flex or
I had to open up my phone and manually
select when I started and stopped
sleeping so the next one I will rake up
and hold down to the button again and it
would basically start activity mode and
besides tracking your steps and sleep
the free app provided by jawbone does
provide other health tracking benefits
the app is downloadable for both Apple
and Android devices and it doesn't
require an internet connection to sync
your device so after you download the
application and register every so often
and I do mine every morning i sync the
up by connecting the 3.5 millimeter jack
into the headphone port now the user
interface that comes up is very
intuitive to use as soon as you finish
connecting the sync summary homepage
appears and tapping on your steps or
sleep will show you your progress here's
where I find my motivation to do better
it records steps and distance walked
then how long you were active calories
burned and the funny thing is I really
didn't know how inactive I was into I
looked at this bar chart here now I do
work in an office environment and sit in
front of a computer most of the day
unfortunately so hence my chart looks a
little bit weak here but again this
chart alone motivates me to get back to
my college days of working out and just
at least being a little bit more active
sliding your finger across this bar
chart shows the time throughout the day
and you can see when you were most
stationary to the time you're moving
around and it's the same for sleep as
well and I like the Jawbone's sleep
interface much better than the Fitbit
flex because it's more detailed you can
track light sleep deep sleep how long
you're in bed for and how long you are
truly up you can see here where I woke
up in the middle the night in utilize
the bathroom it's a great way to monitor
if you are getting a good night's sleep
and if you're not you can adjust your
thermostat maybe adjust the lighting
even sleeping on a different mattress
and comparing your results to optimize
your deep sleep and lastly about sleep
both the Fitbit flex and this jawbone up
recorded accurate movement and times
when I was Restless on the main page
though you do have this food and drink
intake log it utilizes huge beautiful
photos so you can select your intake for
the day for example at lunch I ate a
sandwich and I can select from the
provided photos turkey ham and cheese
etc and there's other wide varieties
that you can choose from but in reality
today I had one of my favorite
sandwiches which is an Asiago roast beef
from Panera Bread you can actually enter
this in by looking it up on their apps
website database as I'm doing here now I
got a myth the Fitbit flex from my
experience was a bit more robust and
easier to search with less clicking and
selecting nonetheless the jawbone up
manually inputting my food makes it
spot-on to track my calorie intake and
besides calorie counting it also records
things like sugar fat and also protein
intake as well the last notable feature
was logging your work out here you can
select a variety of activities that you
may have performed let's say I lifted
weights in the morning from the main
page I go here then here and as you can
see there's also a variety of workouts
that you can select from from playing
walking to yoga to basketball and tennis
after sledding my sweat inducing
activity here I then select my effort
level by sliding my finger up and down
then selecting how long I actually did
it for it will ask me the amount of
calories that I have burned from the
workout session so all in all it's real
easy to use and the app software is very
easily readable with its huge photos and
icons the jawbone up does have a decent
amount of features besides just reading
your steps and monitoring your sleep and
with your interaction and commitment you
can log-in your food intake and workout
sessions there's other features as well
that's just too long for this video but
you can view
trends on a daily weekly and monthly
basis now if you have friends with an up
you can compare and compete with your
progress here and apparently have no
friends on here
and there's also additional apps that
you can download that works directly
with the up as well in the last feature
is a vibrating alarm you can wake
yourself up from my vibration on your
wrist and you can also be alerted when
you've been idle for too long
reminding you to get up once in a while
and walking away from your desk the
product is rugged from my experience and
a battery life does last a full 10 hours
on a full charge I'm sorry a full 10
days the only downside though I do have
to take the band off once or twice a day
just to sync up the device and the only
other time is to recharge the up via the
supplied USB cable it's not a huge
nuisance and eventually became habitual
but having wireless syncing would have
been nice just like the Fitbit flex so
the physical edge of the up did end up
scratching some people during the
physical sports and play and if you're
handling kids this might be of a concern
and the last con is that cap I just hate
to lose it and you can imagine what
would happen if it was completely gone
and can't find it so that's my review
for the up by jawbone and definitely
check out the video bumper to watch the
Fitbit flex review and no questions
asked definitely like and subscribe to

products again this is Jimmy from Jim's
