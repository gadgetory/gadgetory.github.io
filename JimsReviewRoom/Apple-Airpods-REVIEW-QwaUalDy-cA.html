Jimmy with Jim's review room as I'm sure
you're aware Apple has gone the route of
removing the 3.5 millimeter port
altogether there's a few pair of
earphones hitting the market that allows
you to listen to music is through the
Lightning ports while the only other
option is going Wireless with the new
Apple earpods that's what you get a
truly wireless experience with no wires
even in between each ear button I've
personally paid for these at the retail
price of one hundred and fifty nine
dollars making these in hindsight quite
a bit cheaper than other mainstream
truly wireless ear films on the market
but of course I'll go over the details
and see if Apple is offering a bargain
or not and always always love links in
the video description below click on my
link and they'll give you the most
updated prices on Amazon in real time so
without further ado my channel is here
to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to a review Google the
physical features first these are
identical to be wired versions that
comes with your iPhone and I'm going to
leave these air pods in my ears
throughout the video here you guys can
determine if this looks good to you or
not now the opening to the width of the
sides looking at these top-down two
dimensions again are the same as the
wired models from my assessment and keep
in mind I'm coming from experiences with
other earphones with your flanges
silicone tips and all sorts of ear wings
the air pods doesn't provide much
confidence when it put them on for the
very first time but surprisingly after
10 minutes or so you eventually find the
Beast stay in the ear quite well fitting
walking and even tilting my head to the
side here they stayed in
now what I did attempt to run with these
on though this will be more subjective
but I did notice my ear pods slightly
bouncing a bit and causing the air pods
to become loose in my ears I personally
wouldn't run with these on just in case
again you can get
a shot in yourself and determine if they
stay in your ears better than mine now
as there is no silicone ear tips the ant
pod doesn't create a seal in the air so
although they are comfortable for
everyone they don't have any sound
isolation at all
so in terns you can hear your
environment quite clearly no jumping a
braggy
maybe Java or even the Samsung icon X
those are also truly wireless earphones
they block out some more nodes than
these air pods here because of those
designs or ear tips that our supply know
before getting into the sound test a few
more things I wanted to touch base on
now the air pods do provide theory
support a simple DoubleTap on other side
of these ear buds here brings up Siri
and the microphones picks up my voice
for phone calls and of course Siri
questions and prompts very well I do
wish and this was one of the biggest
feature that I found lacking on the air
pods was volume touch controls many if
not all the mainstream brands of truly
wild ear films out there you can slide
your fingers left and right or up and
down or so and you can skip track and
adjust how loud or how low you want the
music to be unfortunately it can't do it
here unless you prompt theory and then
head your music pause and then tell Siri
to adjust your volume then a little bit
more of an extra step now on the flip
side the air pods signal and
connectivity is very intuitive and fast
if anything it's one of the best that
I've tested so far on this channel now
Apple has been promoting their w1 chips
that's inside these ear buds for some
time they're not only providing
exceptional battery life management but
also signal strength and pairing quality
now what's my experience you do get that
as my phone is nearby unlocked as soon
as I open the case of the air pods its
detected by my iPhone instantly that's a
better way for most average consumers
it's five hours that Apple is claiming
does sound quite short I'll admit that
it does but when you look at the
competition the air pipes lasts a bit
longer
second and this was found through world
youthere most listened to their iPods
for maybe an hour maybe two if you had a
long commute but after you're done you
stow them away you're going to put them
into the carrying case now for every 15
minutes it's charged in the case you get
three hours of play
back time that was my setting I was able
to get a little under five hours of each
charge on each charge here before the
air pods would eventually die that's
assuming I didn't use the again the
carrying case at all now last but not
least here indeed it looks like a case
for dental floss but it works perfectly
fun the carrying case fits well in the
pocket it's lightweight has a magnetized
lid to keep it closed the earphones are
also magnetized to keep it in the case
without them falling out now the only
new ones I had was the whishing the
battery indicator was on the outside of
the case instead of the inside so let's
touch base on the audio performance the
air pad sounds identical to the ear pod
from my experience again those are the
wired version there's a good amount of
subtle base offered and a very clear
mid-range being experienced the sound
stage is surprisingly good with a good
amount of audio separation the highs do
lack of itself bite or sparkle at the
top end to make cymbal crashes and
snares really shine but overall I really
liked how these in general down but when
you look back and being a non isolating
pair of earphones it does let in a good
bit of noise because they don't create
that feel as I mentioned earlier so in
loud environments you do lose that death
or that immersion you would want from a
pair of earphones as time so in
conclusion here the air pods it does
great in some areas while other areas it
might still be lacking guys if you can
down below write in the comment section
what do you personally feel about these
how did it look I've been wearing them
this entire time it's such a huge toss
up here it's great price
great battery life yet no sound
isolation no touch controls that is you
as a consumer let me know if you did
have an iPhone here will just be
something you want or would you pay a
bit more and use a different bread so
guys thank you for watching here I'll
see you guys on the next one again I'm
Jimmy with jims review room take care
bye
