room back with you on another
budget-friendly review as you never know
you might run across some cheaper
options out there today we're looking at
the mini speaker that Archer sent me
it's the model a 106 and it's priced at
$59 retail but they do have it on Amazon
right now for around $24 at least at the
time of this review make this one the
cheapest speakers that I ever reviewed
on the channel I'll place my links any
good description below click on my links
and you can get the most updated prices
in real time so without further ado
welcome everyone to another review
going over the physical features looks
are subjective and you guys know I do
like black but they did send me the
green and yellow version the speaker is
the same size as the JBL clip to make
this fit right in the palm of my hands
the outer casing of silicone or rubber
like material that Archer is making
claims that its splash and ring proof as
its IP x5 rated now doing my water test
here the speaker still works perfectly
fine afterwards Archer is also claiming
that this is a shock resistant from
drops and dropping this around waist
height the arch here is still going
strong
so overall the speaker is seriously
rugged the metal speaker grille doesn't
flex it all in a strap provided a bit
different as it's not a snap-on button
but it stays loops even when you do pull
on it it's a secure strap to use going
over the physical buttons there's vibe
up and down and if you do hold down
either buttons you can skip or go back
on songs a speakerphone option is
available but with my testing sadly like
most other Bluetooth speakers sounded
far away and there is an echo presence
making the phone conversation clearly
known that I'm on a speakerphone in
general the power button is last year in
which it's also used to pair the a 106
to your chosen devices and less rotating
to the side there's simply a 3.5
millimeter and microUSB port for
charging the device the archer is
claiming to have a crazy up to 20 hours
of battery life at 80% volume I tested
this at roughly 50 percent to get that
medal the road result and seriously guys
I got two full days and three hours of
use and I'm not biessing at all I left
this in my closet playing the entire
time until the unit basically died now
seriously unheard of now I did a second
test leaving both my phone and the
speaker at maximum volume this time I
achieved 6 hours and 30 minutes so
besides its color scheme the only issue
that I had with the speaker you don't
remember which way the speaker is facing
so at times you had press the furthest
right button assuming violence going up
when it's actually going down it lasts
only one sided speaker is pushing out
sound while the rear despite having that
same metal grille there's no sound being
pushed out on the
other side so to the moment that you've
been waiting for here guys the sound
test I'll play several songs and then
I'll give you my verdict afterwards
that's enough
and there you have it folks now one
thing I did forget to mention I did test
the Bluetooth signal by placing my phone
on one side of the house with the
speaker on the other side and signal
performance was as good as the other big
name bigger bluetooth speakers out there
now when there is a wall or a door in
between though that's when the signal
somewhat dies down a little bit I was
still considered as good but it's not
the best performing Bluetooth speaker
out there in regards to Bluetooth range
but going back to the audio test music
recorded on my end and then play through
your speaker's of course or not the best
depiction of audio quality but hence my
review here so first off heavenly JBL
clip two and the archer side-by-side the
archer model is surprisingly much louder
now regarding bass the a 106 is very
similar to the JBL clip two but
depending on song the JBL does offer
what feels to be a richer or warmer bass
signature you could probably tell that
with the second sound test there's audio
clip from the review just now
now the archer doesn't distort or drone
out part of the mid-range either which
is pretty impressive for such a small
speaker and being as loud as it is but
the mid ranges are still clear and clean
as the JBL clip twos but now although
being louder though putting this at
maximum volume at that time you can
slightly tell that the speaker would
reach its upper limit and the higher
notes do jumble and you don't hear too
much distinction or detail and the very
top end however though if you are
intending on entertaining and standing
not so close to the speaker the archer
surprisingly sounds better than the
JBL's at that particular time so there
are some slight distortion at the top
end here you hear normally when standing
close to the speaker again at maximum
volume it does dissipate though when you
do walk further away and the archer
actually sounds better since it's more
room and/or area filling now at the end
of the day if you're not blasting either
speaker at maximum the arch here is a
great bargain for its price and that's
assuming you don't need the extra
features like pairing two speakers or
full water submersion capabilities now
if you're intending on playing this
pretty loud here I would say JBL is more
reserved but it retains its quality
while our cheer shines more so in bigger
and more open environments for just
being louder so hope this review helped
you in some way be sure to LIKE and

Jimmy long official you guys take care
and I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
