by Jim's review room today we'll be
looking at the glide Gear camera
stabilizer model syl - 3000 now camera
stabilizers are utilized to prevent a
lot of that shake and judder
that you normally see when you're
holding your camera with just your bare
hands and with a stabilizer it creates a
much more fluid motion when you are in
motion such as walking or vlogging even
running it would definitely reduce all
of that vibration and shutter for you so
let's get started here this item goes
for 93 dollars on amazon.com at the time
of this review 99 dollars though if you
were to purchase it direct from glide
gear net this blade style design is
manufactured with non-rush stainless
steel and aluminum parts the glider
utilizes a counterbalance design which
creates a balancing act once you mount
your camera to achieve this balance
counter weight discs are placed at the
end of the blade itself this glide yard
comes with four small and 20 large
weight discs now this camera stabilizer
holds up to a three pound camera per
glide gears website now when you mount
your discs they're usually facing away
from the extended or the heavier side of
the camera again if you can visualize
think counter balance and you'll see it
in a video pretty shortly here now this
definitely takes some fine-tuning and
several adjustments on your first
go-around
now the glide gear in my opinion from my
experience and usage it's pretty
straightforward though and just
remaining patient was key and getting it
right and again a lot of fine-tuning
actually is involved however you would
have to do this with any other
stabilizer on the market today you can
perform the quote unquote mirror test as
I'm doing in the video right now by
standing in front of a mirror and moving
the camera itself from side to side and
front to back the camera should
relatively remain stationary if not
again continue fine-tuning the gimbal
itself as I'm showing here in the video
it does have a limited range of motion
however it's enough for my needs where I
don't anticipate the glide gear to angle
no more than let's say 70 degrees in
movement I wouldn't see why I would need
any further movement in general and
lastly here I'm showing the threaded nut
used to mount your camera now right now
I'm doing a comparison and probably this
is what you're waiting for a comparison
just holding the camera by hand which is
on the left and using the glide gear
on the right and I'm doing the best that
I can holding the camera stable on the
left and utilizing both hands actually
to reduce the bounces as much as I can
now the video is recorded with my Nikon
SLR and it does have vibration reduction
and still the video itself shows such a
difference in quality you can see each
step that I'm taking and the Kim
bouncing and jittering and it's also
evident in turns as well as I just done
now the motion is much more fluid with
the glad you're attached
I've also walked through a bit more
rough terrain here and again the video
itself shows the difference then I'll
leave the video playing for a bit here
and then way you can make judgment
yourself now the camera does the trek as
the more expensive brands to do such as
the crazy expensive five hundred plus
dollar Merlin now granted the Merlin
does have more intuitive features such
as a sliding quick release where you can
use them with a bit more ease but for an
amateur like myself the hundred bucks is
all you need and you get results like
this similar to similar or maybe exactly
- like the Merlin now in conclusion the
price is of this thing is hard to beat
the build quality is top-notch all the
bolts and nuts hold tight and unlike the
cheaper bladed designs which I have
reviewed before purchasing this one the
nuts and the washers won't loosen over
time and when you use it or bounce
around you get the same or similar
results again as the 500 plus dollar
Merlin for a hundred bucks so the
results are phenomenal compared to
holding the camera by hand and this tool
I believe should be in every amateur -
even the professional levels toolbox so
if you're youtubing and want some not so
noobish results definitely get this it
works wonders and I'll definitely be
personally using this in my future
videos as well so all right folks I'm
heading off the bed here and getting
ready for the work day tomorrow
