review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at my subwoofer eclipse sw1
one two we look into the subwoofers
construction and style specifications
and features and lastly my pros and cons
on its performance and usage so let's
get started I purchased this subwoofer
for about a year ago from acoustic sound
design calm now the exterior color of
just a flat black / clips is website it
is considered as a black pika
the dimensions are 14.5 inches wide it
is 16 inches high and it's 19 inch in
depth now this was built back in 2010
and is still currently the model today
it has yet to be replaced
now the subwoofer does feature a 12-inch
active nonresident woven fiberglass
driver that front speaker you see there
now the grille is removable for gets
better aesthetics I didn't see a
difference with the grille removed or
not
now this subwoofer does have a
sensitivity of 106 decibels with a
maximum acoustic output of 116 decibels
now I use the subwoofer and chose this
specifically because it's right in my
price range there is several others
above this which gets pretty close to
the 800 and $1,000 range which is a
little bit too much for my pocket
however I do have a large open room
downstairs and I had to choose a pretty
darn good subwoofer and this actually
does the job now the amplifier is rated
at 300 watts continuous or RMS and it
does have a dynamic power of 600 watts
total now the unit does weigh about 46
pounds and it does provide some weight
but this subwoofer the pros far exceeds
the cons per bass deep bass and like I
said it does fulfill the entire
downstairs in my entire downstairs is
not too big but it's about 700 square
feet another pro that it has is multiple
connections as well it does feature a
left and right line level RCA jacks also
a left and right high level speaker
binding posts as well and also connects
through AWA port so overall this is not
klipsch --is flagship sub-woofer this
actually for above at the sw1 115 308
310 and 311 now that goes that doesn't
go without saying that this subwoofer
does definitely perform and this will
give you house rattling Chas vibrating I
mean earthquake feeling of a subwoofer
now in more open areas which is what I
have in my case it's a little bit I wish
it was a little bit more bass in the mid
fields or in the middle of the room now
I'm pretty sure that's acquired by the
more expensive subwoofers in the SW
series but for the price that I paid
it's already $600 for the one 112 which
is what we're reviewing today but again
that doesn't go without saying there's
no Distortion
the bass is crystal clear just deep deep
fillion vibration I don't know how to
describe as more as I can but it is a
good good subwoofer that's a great
subwoofer let me correct that and if you
do have the correct room a more squared
room and after theater room a bedroom
whatever room you're putting this in if
it's not entire first floor open area
this will probably more than exceed what
you need excellent sub / hands down so
that's it for this review and the clips
sw1 one two subwoofer I hope you enjoyed
this review and if you haven't done so
please take your time to like and/or

alerted to new products once they come
out and lastly this is Jimmy from Jim's
