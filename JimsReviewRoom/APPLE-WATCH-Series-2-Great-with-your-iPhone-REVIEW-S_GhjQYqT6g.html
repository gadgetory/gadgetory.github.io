really missing out I didn't purchase the
first generation Apple watch but I've
been testing android watches and fitness
bands like there's no tomorrow now this
year things are a little bit different
I'll put prices on your screen right now
for the new Apple watch series too and
all those apples website says they start
at $269 that's actually for the first
generation model the cheapest second
generation is priced at three hundred
and sixty nine dollars for the smaller
38 millimeter size I did personally
purchase the 42 millimeter watch which
you'll see throughout this video and
that comes with this silicone bed now
I'll place my links in the video
description below click on my links and
they'll give you the most updated prices
in real time so without further ado my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review room
after physically owning physically
wearing an Apple watch instead of
looking at photos and videos online
the Apple watch it looks quite classy
and it feels modern
once you have one in your possession the
aluminum casing the very smooth rotating
crown and the tactile button are all
quality there's no scratches during the
time of me testing this and that
silicone ban is a must if you're a
fitness nut or intend to swim with us on
as well and yes that's one of the newest
features you can get up to 50 meters or
165 feet underwater unlike the first
generation it was only splash resistant
and for those who are asking here's a
demonstration I'm a speaker blowing out
water supposedly but like the previous
generation Apple graciously offers
interchangeable bands it's very
straightforward to swap them out simply
hold the release button on the back here
slide the ULM out and slip the new one
back on I recommend getting the base
model if you do decide to do any sport
activities plans sweating in this thing
and then purchasing from third party
vendors where you get different styles
for cheaper versus purchasing direct
from the Apple store now being
transparent and upfront with my viewers
here one of the largest band makers for
Apple watch's mono where did help
sponsor this video to make this review
possible then I'll be showcasing several
bands throughout this video to showcase
other style options out there they're
sold at Target Best Buy and on Amazon
but they did offer me a discount code
for my viewers to use the link is in the
video description below and also my code
here and as a side note this is me
personally saying this they do make some
very good quality stuff from the samples
I received and they do make a band for
nearly every occasion again check them
out at mono we're calm now getting into
some of its features the screen is
seriously bright and direct sunlight had
zero problems whatsoever there's
built-in gps which i recommend for any
fitness watch as it does provide much
more accurate results and with my
testing running at my very familiar park
it's as awkward as my phone's GPS and as
accurate as my other GPS smart and
Fitness watches I'll get into detail
about running and
working out pretty shortly now one of
the features I absolutely love is
answering phone calls right on your
wrist technically this isn't new I've
seen this on a Sony SmartWatch that I've
reviewed in the past some time ago but
other smartwatches if they offer this
feature they usually have to get a
separate data plan for the watch itself
now with the Apple watch here at
piggybacks right off of your phone and
the positive side if you are in a silent
room a salad area it works perfectly for
my test with my friend on the other side
she says that I sound very clear there
is some distance though but other than
that that's very common with most
speaker phones if you're in a slightly
busy area there's some background noise
it's somewhat hard to hear your friend
and you're then placing your wrist next
to your ear trying to have a listen but
when it does work though it's such a
handy feature especially if your phone
is in your pocket or maybe you're away
from your phone in general now
notifications comes through perfectly
with options to respond back to text
message either by quick responses
provided at the bottom of the screen
here or voice recognition it works very
well and it's possibly the fastest
method here basically if you want to do
some full-on sentences to respond now
scribbling is also an option it
surprisingly does work very well here
but I do wish my finger recognition
could be more exact I feel as though I
have to exaggerate or perfect each
letter at times to ensure the Apple
watch registers that particular letter
I'm trying to type in but overall all
the options available has been good -
great not to mention emojis are also
available but here let's take a look at
the home screen here one of the best
features is the option of having the
home screen change without needing to
download or exit through the app on your
phone that is that you can indeed
download more backgrounds but having
summer pre-installed on a watch already
makes it Streamlight now so I've been
left and right it's pretty simple to do
but as you can see in the video here
once in a while I don't perform that
perfect edge swipe so the Apple watch
isn't too forgiving but understandably
so I'm sure to prevent accidental screen
changes now pressing the crown down the
side brings up all of your apps which
works great here and something that
would be great to see on iPhones and
iPads eventually as an alternative
instead of swiping and flipping through
your screens a long press on that though
that same doubt brings up Siri which
works great when you want to
use a voice command now the bottom below
that below the crown here allows you to
close apps or select which ones to bring
forth that are already open
now speaking of apps for those who are
unfamiliar Apple does have a great
lineup of third-party app vendors all my
social media on there like Twitter
Instagram etc all of my most used
fitness apps like run keeper and Strava
are there as well and you can initiate a
workout right on your wrist now there's
apps wierdo absolutely as you can say
down to like Zillow and Redfin those are
on there because I've been searching for
some new homes recently but again that's
some of the variety that is offered in
the end a very robust lineup of apps and
I'm sure most average consumers average
users will find something worthwhile to
them on there now as for the fitness
side of things the daily activity
tracking is very good but I believe very
much for the average consumer
everything Fitness related that the
Apple watch offers is technically
offered but it likes a Fitbit and other
mainstream fitness bands out there
that's being honest and that's just the
reality but what I see and how or why
Apple succeeds it's how simple it is on
the surface it's not geared towards
those counting steps it's not geared
towards specifically how many calories
you've burned but that colorful wheeled
colorful display throughout the day
gives you insight and how much movement
you've had as indicated in this pink
color here now Green is for exercise and
less than aqua color here in the middle
is how much you have been staining for
now steps and distance are still counted
but again the main focus is and be easy
to read activity wheel and how much
activity in general that you have
performed now when you do an activity or
log in a run here it does get quite
interesting GPS kicks on the heart rate
sensor starts reading and at your
fingertips you have distance pace heart
rate and a timer going all at the same
time just enough to see how you are
performing during your run is just
enough data at least for me here to
ensure I'm performing it as I desire
here the only thing that I really saw
missing from the factory was heart rate
zone training from the Apple's dedicated
activity app and the fact that I can't
have some sort of bar chart or line
graph here to show my progress
throughout the month all on one screen
on the phone here it's somewhat of a
bummer so long-term trends for more
fitness focus individuals who like some
data and numbers the factory app is an
ideal but in a big but that doesn't mean
the Apple watch is any less as you can
use third-party apps like the very
popular
RunKeeper to track those needs now as
for a heart rate accuracy I've proven
through two years or so possibly three
years of testing these things on my
channel here most risk based heart rate
trackers are not as accurate as chest
Wrentham with the Apple watch series -
it does a very good job at reading the
very peaks and the very lows but the
consistency throughout the run isn't
dynamic or as responsive as I've seen at
the chest strap you can see each one I
performed here the blue or somewhat
purple line is very blocky now this
could be due to noise when running and I
try to ensure the best fit and placement
per instructions each time but every one
I'm doing I'm getting these results
sometimes it's spot on at time that's
completely off in the end I would say
it's still a were the heart rate tracker
for general readings the readings are
accurate enough but if you're looking
for pinpoint accuracy it's not there
with the variability I would say the
readings performed as well as most other
risk heart rate trackers out there it
was an average performance you can say
so coming to the end here one of the
biggest gripes in the last generation
was better life lasting only 18 hours
maybe 20 hours or so from some people
now from my experience I don't know if
this is a gimmick or one of those
under-promise and over-deliver
situations I've actually been getting a
day and a half and on days I'm not using
it too much I can get two full days
worth of use and with a run-in with text
messaging periodically throughout the
day and of course checking that time
once in a while I've been averaging well
over 18 hours that Apple is claiming now
if you're an owner of a series - let me
know in the comment section below I'll
be very intrigued to hear what others
are getting and the time to recharge the
series - from a dead battery it was
almost two hours to complete now to
conclude and answering the question
what's new - series 2 versus the last
generation and should you upgrade
there's a new faster processor I don't
know how much faster is but my series 2
has been buttery smooth to be honest
with you it now features GPS it's now
water resistant up to 50 meters not just
splash resistant the screen is crazy
bright possibly one of the best screens
in direct sunlight that I've tested so
far and any SmartWatch that is one thing
I forgot to mention though there's also
media controls on here better yet you
can store music on the Apple watch
itself through Apple music and leave
your phone completely in the
car or maybe in your locker and you can
listen to your music with Bluetooth
earphones now the overall experience has
been really good and features nearly
everything we want out of SmartWatch the
flaws that I did notice there were
equivalent to the other flaw that I've
seen in other devices so the Apple watch
it's technically not worse than others
if you're on the fence for an Apple
watch I'd say it's surely worth the
purchase it complements your iPhone very
much so that's it for this review be
