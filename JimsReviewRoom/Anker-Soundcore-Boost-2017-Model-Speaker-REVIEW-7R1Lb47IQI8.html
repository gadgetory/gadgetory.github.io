room I know I've been testing a lot of
premium or expensive items on the
channel recently a good handful of you
have requested for me to review more
budget-friendly products I've been
reading the comments so today I'll be
looking at the sound core boost that
Ankur sent over it retails for just 90
dollars bidding out the mainstream
competitors in regards to retail prices
but they are also currently on sale at
the moment through Amazon I'll place my
Amazon affiliate links down in the video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time so sit back relax
and hopefully my videos can help you
make that purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's review room
going over the physical features it's
confirmed the sound core boost falls
into the small speaker category making
it ideal if portability is high on the
list
not very similar in size and weight to
the JBL flip 4 and Sony XP 20 that I
just reviewed on the channel keep in
mind despite how small and light it is
its squared off on all corners while
some of the aforementioned competitors
are much rounder you could be a judge if
this not works for you or not the top
and bottom offers this unique looking
rubberized plastic gives off a recycled
paper like appearance here I was giving
it this eco-friendly look it's pretty
cool but one thing I would critique
though I do wish the rubberized texture
was grippier when I picked it up it is
somewhat slippery if you're not holding
it without thinking about it nonetheless
the speaker still gives off a feeling
click quality product the surrounding
fabric grille looks great too and
overall it doesn't feel cheap the sound
quarters the IPX 5 rating identical to
Sony Bluetooth speakers I've recently
tested it's only splash proof so you
can't submerge this underwater like the
JBL flip 4 now looking at the top I'll
be battery level indicators is on your
left with NFC pairing on your right now
of your buttons in between are
responsive with a physical press you
have pause and play
you can skip songs with a double press
on the sensor button however there's no
way to go back to your previous song
which was somewhat of a letdown however
with that same button you can activate
Google Voice assistance or Siri if you'd
like the last is this up button which is
a bass booster bass enhancement feature
which I'll discuss later in my audio
test we're rotating to the side the
boost has a charged up port which
neither one of my competitors have if
your phone is running low on a battery
plug in a USB cord to your phone and use
the sound cord just like a power bank
and although anchor is number one in
power bank sales that's what they're
known for unfortunately don't get quick
charge capabilities with this regarding
better life anchor claims up to 12 hours
of use and in my testing at 50% bond
with the bass boost feature on I was
able to get seven hours and three
minutes to be exact before the speaker
died I ran the same exact test with my
Sony XP 20 I was able to achieve nine
hours and eight minutes instead moving
on to Bluetooth range anchor claims up
to 66 feet and with my testing I was
able to achieve about 95 linear feet of
range which is outrageous every
go through two walls and some cabinets
never dead lose signal the last but not
least be built-in speakerphone it's
quite good at all lengths so standing
away from the speaker never did the
sound cord boost cause my voice to echo
or give off a sound as though I was in a
bathroom I do admit though although
standing from three to five feet away my
voice was still oddly quieter than the
competition
so finally - the moment you've been
waiting for here I'll play several songs
for you guys and then I'll give you my
verdict afterwards
[Laughter]
one time we made a promise we'd all stay
we were closed that we always get to the
end of day
you hold you closer you call the waste
alert and let me go did you call - yeah
did you not know who to trust
wait
I thought it'd be
go
the first time you fire this thing up
you're going to notice the anger has
bass the sound core gets deep it's
resonating it's quite impressive at how
low this thing can go it's even deeper
than the beats pill plus which is also a
bass heavy speaker deeper than DJ before
and Sony XP 20 now with all that bass
there's minimal distortion and you don't
have that nasty fluttering that you get
with cheaper models now how does this
affect the mid-range as with basic
speakers especially cheap ones sometimes
they can distort and give off this muddy
presence with these encore boost you
don't get that listen to generals of
hip-hop rap pop music and EDM it all
sounds great the mid-range is still very
much pronounced and provides an
immersive experience and for those in
this price range you're going to be
happy and the flip side if you
predominantly listen to generals of rock
classical or songs heavy into vocals the
vocals do sound ever so slightly
recessed compared to the big branded
competition indeed the foot for the XV
20 offers less bass and the vocals are
brighter more forward making the
affirmation genres shine with my test if
you don't have all three of these
speakers side by side at home playing
them back-to-back the song core is still
great to listen to as for the high notes
I didn't hear any pinging or ear
piercing note audio separation is not
much apparent as with most Bluetooth
speakers small or large and the sound
stage is also absent again very similar
to most employed speakers out there in
the end I'm really impressed by the
audio performance if you're on a budget
and looking for a Bluetooth speaker in
general the sound core is worthy to look
into
now despite its shortcomings they are
very short in my opinion the only issue
I would consider is really its battery
life in the comment section below let me
know what you think is this something
that you would consider a buying or not
it's a better life enough for your needs
I would be interested in hearing your
thoughts again I'm Jimmy with James
review you guys take care and I will see
you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
