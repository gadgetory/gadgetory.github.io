row to 100,000 subscribers appreciate
you guys saw the count up right put out
the above the screen somewhere hope you
guys doing good off on another filming
adventure here just how to swap out cars
here and get the car with a baby seat
that's what's in the center right there
you gotta pick up the little girl in
about a hour and sprite it's five
o'clock right now so it's rush hour so
there's a bunch of cars coming on and
whatnot but yeah I got the boom to had
it for about a week now personally
bought it and I've been given a shot and
whatnot running to the most open spot
that I can find here in the city and
that way I can test out the range ue
claims that this has 100 feet worth of
wireless range so that should be pretty
interesting to test out see how it goes
but the sound quality wise I'm kind of
shocked man it wasn't a I think because
a lot of other newer bluetooth speakers
have been coming out those other ones
sound actually a little bit better than
this thing here so littell shocked you
II didn't improve on a sound quality the
sound volume it the loudest has
definitely increased it is loud as heck
but surprisingly this little thing can
power up a small I'm sorry this little
thing can power up my living room
downstairs at once you guys see in the
reviews there just one big span that
expands for my living room all the way
over to my kitchen so it's about 40
linear feet of open space but yeah this
little thing can definitely fill that
room but again the quality just didn't
really didn't really hit it for me but
what I intend to do in this vlog here
I'm gonna unbox another item a box here
that I got I didn't know who the heck it
was from
sometimes these packages you know you
buy from amazon or wherever and amazon
most for the most part comes in one or
two days for me but then you know other
companies they say anywhere from five to
15 days so who knows what I get
sometimes and I'm this here it doesn't
have the the senator who it is basically
so it's awesome man it's always like a
little surprise for me every time it's
like Christmas so it's one of the perks
of being a reviewer I guess holy these
people can't drive it's my new york rage
coming out and anyways let's go on to
the next scene i'm gonna find a parking
spot real quick here and we're good to
go all right there must be something
crazy going on in the city right now but
I just saw fire trucks and ambulances
all over converging into the city and of
course we got the news chopper
helicopters hovering right there too and
I think there's another helicopter in
the distance coming over here but
anyways what I want to show you guys was
this awesome little tool I got here it's
a laser distance measurer I actually
reviewed this long time ago basically
this point and shoot you turn on the
laser there we go right there hey
pointing at the wall
and you press one more time and it gives
you a measurement but the box has been
really really good for me and I'm sorry
guys and there is another helicopter
coming in here I guess there is
something going on but here goes the air
that I'm gonna film I'm gonna have I'm
going to measure about a hundred feet
and see how far i can get with the UE
boom to and see basically how how long
the range is alright so let me get going
here I gotta pick up my little girl from
daycare and it is about almost six now
and I'm pretty short a city traffic
right now is for rendus I can see
gridlock from here and again those
helicopters there's one right above me
so sorry for the bad sound I might
rerecord this might not but I see you
guys the next one right answer some
questions in the next scene all right
folks it's question time so just like in
all my videos on my blog so far that is
write down your questions down below it
doesn't have to be YouTube related and I
will answer them next week on next
week's vlog so hope you guys leave
something down below you won't have to
answer for you but it goes to list for
this week here start for pronounce your
name is wrong first one is Harrison
Lloyd best and worst products I ever
reviewed worst product and that's a
tough thing like most of these products
there's always pros and cons to each but
the one that really and unfortunately
stands out the most is the powerup 3.0
it's basically a little motor that you
stick on your paper airplane and you can
control your paper airplane with your
smartphone it's really cool if you get
guys ever watch that video is called a
powerup 3.0 unfortunately for me it did
not work it was very tough to use I
don't think I was successful to be
honest with you in all the attempts that
I tried and I did show in the video as
well I know I do know for some people it
did work but there is also a good
handful of people that it was
unfortunately a difficult challenge so
for the average consumer for having kids
because it's a toy man it was really
tough to you so unfortunately power
3-pointer wasn't wasn't so great in all
the products that reviewed so far best
one has to be the bose qc25 noise
cancelling headphones not the best in
sound quality but noise cancelling it
beats out my samsung level overs I've
tested and also the Sennheiser momentum
wireless which is currently my favorite
pair of headphones it beats the noise
canceling performance on those two hands
down the best it was really fun not only
did it perform well but I was able to
bring it into the city I actually stood
next to the train water fountains in
front of corporate centers I was out
there during the lunch hour so a lot of
people were walking around what not just
ambient noise cars driving by it's a
really good test got me outdoors but I
was just impressed by the performance
and like said I got to film outdoor I'm
always grateful when I can't get out and
away from the studio life improvements
is the next question tap three generous
and three artists from each category in
regards to music here I probably won't
list out the artist since there's so
many but EDM will be the first cascade
that guy is sick listen to his music you
can YouTube it as well watches live
concerts but I cascade I'm really into
that kind of EDM right now or electronic
dance music definitely check them out
the other genre it's more like deep
trance I don't know how to explain it
something collective gasp music I don't
know but the checkout Blackmill once he
listened to him you guys will understand
what I'm talking about and it puts you
in a whole different world and if you
guys have some good pair of headphones
give them a shot Blackmill very Duncan
music give it a shot and then the other
the last general I would say is rap
hip-hop pop music in general and that's
of course anybody top 40 radio just in
general I just listened to them and
whatnot next one is I believe it's Earl
de salsa all right how long have I been
gyming for what workouts did I do
because I'm huge I'll be honest and I'm
not huge I don't know why and I'm not
trying to be monoester humble I think
it's the camera maybe it makes me look
big or Jack to whatever i'm not trying
to get jacked her or huge i I'm just
trying to stay fit man I'll be honest
and let me tell you a little story
behind this so after college or during
college I was really eating healthy like
very healthy and I worked out
religiously and then when I went to work
for corporate I started eating a lot of
Lean Cuisine thinking that it was
healthy for me and then I'll be on
I was eating poorly I was drinking you
know I soda can maybe two cans a day I
just try to stay awake I wasn't a big
coffee drinker at that time and i did my
yearly checkup got my blood work done
and my triglycerides was at 400 in
something when I believe the norm is
about a hundred and twenty one hundred
and forty or so and then I was
prehypertension for high blood pressure
as well crazy and I was like 22 at the
time really young so then I want a this
crash course diet of eating salmon you
know make a three drinking water and i
went back and forced myself to try to
jog and i hate running but i do it and
just you know stay healthy and you know
after three months he said come back and
do the blood work and sure enough my
triglycerides and my prehypertension did
go down and it's at a reasonable level
no meant of course I don't want to be on
meds so that's why I try to strive to
stay healthy I was a lot more cut lean
tone I guess it in my earlier 20s today
you know metabolism starting to slow
down a little bit but I workout just try
to stay healthy but again I'm not I
don't think I'm huge I Lee said I think
it's the cameraman so sorry to bust you
guys bubbles next one is my white finger
you guys got some unique names to him
most interesting things in life good bad
weird or awkward made most interesting i
gotta say is a youtube I mean it's kind
of obvious but YouTube has opened up a
lot of doors I was able to go on the
press conference for jaybird last year
and when they revealed the jaybird rain
and that was like an opportunity that I
never experienced before I had less than
obviously less subscribers at that
moment and they they gave me an
opportunity and an experienced traveled
all the way up to salt lake city utah
and be a part of a press conference for
the first time and just to meet really
cool individuals out there working
professionals from a fourth journalism
but also in the sports community and i
know it was a humbling experience to
actually do that for the first time and
small little me and small a little
youtube channel but i'm grateful for it
and they you know it was a good
experience a good time but um other
interesting or good stuff is in my
previous jobs i was able to travel a lot
so I've been up and down almost the
entire East Coast from Boston all the
way down to orlando South Carolina
Georgia Alabama down to Louisiana thumb
to New Orleans and I drove all the way
to dallas texas going through houston
and a drove back going back through a
Little Rock Arkansas Tennessee and then
and then through Pennsylvania and all
that crap so all y'all drove that entire
way actually so sorry I didn't mention
that earlier I hope and I wanted to do
that on my 30th birthday was to drive
all the way from the east coast to the
west coast taking a southern part of the
United States then when i drive back and
we'd drive up the coast the west coast
and hit up seattle then head up the like
out of Minnesota Nebraska but not but
eventually make my way over to Chicago
and then back up to New York City so I
haven't done that of course I got a kid
now so that's why those dreams
unfortunately had to be postponed but
one day man one day maybe I can take her
along who knows but that'd be like a a
good two month trip but that's it for
the questions leave your questions down
below and I'll try to answer them next
week and I got of course more products
along the way tons of stuff being
announced we got google chromecast which
I definitely want to get because I did
buy the original one and I notice it's
kind of slow but uh Lisa hopefully the
new ones you know sped up and whatnot
the Moto 360 got my eye on I might get
that i'm filming with a note for been
contemplating on replacing it I might
get the nexus was at 6p see how that
goes I have a surprise for you guys as
well I got the s6 edge+ on the way and
that should be maybe a nun box i don't
know if i'm gonna do a full review on
that but we'll see but it went again um
