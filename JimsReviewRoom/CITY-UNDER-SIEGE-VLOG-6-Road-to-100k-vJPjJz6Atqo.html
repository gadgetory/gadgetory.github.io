ro to 100,000 subscribers pretty sure
you guys saw the count up right put out
the above the screen somewhere
hope you guys doing good off on another
filming adventure here just had a swap
out cars here and get the car with a
baby seat that's what's in the center
right there you got to pick up the
little girl in about an hour and it's
bright it's five o'clock right now so
it's rush hour so there's a bunch of
cars coming on and whatnot but yeah I
got the boom tube had it for about a
week now personally bought it and I've
been giving it a shot and whatnot
running to the most open spot that I can
find here in the city and that way I can
test out the range
youie claims that this has 100 feet
worth the wireless range so that should
be pretty interesting to test out and
see how it goes but the sound quality
wise I'm kind of shocked man it wasn't
uh I think because a lot of other newer
Bluetooth speakers have been coming out
those other ones sound actually a little
bit better than this thing here so
little shocked you II didn't improve on
a sound quality the sound volume it the
loudest has definitely increased
it is loud as heck but surprisingly this
little thing can power up a small I'm
sorry this little thing can power up my
living room downstairs that was wise you
guys see in the reviews they're just one
big span that expands for my living room
all the way over to my kitchen so slow
40 linear feet of open space but yeah
this little thing can definitely fill
that room but again the quality just
didn't really uh didn't really hit it
for me well what I intend to do in this
vlog here I'm gonna unbox another item a
box here that I got I didn't know who
the heck it was from
sometimes these packages you know you
buy from Amazon or wherever and Amazon
most for the most part comes in one or
two days for me but then you know other
companies they say anywhere from five to
fifteen days so who knows what I get
sometimes and I miss here it doesn't
have the the sender who it is basically
so it's awesome man it's always like a
little surprise for me every time
it's like Christmas so it's one of the
perks of being a reviewer I guess holy
these people can't drive
it's my New York rage coming out and
anyways let's go over to the next scene
I'm gonna find a parking spot real quick
here and we're good to go
alright there must be something crazy
going on in the city right now but I
just saw fire trucks and ambulances all
over converging into the city and of
course we got that news chopper a
helicopters hovered right there too and
I think there's another helicopter in
the distance coming over here but
anyways what I want to show you guys was
this awesome little tool I got here it's
a laser distance measure I actually
reviewed this long time ago
basically it's point-and-shoot you turn
on the laser there he goes right there
hey pony at the wall
and you press one more time and it gives
you a measurement but the box has been
really really good for me I'm sorry guys
if there is another helicopter coming in
here I guess there is something going on
but here goes the air that I'm gonna
film I'm gonna have I'm gonna measure
about a hundred feet and see how far I
can get with the UE boom - and see
basically how how long the range is
alright so let me get going here I gotta
pick up my little girl from daycare and
it is about almost 6:00 now and I'm
furniture at a city traffic right now is
four rendus I can see gridlock from here
and again those helicopters there's one
right above me so sorry for the bad
sound I might rerecord this might not
but I'll see you guys the next one right
answer some questions in the next scene
alright folks it's question time so just
like in all my videos on my blog so far
that is write down your questions down
below it doesn't have to be youtube
related and I will answer them next week
on next week's vlog so hope you guys
leave something down below you want to
have to answer for you but it goes to
list for this week here start for
pronounce your names wrong first one is
Harrison Lloyd best and worst products I
ever reviewed worst product and that's
the tough thing in like most of these
products there's always pros and cons to
each but the one that really and
unfortunately stands out the most is the
powerup 3.0 it's basically a little
motor that you stick on your paper
airplane and you can control your paper
airplane with your smartphone it's
really cool if you guys ever watch that
video it's called the powerup 3.0
unfortunately for me it did not work it
was very tough to use I don't think I
was successful to be honest with you in
all the attempts that I tried and I did
show in the video as well I know I do
know for some people it did work but
there is also a good handful of people
that it was unfortunately a difficult
challenge so for the average consumer
for having kids because it's a toy man
it was really tough to you so
unfortunately the powerup 3.0 wasn't
wasn't so great and all the products
that I reviewed so far the best one has
to be the bose qc25 noise cancelling
headphones not the best in sound quality
but noise cancelling it
beats out my samsung level over as I've
tested and also these Sennheiser
Momentum's Wireless which is currently
my favorite pair of headphones it beats
the noise canceling performance on those
two hands-down the best
it was really fun not only did it
perform well but I was able to bring it
into the city I actually stood next to
the Train water fountains in front of
corporate centers I was out there during
the lunch hour so a lot of people were
walking around whatnot and just ambient
noise cars driving by it's a really good
test got me outdoors but I was just
impressed by the performance and like I
said I got to film outdoors I'm always
grateful when I can't get out and away
from the studio life improvements is the
next question
top-3 generous and three artists from
each category in regards to music here I
probably won't list out the artist since
there's so many but EDM will be the
first cascade that guy is sick listen to
his music you can YouTube it as well
watches live concerts but I cascade I'm
really into that kind of EDM right now
or electronic dance music definitely
check them out the other genre it's more
like deep trance I don't know how to
explain it some eclectic gas music I
don't know but check out black male once
you listen to him you guys will
understand what I'm talking about and it
it puts you in a whole different world
and if you guys have some good pair of
headphones give them a shot black male
very dumb give music give it a shot and
then the other the last general I would
say is rap hip hop pop music in general
and that's of course anybody top 40
radio just in general I just listened to
them and whatnot next one is I believe
it's earl de salza alright how long have
I been jamming for what workouts do I do
because I'm huge I'll be honest man I'm
not huge I don't know why and I'm not
trying to be modest or humble I think
it's the camera maybe it makes me look
big or jacked or whatever I'm not trying
to get jacked or or huge I'm just trying
to stay fit man I'll be honest and let
me tell you a little story behind this
so after college or during college I was
really eating healthy like very healthy
and I worked out religiously and then
when I went to work for corporate I
started eating a lot of Lean Cuisine
thinking that it was healthy for me and
then I'll be honest
I was eating poorly I was drinking you
know a soda can maybe two cans a day I
just try to stay awake I wasn't a big
coffee drinker at that time and I did my
yearly checkup got my blood work done
and my triglycerides was at 400 in
something when I believed the norm is
about a hundred and twenty 140 or so and
then I was prehypertension for high
blood pressure as well crazy and I was
like 22 at the time really young so then
I went to this crash course diet of
eating salmon you know Omega threes
drinking water and I went back and
forced myself to try to jog and I hate
running when I do it and just you know
stay healthy and you know after three
months he said come back and do the
blood work and sure enough my
triglycerides and my pre hypertension
did go down and it's at a you know
reasonable level no meant of course I
don't want to be on meds so that's why I
try to strive to stay healthy I was a
lot more lean tone I guess you know in
my earlier 20s today you know metabolism
starting to slow down a little bit but I
work out just to try to stay healthy but
again I'm not I don't think I'm huge I
least said I think it's the cameraman so
sorry to bust you guys bubbles next one
is my white finger you guys got some
unique names to him most interesting
things in life good bad weird or awkward
man most interesting I got to say is a
YouTube I mean it's kind of obvious but
YouTube has opened up a lot of doors I
was able to go on the press conference
for jaybird last year and when they
revealed the jaybird rain and that was
like an opportunity that I never
experienced before I had less than
obviously less subscribers at that
moment and they they gave me an
opportunity and an experience traveled
all the way up to Salt Lake City Utah
and be a part of a press conference for
the first time and just to meet really
cool individuals out there working
professionals from a fourth journalism
but also in the sports community and I
know it was a humbling experience to
actually do that for the first time and
small little me and some more a little
YouTube channel but I'm grateful for it
and they you know it was a good
experience a good time but um other
interesting or good stuff is in my
previous jobs I was able to travel a lot
so I've been up and down almost the
entire East Coast from Boston all the
way down to Orlando South Carolina
Georgia Alabama down to Louisiana come
to New Orleans and I drove all the way
to Dallas Texas going through Houston
and the drove back going back there were
a Little Rock Arkansas Tennessee and
then and then through Pennsylvania and
all that crap so all y'all drove that
entire way actually so sorry I didn't
mention that earlier I hope and I wanted
to do that on my 30th birthday was to
drive all the way from the east coast to
the west coast taking a southern part of
the United States then when I Drive back
and we drive up the coast the west coast
and hit up Seattle then head up the like
out of Minnesota Nebraska but not but
eventually make my way over to Chicago
and then back up to New York City so I
haven't done that of course I got a kid
now so that's why yeah those dreams
unfortunately had to be postponed but
one day man one day maybe I can take her
along who knows but that'd be like a a
good two-month trip but that's it for
the questions leave your questions down
below and I'll try to answer them next
week and I got of course more products
along the way tons of stuff being
announced
we got Google chromecast which I
definitely want to get because I did buy
the original one and notice it's kind of
slow but Lisa hopefully the new ones you
know sped up and whatnot the Moto 360
got my eye on I might get that I'm
filming with the note 4 I've been
contemplating on replacing it I might
get the Nexus was it 6p see how that
goes
I have a surprise for you guys as well I
got the s6 edge+ on the way and that
should be maybe an unbox I don't know if
I'm gonna do a full review on that but
we'll see but anyway again write down
your comments below I will what I will
answer them next week for you guys and
so you guys are the next one you guys
