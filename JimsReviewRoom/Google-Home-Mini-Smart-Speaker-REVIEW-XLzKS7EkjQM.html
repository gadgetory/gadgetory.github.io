voice assistant speakers are going to be
a big thing in 2018
Alexa has their version Apple will
eventually release their home speaker
and Google well they have this the
Google home Mini I'll put prices on your
screen I did personally buy this direct
from Google but as always I'll place my
affiliate links in the video description
below
click on those links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
so folks sit back and relax
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review heading into the physical
features first I love the fabric cover
it gives the room a more textured look
making the error look up a bit more
comfortable to make this kid in pet safe
so it doesn't slide off the table
there's a non-skid pad underneath with
my testing it's not moving at all now
beautiful and bright LEDs light up the
top when using the Google home mini when
activated and something I found very
intuitive were the touch controls on
either side giving an ever so slight tap
raises and lowers volume now looking at
the side of the Google home Mini as an
FYI
there's no three-and-a-half millimeter
port for physical connections however
there's a button to turn off the
microphones just in case you don't want
to activate Google assistance and into
the middle that is the microUSB port
oddly I have no idea why they didn't go
with USB type-c keep in mind there's no
battery built in so it's not portable
per se and we require being plugged in
at all times now this is a Wi-Fi speaker
so it does they connect it to your
home's Internet you can also use this
with Bluetooth with your phone here as
it does come with Bluetooth 4.1 now as a
fun fact I know I mentioned earlier this
doesn't have a built in battery but I
did connect this to one of my power
banks the speaker can indeed function
like a portable bluetooth speaker you
just got to bring around a USB cord any
power bank fill just something I wanted
to share but testing the microphone in a
silent room and with a normal voice the
mini speaker can pick up my voice from
about 40 linear feet away it's pretty
impressive now with music blasting at
maximum volume I was able to
stand 20 feet away but had to raise my
voice for the speaker to hear me not bad
though considering how small the speaker
is testing a speakerphone the person I
was talking to played loudly and clearly
throughout the room the microphone
picked up my voice pretty decent loud
inaudible one closer up but sounded to
have slight distance in some room echo
when I was standing further away so
finally the Google assistant
capabilities are the real star of the
show here I do use it every morning for
the basics like getting my weather but
better yep I place my work address into
my Google accounts and have the home
Minnie tell me how many minutes will it
take in traffic to get to work but some
more advanced features Google assistant
is now conversational meaning you can
ask a question and she will follow up
with several more questions to better
understand you it keeps track of this
and then gives you an answer back
accordingly there's no need to say the
Google command each time that you want
to ask something how much your plane
tickets to New York upcoming round-trip
flights from Charlotte to New York City
start at $145 do you know what dates
you'd like to fly for those watching
Netflix like I do I can usually tell the
Google mini to play stranger things on
my chromecast enable TV the only issue
they can't differentiate which season I
want to watch it's also a very similar
experience with YouTube it's great that
it plays but because of the huge library
of videos sometimes it doesn't play the
exact one they don't want either or it
was better than nothing in the past just
originally they allowed me to pull up my
home security camera both nest cams and
logic cams which helps tremendously
and features that I know does work but I
don't own any of these because they're
just too expensive his smart thermostats
well the Google you can firmly across
the room tell the nest thermostat to
cool down the house it's pretty
intensive how deep this is and surely
how far it will go in 2018 so alright
folks checking out the audio I'm going
to play several samples for you guys so
be sure to put on your headphones or
earphones to get the best listening
experience
this small little speaker packs a punch
I'm pretty amazed at how bright and how
loud this can get considering how small
it is to the Google mini does lack in
base but it's very forward with its
vocal performance with that bright and
forth sound signature the speaker sounds
clear and well pronounced volume levels
are enough for personal and casual
listening bedrooms garages you standing
in or around your kitchen our ideal
places now you can have music playing in
large open areas but the audio will
sound pretty much generic as for a
soundstage it's common with most small
speakers there's no audio depth
perception or separation since there's
only one speaker and if there are -
there's just too close together to
provide any kind of open soundstage in
general so folks for $50.00 I really
liked it a lot my life has already
integrated into Google's ecosystem and
with the many I'm now expanding my
experience through hardware and
appliances it's awesome until I found
out that the anti a is watching but
they're always watching right anyways
guys once again I'm Jimmy wood Jim's
review room please like subscribe and
comment down below what you guys think
of the Google home MIDI you guys take
care and I'll see you on the next one
