room the MX master is back and although
this looks identical to the MX master
the 2's has some very darn good features
and upgrades and if you're new to the MX
lineup they've been one of the best
options to buy if you're having desktop
production those working long hours in
front of a computer anyone that needs as
much from a mouse as they can Logitech
provided this mouse under embargo so I'm
finally able to show this on my channel
it's priced at $99 retail as with the
previous generation as always I'll place
my affiliate links in the video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
these things might go on sale so sit
back relax and hopefully my video can
help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's review
going over the physical features first
there's no question that this mouse is
large compared to other mice that have
here in the office as a size comparison
the 2s fills the palm the best the
medium-sized M 705 I can indeed cut that
entire thing here is a great mouse
nonetheless but for long hours in front
of the computer editing the larger Mouse
with that huge thumb rest here does
allow my hands to feel more relaxed now
one thing I wish Logitech would improve
is providing a stickier much more grippy
texture at the some area and on the
other side where my ring and pinky
finger rest to make it less slippery
when handling that's something I missed
and the MX performance mouse that they
had way back in the day now some
familiar features makes a return the
hyper scroll wheel is perfect for large
Excel and Word documents it's perfect
for long webpages to scroll through them
pretty quickly here you can toggle
free-flowing which I just showed you
here or with the tap of the button for
and the mouse you can have a click -
click Ratched method for moving around
it gives you a little bit more precision
now for example if you're into Photoshop
utilizing the side scroll wheel here
will move your workspace from left to
right and vice versa
comes in handy from time to time the
back-and-forth buns that are found on
other mice or other competitors is
available to go back or forward on
webpages which is super convenient but
compared to many other mice I've used in
the past including Logitech having the
buns a bit bigger or simply moving the
buttons directly above my thumb will be
much easier than retracting my thumb
each time to tap now there's a discreet
button on the thumb rest when pressed
this brings up all of your windows for
viewing at a glance and back to a single
windowpane when pressed again although
all these features from the factory are
useful for everyday use with the free
letter tech options software you can
customize up your buttons and have them
performed certain shortcuts have them
performed certain keyboard shortcuts
even it's all customizable now from here
on out in this video this is where it
gets really interesting and personally
for me puts me at all with any Logitech
options software we can have the buttons
customized to a specific application
whether it be Google Chrome whether
you're using Adobe Photoshop or premiere
or even Microsoft Paint you can
customize your mouse and use the buttons
as your predefined shortcuts now one
example if you copy and paste a lot
assign copy and paste to your back-end
for buns whenever
working premiere those buns are used
just for copying pasting but once it
opens say let's say chrome the mouse
automatically changes to whatever I have
set for the Chrome application in this
case I left it as going back on pages
and going forward on webpages for my
convenience but the mouse intuitively
jumps back and forth in between settings
as a jump in between apps or programs
now moving on to other new and upgraded
features and why you would consider
buying this is the dark field mouse
tracking the original master had and up
to 1600 dpi reading while the master 2 s
has an up to 4,000 dpi reading making
this a very sensitive Mouse and a highly
reactive Mouse to to small movements and
your field of work you might just need
that the master is still capable of
reading on practically all surfaces that
you throw at it whether you're not using
a mouse pad at all or using it on top of
Dell would shine even here would tables
and even transparent glass that I've
tested here again it all works
now wireless range wise I was able to
achieve twenty-seven million feet before
the mouse started to lose its signal now
better life has claimed to be improved
as well with the original master lasting
up to 40 days the new master 2 s lasts
up to 70 days and just being transparent
I haven't had this mouse for the full 70
days so I can't say how long it's lasted
so far but once the battery does die
check the video description and I'll
list what I achieved eventually the last
step and we've seen this before you can
have this Mouse pair via bluetooth N or
the Logitech unifying USB attachment
three computers can be connected at the
same time and can be switched between
them by pressing the button on the back
of the mouse pretty straightforward
example but again the 2's flexes its
features list here once again with the
introduction of Logitech Flow download
the software on your windows and/or app
computer and have the mouse recognized
by up to three computers again now you
can seamlessly work across three
computers at the same time very similar
to having three monitors connected into
one PC or one system you can drag your
mouse over to the second and third
screen you can share your keyboard
across all three systems as well
I tested copying files from one computer
and pasting it on to another that went
without
hitch the connection is based off of
your homes network and not by bluetooth
or with the USB unified that logitech
provides now I tested this with a 250
megabyte video file here it had taken
about a minute and a half to fully copy
over that lightning speed 9 gigabit
speeds though but for the average
consumer faster than sending files
through email or uploading to Dropbox
and read downloading now there are
unfortunately limitations though which
does take away from this amazing idea
one and this is not a deal breaker
technically in my book here but moving
my mouse over to other screens there is
a slight one-second delay before the
mouse is responsive again again very
minor now second I can't drag a file and
drop it on to the other desktop my files
would stop at the edge of the screen and
the mouse would continue to go across
and third I can't have an open file such
as a word doc open or a photo opened and
drag it over to the other screen slash
computer as well it somewhat removes
that streamlined approach again another
thing I can do is copy and paste all of
this can't direct files over so in the
end here the master 2 s is still one
beast of a mouse if you currently don't
own the previous generation and are in
need of a Productivity Mouse in general
for sure get this it's a large
comfortable fit tons of options tons of
features here I love the custom setup
for each program and it works seamlessly
they propose better life increased never
hurts in love stick flow it is a great
concept I can still see it as being very
beneficial for many I do wish it was
more intuitive but as stated earlier it
is easier / faster than sending it to
your own email or cloud storage and then
read downloading that's assuming you
don't have a thumb drive yourself so
overall I still highly recommend the
master 2s if you don't currently own the
original master now for those who have
the previous generation let me know in
the comment section below is it worth
the upgrade to you or not to be really
curious to know what you guys think
hopefully this video helped you make
that purchase decision you guys take
care and I will see you on the next one
