hey everyone Jimmy with Jim's review
room my apologies for such a huge delay
on this review but as they say it's
better late than never I'm trying to get
my office up and ready for you guys but
this is hands-down the most anticipated
SmartWatch on my channel especially
after testing the s2 from last year and
seeing how great that one felt now I
personally paid for this at the retail
price of $349 prices are on your screen
of course and indeed compared to most of
the competition it is up there I'll
place my links in the video description
below click on my links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
you never know when these things might
go on sale so without further ado my
channel is here to help you make a
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review going over the physical
features the first thing you're going to
think the s3 looks huge and it is a big
watch compared to many others on the
market i'll myth that but if you're into
big watches this thing looks amazing it
looks rugged it looks badass
and over a very masculine watch now the
biggest problem though if you are an
office worker and typically wear long
sleeves without rolling them up this
thing is going to snag quite a bit here
at the cuff so just be aware of that now
in the retail box there's small and
large silicone wristbands from the get
go feature the coolest removal method to
swap them out you can always swap them
out for leather all the materials down
the road here and wearing this all day
it is very comfortable here I personally
did not have any irritation while
wearing now the entire watch is ip68
certified the six meeting that this is
dust tight no dust is going to get in
and the 8 which is the highest ring that
you can get an electronic device today
the number 8 means it is submersible in
at least one meter of water for up to 30
minutes
now the Samsung user manual does get
more specific stating 1.5 meters is the
maximum for up to 30 minutes and also to
avoid taking this into the shower or
going swimming with the s3 on the s3 is
also receiving the military standard
certification against high and low
temperatures it's also shock resistant
also rain resistant as well and with my
time wearing this too even submerging my
own watch underwater the s3 is seriously
a tank not much will be stopping this
compared to the competition now moving
on here looking at the back there is
wireless charging offered through these
Samsung doc Samsung is climbing up to
four days of battery life which is
phenomenal now but my experience of my
test here I'm getting two days on
average
unfortunately 50% less than what Samsung
is claiming but on the flip side though
it's still better than most if not all
the other smartwatches that have tested
so far on the channel now the s3 also
brings back the heart rate sensor you
can check your heart rate instantly if
you'd like with the built in app if
you're not manually checking the watch
periodically we'll do so throughout the
day and save it into your s health app
I'll discuss heart rate performance and
the health features a bit later now
let's get into the meat of the
SmartWatch here the upper button is your
back button here the bottom right is
your home button and it works as pulling
up your app menu as well the home button
can also serve as a quick access feature
to open an app double tapping it
basically can activate s voice open up
contacts open up your calendar open up s
health or even open up your music player
etc but the bad side or the unfortunate
side here it doesn't have every app at
your disposal so what I did on mine here
I'd then set up two recent apps which
gives me a little bit more wiggle room
now a triple tap on that same home
button will activate the SOS feature I
figured that I personally love for peace
of mind set this up ahead of time
through your phone by inputting who your
emergency contacts are it could be 911
like and selecting if you want them to
receive text or a phone call from you
and events let's say you're in a car
accident or fallen where you can't reach
your phone reach for your wrist and
again those three tabs will activate
this your GPS location will be sent via
text or if you elected to use your phone
call method your watch will turn the
speakerphone on you can communicate
through your wrist but more on that a
little bit later now back to the face of
the watch here that beautiful and very
tactile metal bezel makes it come back
and it rotates so you can cycle through
your screens and the options scrolling
to my left are all of your notifications
and updates Facebook hangouts calendar
events you name it rotating the bezel to
the right and showing you some of the
things that I have on here I know I'm
going to show you a bunch may be
something might not be for you but
there's whether there's contacts there's
reminders for the day calendar events
calorie count and activity wheel for the
day my steps and
Institute in barometer here my news
headlines linked with Flipboard media
controls to control my music and then
there's silent vibrating alarms which
you can set up on your wrist here you
don't need to do it through your phone
now touching based on this quickly the
vibrations set on high felt of medium to
low strength for me and considering the
size of the s3 and I'm usually a light
sleeper as well I was expecting a bit
more feedback to wake me up in the
morning the good thing though along with
the vibrations you can have an audio
beat going off at the same time and if
anything that usually wakes me up but
then again it kind of defeats the
purpose of a silent vibrating alarm so
just be aware of this and I would
suggest to you to test it out yourself
now finishing up the screen next up is
an option to check my heart rate as I
showed you earlier and last is simply
for apps that I would frequent late me
now all the apps that I have shown so
far can be customized in any order and
you can either add or remove them
through your phone by pressing the home
button brings you to the app menu or
rotating again that sleek bezel here
scrolls through all of your apps so
switching gears a bit here I want to
discuss the more unique features of the
watch there is a microphone built-in and
you can respond back to text messages
via your voice unless there's also the
ability to use your watch as a
speakerphone now as for audio quality
those on the other end were able to hear
me quite well I can have my arm out in
front of me and the microphone still
picks up my voice with pretty good
amount of quality but the speakerphone
unfortunately does get raspy and tinny
at the very high frequencies when you
hear other people talk to you now
besides using your voice for texting and
phone calls you can go the more
traditional method here of typing in a
text or even handwriting individual
letters now it works for the most part
and I only see this method as being
convenient in more in dire situations
it's not the fastest it's not 100%
accurate but it works and is there as a
unique and cool alternative now another
feature is having the ability to store
music right on the watch itself there's
four gigs of internal
storage and via bluetooth you can pair
your earphones or headphones and listen
to music right from your wrist there's
no need to carry your phone and this is
also very ideal for runners or those at
the gym who truly want to cut the cord
now as health as mentioned earlier is a
great app here from my testing in
recording your daily steps sleep if you
decide to wear the s3 overnight and many
other health tracking metrics now
jumping into the health features even
without your phone you can initiate
everything right on your wrist for a
workout select from a multitude of
activities from your gear s3 to label
your events here I'll eventually pick
running here since it's the most popular
I can set targets you can turn out of
the GPS of course got it intervals that
gives you updates during your activities
and it gives you alerts at every mile or
every few minutes or so based on your
information based on your distance your
pace your speed etc and while in an
activity you can view on your watch in
real time your heart rate your duration
your distance based on the GPS of course
calories burn pace which is essential
for runners here speed cadence and then
back to the heart rate being displayed
but this time in a bigger format or
bigger font and with my testing on
distance the GPS works every time and
the distance is accurate here the heart
rate sensor specifically on the s3 like
all risk based HR trackers there's not a
hump percent accurate for the s3 it's
been giving me good results when I
compare it to my chest strap the one big
downfall though that I've seen with the
gear s3 and this is assuming those who
already have data on these apps the s3
is lacking Strava and RunKeeper
at the time of this video met my run-in
endomondo or the only two other popular
apps that i could find there could be
more coming down the road if i didn't
miss anything
comment down below but since we're
touching out apps Tizen which is
Samsung's operating system has been
gaining traction it has been out for a
while now but shockingly we're still
seeing limited amounts of popular
third-party apps being supported
especially when you compare it to
Android wear and the Apple ecosystem now
one of the biggest downfalls that I've
personally seen is the lack of Google
Maps and real turn-by-turn navigation
something that I love again on Android
and Apple now well mit though for most
users out there for the average consumer
which I do cater to on this channel
despite the lack of apps the astroid
still provides most of your needs with
what is currently available today so
despite that limitation as
strongly recommend Tizen as an option so
with everything we touch based so far on
the frontier s3 it is one heck of a
SmartWatch here it's a Swiss Army
SmartWatch nonetheless it's rugged as
hell it looks badass the screen
functions great with zero slowdown or
freezes from my experience the screen
offers rich and vibrant colors visible
in low-light of course but it's also
visible in direct sunlight as well I
love the robust workout functions and
how easy it is to use
I love the rotating bezel I very much
enjoyed the design and the layout the
menus and notifications now with all
that being said there are indeed a few
flaws but it never deterred me from
recommending this watch in general now I
did personally pay full retail price for
this but never in the back of my mind
did I say man did I waste my money it
wasn't worth $350 I never said that
like I said I do wish there was
turn-by-turn navigation is probably the
biggest thing that's my biggest gripe
but other than that it's still a awesome
awesome watch that offers probably
everything that you can ask for in a
SmartWatch today now if you are budget
conscious I would say wait for this to
go on sale and even then you're going to
get one heck of a SmartWatch one heck of
a deal so I hope this video helped you
in some way be sure to LIKE and
subscribe if you haven't already and be
sure to check out the AC season watch
three that recently came out as well
it's seriously a great watch for the
price that it's offering at tap or click
on that if you would like and as always
gyms review room is here to help you
make a purchase decision you guys take
care and I will see you on the next one
bye
