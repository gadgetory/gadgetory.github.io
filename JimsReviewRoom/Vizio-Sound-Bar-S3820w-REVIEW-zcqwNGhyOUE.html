review room welcome back to another
review now in several of my bluetooth
speaker reviews I had several different
viewers asked me about speakers for your
TV to watch movies and play games but at
the same time wanting something smaller
and less cumbersome many traditional
tower speakers sound bars are indeed a
great alternative for the average
consumer looking for a better sound than
what a TV can put out so today I'm
pleased to show you what a Vizio Z
entry-level sound bars and they start at
just $79 for the 29 inch wide version
$99 for the 38 inch which I have here
and then it jumps up to two hundred and
ninety eight dollars for the 54 inch
wide one so without further ado we'll
get started we'll go over the
specifications and features first before
going into the sound quality this
mid-sized sound bar measures 38 inches
wide stands at three point six three
inches tall and has a depth of two point
eight eight inches it's also lightweight
but enough to stay in place weighing in
at five point two pounds the finish is
pretty standard coming in black plastic
with a fabric grille it's unlike some of
the more expensive brands out there
providing wood grain or a brushed
aluminum look however everything is
still very well built and still feels
like a quality product now this sound
bar is a two channel system which are
stereo left and right audio channels as
most sound bars are if you see one that
says 2.1 it usually denotes left and
right audio channels but it also
includes a subwoofer with a package and
before I miss this if you're interested
in the three hundred dollar fifty four
inch wide one I mentioned earlier that
is actually a three channel speaker with
no sub over there's left right and
center audio channels again that's only
on the 54 inch model and all these
models you can hang on the wall as Vizio
does provide or supply the wall mounting
hardware but looking at the dimensions
and when compared to other competitors
the videos do stick out a little bit
more though that might be unsightly from
the side now getting back on track here
and looking at the rear the left holds
all of your
cool buttons with first being the power
button second to toggle between your
audio sources bluetooth pairing button
is next and last are your volume up and
down but if you're sitting down the
sound bar does come with a quality built
but basic remote control and Vizio was
nice enough to include two triple A
batteries but what's very important and
not to forget if you're in the market
for one of these are its connections you
want to make sure that you have enough
ports if you have more than one device
and all these connections I'm about to
mention are all different meaning every
device will use a different cable to
connect now with this model here on the
left you have your old-school red and
white RCA inputs the power plug ports
and looking at the right here is your
RCA digital optical input or also known
as speed if depending on how you
pronounce it next a three and a half
millimeter inputs and the bottom right
is a RCA port to connect this to an
external subwoofer and as stated earlier
this is a 2.0 system which a subwoofer
is not included and very last in the
center is a USB port for servicing now
one thing that stood out to me is
there's no HDMI connections whatsoever
so keep in mind with this device you'll
use a HDMI cable from the device
directly to your TV and then use some
sort of audio cable from the device to
the sound bar again not a big deal but
something to point out and one last
thing I want to mention are these vizio
sound bars do have bluetooth connections
which is perfect when you want to listen
to music off your phone or tablet
wirelessly perfect for those who do want
to watch content while in bed or control
music well let's say you're in the
kitchen now the part that you've been
waiting for the sound quality now when
playing the last of us on PlayStation 4
with it's superb acting in music the
vizio really did justice it had taken me
by surprise how loud this thing actually
gets but more importantly it's actually
distortion free the sounds are actually
pretty deep with enough food that you
can say overall deep enough bass very
loud highs distinct voices it's great
for casual gaming in gaming in general
now if you're a competitive gamer then
for sure look into a headset where you
can differentiate audio fields a little
bit better
Oh
all right drive on through
ah
what's your business here at the day off
busy little friend alright move on
through Thanks now when jumping over to
movies I tried using one of my all-time
favorites heat and blu-ray featuring
Robert DeNiro Al Pacino and Val Kilmer
now during the iconic gunfight in
downtown LA sound was again loud voices
had depth and hearing bullets penetrate
through vehicles almost puts your mind
at all in how powerful this speaker is
again just very shocked from just a $99
sound bar
and that's the keyword that I wanted to
emphasize for just a $99 sound bar it
does very well of course when I compared
these to a $300 sound bar you do achieve
a bit more clarity fidelity as a whole a
quick example is in the same scene in
heat the more expensive systems
pronounces the shell casings hitting the
ground and gunfire echoing through the
skyscrapers much easier more naturally
that is now with the videos you had to
pay attention just a bit more to realize
those small but amazing details but
again for the price that you do pay I
believe you get more than what you still
paid for and if that's in your price
range or you're on a budget
hands down these will greatly improve
your entertainment experience over your
TV speakers so I hope this review helped
you in some way be sure to like
subscribe and share this video if you
can as it does help me and bring you

and Google+ for content behind the
scenes and I'll see you on the next one
