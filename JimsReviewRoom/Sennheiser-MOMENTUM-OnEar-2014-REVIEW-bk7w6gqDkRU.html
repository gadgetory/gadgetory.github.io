welcome to another review now today
we'll be looking at the latest
generation of these Sennheiser
Momentum's on here it's the smaller
brother of the momentum over ear model
and priced $100 cheaper at 199 the
momentum line previously received very
good reviews for performance and it's
more fashion focused metro look you can
say versus some of the other headsets
going with that more futuristic look
we'll see how this year's model holds up
and possibly help you decide if this is
worth the purchase or not so without
further ado we'll get started the
momentum on-ear comes in seven different
colors to match your fashionable needs
and the one half here is in blue by
going over as physical aspects first the
first thing that you'll notice is how
lightweight it looks and how it feels
just like the previous Momentum's the
headset uses a stainless steel metal
band to hold both ear cups in the
headband on top the material that covers
the headset is Alcantara sourced from
Milan Italy person hyzer giving a very
premium feel it's a synthetic composite
material that mimics suede but it has a
greater strain and abrasion resistance
Alcantara is widely used and currently
in luxury automobiles from BMW all the
way up to Lamborghini now moving on to
the ear pads then use the same material
and the padding is soft and supple each
ear pad is removable and each ear cup is
easily adjustable riding along the
battle band now braking in the headset
and playing around with the ear cup
didn't show any signs of wear at first I
was afraid over time I start to see
material flake off since it's a snug
slide and fit but that hasn't been the
case it's been really durable
now each ear cup also has the ability to
pivot and also slightly rotate to ensure
this fits most heads out there and while
wearing this at first it was somewhat
squeezing my head but after breaking
these in for about an hour or so they
became much more enjoyable
now with long term wearing although
there's not much padding and the
headband portion three hours into
wearing these didn't cause any fatigue
or soreness on my head
when considering they only weigh about
160 grams it's light enough to be
comfortable at one feature I found
missing are the ear cups don't fold
inward
there's still way for portability
however Sennheiser does provide a very
nice yet somewhat large though carrying
case it's low stitch with a neoprene or
foam like texture on the outside while
the inside is felt lined with a stretch
mesh fabric to hold your wires but
overall testing the durability of this
headset by stretching this in different
angles and areas examining its build the
construction is very well done it's a
premium feel has solid mechanics it's
lightweight and in my opinion it looks
good too and just me personally I should
have went with the black headset with
the red stitching I think those look the
best there but finishing its physical
layout here sennheiser provides two
cables to use one is the smart remote
which you can adjust valium play in
pause and fast forward and reverse your
music and with this cable and headset
you can answer phone calls as well and
with my phone call test based sounded
good but good for a headset though there
wasn't any noise cancellation features
but nonetheless voices were clear and
folks on the other end didn't find any
issues out but norm now moving on to the
part you've probably been waiting for
how long do the sound now my channel
aims for the average consumer and hope
you're enjoying this video so far
now these momentum on ears are a closed
back design or you can say sealed ear
cups helping with lower sound fields and
giving the perception of a more enclosed
soundstage but because they are a closed
back setup they do block a good amount
of ambient noises from the outside now
during testing the antler Momentum's in
my opinion they blocked about 85 percent
or so of outside noises which does help
with the immersion into your music
casual conversations for the most part
were muffled while crowds of people
still resonate some sounds through the
ear cups lightly now in addition it
keeps sound in and in theory provides a
deeper / richer sound now for my test
the on ear momentum to do get pretty
loud and playing around 75 percent
volume was very comfortable listening at
maximum volume the very highs and S's in
vocals are only slightly distorted and
it's only apparent on certain songs that
has a lot of layers on top of each other
but I wouldn't suspect too many people
listening at maximum volume as again
they are pretty loud now highs in
general are not tinny
or harsh on the ears as well even after
hours of listening from my experience
the on ears sounds great and I would say
almost perfect for
music from the likes of John Mayer
Michael Buble sounds that are more rock
folk country bluegrass excetera now
listening to R&amp;amp;B classics like moist men
an old school not new school that is
where I carry all did very well the
audio clarity on instruments are very
distinct especially the strings vocal
clarity is also very parents as tonality
is just in the right balance mid ranges
are not too pronounced yet not boxy
again right in the middle and lastly
there's enough clean bass deep enough
bass that makes hip-hop and rap an
enjoyable experience bass can be
described as being tight rounded and
thumping but with that being said if
you're a bass head and aiming for more
sub bass levels it's not a hundred
percent hit like those found on the
beats by journey headsets now going up
another hundred dollars through the
over-the-air Momentum's can only achieve
that deep and warm yet booming bass that
you may prefer but as an all-around
headset and still for hip-hop and rap it
still does justice though so overall
almost every genre throughout this I
believe did very well and if I can sum
this all up the an ear Momentum's are
very good from its build quality
aesthetics and down to its sound quality
despite missing some minor features that
is previously mentioned so I hope this
