room
ever since jaw bones fell off the map
there's the nothing as small as the up
three and offered heart rate tracking
today we finally have it answered I
personally bought the Ultra HR that's a
retail price of $149 and comparing to
the charge - it's really interesting to
find it at this price point and it makes
me wonder if Fitbit is changing their
product lineup later this year we'll
just have to wait and find out now as
always I'll place my amazon affiliate
links in the video description below
click on my links and they'll give you
the most updated prices in real time and
I'm very confident down the road you can
get beads for less than retail so
without further ado my channel is here
to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to jim's reviewer go
little the physical features first it's
nearly identical to beam on HR version
same comfortable band same screen size
and B same thickness but what I have
here is black with stainless steel and
the bands are still interchangeable so
you can swap them for different colors
or if ever when the band wears out
there's no tools required now as before
the Ulta HR is water resistance and only
splash and sweat proof there's no
indication on submerging this underwater
however I totally forgot that I was
wearing this while reviewing the JBL
flip for the other day if you did see
that video and practice replaying a few
right now I did my arm in the water
about two to three times the Ulta HR
still working perfectly fine today no
one is different though is the last
strap it uses a buffalo instead of these
snap-on buttons
the last regarding that physical bill of
course we have the optical heart rate
sensor on the back with Fitbit peer
pulse technology number one that's a
little bit later
touching based on better life if it uses
their proprietary charging cable if
you're a frequent traveler remember to
bring this along here this is great the
original ultimate claimed
five days worth of battery life the elta
HR despite having all-day heart rate
tracking is now claimed to have seven
days worth of use and while wearing this
I was indeed able to get seven days and
exactly two hours worth of use until the
product officially died now going over
the screen a double tap is required to
turn on the display two taps with your
index finger at times does not register
it is quite frustrating for newcomers
here now the other method performed here
listing your wrists if you're looking at
a watch for the most part reveals the
screen once in a while you might have to
reset your arm and do it again this is
pretty common on most vehicles today now
regard that screen though that is quite
dim though in direct sunlight at midday
when you're out walking or running it is
still identifiable but it is again hard
to see now jumping onto the screen here
and seeing what data is available you
have your time and date Nexus steps
after that is your heart rate distance
calories burned and active minute now
through the app you can also add a
resting heart rate to be displayed and
the battery life meter for YouTube view
now what you don't get down here is
floors climb okay keep in mind there are
other vertical and horizontal styles
that you can choose from six vertical
and six horizontal that I personally
counted here all selected through the
app to your preference in addition
despite the unobtrusive small screen the
also still has the ability to display
phone numbers and those who are calling
in there's also text messages that come
through but it only displays the
beginning the entire text message
doesn't show last calendar events are
shown on here as well but I noticed push
notifications from apps like aloe or
hangouts my personal logic cam or my at
home security system doesn't show on
here as well unfortunately now other
features I want to glance upon so you're
aware there's a get up and move feature
if you've been predominantly inactive
for an hour the wristband will vibrate
and tell you to get up and basically
perform a couple of steps for a couple
of minutes to keep you active throughout
the day the last but not least here
there is a sound vibrating alarm you can
set up multiple alarms in a day and any
combination of days including weekends
the vibration from my experience is good
and it's been able to wake me up every
morning
from bed now the only thing really
missing in regards to features is a
barometer to record how many flights of
stairs that you climb of course GPS is
not on here and I don't expect it to be
on here for such a fitness tracker but
again all those desired features that
are missing though
would of course make the band bigger or
if not at least more expensive now
regarding accuracy here suite tracking
first it's not perfect however it does
perform equivalent or better than the
competition out there
I watched Logan in theaters with my
father last week and at times trackers
in the past has registered me sleeping
because I would barely move how watching
a movie but in this case with the alta
HR there's no false positives
now with overnight sleeping it does a
very good job of knowing when I fell
asleep and when I woke up as well as
we're steps like all restore actors
they're never 100% accurate but pivots
seem to be within reason this will of
course be dependent on what you do on a
daily basis now finally such a kind of
heart rate tracking indeed it does
provide general all-day tracking it also
provides a resting heart rate to help
track your heart health and while on a
run or an activity you can see a heart
rate but you do have to tap or cycle
through the screens the accuracy is
quite good when I compared it to my
trusty driving through polar and
underarmour chest straps here optical
heart rate trackers rarely if ever are
100% accurate but surprisingly the alta
HR did very well the only issue that
I've found here at Fitbit includes smart
Trek which enables the band to auto
recognize your workouts after 10 or
maybe 15 minutes depending on what
you're doing and it saves it for you in
the app that's great but would be
altered the ulta HR for those who tend
to run and then walk or stop and go or
maybe those who do interval training it
won't register those activities because
you haven't been consistent again for
those 10 to 15 minutes I confirm this in
three different runs that I've performed
here interval runs that is and again it
just never registered never recorded on
to the app with the alta HR there's no
way to manually tell the band you start
a workout and when to stop it so in the
end here the Ulta HR although offering
the heart rate tracking it is still
somewhat of an entry level band now
don't get me wrong though Fitbit now
including HR ratings on the Alta this is
huge especially for such a tiny package
but on the other end though if you're a
running enthusiast needing pace cadence
a more robust and workout feature or
layout on the band itself you got to
look somewhere else
and you have to get something bigger and
probably something more pricier at the
end of the day I still highly recommend
the Alta HR for those not needing all
the bells and whistles or new into
getting into activity bands and not
wanting something big and clunky so I
hope this review helped you in some way
