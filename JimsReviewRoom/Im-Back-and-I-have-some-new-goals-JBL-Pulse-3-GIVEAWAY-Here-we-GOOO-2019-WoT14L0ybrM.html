guys are doing good I'm Jimmy with Jim's
review room and I'm coming back for 2019
damn does it feel good I took some time
away for myself here like I promised
last year I'm gonna spend more time with
my family which I did and I did started
to focus more back on my health went
back to working out I hope you guys can
tell you know but all seriousness I'm
refreshed for Jim's review room and I
miss you guys so much I've been thinking
about you guys every day trying to see
what new content I can put out what I
want to do for 2019 so there's gonna be
a lot of good surprises coming down the
road so a lot of things I've been
thinking about some of the goals that
I've been trying to formulate over the
time that I was away
right now we're close to 700,000 subs I
want to reach 1 million subs by the end
of 2019 and for me to do that at the
rate that is going right now it's not I
need to up my game once again and I've
been doing that every year I was setting
up new milestones and I'm staking that
claim today December 31st 2019 we're
gonna get to a million so come along
that journey with me put on your
headphones and earphones and let my
music and let my soothing voice or
whatever you want to say help with your
buying it needs second awesome thing
coming to the channel my commercial
lease in this studio space here this
office space will expire by the end of
this year and I don't plan on renewing
that means maybe I'll get that airport
hangar that I've always wanted most
likely I won't but no matter what
there's going to be a new studio space
so I'm excited for that and now thinking
about it moving the office moving my
family I don't know if I'm gonna hit
that million milestone holy cow well
we'll figure it out along the way the
herd here I said it before I'm
attempting to make my videos less sexy
less on the editing but putting more
effort though into reliable authentic
and transparent reviews as I've done so
before the reason I want to say that is
after six flippin years of doing this
full-time I clearly came to a
realization I've never been funny on
camera nor have I been the most
entertaining ones and while I'm sticking
a joke about my ex or so but that's
really about it but what has been
working and I'm sure what made Jenn's
review room successful as it is today
was striving to be that source for
people to come to for detailed reviews
and an honest experience and I believe
it really showed in the beginning it was
really slow but now it's finally paying
off
so again doubling down on that and again
there's some new things coming down the
road new tests maybe some new camera
angles - for you guys to see the product
a little bit better but anyways I want
to hold off on that it's gonna be coming
next week and again throughout this year
so with that being said let's start up
the gyms review return right here this
video is sponsored by me I have the JBL
pulse three brand new in its box I know
this is mine
from back there this would be an
international giveaway with me drawing
the random winner I'm marched first be
sure to write that down on your calendar
all you have to do is subscribe to the
channel and turn on notifications second
follow both social media handles Jimmy
little official and Jim's review room
and either Instagram or Facebook keep in
mind you have to follow both and I will
be checking on Jimmy little official
Jim's movie room last but at least for
me to do the drawing for me to put into
the computer system this website and
then it randomly draws the name you have
to comment down below with your name
there's social media handle and what
country you're from so when I do reach
out to you I actually can verify you we
had a couple of scammers last year which
was not cool so that is about its
international giveaway March 31st 2019 I
will be announcing it on my social media
Facebook in or Instagram so be on the
lookout let's start off this year right
let's start off the reviews next week in
a couple more days and let's start road
to 1 million all right folks I'll catch
you guys at the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
