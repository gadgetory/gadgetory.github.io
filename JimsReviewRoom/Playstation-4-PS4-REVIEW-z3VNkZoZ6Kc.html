review by Jim's review room today we'll
be looking at the much-anticipated
PlayStation 4 and there's a lot to cover
so if you want to skip around definitely
look at the video description below for
two different times you can click to and
be sure to visit and like facebook.com
slash Jim's review room as also do a
photo shoot on all the products that our
review on there so there's a lot of eye
candy as you can see now without further
ado we'll get started
now as of this review the PlayStation
comes in only one configuration it comes
with a 500 GB hard drive one color which
is black in priced at 399 dollars now
adds an entertainment and Media Console
the unit fits in with most other
audio/video equipment
matter of fact it's almost the same
exact size as the previous generation
PlayStation but on the screen you have
your dimensions as shown and right next
to it is of course the PlayStation 3 and
just for comparison purposes I happen to
stumble across this today it's the Xbox
one as you can see it's about one-third
less in width compared to the Xbox one
and it's not as tall as well and do
subscribe to my channel because I will
eventually be doing a comparison between
the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one since I
both have them in house now then
continuing with this physical overview
the power sensor is located here with
the eject sensor right below and yes
they are sensors and that buttons glide
your fingers over them and the
corresponding actions occur now to the
right two USB 3.0 ports located on the
front and now rotating to the rear here
you have your power cable digital sound
output HDMI LAN cable and there's an
axillary port for the new PlayStation
camera and as you can see the entire
rear fascia is just air vents like this
to keep the system running cool that is
the system of course comes with Wi-Fi
access and supports B G and n standards
for those choosing wireless internet
connectivity the system uses the same
black texture plastic with one third of
the system in a beautiful black glossy
finish there is an LED color bar here to
indicate what mode the system is on now
orange is standby blue is powering up
and white is on and in use and hopefully
there's no red light of death how to be
somewhere in this machine
but only time will tell I'm pretty sure
Sony made a quality product uh now what
you receive in the box is this system
itself the DualShock 4 controller a
micro USB cable for charging the
controller a mono headset for voice chat
power and HDMI cable and your code for a
free 30-day trial of PlayStation Plus
and I'll go into detail later about the
PlayStation Plus the controller and the
headset and worth mentioning though as I
stated earlier the PlayStation 4
includes a 500 gig planner hard drive
but it's been confirmed you can replace
and/or upgrade the hard drive yourself
and it's supposedly pretty easy to do
now turning on the system for my hard
boot up to login screen takes about 22
seconds now from there you'll be greeted
with Playstations very familiar
dashboards slash home screen called the
XMB
where all your menu features online
horizontally similar to the PlayStation
3 and Vita now with this model once you
press X each menu is open in a new
window from my experience the home
screen and menu features are smoother
and faster although still familiar
now all those smoother and faster as a
whole though there are still times when
certain data just doesn't load up
instantly and that's something I never
understood why would they code something
like this it's bearable but considering
this is the latest and greatest you
would have thought it was a different
type of coding this time around
trophies still does not load up
instantly I just never understood that
but in addition to the standard
horizontal menu you have a second row of
items now a selection of streaming
services are offered including popular
applications like Netflix and Hulu Plus
etc now all of Netflix that I accessed
was actually faster than last
generations and offered ridiculously
fast video playback when forwarding and
rewinding now the only other service at
which they had was YouTube and I tried
accessing YouTube through the supplied
web browser and was unable to play a
bummer but hopefully a firmware upgrade
in the future can supply that and since
we're still in the home page here
messages has some new features messages
are now color coded and staggered to see
who and when messages were sent in my
opinion much more organized than the
previous generation were messages
incoming and outgoing were just stacked
up and
of each other now additional features
include the ability to send a 15-second
recorded voice message instead of typing
out everything with their controller and
I've tested hooking up a USB keyboard
and mouse and first the PlayStation 4
does recognize the device but then you
can't use it it's really odd and as for
party chat that's available now in a
Playstation 4 we can chat up to eight
friends simultaneously regardless if
your friends in the same game or not
it's eight friends talking across one
channel now as I'm doing this review
currently PlayStation 4 can play
blu-rays and DVDs it cannot play though
CDs or mp3s nor can it read an external
card reader attached to the USB ports on
the front and that's a huge downfall for
me because I do attach an external card
reader to showcase photos to guests or
family when they're over here and I you
know of course displayed on the big
screen or I play movies right from the
SD card and I'm not to mention you can't
play PlayStation 3 games on here either
and I just bought grand theft auto 5 for
$60
in addition none of the PlayStation 3
peripherals work like a controller or
you're the old webcam except from what
I've learned so far only the PlayStation
Move can be carried over now of course I
can see the reason why from a
technological and financial standpoint
but just putting it out there you have
to rebuy basically almost if not all of
your goods now going into a more
positive light now the PlayStation 4
itself is a true multitasking Beast as
you can see on screen I'm just
demonstrating random recordings of me
playing a game then instantly jumping
back into my previously played Netflix
video or jumping into messages etc and
you can see me doing this you're just
doing random things on a screen it all
happens on the fly now it makes the
transition almost seamless in staying on
topic of multitasking I wanted to touch
base on this new offering of the
controller which is the share button now
while in game the PlayStation always
records your last 15 minutes of gameplay
you can click on the share button and
upload up to those last 15 minutes to
your personal Facebook page and share it
and the Playstations dashboard and if
you don't want to include the full 15
minutes you do have the ability to trim
the clip through the edit
now the editing tools were very limited
with no other features as an addict text
zooming in or out you can't add in your
avatar or logo
you can't even narrate over it again
don't think that you can do is just trim
and you can't trim sections of the clips
and then piece them together so the
editing features aren't as robust as
thought now also while in-game you can
take a screenshot of your screen and
upload it to either Facebook or Twitter
and share it within the PlayStation
floors and messaging system so regarding
recorded content as a recap videos can
only be uploaded to your Facebook
profile and friends can find it on the
PlayStation 4's home page under what's
new and screenshots can be shared on
your Facebook page Twitter and 3d
playstations messaging system and
hopefully YouTube will one day be a
feature you know down the road the last
feature from the share button that is
the most notable is being able to stream
your gameplay live to either twitch or
Ustream now this system is very fast and
easy to use with just enough information
displayed you can see how viewers are
watching you live and also their
comments for you to interact with them
now if you intend on purchasing the
PlayStation 4 camera you can broadcast
your face if you desire to do so then if
you want to watch other people play that
can be accessed again from the main
PlayStation home page under live from
PlayStation so overall this is a really
neat feature to further the share
content with the world in a very easy
and quick to new manner overall gaming
is great and from the day one of release
titles battlefield 4 seemed to receive
the most notable upgrade if you can see
the power the PlayStation 4 over the
last generation obviously this is just
scratching the surface by getting a
glimpse of what the system in do for now
is pretty amazing
battlefield 4 alone has the beautiful
lighting lens flare and now running at
60 frames per second just a very
noticeable and positive difference from
console gamers out there
call of duty wasn't too drastic of an
improvement though and really felt more
refined and polished rather than a
generation leap into next gen now as a
point the PlayStation 4 is no question
is capable of some amazing things but
yet at the end of the day it depends on
the developers making for
content in regarding playing games
PlayStation Plus is now a requirement to
play online if you don't pay for the
PlayStation Plus membership you still
get all the social functions and other
features such as accessing entertainment
film and TV services such as again Hulu
Plus and Netflix etc you have you still
have your share options including
sending gameplay video and screenshots
to Facebook screenshots to Twitter or
livestream gaming via Ustream or twitch
other random items you still get the web
browser get the PlayStation Store access
so again on the screen it just lists all
the services you still get for free if
you don't become a member now it's a
partner that we do have to pay to play
online but at the moment the competition
namely the Xbox one of course requires
the same deal so we can't get too bummed
out I guess but with the annual
membership you receive the previous
mentioned free services but now you get
free games for download which is huge in
itself and they're not just indie games
they're not just quick short games we're
talking about full-blown $60 games for
download free now / the PlayStation
website you get access to free game
trials download the entire game play for
about an hour and if you like it you
actually keep it and all your stats are
kept once you purchase it you get access
to beta invites to test games before
they're even released to the public and
lastly you receive one gig of cloud
storage now save your games on the cloud
has backup and you can retrieve them
anywhere at any time now with a
membership it's great Andrey pays for
itself in the first two months or so and
about the free games again playstation
typically releases new free games on a
monthly floatation now we'll jump over
to the controller and included headset
provided by Sony and the controller is
definitely worth a review on its own and
you can click on the video that just
popped up here or find it on my channel
at youtube.com slash games a review room
now the controller as soon as you put it
in your hands and hold it for the first
time there's a huge difference in
comfort economics and even the size of
the controller the joysticks and a d-pad
are now dimpled in and it just gives you
a sense of properly feeling where the
thumbs needs to be and it also has less
slippage as well the controller handles
loan are longer and now my ring and
pinky finger actually gripped the
controller unlike the PlayStation 3 and
most notable the trigger fingers feels
amazing with contours to seat your index
fingers now regarding the touted
touchpad for the time being it has its
intentions but I haven't found any true
and innovative muses yet the controller
does now feature an integrated speaker
and for such games with single-player
campaigns where dialogue or narration
occurs now it's a nice addition to
further enhance interaction and
immersion now lastly is the supplied
three-and-a-half millimeter input
headset as a single ear headset with an
inline mic and mute button now when I
first pulled out the mic the line seemed
really thin and weak now I'm worried
over time that constant use and bending
may cause the connection to break but
only time can tell in that aspect
now however testing the mic the audio is
loud and clear with no hum or hisses in
the background the mic is real sensitive
though so if the mic is moving around on
the receiving end it does pick up all
those noises it sounds like you're
rustling around with that mic so overall
with my experience with the PlayStation
this machine is a beast in its own right
a definite improvement from the last
generation now emitting Li there are
some features that are not as robust
such as limited features for editing
video and uploading your recorded game
is only limited to Facebook and on the
plus side I love the ability to stream
live gameplay connecting with friends is
easier through the messaging system the
controller is the best one Sony has made
so far so if you're set on buying a
PlayStation 4 or just a fan of
PlayStation this is no question worth to
purchase as Sony and Playstation itself
has grown and learned from its previous
mistakes as of this video I just
received the Xbox one and it's release
date and I still need to test it out
before determining which one quote
unquote
is a better experience so definitely
subscribe and like this video
and once I get the Xbox video out I'll
definitely make a comparison video and
you'll see what the verdict is so if you
