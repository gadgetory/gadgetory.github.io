review room several viewers recommended
for me to look into the company audio
engine and supposedly they make some
stellar speakers now doing a bit more
research and offer their websites prior
to the company audio engine this team of
audio engineers have been working with
companies like Harman Kardon Gibson
guitar and even for Apple over 30 years
worth of experience in the industry now
audio engine isn't known to much and
Best Buy or similar mainstream retail
outlets but for audio enthusiasts and
audio files they do have a reputation
online so I decided to give them a try
and see what this is all about and what
I have here is the audio engine b2
bluetooth speaker it's priced at 299
dollars as of this video and we'll see
how this fares for the average consumer
now I'm here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to jim's
review starting with the physical
features this comes with some vintage
looking wood textures like zebra wood
and walnut but what I have here is a
more modern style coming in as black -
now the b2 is not per se a portable
Bluetooth speaker where you basically
would put this into your bag and bring
it along with you as it does measure
four and a quarter inches high 12 and a
quarter inches wide now and 5.5 inches
in depth and it weighs in at 7 pounds
according to the gyms review room scale
now there's also no built-in batteries
so for sure the speaker's meant to stay
stationary most of the time but it's at
least still compact and I think easy
enough to move around the house if
needed at least now the frontier is a
very strong magnetic grill that snaps
onto the cabinet itself without very
much effort at all but behind this are
two three quarter inch tweeters on
either side here with a two and
three-quarter inch Kevlar woven woofers
now the grill off I think these look
exceptionally well now rotating to the
back here you have an independent
Badnaam power and pairing button to the
right with an antenna being provided for
extended range now below to the left is
a 3.5 millimeter port for connecting
your audio devices physically and far
right are simply your power plug
and your on and off switch all very much
straightforward but let's get into the
audio test right away here by playing a
few samples I also I have here the very
much praised Bose Soundlink 3 now it's
the same price and I believe the audio
quality is one of the best for Bluetooth
speakers in general now after my tests
here I'll give you my verdict afterwards
and get a good look at you oh so flat
and there you have it folks now sound of
course recorded off of this speaker and
then played through your speakers there
are not the best depiction of audio
quality but hence my review here the b2
does hit harder and louder the bass
levels are no question deeper and you
might have been able to tell through the
samples provided at moderate volumes
bass levels for a Bluetooth speaker is
very well done making even the boast
actually feel a bit underwhelming
there's not much distortion at this
level and enough for most if not all
genres of music now listening to your
favorite hip hop songs and EDM focused
modern music of today the b2 compared to
other Bluetooth speakers does sound good
or even better when again compared
apples to apples not only on certain
songs and with the volume up at a much
higher level you do have some slight
distortion though and at times vocals in
the mid-range this sounds slightly
suppressed but going back to a more
average volume level the mid-range is
still clean and clear with offering
enough brightness for voices and vocals
to have them detailed and very much
enjoyable now the last part here high
notes cymbal crashes and s is performed
on a high-end level with minimal to no
distortion at all there's no ear rigging
high pitches either and you don't hear
the high tones or high notes jumbo or
cluster together and considering this
does have bluetooth of course watching
Netflix with your phone or tablet and
this thing is quite impressive and
immersive now subtle voices and sounds
are heard with detailed clarity in the
environment now it's a serious upgrade
to what you already have built into your
phones already now another test that I
usually perform since a lot of people
ask me does this fill up a small medium
or large room now indeed the b2 works
for large rooms no question about it
now another test here that I perform is
the distance and with the antenna placed
in there's really no issues whatsoever
with walking down stairs and onto the
other side of the house here going
through several walls and the first
floor ceiling and never lost the
connection ever so overall for a
Bluetooth speaker this sounds phenomenal
and for sure warns it's price tag it's
cheaper than a Marshall Stan or which
was already a great speaker and it
actually sounds better
then the Bose Soundlink three at the
same volume levels again the only
shortfall here is when it is loud it
does get slightly distorted but most of
time testing and listening I'll be
honest I personally have this here at
about fifty to sixty percent volume and
barely reaching as high as this thing
can go so how this review helped you in
some way if you do like my work be sure
to add me gems review room to Facebook
Twitter Instagram or Google+ and you can
see what I do behind the scenes and ask
questions as well this is Jimmy wood
Jim's review room you guys take care and
I'll see you next one
