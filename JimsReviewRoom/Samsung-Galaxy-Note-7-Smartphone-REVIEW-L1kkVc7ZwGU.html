room jumping right into this since we
have so much to cover I'm pleased to
show you guys Samsung's best phone out
at the moment the Galaxy Note 7 I
personally paid for this at the whopping
price of eight hundred and forty nine
dollars with tax it was roughly around
nine hundred so my pocket is definitely
hurting right now and quickly looking at
the price sheet Samsung looks to be the
most expensive but once you adjust the
phones to Samsung's 64 gigs of internal
storage the iPhone is equivalent and the
Moto Z are a bit closer in regards to
price I'll place my links in the video
description below as prices do fall over
time click on my links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
so without further adieu on channels
here to help you make a purchase
decision welcome everyone to jim's
review room
go over the physical features first for
a large phone it's frankly the most
comfortable the same 5.7 inch screen
returns but the curved edge display now
comes standard and I'll detail those
features later what's key to make this
one of the best big phones to hold in
your hand is the rear is also curved
creating a very smooth and seamless grip
versus the sharper edges on the more
traditional phones you can say now it's
not a feature that would make this an
absolute buy but a feature I think
that's very much notable the back is
made of glass in the front now features
Gorilla Glass 5 and from watching the
YouTube channel jerry-rigged everything
the note 7 front glass seems to be more
shadow resistant but it's scratch
resistance has dropped by several levels
based on Jerry scratch tests I would
recommend finding a screen protector now
very similar to the s7 and the s7 edge
we're getting expandable storage which
is a huge plus we're also getting that
same ip68 water resistance in which I
tested for you guys here and even with
the s-pen out water getting into the S
Pen slot here phone still works
perfectly fine my first test when I
pulled this out the water the timer had
reset for some odd reason but I did a
second test back-to-back and phone
lasted another 30 minutes confirming the
water resistance now what else is new
here we're moving away from USB 2.0 and
onto USB type-c which I'm totally
thrilled to hear this is the newest
standard as USB type-c theoretically
should be crazy fast at a huge
difference between USB 2.0 that we're
all familiar with now my latest computer
build Forge it does have the latest USB
3.1 gen2 type-c to be really technical
here and testing the speed for file
transfers sadly with my test it didn't
seem any faster transferring the same 1
gigabyte video file my Samsung s7 which
has the same processor and RAM as the
note 7 both phones performed at a very
similar speed
they've been plugging my phone into my
computer and accessing my photo files
which are located on the phone itself
nothing microSD card still waiting for
these photos to load this shouldn't be
the case especially with this new type
of technology now the only real benefit
I guess for the note 7 then is a type C
cable the wire itself is real
stable and can be inserted in any
fashion since we're talking about this
charging port here recharging from a 1%
battery for 15 minutes gave me about 20
percent 30 minutes gave me about 34% and
at an hour around 66% and to fully
charge the note 7 it had taken me about
an hour and 30 minutes to an hour and 40
minutes each time and that's what the
screen off of course and the always-on
display showing now as for a better life
pretty impressed with how much I'm
getting off of this so far as phone has
been lasting me about a day and a half
with my personal normal use I guess you
can say now screen on time lowest I've
ever gotten so far was three and a half
hours and there's one particular day I
was able to get six which is crazy but
I've been averaging around four to be my
medium or mental road number
the last notable feature is the iris
scanner used to unlock your phone that's
a brand new feature here I do like it
for the most part and when it does work
it's simply fast sometimes so fast
that you don't even see the scanner come
up but the scanner in general you do
have to hold it up to your face at a
certain distance and with my very
amateur way of measuring here and some
good days I can get about 20 inches away
from my face or for those outside of the
US about a half a meter away and the
worst case scenario it does require me
to be as close as 16 inches for it to
work nonetheless it does work and it
works great but the action of just
pulling the phone back and forth and
sometimes you're required to open your
eyes a bit wider does make some users
self-conscious not to mention if you do
wear glasses it does impact its
performance a bit so I'll leave that up
to you guys it definitely does work but
it's honestly subjective and how you
feel about that now the fingerprint
scanner makes a return and it works as
fast as my s7 it's quick it's accurate
and yes you can have the iris scanner on
the fingerprint scanner as well and or
login with your pattern or numeric pin
you don't have to choose one or the
other all three of them can work you
just have to set it all up only one and
only thing that I've really desired on
the note 7 that still hasn't made it
back since the note 4 glory days is the
IR blaster I can understand the enclosed
non removable battery but that IR
blaster has to be one of the most
underrated features to have and as for
reviewers as where consumers like you
guys we got to keep reminding them and
keep inviting these manufacturers this
feature needs to come back but let's
take a look at the camera here hands
down just like the s7 this has to be one
of the fastest performing autofocus
systems on the market it feels
significantly faster if you use the note
7 and then use another brand or simply
an older Samsung phone you can say the
video as proof that difference in speed
really makes a difference in the user
experience now to take you some random
photos here compared to some be
competition the note 7 is more vibrant
it's clearer and it does perform usually
better in low light performance
you
and taking a look at the note 5 oddly I
notice that the note 5 would take
slightly ever so slightly more saturated
colors or images compared to the note 7
and the s7 as well but you probably
can't even tell unless you actually put
both images side-by-side like what I'm
doing here
now as for a processing power the
Samsung s7 and the note 7 has the same
chip offer and currently snapdragons
latest available the 820 I did encounter
any issues and the phone itself it's
still fast enough for the average
consumer still doesn't feel as slick as
the Nexus 6p but still is an enjoyable
experience but getting onto the screen
Samsung has been known to offer very
vibrant displays here and if you're
familiar with Samsung they simply look
great to the average consumer if you
already own the s7 or the note 5 they
look nearly identical when placing them
side-by-side but getting into the edge
screen I love this feature it clears up
my home screen by adding most of my used
or frequently accessed apps on the right
here and when you're not in use the menu
does hide away frequent apps contacts
tasks CNN news the weather or just some
of the edge apps you can install on here
and there's several more that's
available through the online store for
purchase and prices ranges by a dollar
or two and now the very last feature
that I want to discuss is the S Pen
itself I noticed there had to be a bit
more pressure to get the pen out versus
the note 5 but that's not a deal-breaker
at all but something I didn't notice
though the new pen has a much more
narrow tip and does feel more so like a
ballpoint pen and offered a slicker and
smoother experience not to mention the
sensitivity has doubled offering
different widths in calligraphy when you
do press down harder now the following
feature is a feature that should have
been on these note phones long time ago
here but when you're in a crunch when
you're on your lockscreen
take out the pen you can jot down
important numbers names on license
plates emergency like info all without
needing to unlock the phone itself now
it saves write on your screen so no
matter what it's always in front of you
as well another feature gifts or gifs
however you pronounce here is another
new feature using the smart select tool
any video that's playing whether it be
YouTube Instagram Facebook videos you
can select that area and make a 15
second clip a little choppy from my
experience but a little neat feature too
a snippet of a video to your friends or
family ASAP now it does come in handy in
those situations you can also translate
with the s-pen by just hovering over the
word once translation is activated
there's tons of languages available that
will speak the English word however for
you to hear whichever language that you
chose once you tap it it brings you to
the app and then there you can hear the
audio it's unfortunately an additional
step you have to take to listen to
something besides English into bed you
can't translate entire sentences
on-the-fly either and the last feature
that does come in handy although it
seems so miniscule when you're writing a
note here holding down that action
button on the side of the s-pen will
allow you to erase simply letting it go
we'll have you back to writing again no
this feature was not previously featured
at all for some reason so in the end
here I know I didn't cover every single
aspect but honestly hope my test and
honest opinions from my experiences here
gives you an idea of how the notes have
been performed in my opinion yes pricey
indeed but Samsung does it again by
being a Swiss Army knife of phones they
also streamlined and made some things
more intuitive likely jotting a note
down when your phone is locked or having
been erase your button helps
tremendously the waterproofing was
missed last go-around any note 5 and
it's honestly playing catch-up to its
smaller brother the s7 but that's no way
of knocking the phone at all if anything
I'm just glad it's finally back or
finally here to offer peace of mind
overall a solid performer I saw a set of
features and no question solid
performance all around so guys please
help share this video here like and
subscribe if you haven't done so already

care now see in the next one bye
