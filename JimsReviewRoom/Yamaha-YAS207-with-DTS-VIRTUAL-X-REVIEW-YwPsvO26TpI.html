room Yamaha are the first ones on the
markets to offer DTS and virtual X on a
sandbar I know many might not be aware
of what that means but I'll surely
explain it any short segments after the
intro but being transparent as always
Yamaha did ship this over for me to test
I'll of course go over the pros and cons
for you and see if it's worth getting
now this sound bar retails for $300 but
I have seen it recently for 279 as
always I'll place my affiliate links in
the video description below click on
those links and they'll give you the
most updated prices as of today you
never know when they might go on sale so
without further ado my channel is here
to help you make that purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review
all right folks so skip ahead in the
video here if you want to hear more
about the soundbar but for now let me
give you some insights on the technology
so there's mainly two competitors Dolby
and DTS their most recent and competing
technologies are Adobe Atmos and DTS X
and both offers surround sound as you
have experienced before
but with Atmos and X you also get
variable heights basically when a
chopper flies overhead you can in theory
hear it above your head there while
sitting in your living room but one of
the biggest issues not only do you have
to have front-facing speakers but also
smaller up firing speakers that project
sound to your ceiling now once the sound
bounces off of your ceiling you then
experience that sense of height so this
is where DTS virtual X comes in there
are no up firing or built-in ceiling
speakers that you have to manage and buy
it's simply just the Yamaha sound bar
with the Y as 207 I'm gonna call it Y as
instead of abbreviating it
it also up converts non surround sound
sources and enhances them as well but
we'll get into that once we get into the
audio test so going over the physical
features measurements are on your screen
the sound bar is slim and sleek when
paired next to my 55 inch LED TV in the
background here for your reference
now the yes 207 is surrounded by the
more traditional fabric grill with what
I thought was leather up top but it
simply textured plastics now one thing I
do love though there are a combination
of LED lights that illuminates to
indicate which device you have this set
to also light that goes left to right to
indicate volume levels as of recently
the more expensive sound bars tested on
the channel doesn't even have that now
on the far end are touch sensitive
buttons to control your audio and
playback and as a side note the LED
lights are able to turn off or dim with
the included remote control now looking
at the rear the yeas 207 is wall
mountable you do have to obtain these
screws yourself but getting a closer
look at your connections it's very
minimal on the rear here I'm sure most
manufacturers are relying on arc
technology as an alternative essentially
having all of your devices connect to
your TV then just one HDMI going to the
sound bar now for the average consumer
be sure your TV supports the Audio
Return Channel and it doesn't down
convert your signal to stereo
they won HDMI IN you have one optical in
now there is bluetooth pairing for
connections with your phone tested this
with my samsung s A+ and I was able to
walk the entire length of my office here
about 40 linear feet with no issues
unfortunately there's no NFC for easy
pairing now all right to the sound test
here I am using binaural microphones for
this test this is the most accurate test
available so be sure to put on your
earphones or headphones those will make
a huge difference
200 times stronger now
and there you have it folks for the
price range of $300 it's a darn good
sound bar if I would suggest this is
more fitting for small to medium sized
rooms this can be used in large rooms
but you do lose some of its wideness and
breadth when expanding the area the
subwoofer you guys saw earlier is quite
large but the base isn't that rumbling
or resonating it's more neutral than
anything my experience and testing its
punchy and fast on the controller you're
able to turn up the subwoofer and also
toggle bass extension and it does
slightly help but I'd notice it causes
the mid-range the vocals to get slightly
recessed or suppressed almost muddy like
unfortunately I'd say just keep this
setting right in the middle or just a
tick or two up now for the mid-range
with clear voice up the audio is pushed
forward and does become brighter it does
sound much better than these standard
stock settings compared to some other
sound bars in this price range that I've
tested Yamaha 207 does stand out and it
is brighter or more forward than others
but I do wish though there was a bit
more detail resolution here not speaking
of surround sound just yet but the
detail in the revenant during scenes of
rain is a good example when the rain
sounds jumbled together almost like
white noise and it isn't as sharp or
crisp here you can say we're gonna hear
raindrops hitting leaves trees the
ground etc but again for $300
consider how bright and four this is the
207 still sounds good now the high notes
do have some roll off as blasting this
at near maximum the 207 was so within
reason without causing any listening
fatigue which is a huge plus yeah-ha
does play it safe here without going too
high here in the frequency band to cause
any ear ringing or high-pitched
screeches now we're talking about scenes
of jets flying by Superman breaking the
sound barrier sometimes causes that
noise tire burnouts and the fast and
fierce snow those are times when the
affordable sound bars tend to struggle
by jumping into surround sound from my
test again for $300 it does a fair job
compared to other sound bars at this
price range most sound bars will offer a
center channel plus left and right
stereo separation with the yes 207 the
sound stage is slightly bigger and wider
to clarify we're not talking about in
coughing surround sound
I personally did not have moments where
I hadn't looked at a side or behind me
as audio was perceived to come from
there but the order separation was
within 90 to 100 degrees in front of me
not super wide or engulfing but better
than most at this price range last but
not least I gotta address virtual acts
with all that hype and marketing I was
hoping to achieve more of a vertical
audio experience but unfortunately it
does well everywhere else but testing
six different blu-rays three out of the
six is at least dolby atmos certified
also double-checking that I have a
supported 4k blu-ray player the proper
connections hit most importantly the
latest firmware that allows for my blue
light and the sambars to turn on to let
me know three surround sound is working
I've barely noticed the vertical height
this is possibly the biggest letdown for
me so overall I really enjoyed the sound
bar it's simple and accessible no need
for extra speakers and wires the audio
quality is good for the price range I
just wish the biggest selling point of
the sound bar the virtual X offered more
height from my experience so that's it
