room the last time I reviewed these
Samsung gear VR was about a year ago at
the time it was pretty cool to test
pretty neat to try considering it comes
free when you preorder a Samsung phone
last year I did mention the experience
was entertaining at first but the
experience died down quite quickly at
least for me now with my most recent
pre-order of the Samsung si+ the new
model comes with a single controller and
that was indeed something if that was
missing from last year's model the gear
VR with controller retails for one
hundred and twenty nine dollars as
always I placed my Amazon affiliate
links in the video description below
click on those links and they'll give
you the most updated prices in real time
you never know when these things might
go on sale so sit back relax and
hopefully my videos can help you make
that purchase decision welcome everyone
to jim's reviewable
go over the physical items it comes with
the controller of course to triple-a
batteries which is always a plus
micro USB adapters are included so older
Samsung films will work on this headset
as well adjustable velcro straps are
provided to adjust the fit on your head
while wearing now this does work for
both the s8 plus and smaller s8 along
with other various Samsung models listed
on your screen comfort wise the gear VR
is not necessarily heavy on your head
overall but with my si plus it does feel
front heavy that didn't have wearing
fatigue but I did have to wear it
somewhat snug to prevent the headset
from constantly moving forward it's not
a big deal but just something I wanted
to point out that most will experience
now on the right side of the unit's a
touch-sensitive square pad is there with
the home and back button up top volume
rocker buttons are nearby if you decide
to use this versus the controller the
controller itself was much smaller than
what I anticipated it still works but
something with a bit more meat or length
would have organized a felt better well
that's what she said right but it's not
the most robust controller you ever felt
it feels plasticky if that's a word if
it was more like a remote control for
your TV versus a controller for your
Playstation or Xbox nonetheless having
all the buttons on here does help big
time versus using the headsets for
navigation and playing games now getting
into content and the overall experience
strapping this thing on and adjusting
the focus dial up top you're greeted
with an eerie 3d open-space
experience it's pretty cool especially
for those who have never experienced it
before it greeted with a home screen and
from there you can navigate to the
different forms of entertainment offered
one for example Netflix is available and
you get this huge big screen here for
watching movies like movies play there's
ambient lighting spilling over the sofa
and floor having the viewing experience
quite immersive and of course you can
always look around too now for other
forms of entertainment you can watch
twitch YouTube and Vimeo via the web
browser built in now what makes gear vr
very intriguing is the events tab a year
later I'm seeing more content that is
available for you to watch live at one
point I seen a SpaceX rocket launch has
an option or a tour of some temples in
the jungles here live and in 360 I said
it a year ago and I'll say it again
imagine if Samsung offered basketball
games courtside
live and free or at least offered with
your cable package no that would be sick
but in the meantime although it seems to
have expanded in content it is
incremental though at least content that
is worth watching for the average
consumer regarding gaming the controller
helps up big-time it's pretty obvious
but the engagement level when playing is
significantly improved one game that's
included with the bundle was n space
there step into a spaceship and you hold
the controller just like a flight stick
here and movements with a controller
moves a ship while your head movement
aims your crosshairs if you have motion
sickness like I do I am seriously sorry
for the segment here but jumping over to
their first-person zombie shooter
dropped it it's pretty simple and the
graphics isn't too intriguing it kind of
reminds me of the old House of the Dead
games we'll be back in a day but indeed
it did keep me entertained for a while
though and there's some other random
games that offer support for the
controller as well and from my
experience some are better than others
now besides these slightly improved
lineup of content one of the biggest
downfalls of for me is the visual
experience I granted for a smartphone
and pushing 500 plus pixels per inch
that's great but for VR the lenses in
the headset magnifies the screen
substantially to fill your peripheral
vision and by doing so you still get
some pixelation around your peripheral
vision it's not clear as well and at
times you see color fringing at the
edges of objects and text now what I
also notice while testing were times
when the controller would it not be
calibrated and the controller is either
off to the side or at times the
controller is not reading at all there's
definitely some kind of connectivity
issues so over here and I think most
people would feel like this even without
owning the product the gear VR still
fits into a very niche audience Samsung
at the time of this video states they
have around 700 apps for the gear VR
store but I noticed it's still not
hitting that sweet spot where many would
use this on a daily basis let alone a
weekly basis if you guys own any gear VR
let me know in the comment section below
how often do you personally use it know
considering Samsung has been pushing the
360 camera I think
if and when they do offer free sporting
events that's when this will receive a
lot of mainstream average consumer
attention in the meantime if you didn't
get the VR for free I don't think many
would be spending the hundred twenty
dollars to get this experience it's cool
for the first day or two but dice down
quite quickly
in my opinion unless you're a really
tacky person so be sure to LIKE and
subscribe to help support my work here
hopefully with my videos it does help
you make a purchase decision you guys
take care and I will see you on the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
