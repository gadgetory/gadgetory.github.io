here road to 100,000 subscribers I'll
put the number down here somewhere
and welcome to all the new people
welcome back to all those who have been
following me love all your faces love
all your comments even the bad ones and
off filming again of course last night
only common audience asleep until 3:30
last night woke up at 7 took my little
girl to take care and how on the road
right now I need a film as quickly as
possible and just basically just trying
to catch up from last week last week my
little girl had the flu or had a fever
or so and she had to stay home from day
care and you know I had a it took you
know some time away for me to work but I
need to catch up products are coming out
like crazy so just hustling right now
I'm gonna show you guys what I have in
my bag that basically some products that
I bought or a product that I bought here
speaking of my bag here next week's the
next week's vlog I'm gonna show you what
I carry in my bag in general basically
my tools my laptop you know etc just to
show you guys you know my my work tool
is basically and for today's vlog I'm
going to show you what kind of camera
mocking a lot of people asked me what
kind of cameras I use what kind of lens
tripod etc I'll show you guys that
pretty shortly but just real quickly
quickly here that's when I can discuss
some consumer news sadly and I put this
on social media asking if anyone else
had the same or similar issue my Samsung
Note 4 battery has unfortunately gone
kaput I think it is
not a big deal of course I can replace I
can swap it out but at 15% battery
remaining that bit the phone just died
he just turns off and I'm gonna turn
them back on it's at 0% this just
started happening this past weekend
prior to that the last month or two at
about 5% it would start dying and then
doing this crap but I don't know what
the hell's going on but besides the one
I can replace the battery but the big
the main issue I want to talk about is
the Samsung s6 edge+ that I'm reviewing
right now it is a non-removable back I
hope I hope Samsung has shows as it
shows that a good battery that would not
be faulty after a year this Note 4 is
less than a year old I bought it when it
came out so next month November or maybe
December I can't remember it would be a
full year so unfortunately this phone
has recently died yeah I mean the s6
edge+ the battery I mean you can hire
somebody to open up the phone and rip
off the adhesive and replace the battery
and whatnot but I mean I don't know what
they're charging one two compared to a
removal black back plates I consumer
home can easily replace the memory so
that's my qualms that's my that's why
I've been advocating my reviews I know
it doesn't happen to everybody I'm very
well aware of that
some old Motorola phones there no
batteries still work today surprisingly
and it still holds it chargeable and I
have in my drawer I haven't thrown it
away or anything it's like four years
old so who knows how the consumer news
if you guys have see or haven't seen
this link I posted up on my social media
Facebook Twitter Instagram there's this
one company that surprisingly owned I'm
a virtually 90 percent of the glasses
and eyewear that is on the market today
it is ridiculous
watch the video put the link in the
video description very cool to watch if
you guys watch that so that's about it
but um let me go get the products in the
trunk here give me a second I'll be back
all right it's on next week what I want
to do is I'm gonna show you what's in my
bag what I usually carry when I go
off-site this is just one of the bags
let me show you guys what I got here
that out the way of course still testing
the v10 from LG I have I let me see I
think in my pocket here yep
galaxy s6 edge+ and he was one of the
products and I purchased this I didn't
get it shipped but here you go
of course I'll be testing this pretty
soon here it's basically chromecast the
new one I have the old one the other one
the features I love it I cast everything
from my phone we cut our cable bill
watching Netflix YouTube videos a lot of
Jimmy Fallon YouTube video clips and
whatnot and I stream
I don't know once and while I play
twitch down there and the wife's not
home I don't know but I love the
chromecast for 35 bucks this is the new
one of course faster that's what I'm
hoping for because the the first one I
do one even when I first bought it I
noticed that it was lagging a good bit
so hopefully this works out but I didn't
get his bag out the way here again next
week I'll show you what's given here so
you guys excited about this now I
tweeted them and they didn't say if they
are coming to my neighborhood or not
they didn't disclose as of yet the only
thing that they could tell me was their
building in my city so I still have to
wait I hope I prayed to God guys man I'm
excited to hopefully coming and building
my town here I am willing to pay you
guys $70 a month for that one gigabyte
download I know I'm probably not gonna
get that whole one gigabyte speed but
it's better than what I have right now
Time Warner I'm paying right now they
just upgraded the speed for free because
they know competition is coming in
Google Fiber baby bump my particular
plant up to 100 megabytes download and
10 megabytes upload sounds great
some days I get 20 megabytes down I
still get the 10 up and then there's
some days I get 80 down you know 50 down
60 down
it varies or fluctuates so much it's
crazy and there's days when time water
is not even usable and I don't even live
out in the boonies I live you know in
the suburbs
you know 20 minutes 30 minutes outside
the city and so I don't get it but I'm
paying sixty five dollars sixty four
dollars I'm changed for that I'm going
to pay seventy four you guys please come
well let's see what they gave me here
this is actually free you just had a
sign up on their website all right so
they gave me this little card here there
you go and of course it gave me a shirt
I love the dark colors I love the
charcoal gray or or it's heather gray or
charcoal gray whatever awesome thank you
google or alphabet whoever you guys are
right now freaking taking over the world
as long as you guys provide reliable
service I'm happy with that
all right so that's it and again
chromecast and that's it for four
packages today I have to get running I'm
hungry as hell has just been a crazy
morning pretty start and man it's time
to hustle in time to grind like I said I
slept like 3:00 this morning and woke up
at 7:00 3:30 and woke up at 7:00 oh man
gotta work gotta grind baby gotta do
what you got to do so later in this
video I'm gonna show you what my
camera's I know a lot of people has been
asking me about my camera I got that on
this vlog for you guys so stay tuned
like I said earlier I haven't eaten
lunch yet but that's where I'm going I'm
hungry
let's go
all right back to work
alright folks I know you guys been
waiting for this for quite some time now
a lot of people that have been asked me
what camera do I use for my for my
reviews so just a heads up for the
longest time I have been using a Nikon
d5100 s first ever DSLR camera that I
had very old now I think the occur
models D 5500 basically just use what
you've got to be honest with you and I
just recently got this brand new camera
I mean probably maybe four months now so
a lot of the videos that you see on
youtube prior to against four months and
back have been on my old camera and like
I said you can do a lot of work with a
beginners camera an entry-level camera
you do obviously get a little bit more
flexibility with a more professional a
full-frame sensor but anyways let me
just show you my camera here now walk
yes to the steps let me rotate the video
here alright folks and there she goes
it's a Nikon d810 it's a full-frame
sensor camera 36 megapixels this can
record in video up to 1080p at 60 frames
per second which is what you guys see in
the reviews very sharp obviously it's
not 4k
but still with this combination of lens
and the amazing new sensor that they
have on here this still gives one of the
sharpest images that's available right
now from Nikon which I'm totally
thrilled about real quick in regard to
lens I didn't use the kit lens looking
up reviews the kit let this actually
outperform the kit lens this is a Tamron
24 to 70 millimeter f-stop of 2.8 fixed
and both the body and also the lens
itself this is considered as a
professional camera so if you were to do
sports photography or go out I don't
know into the desert or so or even at
the beach where it's windy maybe some
sand is blowing around and whatnot it is
weather sealed so it does prevent
allowed that nasty gunk from getting in
there but again beautiful combination I
really love it
let's go to the side real quick here
look at some of the things that I didn't
have on my old camera you got your
microphone and head headphone ports to
monitor your audio from the microphone
and just if you guys are curious it's a
roadie mic Pro pretty standard I'm okay
with this one I would have now looking
back I would have gotten the sure
microphone a little bit more expensive
but I did discuss that in my previous
vlog and going down here USB 3.0 thank
goodness for those fast transfers and of
course a mini HDMI if I have to connect
this to a external monitor which I don't
have attached today going to the rear
here thing is built like a tank
and get the strap out the way for you
guys on the back just to show you guys
what it looks like your canvas I'm
trying to focus pretty standard stuff
and let's rotate to the right four so
for you photography junkies and whatnot
you guys probably know more than I do
and that's the reason why I haven't done
a review on this one
hi I have taken some photos with this
and it works amazingly well at least for
me again I am the average consumer
although I have a professional camera
but on the video side up that's my
strong suit on photography I'm alright
but on the video side of you use it more
often so that's why I haven't done a
full review on this or a review in
general it's because I don't think I
would give it enough justice or meat on
this professional camera if I were to
review this and put it out but
nonetheless you guys see the work that I
do tell me how it looks I mean of course
I seen the feedback and whatnot but I
hope you guys do like it but keep in
mind I think only my last 20 to 25
videos has been shot on this everything
that I've learned was on my old camera
the the 5100 so you don't technically
need a really badass camera to really
get started but I guess once you you
know get your feet wet establish
yourself then you may consider it to a
like I said a full-frame camera this
does help tremendously in low-light
performance
this is actually one of the best in
low-light performance I believe either
equivalent or just right below these
sony was at a seven are I believe that's
the other second best performing
low-light camera at the moment but but
yeah I mean there she goes below that is
a Manfrotto tripod with a Manfrotto
video head this is a fluid drag system
so like I said I recommend it for anyone
considering getting into YouTube if
you're going to be doing a lot of pans
and whatnot
let me give me a second let me try to
twitch this you can turn this ring and
it basically gives you resistance and
this is how I get my very smooth panning
shots there's a lot of resistance on
there right now and that's how I get my
smooth rotations same thing with
vertical twist that and I can just push
up and down and it will give me that
smooth smooth flow and that's it again
that's my camera there and I know a lot
of guys a lot of people were asking
about what camera I use and there she is
I put the link in the description below
I believe it is currently on sale right
now for about six or seven hundred
dollars less for the body than what I
paid for retail when it first came out
no and one last thing the reason why I
didn't go with Canon I was hoping for a
Canon 5d Mark 4 to come out but instead
they came out with the 5d S&amp;amp;T 5d are it
doesn't shoot at 4k which is fine me I
don't really care too much for 4k right
now at least since most people don't
even have the internet connections even
run 4k streamed via YouTube or even you
know on other websites and whatnot but
but you had a Canon from what I heard
like I said I could be wrong the sensor
was the same as the mark 3 with just a
huge increase in megapixels it's up to
like what 50 megapixels right now which
is crazy good for photography but for
video again you're shooting at 1080p
this camera does phenomenal at the time
one this just came out the Canon didn't
have a model out yeah the the 5d r and
the five es wasn't out yet so I didn't
have any reviews to base my purchase
but actually I got this and Lisa once
the 5d Mark four comes out if it ever
comes out it may be a consideration all
right guys I know it's a long video here
let me get to the questions for you guys
all right folks just like in last week's
vlog write down your questions in the
comment section below you can ask me
anything
and I'll try to answer them next week on
next week's vlog and it doesn't have to
be YouTube related or not even though
this is road to 100,000 subscribers all
right first up here I'm gonna go real
quick here because this video is long
enough Goose 24 how often does a company
sponsor me to do a review I think I
answered that earlier in this vlog here
I did record it earlier this morning
1959 95 to 98% of the time I do pay for
my own products so currently I am still
shelling it out of my own pocket
Nicolay Nicolae Andrei I am so sorry if
I pronounce these names wrong I'm really
bad with names how long does it take for
me to edit the video I did answer this
question probably about I think vlog
number two and I go into detail but real
quick here it takes me to edit just
literally editing alone it takes me
about a day so six to eight hours
amber Etzel what I consider reviewing
fitness equipment such as bikes I have
done a couple of pull-up bars there's
one pull-up bar that I very much love
going to YouTube and search best pull-up
bar and that's the one I personally
still use today is the best one that I
found so far and it cost almost
equivalent to all the other ones but
this one has a lot of perks and bonuses
again youtube search best pull-up bar
and you'll see gyms review room on there
and take a look at that one it's really
good and it for bikes and whatnot I
can't afford it I would love to I would
love a specialized bike
I want to get into road biking but man
those bikes are not cheap I'm still
working with my beginners bike but maybe
one day James Hahn what did I do with
all the products after their review I
majority of them I do sell them I just
can't I can't keep them obviously if I
reviewed three Bluetooth speakers that's
what nine hundred you know 700 to 900
bucks right there in total so it's not
chief I do salad most of them back I do
take a hit on each one hopefully with
the with the reviews I do make the money
back over you know several months or a
year or whatever so that's the game plan
Jose Salas will you review the
chromecast or he just told me to review
the chromecast got on pre-order I should
be getting it this weekend so definitely
I want to replace my old one so I'll see
how this new one performs it should be
faster so we'll see yes chromecast is on
the way
all right folks and that's all the
questions right there if you guys can
add me on to Facebook Twitter and or
Instagram and follow me under you guys
see some you know behind the scenes
pictures and also content before I can
actually can put them on video of course
and guys I can't say how much I'm
thankful for the opportunity right now
we're gonna hit 100,000 subscribers it's
just a matter of when but the
opportunities you know screw the numbers
if the if the opportunities that you
guys are offering or presenting to Jim's
review room without you guys LG would
have reached out to me you know without
you guys I wouldn't be able to have this
as my full-time job thank you thank you
