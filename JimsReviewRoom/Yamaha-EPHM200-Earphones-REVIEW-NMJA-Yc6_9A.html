room today I want to give a try to some
in-ear earphones as I love the passive
noise isolation the ease of portability
and the sound you get when you place
this inside your ear canal now we're
looking at the Eph M to hundreds priced
at one hundred and forty nine dollars as
of this video and we'll see if they are
high performance earphones as Yamaha
claims so I'm here to help you make your
purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's preview burns coming in three
different colors red white and the black
version that I have here all features a
nice glossy black finish and each with
the Yamaha logo and silver now regarding
my testing with all earphones and
earbuds pulling and vetting the wires on
these did impose any issues now there's
not a separate rubber guard to
compensate for accidental movement but I
do appreciate the side of the earphones
extending quite a bit offering an
alternative form of protection you can
say now going back up here if you were
to take apart these earphones this
unconventional bulge here is really the
huge driver inside five eighths to be
exact
by going one step further in being
unique taking off the ear tips here
Yamaha is claiming these are the world's
first to offer a titanium tube and I'll
be honest and thought they were a
marketing gimmick at first here but ever
so slightly you can see each tube
slightly flex in turn providing a more
natural fit inside the ear canal and
even sound distribution but more my
sound test a little bit later
but now regarding comforts Yamaha
provides a nice assortment of sizes five
and total actually so you shouldn't
worry about fitment now I tested the
audio technica CTR is the other week and
they were a snug fit which I personally
like for that added sense of security
but these here still holds in the ear
canal as well and testing is walking
around the city and around the house
never did these earphones fall out or
become loose now if you think in ear
earphones are uncomfortable it's
possible with this being less aggressive
you can say these actually might work
out for you now in addition to the ear
tips llaman includes a three and a half
millimeter two quarter inch adapter any
very nice but more importantly
functional hard carrying case inside
offering pockets on either side to hold
all of your goods here and while the m2
hundreds are protected in this case
pulling them out later they barely
tangle with the design Yamaha has chosen
now I'm pulling these straight apart
here provides your standard length like
most quoted earphones at four feet or
1.2 meters enough to have your phone in
your pockets or leaving your device
nearby on your desk now the only concern
that I had is with the wires themselves
the rubber jacket used to protect the
wires inside does feel slightly thin
thinner than other earbuds or earphones
that I've used in the past and to be
fair nothing has gone wrong with these
and it's one of those cases where time
will only tell and as you can see in the
video here there is a built-in
controller for use with Apple devices to
adjust volume pain skip songs and
although this isn't made for Android
devices I'm still able to pause and play
songs with the controller and answer in
disconnect phone calls I can't skip or
forward songs in general and speaking of
phone calls here here's a quick test
hello hey I'm doing a test on the phone
again I just wanna make sure you can
hear me so I just going to do some
random test here and just let me know if
you hear any window if you hear anything
in the background right now me clearly
any background noises any cars driving
by I'm outside right now
you're a little bit of rustling I'm not
sure what that is exactly but it doesn't
sound specifically like a car or
anything like that okay there is a light
breeze out here so you do hear a little
bit something may sound like a little
bit of a breeze or maybe some wind and
look yeah that's what it sounds like a
little bit okay above my voices sound
loud and clear or do I saw a muffled do
I sound faraway like I'm on a
speakerphone by any chance nope you
sound pretty clear like you're on the
phone sound good
and one last that I'm going to walk back
and forth real quick here and I want let
you know tell me if you hear any
rustling with the cord if it's rustling
against the shirt let me know if you
hear anything
whoops sorry about that you hear
anything
oh definitely it was pretty clear pretty
clear with me walking around yeah I
didn't really hear much of anything a
little tiny bit but not even really
remotely close to sounding like static
or anything okay sounds good alright
thanks for your time all right bye and
there you go folks I hope you enjoyed
that small little segment there for you
now moving on to the probably the most
important part here is how do they sound
now using FLAC files or lossless audio
to test since streaming services
provides some low quality bit rates it's
the only way to test earphones to see
its true potential now first up is bass
and it is strong if you love bass these
are no question going to fulfill your
needs it's not as deep as the Beats
products I believe but it's a nice full
bodied sound especially with bass
dominant music of rap and hip-hop of
today the great thing although it's bass
focus is not obscene in my opinion but
rather it accompanies most generous and
most other sound fields for today's
music that is from Nicki Minaj to EDM
music of Cascade and Avicii let's say
the beats will get you nodding now those
who do tend or fare closer to a more
natural non bass boosted sound I
honestly will no question you can say
we'll have to look elsewhere now as for
the mid-range in vocals surprisingly
these are mid Ford I personally like
speakers on these somewhat brighter side
as I
do interpret the sound as being clearer
and more distinct vocals you can say
with minor nuances even being heard
these are very much so and I believe
because the mid-range is pushed a bit
forward it prevents the bass from being
100% dominant and or having the
mid-range eventually become muddy and
weak overall I am pleased with this area
now as for the high hats and high notes
in general nothing at the norm as being
ear ringing or tinny which is a good
thing but being very much based focused
the top end does lose some of its
sharpness and bite almost down sounding
and you can't really get too excited
about it now as for the soundstage is
not as open as I hope for as well
offering deeper immersion into the music
left on the right auto separation is
clearly present when offered but having
a 3d experience wasn't much there
despite having these huge drivers
mentioned earlier and last for loudness
oh yes these will definitely get loud
keeping these around 50 to 60 percent
was definitely enough for me so despite
some of the lacking components like
soundstage at the highs it's almost to
be expected when you want bass focus
headphones and earphones but if you do
like bass these are for sure a
consideration and alternative to the
beats products more ford mids and vocals
deep and full sounding bass yet still
clean and not to mention the variety of
ear tips and comfort you get with these
so this review helped you in some way if
you like my work add me
