both just released some new over-the-ear
headphones these sound true twos are the
wired models while these sound link twos
which I have here are the wireless both
a complete redesign at least
aesthetically having them a lot less
bulky compared to last year's model
now pricing is on your screen with these
sound link twos here that I personally
paid for at the retail price of $279 and
also through up there on the screen for
another $20 you can get the wired but
one of the best if not the best in
active noise-cancelling performance the
bose qc25 for more recent updated
pricing of course click on the link in
the video description below just in case
you're watching this later in the year
again I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room
be sure to subscribe and follow me on
Facebook Twitter or Instagram for more
reviews like this so I'm here to help
you make your purchase decision welcome
everyone to jim's
review room going over the physical
features first this is not a direct
comparison video to the qc25 but i gotta
say the selling tool looks and feels
almost like them the same quality are
placed into the selling twos with the
foam band line with Alcantara a top has
leather though and the arms extending
down are reinforced with aluminum rails
in BOCES fashion it feels like subtle
simple and refined luxury but the
quality is there to do my stress test
nothing broke no seams were exposed
everything really stayed together
perfectly fine you do hear a little bit
of play but nothing of concern at all
overall very well put together now
moving down to the air cups they do turn
a full 90 degrees for stowing and they
do pivot enough to fit most heads the
unfortunately don't fold inward for
easier stowing for travelers the
supplied carrying case footprint isn't
that large but it is something to take
into consideration a little bit over 50%
of the case is covered in fabric with
the rest a soft leather inside this is
felt lined with a neoprene carrying
pouch for your supplied cables not worn
them a little bit later but heading back
to the ear cups here each side is
labeled for easy channel identification
the ear pads are just plush
for long-term wearing but I'll discuss
that in my comfort test shortly as for
connections although this is a wireless
pair of headphones the left side offers
not a three and a half but a two and a
half millimeter input and the cord
provided is about three feet and 10
inches long just enough to keep your
phone in your pocket
the cord and input does not have a
locking mechanism
however attempting to simulate a yank or
pull on the cord the water stays in very
very well on the right side volume up
and down with pause and play in the
sensor which are very easy to reach a
identify fiscally and the same sensor
button can also be used to accept phone
calls which I'll demonstrate real
briefly here oh I am testing out my um
these headphones uh-huh
and I got you on the fundamental test in
many ways how do I sound how does it
sound so far it's not like there's
parking on your phone oh that clear huh
yeah how nice and did you hear Lynn in
the background you hear screaming oh now
I'm going to say do you hear an echo or
any kind of static or anything like that
no okay hey clear perfect alright let me
stop the recording real quick several
less features are the on and off switch
on the side that also provides voice
prompts on which devices you're
connected to and the percentage of
battery life remaining which is very
useful in speaking of batteries the
microUSB port is located on the bottom
and Bose does a phenomenal job with
offering quick charging 15 minutes gives
you two hours of use while a fully
charging the headphones from a dead
battery will take you about three hours
and you get 15 hours of playback better
life is decent when I compared this to
some of the other competitors out there
other headphones were around 13 to 15
hours in battery life but as we're
comforts these are still the lightest
pair of headphones that I ever tested
they weigh exactly the same as the qc25
at just 6.9 ounces or 192 grams and
because they're so lightweight the
minimal cushions and designs still works
fine wearing these for three hours
straight with no problems and it didn't
have issues with the headphones clamping
too hard on the jawline overall very
comfortable as for sound leaking there
is a bit though at higher volumes not
too bad but compared to other headphones
I've tried the sounding twos do leak
slightly a bit more but to the part that
you've been waiting for the sound
test overall similar to the other Bose
products they've always provided clean
balanced audio right out the box is
selling to provides a characteristic
that leaned towards mainstream users not
audio files in my belief some very much
prefer the sound signature as it
relatively remains flat not too strong
on bass not too strong in the high notes
either but it's far from underwhelming
as well the selling tools in my
experience provides a neutral tone that
works for many genres more so for
classical rock and/or other heavier
vocal and string focused music the
selling to's does work good for EDM hip
hop and rap but those who listen to
those generals I would think would favor
a bit more bass to have that constant
808 beat in the background stand out a
bit more
but the sounding - offers clear sound
virtually no distortion in its quality
and listening to these for those three
hours straight
I had no listening fatigue whatsoever
there's just enough bass to be enjoyed
in general vocals are just enough Ford
and highs are not singing in ear ringing
for the price range the soundstage is
decent with hearing Audio separation but
distance isn't as well distinguished as
some of the other high-end headphones on
the market overall if you're looking for
a great well-rounded audio quality a
great build quality that's super
lightweight the sounding tubes are a
great choice if you're looking for a
better spatial sound deeper bass or
something with a bit more bass boost
there's definitely others out there as
for the price let me know what you think
below would you be willing to shell out
just $20 more and go wired with the qc25
for the amazing active noise-cancelling
features I'm really curious about that
