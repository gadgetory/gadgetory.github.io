room welcome back to another one of my
videos I just let you guys know I did
remove that light nose on top of that
speaker some of you guys my fans out
there we're saying it's kind of blinding
you so hopefully that fixes that issue
so I've been anticipating this for quite
some time here this is the Skullcandy
crusher 360 these are heavy and I mean
bass heavy headphones you guys know I
use my binder or microphones during the
audio test this would be a very cool
experience for you guys back at home now
the other reason why I wanted to test
these here if they're promoting this
thing where you can feel this unique
vibration since you can feel the
vibration on your heads on your ear
around your head or so that's gonna be
pretty cool but anyways being
transparent here Skullcandy didn't send
this over for review I'll go over both
pros and cons I have full editorial
control over this I'll let you guys know
what's good and what's not also I'll
leave my links down in that video
description below so you guys can check
for the most updated prices click on
those and they'll let you know if
there's any deals that are going on any
sales that are going on and you guys can
get pricing in real time
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
now going over the physical features
first the crusher 360 is one classy
looking tank bet is it's built like a
beast matte black practically everywhere
very sexy the metal is diamond-cut so
the edges on here feels a little sharp
it's not a bad thing though but it's
something I haven't felt on any other
pair of headphones that I have reviewed
and last again it's just beefy feeling
in the hands now the headband on top is
slightly thinner than what I would have
anticipated but it was so often smooth
though what really was interesting
during testing if it weren't for this
little Ridge or indentation right here I
would surely feel pressure at the crown
of the head instead I gently feel two
pressure points pretty much evenly
distributing the weight here now one
thing that I did appreciate there's
minimal gaps on the headband itself
while the headphones simply don't stick
out like crazy as you guys can see very
minimal gap now getting into comfort
there is some weight on these things but
I personally didn't feel weighed down
that would give me some kind of neck or
general head fatigue the ear pads are
plush with minimal clamping force at the
jawline and over time wearing this in
the office I've never had ear sweats but
they do warm up in warmer environments
taking a closer look the buds are on the
right side here pretty much straight
forward now while holding down balm
upward um does skip and goes back on
songs the middle button is for pairing
pause and play and answering phone calls
now oddly holding this button down does
not activate Siri or Google assistant I
confirmed you have to activate those
voice assistants on your phone and then
you can still use the headset microphone
to ask the question then now if you're
listening to music and a call comes in
the speakerphone or headset
functionality was very clear but the
receiver on the other end like most
other headsets here they do pick up some
background noise but getting back on to
the headphones the left ear cup this is
where it gets really interesting there's
some bright LEDs to indicate how much
battery power you have left and also how
much base you have introduced into your
listening experience but regarding
battery life slow Kenny is coming up to
29 hours of use with my testing let ins
play from a hundred percent battery to
dead with
face control at about 50% here to try to
get that middle-of-the-road result I was
able to achieve one entire day plus 13
hours and six minutes to precise all
together it's about 37 hours which is
insane now keep in mind the Crushers
also have fast charging just ten minutes
gives you three hours of playback back
basically if you leave the headphones
off or say the battery dies and then
confirm with my testing here you can
still use the headphones with the
physical three and a half millimeter
cable that it's provided you just won't
have bass control features on the side
here and of course you can't go wireless
but what if you read half millimeter
chord you can use this with your pc
playstation or xbox we're going the Xbox
you do have to have the stereo headset
adapter but speaking of base control
here it's a physical touch similar to
the Sony 1000 actually Sennheiser PXE
550 s a gentle light swipe is all you
need to adjust how much bass you want to
experience I'll definitely give you a
sample of that pretty soon so hold down
there now last but at least the crushers
have bluetooth 4.1 how did it even go
with at least four point two four
slightly better range or maybe power
efficiency but testing this and this is
proof this is evidence Y specs doesn't
mean everything I was able to achieve a
ridiculous a hundred and thirteen linear
feet that's roughly the entire hallway
over here plus my studio space in here
with a signal going through one of these
walls and their range never broke it is
impeccable compared to the competitors
most competitors good competitors are
getting about eighty linear feet and
some of them with even Bluetooth 5.0 now
as we're playing this with Netflix and
YouTube I personally had no singing
issues with the wireless connection with
my phone both Apple and Android now it
slowly getting into audio there is
minimal sound leaking but starting at 60
to 70% in volume in quiet areas those
sitting right next to you will probably
start hearing a little bit of what
you're listening to but if you're on
public transportation and walking around
in public of course that won't be an
issue whatsoever
now as for passive noise isolation just
having them on right now the crush is
surprisingly barely blocks out anything
I can hear a lot of stuff that's going
around me but once music is going even
at just 50%
which is somewhat low most of your
environment will dissipate be blocked
and go unheard alright folks please put
on your own headphones or earphones as
I'll be using binaural microphones to
give you the best listening experience
and give you a taste of what this base
control is all about also please go into
the embittered description and follow me
on social media and leave those fire
emojis in the comment section alright
folks please support my work and enjoy
this test alright folks make sure you
have your headphones or earphones on
what I'm going to do is on camera I'm
going to point down meaning that that's
gonna be low or basically zero bass 50%
and when I do this it means I'm gonna
turn this up to basically maximum
alright here we go folks let me turn it
back down
Oh
so there you have it folks keep it mind
this pair of headphones are that for
everyone and it's clear they're
targeting bass heads but hear me out
here the one thing I could not demo were
the feelings that you get now emotional
this didn't bring tears to my eyes or
anything like that
but you can literally feel the bass
vibrant nearly identical to the
vibrations that you feel in your chest
at a concert through the droning bass
from the back of a car with a huge
subwoofer system now you feel that deep
droning bass on the bottom of your ears
around here and behind your earlobe and
I'm not exaggerating here but it shakes
so much that you would think people
around you would see these headphones
vibrating like this and again bouncing
all over your head it is so real and I'm
not again exaggerating here it is
intense and again an experience you're
not going to get out of any other pair
of headphones someone loved it
some will know who I should say it is
just too much but if you're into deep
rumbling chunks of over kind of bass
honestly Skullcandy nailed it no
questions asked now as for the audio
with the bass boost turned down here to
get a more level playing field the
quality is good the mid-range is clean
and clear neutral but enough detail to
be enjoyed there is some dimension here
in the vocal work with hearing music in
the background with vocals slightly
being interpreted in the foreground the
high notes are not ticking whatsoever
and there was just enough for me without
being underwhelming very much enjoyable
on the top end that once I do turn up
the bass again these are bass heavy
headphones to be fair there is some
droning though but the mid-range and
high frequencies are still very much at
the defile and doesn't sound recessed
encased or suppressed now once it go
maximum bass like turn this all the way
up here then yes you surely do here bass
taking over the vocals don't necessarily
get muddy but they sound a little too
warm and then from the sub bass area
that droning does overshadow the vocal
work but again you can control how much
you
want with that swipe as for movies the
amount of bass is objective with most
movies with dialogue like most
headphones or earphones they sound
really good with scenes with a lot of
action explosions I did tend to lower
the base of bits but over a moderate
amount of bass added to the experience
because moderate bass was more tolerable
I wouldn't be able to experience the
strong vibration feedback as it would
then diminish or technically overshadow
again those actors voices and the finer
details in movies again its objective
and adjustable but when tweaked it is
surely enjoyable now overall this pair
of headphones is not for everyone but I
recommend at least giving it a try at
say your local Best Buy or so in turning
it's you moderate bass first before
making judgments before you turn it all
the way up to maximum overall I
recommend them if you're debating on
getting them again check out my links
down in that video description below for
updated prices and my social media
handles hopefully this video helped you
guys some way take care talk to you guys
