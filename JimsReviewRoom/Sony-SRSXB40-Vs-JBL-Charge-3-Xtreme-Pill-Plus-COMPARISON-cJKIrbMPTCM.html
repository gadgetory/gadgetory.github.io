and welcome back to another one of my
videos today
we're jumping right into this one here
when I did the review for the Sony X
before you I asked you guys to let me
know which speakers you guys want to see
a head-to-head comparison with that's
what the video is all about today I'm
not going to get every speaker of course
that you guys have requested for but I
took the most popular ones the most
requested ones and try to do my best to
incorporate here so that includes the
GBA like charge 3 which is also speaker
here the beats pill plus another bass
focus little speaker and you guys did
requested a lot when comparing to Sony's
figure with a speaking with here JBL
extreme one of my best all-time
Bluetooth speakers you never know maybe
the Sony would sound as good maybe even
better and maybe worse we'll find out in
this video so again with this video here
I'm not going to be very fine my new
details I'm just going to go over the
major points and you guys can see the
pill plus is the smallest most ergo
nominal and of course the most
convenient least cumbersome here that
that fits in the palm of my hand throws
in a bag no issues with the charge 3
it's a little bit bigger but still very
much manageable the passive base
radiators are exposing that's what the
Press on this purge ABL but the it holds
up fine basically from my personal
testing during the review but there goes
best and then compared with the sony
xba-40 with the charge 3 you guys can
see that the Sony is slightly bigger
here and the side profile of course the
JBL is a bit more audible if you guys do
value that and I'm going to show you
guys in comparison with the extreme just
how different the size is you can see
that there so the Sony is a little bit
smaller than the extreme so the sony i
would say doesn't fall into large
speaker territory but definitely it is
the in-between between the extreme and
the charge 3 so if you guys are needing
portability the beads is the best option
then the charge 3 then
speaker now getting into ruggedness and
basically the outer shell or the outer
performance of each JBL and the extreme
is going to be the most rugged for you
guys it does feature that rugged fabric
that does alleviate a lot of scratches
and cosmetics marks that when you would
see over time but keep in mind though
the extreme is only water resistance and
the charge three it can actually float
in water with these Sony which is the
star of this video here this is only
splash resistant as well
you cannot dump this into water it IPX
five rated the charge these ipx7 with
the beats pill plus this is actually not
water resistant at all so keep that in
mind there's no protection it's more of
a lifestyle product and does look
gorgeous so in my personal opinion but
again if you guys are looking for
something more on or Z stay away from
the beats pill the other speakers are
probably your best bet now jumping into
connectivity and battery life of course
all this uses bluetooth connection the
only speaker that uses microUSB is the
charge screen so if you guys are using
your phone chargers if you go to your
friend's house they forgot the
proprietary charger with these other
speakers plug this into the wall with
your phones or with your friends
microUSB court you cannot you guys can
have power once again I would be pill
Excel or I'm sorry the pill plus that
the pill excels recalled actually the
this used to be the lightning cable that
is proprietary with Apple that's of
course supplied in the retail box and
then we get to the extreme and also the
sony xba-40 they do use a more of a
old-school port a price show some b-roll
right now for you guys that you guys do
use a wall adapter for it
so again if you guys do go traveling
these guys are probably gone for more
than a week or so if you guys are using
these speakers heavily keep that into
consideration the microUSB port might be
a consideration for you might be the
benefit for you well the others you
might have to have the nuisance of carry
around their particular chargers now
with that being said all these speakers
do feature a charge out ports which
means that you can use a micro USB cord
or a USB cable that is and connected to
any of your devices that uses micro USB
as well such as a you know if a
smartphone tablet if you guys still use
that in charge your devices other
additional features here and again I'm
just going with the main ones B of
course the Sony does feature these LED
lights when you do have music going this
middle strobe lights that blinks as well
that's one of the biggest perks of this
figure here you guys do value that of
course I don't have the JBL pulse 3 I
know you guys did specifically asked for
that I don't have it here at the studio
just yet but anyways you can't control
the lighting on the Sony with some of
the presets that are offered through the
Sony app that's available on Apple and
Android as well of course the other
speakers don't feature any lights at all
and now I'm jumping over to battery life
the pill plus is the smells coming in at
12 hours worth of use the charge 3 is up
to 20 hours which is pretty decent
these sony xba-40 claims up to 24 hours
of use which is really darn good and
then the extreme unfortunate is starting
to show its age a little bit here this
is up to 15 hours per JBL's website I
have the actual tests again in my review
on the channel here now jumping over to
the sound test I'll place up a sample
for you guys I'll give you guys my
verdict afterwards
will you find me soon
tonight so far away I couldn't teacher
Anson give them to me
inside is way too much want to hold you
I feel
wherever leftovers also memory it's no
mystery and you and I we got history
yay
whatever let's go there is also tragedy
would be hey
Oh
Oh
and maybe have it folks hopefully that
sound comparison did help you in some
way or form here and what I still want
to give you guys is my analysis
considering those personally listening
to this in the skinny year and of course
give you my expertise over the years of
listening to Bluetooth speakers in
general
so first up here is the pill plus here I
don't want to call the pill excelent
which they made the pill itself but
regard to pill plus because of its small
size form factor you can tell this was
the worst-performing Bluetooth speaker
unfortunately out of the bunch
because of its small size you can tell
it was pushing the face as much as they
can but it couldn't fulfill as with
these other speakers the other speakers
were a lot more worn a lot more full in
the audio experience especially bass
Department this is still a good speaker
for its size but again we're just
exclusively comparing to these speakers
this was the enforced performer so I do
apologize beat lovers out there and put
that to the side on the opposite
spectrum though you guys might have
guessed it it is not the sony xba-40
that was the best it was actually the
extreme this was still the loudest this
still offered the deepest sub bass level
the best bass level the most enjoyable
face out of the bunch here Barry Ford
mid very bright mint which I personally
love on a speaker myself if not sub bass
levels as like the Eclipse tower
speakers that have in the pack right
there
but again compared to what a half year
today in this comparison video this did
perform the best so I'm going to put
this to the side here for you guys so
now it really boils down to the charge 3
and also the XP 40 I tried a bunch of
songs several genres again different
types of music and trying to find out
which one sounded better the first thing
I want to mention and part of the
biggest difference at least that we can
tell or say right off the bat at 50% buy
this does sound lower invite lower its
loudness
compared to the XP 40 now
you play these at 80% of I'm both a
speaks at 80% violin then both of these
speakers are playing almost an equal
loudness or equal volume level so just
keep that in mind these so they did not
perform I guess you can say at the 50%
mark now regarding all your performance
again I mentioned I want to stress again
I tried several songs I'm not trying to
cop out or anything like that there were
times when the charge 3 did something
better there are times when the XP 40
sounded better there are times when the
bass levels was better on this the
mid-range was better on this the vocals
which was much more forward and then at
times with different songs the Sony
performed better with deeper sub bass
levels with much more for bits and the
list goes on basically so very close to
performance how is it the biggest
purchase determining factor besides the
vibe level differences is I've noticed
that the Sony I'll perform the charge 3
more often at different songs not by
much but more often the sony was the
better performer out of the bunch then
out of the charge 3 or compared to the
charge 3 that is so exactly keep that in
mind I would say at the end a for the
average consumer for any consumer that
is take into consideration the form
factor the weight the portability
battery life as well and also
considering that this can be thrown or
submerged underwater this is only
splashing resistance well Evan gave $220
retail 150 outlets retail and you get
very close audio performance if anything
Sony does beat out the charge 3 like a
hair or maybe by your pinky finger I
don't know how you guys were measured
the Sony does a perform and it's the as
the winner out of this comparison video
