and getting this to my attention for
review if I didn't get these man I'll be
missing out I love the revolver s but
for those who can't spend that much
these are the cloud alphas HyperX sent
these over for testing but it has always
been transparent
our assessments was not altered it in
any way please watch the entire video
for both pros and cons they retail for
$99 at the time of this video I'll place
my affiliate links in the video
description below click on those links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
these things might go on sale
I'm Jimmy with jims review room and I'm
here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
before we get started I have hired a new
reviewer for the channel his name is Ian
and he'll be reviewing the cloud twos
which should be released in a day or two
he is helping me out here please give
him a warm welcome when you do hear his
voice on that next video man let me know
how he does you know I always get
feedback from you guys so getting into
this I love the black and red it's the
details that looked amazing red
stitching up top but very subtle cool to
the touch leather down to the cold
aluminum arms on the side and love that
red there and down to the aluminum
stealthy black metal ear cups everything
looks and as important feels very
premium the headset unfortunately
doesn't fold in in the ear cup don't
swivel when I'm taking a break from
gaming leaving an on my neck it could be
a little uncomfortable so I do just
leave it on the table but speaking of
comfort
testing this over the weekend for
several hours straight playing both
battlefield and overwatch these are very
easy to wear coming in at 336 grams with
a cord and mic attached they never felt
heavy on my head I never had wearing
fatigue and never any issues along the
jaw line due to its clamping force now
although the cloud alphas are very
comfortable while wearing and gaming
it's a very similar experience with the
ear pads soft and supple leather once
again and while wearing they do feel
plush against my face now I do admit
they don't feel as airy as my new
Corsair void pros and intend to heat up
my ears faster in normal room
temperature the good thing though over
these several hours over the weekend
that is I have never had any ear sweat
now the passive noise isolation and the
alphas are pretty darn good here
when audio is going the alphas do black
out a moderate amount of background
noise it's able to muffle much of your
keyboard presses family in the
background talking and the likes the
microphone is detachable which I love
some headsets do come with a fixed
microphone that you would have to swivel
up when you're not using kind of
annoying but the microphone is flexible
its bendable very easy to articulate to
your position testing the microphone
quality there's a quick sample alright
folks doing a very quick test at the
HyperX cloud alpha microphone this is
completely unedited I have the Amazon
echo playing at about 50% of I'm playing
NPR a National Public Radio for those
who don't know but I'm trying to
essentially
assimilate voice chat on the background
I'm kind of ambient noise you guys might
be able to hear a little bit of that
the background but I'm gonna snap my
fingers in front of me I kind of give
you guys a little bit of a test or a
sample of what you guys might expect
this still picks up a little bit of
background noise but it is one of the
better microphones out there second my
voice comes across very very clear
that's the most important part a little
bit nasally but again compared to others
on the market there's actually one of
the best ones I've tested so far on the
channel hopefully this little test
helped you guys in some way back to the
review touching based on the wires
there's connections for both PC and
consoles each comes fabric braided it
feels great yanking hard on this thing I
mean hard to test here it's been a beast
sting inside the ear Cup it's also
removable which helps with transports
and the inline controller there's no
DSPs inline amps and such it's a simple
vine wheel and a mute button to use very
easy to reach and the adjustments offers
enough feedback or resistance
so most accidental bumps won't happen
now touching quickly on transport
despite the alphas being built like a
tank here instead of a carrying case
that I think would have made this entire
package complete you do get up carrying
pouch it's simple less bulky to an
extent but I would have preferred more
protection last but not least before I
talk about audio performance the biggest
selling factor of marketing that HyperX
is doing it's this dual chamber driver
separating the bass response for the
mids and highs helps create a cleaner
audio experience better response overall
they're claiming better distinction and
audio and less distortion of course
putting this through the test I fired on
battlefield 1 for its airy very open
world experience also for some of the
intense gun battles and vehicle
destruction that goes on
bass is very good for aimed on preempt
non DSP included headset it's not deep
resonating bass likely revolver s but
the Alpha provides a very balanced bass
experience face is punching clean
explosions going off they're not
overdone and they don't sound either
raspy or money either but I'm really
nice Rumble compared to other headphones
in its class the cloud alpha sounds
better than most in my opinion if
anything they're also louder in volume
two getting into the mid-range these are
very bright and forward vocal
performance stands out with sounds on
your own footsteps of running on
different terrain two different surfaces
are heard with very good distinction
because of its bright signature the
Alpha is during battlefield one had a
lot of detail and fidelity being heard I
did throw in some overwatch and very
similar characteristics were noticed I
do wish these were a bit airier had much
of a water sound stage but honestly I
think if we were to push that on these
pair of headphones it would be more in
the revolver territory but for a hundred
dollars for the hundred eyelet price
range these are performing phenomenally
now as for the high frequencies when
bullets are flying by and Benefield one
or time when I'm playing four to seven
other headsets can sound ear piercing on
the very top M the cloud alpha prevents
a lot of that listening fatigue that
sometimes very bright and B in your face
type headsets can cause in the end the
biggest part from just the audio test I
would have to say it's how clear how
well define these headsets are those
dual drivers surely maybe the reason
alright folks that's it for this review
I highly recommend these again Ian my
new tech review will be making the next
video go easy on him let me know how it
goes you guys take care and I will see
you on the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
