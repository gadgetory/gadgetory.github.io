just realized we just went over 450,000
followers the other day I don't know how
maybe it's my cheesy radio voice that I
have here are they crazy warm tones that
I have in my camerawork but again
seriously thank you guys very much ahead
to acknowledge this because in four
years four years have been doing this
full-time I'm now finally seeing that
hard work pay off so again thank you
thank you guys very much but today you
guys been requesting for this this is
the Sony HP r on Tues as always being
transparent some items I do receive as a
review units from companies some I don't
this one I did personally pay for at the
retail price F 299 dollars so I still
have my WH 1000 X headphones as well but
I'll be making a direct head-to-head
comparison video on that one soon so be
on the lookout in the meantime be sure
to click on my affiliate links down in
that video description below for the
most updated prices and if you guys
haven't checked it out yet
you guys gotta follow my work on
Instagram Facebook and/or Twitter all
that will be down below alright folks
I'm here to help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
going over the physical features the
8900 ends looks and feels identical to
the previous generation there's only
three colors in total at the time of
this video Sony's calling this one
grayish black I never realised this but
if you're a headphone nuts if you have
seen my Sony xb9 50 review it's the same
exact headband it's not a bad thing but
pretty interesting to point out now a
sturdy clicky holds its shape very well
here and last I know this is seriously
overkill but that stress test proves
it's one of the most flexible headphones
out there and I'm not trying to break
these headphones but I try to feel it
here if there's any plastic shattering
or creaking anything that would make us
feel cheap then a $300 to me that's not
cheap at all now regarding comfort
wearing this with several our stripes I
didn't have any discomfort at the crown
of the head and there's not much of a
clamping force at the jawline but I do
notice the headphones do rest right on
there right on the joint which causes a
little bit of weird fatigue over time
the air comes through slightly warm up
my ears but I've never had ear sweat
occurring and for those with smaller
heads from just like the XP 950 design
there is a decent amount of gap in
between your head right here
no touching face on the controls I love
the intuitive touch on the right ear cup
very similar to the WH 1000 X's it works
every time and I never had an issue of
missing a command or an action gently
swiping to gently tapping initiates the
command and a left ear cup there's
unfortunately no touch controls but
anything physical is located right here
on the back now we have active
noise-cancelling I don't off which I'll
get to shortly the same button turns on
and off ambient wear and this is
becoming very common and more premium
headphones if you want to be safe here
surroundings when walking through the
city or here in your surroundings while
at work this feature turns on the
built-in microphones and pump your
environment right into your ears off
with active noise-cancelling on if I can
reach back here and
ambient switch over and you could hear
your surroundings here your environments
pretty naturally moving on to the next
part now finishing up the important
physical aspect microUSB is featured
again no USB type-c considering the
world is wanting a universal plug and
last is a three a half millimeter jack
for physical connections I did confirm
though this did not work with a PC if
you connect the USB cable to it your PC
will recharge it though but again no
direct audio signal now since we're
talking about battery life the age 900
ends are claiming up to 20 hours of
battery life with active
noise-cancelling on now I did test this
at 50% of I'm letting it drain I got 22
hours than that now quick charge is
available with 10 minutes on the cord
giving you back 65 minutes worth of
playback now getting back to those ear
cups here the hurons can be used with
phone costs hasn't this my voice comes
across very clear and everyone said my
voice sounded sharp and no distance or
muffled sounding it doesn't sound like I
was stuck in the bathroom or so however
this does pick up a lot of background
noise very easily
now last doing the double tap on the
right ear cut does bring up Siri or
Google assistant to finish up the
physical bill the headphones are
collapsible for easy stun and Sony does
offer a carrying pouch now I prefer a
case instead but the bag does help
prevent possible scuffs when I throw
this into my bag now slowly touching
based on audio these do sound liek quite
a bit that's 60% bottom which is
comfortable and enjoyable listening I
can hear music playing from 6 feet away
but compared to my Sony 1000 X's I had
to crank that up to 80% of I'm here to
achieve that same sound leaking that I
had with me here on Tues at last before
the audio demos Bluetooth 4.1 is
featured on here FX HD and L back are
available now for those who are not
aware LDAP provides the best wireless
audio signal over Bluetooth if you're
using quality audio files to
uncompressed FLAC files al deck offers
the least amount of compression and with
Android 8 and higher having L deck
built-in finally we get to experience
this particular feature back in that you
had to have a Sony device or an Xperia
smartphone to experience
Le Bec with my test repeatedly turning
on and off over different songs here and
whenever I don't get the experience I
try to test it over and over again to
make sure that it's not user error that
a difference um it is super minimal here
if you're swapping the audio signal back
and forth from SBC to L deck you really
will be able to tell or tell and all to
be honest with you now when I listen to
SBC that's basically CD quality for an
hour straight in head my ears become
used to this quality then I switched
over to L deck I could ever so slightly
tell there was ever so slightly deeper
bass and ever so slightly clearer
directional sound and when I mean minut
or ever so slightly it's very small it's
like a tiny little sliver and just to be
clear I did use flat files as well just
to make sure that there was no user
error now those who are audio files and
have tested this to themselves please
let me know down in the comment section
below of your experience now jumping
into active noise-cancelling performance
the HT 900 buried well in my opinion now
I want you to put on your own headphones
or earphones as I'll be using
professional binaural microphones to get
the most accurate test that I can give
to you guys all I ask please like and
subscribe if you haven't already and in
the comment section down below just
throw me some fire emojis here we go
and being found and this is what
ambience we're on of course all your
environments is being pumped into the
microphones right now into your ears to
get that experience press it again and
there you have folks now jumping into
the audio test again please have your
headphones or earphones on to get the
best and most representative experience
that you guys can get uh play several
samples for you guys here it goes folks
be sure to put on your headphones or
earphones I'm gonna give you a unedited
audio test on a play some copyright free
music for you guys
Peter's veggie color sure what to get
every time you wanted to Rahila forget
you
although it can't be done
I'm only asking once would you let me
all right folks hopefully you enjoyed
that audio performance or audio test
that is honestly I very very much
enjoyed these here they here on Tues
really do get loud and using this on my
older pixel excel also my samsung sa
plus 50 to 60% in bottom was very much
comfortable very enjoyable that's
seventy percent and higher it becomes
too loud for me ii the bass on these are
just enough i could use a little bit
more but overall the offered of a
signature similar to my most QC 35 twos
its punchy non distorting slightly being
above neutral my personal opinion and
it's not resonating or deep which isn't
a bad thing but again sometimes you want
to point out for you guys now within the
sony app that you've seen earlier there
is a bass boost option that does
somewhat help now as for the mid-range
this is really appreciated the h9
hundreds now somewhat bright moderately
forward to give ocol performance a sense
of being in the forefront the HT 900
made more modern music of today sound
alive and exciting very clear articulate
and a good amount of detail and fidelity
but a sound stage is this area it's very
good but a little bit more would have
made these things amazing you can surely
hear vocals and instruments in the
forefront and behind you left in the
right audio channels are no caution
distinguishable which helps with the
immersion but the audio snap-ed me i
guess you can say I want it to be just
ever so slightly more spatial and wide
other that most people will find the
mid-range worth the money that they paid
for now as for the high notes my test
review their precise barely any roll off
from my experience and never aggressive
to cause listening fatigue or your
tinging miss the high frequencies
performed perfectly and well-balanced
for be the last but not least watching
movies there's no sticking issues from
my experience with either YouTube or
Netflix and a movie watching experience
was identical to the audio music
listening experience in regards to
quality and performance if anything I
had to increase vine up when watching
videos the apps
equaliser wasn't much in the virtual
surround sound did it make the
experience much more enjoyable the only
feature in the app here that's worth
mentioning and supplemented the audio
experience is again then bass booster
and
believe it in the end do I recommend
these no question yes if you're on the
fence I would surely tell you that you
give these a try now testing the comfort
would be my biggest suggestion /
critique but everything else should work
perfectly fine for you now the only
question should you spend fifty dollars
more and get these WH one thousand X's
