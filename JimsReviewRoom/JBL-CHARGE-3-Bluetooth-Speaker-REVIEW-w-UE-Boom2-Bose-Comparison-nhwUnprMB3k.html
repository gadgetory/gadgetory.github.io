room but this has to be the most
requested review in the channel to date
you guys asked for it you guys got it
I'm pleased to show you guys the brand
new JBL charge 3 the follow-up to the
charge 2 plus that one my best midsize
bluetooth speaker on the market in early
of 2016 now I personally paid for this
at the retail price of 149 dollars and
as always I'll place my Amazon affiliate
links in the video description below
click on that you can check for the most
updated prices in real time and see if
they've gone on sale again I'm Jimmy
with Jim's review room welcome everyone
to another review
go over the physical features if you
watch my JBL extreme video these two
look nearly identical of course the
extreme is much much bigger now first
off the mid-size speaker is portable
coming in at little over eight and a
quarter inches wide almost three and a
half inches from the bottom to top and
also front to back now the weight
doesn't feel bad coming at one point
seven six pounds it is on the heavier
side of mid-size speakers but the weight
feels evenly distributed and portability
shouldn't be an issue now taking a
closer look JBL got rid of that all
aluminum grill and went with this
ruggedized durable fabric which has been
holding up well from my tests now on the
sides JBL returns with offering those
passive base radiators you see moving
and shaking when sound is being pumped
through now if you look at the old JBL
charge to the charge three is just
slightly bigger in size now and similar
to the ue boom - and an improvement over
the charge - plus model this speaker is
now ipx7 certified last year's model and
many speakers on the markets they are
only splash resistant now what this
means to the average consumer this
speaker can be submerged in water up to
one meter or 3.3 feet deep here for a
maximum of 30 minutes now I want one
step further here some of the fugu
products I've tested in past they can
float in water ensuring the speaker
doesn't sink to the bottom of the lake
here
despite being waterproof then the first
generation UE roll unfortunately does
sink on the other hand but with the
charge three this thing stays buoyant
and after submerging the speaker
underwater the charge turn still works
perfectly fine now going over the
buttons here you have your bluetooth
pairing option on the far left volume
down the power button and to the right
of that finally does the charge model
comes with JBL connect similar to the ue
products you can pair this with another
JBL connect speaker now you can mix and
match in my case here I have paired my
extreme with the charge 3 and both will
play from the same audio source and from
my testing here both are in sync with
each other for music now if you have the
same model speaker like if you had two
extremes or maybe two charge threes you
can have separate left and right stereo
separation now in my case I was only
able to play a quote in party mode which
provides no separation however with both
speakers pumping out audio the audio
immersion increases dramatically and
causes the entire room to fill evenly no
testing this with Netflix in
movies there is a minimal delay here's a
quick demo to show you what I'm talking
about keep in mind this happens with two
speakers going on or even just one
speaker it's just a Bluetooth speaker
latency issue that's pretty common
I'm not really an optimistic person but
I hope you're wrong about Istanbul
because it's an amazing place I hope you
will be the one good now getting back to
the buttons here there's volume up and
last on the right here is the pause and
play feature now looking at the very
bottom of the speaker there's five
bright white LEDs here they're battery
level indicators basically and then left
rotating to the rear you have a rubber
sealed cap offering a 3.5 millimeter
input if you decide to manually connect
the speaker to your phone or device a
microUSB port for charging which JBL
claims takes up to four and a half hours
to do whoever there has been times where
it does take me a little bit longer than
that and last to the right is a charge
out port making the charge three like a
power bank enabling you to use a USB
cord to charge your phone or again other
devices as need be but regarding battery
life JBL has made a substantial
improvement here and glad to see JBL
raising the bar here last year's model
offered up to 12 hours of use with the
charge 3 JBL is claiming up to 20 hours
of use and for my test at 50% volume to
get a middle-of-the-road result I was
able to achieve 20 hours and 48 minutes
to be precise until it died which is
crazy long and the best battery life
I've gone out of any midsize bluetooth
speaker that I've tested
not to mention better than some large
bluetooth speakers out there moving on
here regarding Bluetooth signal range in
a empty parking lot with a straight line
of sight I was able to achieve about 40
linear feet and at home just like most
other good Bluetooth speakers I was able
to go downstairs to the other side of
the house on the first floor and still
have my Samsung Galaxy S M connect with
no signal loss so with everything being
covered so far the only items are really
notice missing that would have been
great is NFC or near field communication
for easier and seamless pairing but more
importantly I was hoping this to have
speakers on the rear so that way we need
to do stand this up just like the UE
boom - or some of these fugu products
out there I was hoping for 360 degrees
sound with the new model unfortunately
no sound comes out they're rare from the
charge three so to the moment that
you've been waiting for hear the sound
test now first
up is Eleni UM's fortress featuring
Johnny fedora
it was shadows
Oh
ah
he does it you're so fine I'll let me
show you why let me show you let me get
a good look at you and there you have it
folks now sound recorded on my end and
then play through your speakers or not
the best depiction of audio quality but
hence my review here now if I can sum
this up real quick everything across the
board has been HIPAA fide you guys can
tell in the audio samples bass has gone
up pretty significantly compared to the
Sony Xperia viewed or the beats pill
plus both great bass heavy speakers in
their own way the JBL charge 3 doesn't
go as deep but provides a bass boost
signature more than many other midsize
bluetooth speakers on the market the
firm majority of the music you're
listening to out there EDM hip hop pop
the bass on this is possibly the best
for a midsize speaker as it doesn't
drown or become distorted as much as the
other two speakers I just mentioned if
your bass focused the charge 3 is a
strong consideration I doom it though at
times with bass heavy songs the vocals
or mid-range is affected by the amount
of bass being offered and that wasn't
the case with last year's model the
charge 2 Plus now if you prefer a more
natural or accurate tune the Bose
Soundlink mini to really shine at being
balanced now if you like a bit more bass
in your music the charge 3 I think nails
it now as for the UE boom - a great
speaker at one point but it's honestly
starting to show its age now regarding
the high notes and this sums up to
charge 3 here it's also pushed to the
limits in my
we're casual listening is perfectly fine
but at maximum vibe you can tell the
speaker is right on the edge of losing
its quality and might become raspy at
the very high notes for certain
high-pitched songs but the soundstage
and audio separation is still not as
apparent here like most other Bluetooth
speakers but again if you get another
one of these speakers here I recommend
using JPL connect so to summarize and
give you my final thoughts here the
charge Lee pushes the edge of what a
midsize speaker can do and it's fine at
times being on the edge of being too
amplified on the edge of being distorted
for some songs JBL's sound signature
offers what most average consumers are
looking for there's that bass boosted
signature that's better than most out
there a louder speaker than most out
there again bright meds for a distinct
vocal experience and physical features
that most would actually use that's
waterproofing JBL connect and having an
excellent battery life now lesson before
I forget to mention here it comes in all
at just one hundred and forty nine
dollars at a time this video in my
humble opinion despite this amplified
sound across the board and being as
clean as I would hope only at maximum
volume for the price and what it can do
is still a great value and a speaker
that I still highly recommend so
