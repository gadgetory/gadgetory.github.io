review room welcome back to another
unscripted underrated unboxing so today
I have the brand-new Sony wireless noise
cancelling headphones the model MDR zx5
50 B M and I know that's a mouthful
right they are which sony actually
created names for their lineup just to
avoid some confusion there but of course
we'll go around the box here for you
guys and also see what's inside the box
as well so without further ado we'll get
started
now with all my unboxings they are a
little bit more detailed than some other
unboxers out there that way you get a
little bit more information beforehand
before you actually wait for the review
and also before you get to the stores
well but just going over the back of the
box real quick here basically you can
use these with your smartphone to answer
phone calls and whatnot as it's denoted
here it says it's also compatible with
AAC for high sound quality even for
wireless technology it also reduces
approximately 90% of ambient noise on
using the note noise canceling feature
on these now again I bought these for a
hundred and twenty eight dollars retail
I did just test the bose qc25 s and
those are phenomenal I think you're the
leaders in noise canceling headphones
out there so we'll see how these form
not sure how these would compare with
the bose qc25 s but it's definitely
worth a comparison just to see if these
Sony's and a cheaper price can perform
as well now moving on to the next
section here up to 25 hours of playtime
with the noise cancelling on it takes
about four and a half hours to charge
and on here it says it does have NFC
connection as well so just basically tap
your phone onto one of these ear cups
here and it will pair this headphone to
your smart phone just like that so
pretty straightforward pretty easy here
and then a little bit of the fine print
on the bottom here not much information
to to read about here but let's go on
the inside there's nothing on the sides
just for you guys and give me a second
minute zoom out
all right and let's see what's inside
the box for you guys and look at the
goods it's not a real high quality box
to let you guys know sometimes the
packaging and some of the other
headphones they're like gorgeous
foam-filled and whatnot really just
cardboard thin cardboard construction
and a little bit of a thicker cardboard
material here but here goes the
headphone themselves Wow very light I
mean ridiculously light I wonder how
much these weighs I have to look that up
for you guys pretty shortly here leather
padded ear cups here
not too much padding to be honest with
you a little shocked it's not as dense
as a is that what I would have expected
but give me a second let me zoom in real
quick for you guys and adjust the
lighting as well so you guys can get a
better picture of what what we're
talking about so here go the ear cups
themselves like I said it's actually
very um it's pretty firm right here in
the middle there's not like I said it's
not as plushies I would have expected
just really basic plastic construction
and I normally do review a lot of
high-end headphones as well they they do
use a little bit more better material
these are like a really hollow feeling
plastic material so right now the
construction it's really basic it's not
bad I mean it still works yeah I mean
they do flex a bit here not much
compromise I didn't hear any crack or
anything like that so nothing too bad I
mean they are flexing so that's no
problems in that area right there so
just do swivel basically 90 degrees this
way and a little bit couple degrees back
here and it doesn't all it does pivot up
and down a little bit just to fit some
heads on there for you guys and let me
zoom out real quick here
and the noise-canceling feature is on
the left ear couple determine these
around here so this is what it basically
looks like he goes the switches on the
left ear cup and I'm to zoom in and real
quick for you guys
so basically got the noise canceling
feature on or off and then the right ear
cup it has all your controls here here
goes your Valley buttons power button to
turn it on and a so basically you can
push into a pause or play and then this
skip a song you basically push up or
down and the button retracts and then on
the bottom here is your micro USB port
to charge these guys and again it takes
about four and a half hours to charge
fully and that is basically about it for
these headphones they do adjust and from
first impressions they do pretty much
stay intact not bad alright and let's
see what else is in the box here put
those to the side here and let's see if
there's any other goods in here let you
see this so I guess for the price range
I mean it really is you know you get
what you pay for
from that's basically how I feel like I
said a hat I do review normally other
more expensive headphones this is a
cheaper option and the reason why I want
to test these out was because like I
said I did test out recently the bose
qc25 and in my opinion they did really
well regarding noise cancelling i think
they are one of the leaders in noise
cancelling and here goes the micro USB
cable to charge the headphones and in
just instruction manuals and of course
the warranty card as well the warranty
information
nothing else is in this here and nothing
else
is this year as well so no case no no
hard case no fabric bag to hold these in
basically it just comes with the
headphone themselves and a micro USB
cord so like you said it's really back
to basics you can say and it's probably
and that's probably why keeps the price
point that low but more importantly
these look like they they're built fine
although like you said it does feel I
guess less premium you can say but again
you do get when you pay for and like at
this price range we do have to of course
definitely test out the sound quality to
see how that fares were some of the more
expensive brands and like I said this is
you can say more for the budget
conscious individuals and consumers out
there and excited it could very well
performed perfectly fine and you know do
very well compared with the likes of the
qc25 so like I said I keep using that as
they are you can say in my opinion
leaders in noise cancelling not maybe in
audio quality but again in noise
cancelling so that's why I want to test
the test these personally and there you
have it folks so basically like
subscribe and if you haven't follow me
on Facebook Twitter or Google+ as well
that way you guys can see behind the
scenes information and the reviews that
I do again so I'll be testing this for a
little bit here probably over the next
week or so of course I'll definitely
break these bad boys in today and see
how that fares out and the review again
should be coming up pretty shortly so
again appreciate the support and I'll
see you guys in the next one this is
Jimmy with Jim's review you guys take
care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
