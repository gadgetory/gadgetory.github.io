room and here's my list of agency
headphones I've personally tested
compared and provided videos on none of
these headphones are sponsored nor have
they ever sponsored my channel before so
this video is designed to help you make
that purchase decision the whole Jim's
review and brand is about doing so now
keep in mind I haven't reviewed
everything and if there's one that you
think deserves to be on this list
please come down below so others can see
second this is my top 5 so I'm not going
to go over every single detail so be
sure to check out my links down in that
video description that goes directly to
my reviews as always I'll place those
affiliate links that in that video
description below click on those links
for the most updated prices in real time
you never know when these headphones
might go on sale alright folks let's
start with number 5 now this is the best
deal the anti headphones with the most
value these are these Sennheiser 450 BT
NCS it's hard to find a very light pair
of anc headphones anything from the low
to mid 200 gram range will be the
lightest wildly 290 grams and up starts
to get a little bit heavy on the head
these weigh in at 238 grams now the
sound signature is neutral balance and
lean towards accurate surround than
being bass boosted or bass heavy the
only thing I really critiqued was
needing to play these at 80 to 90
percent volume for these to become loud
while most other headphones are usually
around 80 to 70 percent volume the
active noise-cancelling performance is
impressive they're nearly if not
identical to their flagship the
Sennheiser PXE 550 s even though they
don't black out as much as the number
one spot you get very good active noise
cancellation for the price the reason
why these are priced so low sennheiser
gives up on these special high-tech
features like ambient wear and the
automatic noise cancelling adjustments
those are decent features but if I'm on
a budget I also don't care for it also
battery life is not bad I can surely
live on this it's 19 hours with a and C
on and 25 hours with a and C off the
more expensive top-of-the-line
are claiming up to 30 hours of use like
I said the prices justifies it 19 hours
is perfectly fine again these are these
ten hazard for 50 BTS MCS now I know
this might sound a little bit weird even
redundant here but remember this is 100%
based on my test
it's another Sennheiser brand this is
the PXE 550's these take number four and
when you hear the rest on this list
it'll make sense to you that PXE 550's
our flagship anti headphones and
includes all the premium features that's
ambient to wear automatic pause when you
lift up your headphones thirty hours of
battery performance touch controls and
not to mention a very decent app so you
can tune the audio to your liking the
app alone surpasses what both in sony
offers no not to mention these are
stupid lights at 227 grams making these
lighter than they boast QC 35 twos and I
will admit although lighter they are not
as comfortable but considering its price
which is $249 it's somewhat justified
plus you get all the fancy Tony Stark
tech that I've mentioned earlier now as
for the active noise-cancelling
performance this is why it's not in the
top three the ansi performance does very
good though and reducing environmental
noises but the next three do cut out the
air and your surroundings a bit better
if you want quality sound that you can
adjust with its app great battery life
super lightweight agency headphones and
you're around that $250 price range
these are the ones to get alright either
the next one get ready for the best of
the best from here on up
so here goes number three I'm handing
this to the Sony here on Tuesday or some
of you guys know them as the H 900 ends
again links are in the video description
for the most updated prices now these
had better ANSI performance and blocking
out noises than the previous
Sennheiser's this does muffled down
voices and especially the ambient air
around you is it better than number one
or number two on this list of course not
but when I tested the Huron twos they
perform very similar to these Sony 1000x
m2 which were Sony's flagship ANSI
headphones at that time now you also get
practically every feature on the
flagships like transparency mode touch
sensitive controls amazing battery life
at up to 28 hours and now we get L DAC
bluetooth transmission this is the best
wireless transmission right now I know
most might not be able to tell the audio
quality that is but for the same price
as the others if not cheaper
why not future-proof yourself right then
the audio is a bit more colorful than a
Sennheiser 450 BT NCS and better than
these Sennheiser PXE 550's right out the
box granted as I mentioned earlier you
can tune those to other previous
headphones to your taste now with the H
900 ends they're slightly above neutral
being slightly more bass boosted and
also using these at 60 to 70 percent of
I'm for surely loud enough for me now
several things to keep in mind these do
sound leaked quite a bit and although
the microphone is good for phone calls
these do pick up background noises when
you're chatting with someone on the
phone now these are heavier at 290 grams
the white is distributed evenly though
and doesn't feel too bad but they surely
don't feel light either it's to be
perfect in between the reason why they'd
be to the PXE 550's is because of all
the flagship features I've mentioned
earlier the ansi performance is better
and right out the box i personally
preferred the more colorful slightly
more bass boosted audio signature again
these are the here on tubes
so number two man I really can't shake
these I know they've been on my list
previously I've been emphasizing comfort
NZ performance high-tech features and
audio quality the bose qc25 2 again hits
almost everything on the head if you're
looking for it no BS pair of headphones
straight to the point and comfort and
audio bose still kills it in the
industry going briefly over the
high-tech features you do get Google
assistance in Amazon Alexa built-in and
they're great I love the feature and
that's really about it you forego all
the bells and whistles or ambient to
where you forego those touch controls
even their app is quite sparse but
here's my experience although there are
no touch controls the buttons work
perfectly fun and there's something
about it
confirmation click something about
physical feedback that feels like it's
guaranteed success now although we have
viewers that might say well the bose
qc25 twos
don't have el dak apps X HD or even
apdex wireless technology that we're
missing out on the best audio experience
but there's something special with the
engineering at both these QC 35 2's have
an audio signature that's very pleasing
spacial and providing a lot of audio
separation and depth compared to the
competitors compared to the previous
headphones on this list bow still
provides a better audio listening
experience much more detail letting you
hear nuances and instruments and vocals
now as for active noise-cancelling I
know most of my fans hello a team of
James review fans out there fighter mode
is for you guys they know Bose has been
dethroned for AMC performance but bow
still blocks out more of your
environment than number five and number
four on the list and either equal to
maybe a little bit better than you Sony
here on Tues that's how good bose is
hands down they killed it in comfort
they killed it in simplicity for cat6
they've nailed it with its punchy yet
detailed audio signature that's pleasing
to most not everyone but most people out
there as for comfort though these are
the best again hands down space-age
feeling lightness and I'm not
exaggerating the ear cups themselves are
very much recessed and giving the most
room for big
those earphones gives me the least
amount of heat buildup or ear sweat on
those hot summer days that's nasty
but these are the most comfortable anti
headphones that I ever used and yes even
better than even number one spot on the
list the last stuff these headphones had
accident phone call capabilities for my
voice it sounded very clear but like
most other headsets these do pick up a
lot of background noise QC 35 to better
life is rated at 20 hours which again is
surely enough in my opinion but the
competition is offering around 30 hours
as a side note I know I'm shooting here
since it's my top 5 I'm adding this
extra at headphone in here this is
technically not on the list because it's
more of a splurge item but check out the
VN o h9 eyes they're expensive as heck
but man the looks the minimalism the
craftsmanship and the choice of
materials they use are amazing not to
mention the audio quality is equal to
boast not to mention the re behalf
replaceable batteries ANSI performances
around my Bose offers as well but I just
wanted to throw that in there as there's
just an amazing except they're not
officially on the list because of the
value they provide performance but the
price was a little bit high alright so
here goes number one get ready
so let's give it up folks to the Sony
1000x em threes that have found in an
airport vending machine no I am not
joking these were sold out everywhere
upon release and luckily stumbled across
them during a layover so but anyways
these are priced at $349 and is
currently the best anti headphones that
you can buy with all the bells and
whistles at this price point
there's ambien to wear touch sensitive
controls we have l deck which is the
best in quality wireless transmission we
have USB C which is future proofing your
headphone connection in which all the
previous headphones mentioned earlier
doesn't have you also get 30 hours of
battery life 39 hours if you don't use a
and C let's not forget class-leading
fast charging no one else is doing this
10 minutes on the charger and you get
not two but five hours or the
performance and right now I'm sorry I
sound like a Salesman right now but Sony
did great they set the bar so freaking
hide that other companies I would assume
next year coming around the corner it's
gonna be tough for them in other areas
they might be might not be the leaders
in but Sony still beats most of the
competition for example regarding weight
Sony finally slimmed down to 254 grams
not the lightest in the world here and
an album that not as comfortable as the
boats but 254 grams beats majority of
the competition the only nuances that I
do wish were better the automatic ANC
which is when you sit down and see
performance turns up to maximum and then
when you get up the headphones
automatically lowers down the AC an AMC
performance so you can hear your
surroundings for safety that was
somewhat finicky I just left it at max a
and C everywhere I went though and
second not sure why Sony did did not
address this that is but you can't pair
more than one device at a time when I
get into the office here I have two
unpaired for my phone then repair it to
my computer over there it's not really
seamless so some can let that slide some
can't I understand
but for me the following overrides all
the shortcomings SUNY's active
noise-cancelling performance is
hands-down the best on the market
currently I thought Bose did an amazing
job and that was it Sony came around and
holy freak it makes the bose sound like
an SI is only half way work
and that also it's no exaggeration the
1000 xm3 blocks out much more ambient
noise around you from fans wind noise
voices around you too even the
background music at your favorite coffee
shop there if you haven't heard my boast
QC 35 2 vs 1000 x m3 video definitely
check it out the samples I'm going to
search for the name then type in gyms
review room in the youtube search bar
and you'll see it now the audio
signature on the 1000 XM theories is
impressive it's different but very much
favorable for most I will admit though
Sony doesn't focus on being detailed and
high-resolution in its audio signature
that's why I suggest Bose but Sony does
provide a very punchy basic experience
that makes pop EDM than hip hop music
sound much more impactful alive in your
face kind of audio that is even watching
movies with this it sounds just so much
more immersive those explosions holy cow
if you're on the fence they're 1000 X
m3s are hands-down worth a try now to
look at but definitely worth a try put
them on give them a go to experience how
well their anc works and how immersive
the audio signature can be so again
check out the full review just search up
any one of these headphones and then
play some gyms review at the end to find
my comparisons last but not least here
kind of a bonus section if you guys have
watched this far along I wanted to give
you two runner ups that I have
experience with that's worth a mention
first up these surface headphones had
great anc performance beating bose at
times and not as good as Sony though but
because of all the plastic that they
used on the headband and also the ear
cups the limitation on Cortana the low
better life and the fact it wasn't as
comfortable Microsoft didn't make it on
a list if I were to rank these it would
possibly be seventh place to be fair
they're also the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins P X's
are one sexy pair of headphones which
has such a unique look here this did
have some techie features but compared
to others not so much the audio sounded
similar to the bose QC 35 2's which was
great and also the anc performance was
similar to bose as well so it wasn't the
best but still pretty reasonably good
also the P X's were not as comfortable
for long-term wearing the better life
was good rated at 22 hours but again
still not up to
at 28 or 30 elect me competitors and
again it all comes down to that price as
well these retail for $399 but I think
they dropped it down recently to 350
again that's why it's now imma listen I
probably place that six
so overall let me know what you guys
think of this list please let me know
why you chose either team Sony or team
Bo so whichever headphones that you have
I know there's many Sony fans out there
since their recent release but give us a
little bit more detail help others out
there within the gyms review room
community I know there's some I haven't
reviewed as some from audio technica I
wish they would respond back to my
emails for god sakes but there's also
the neuro phones and the Adobe
dimensions which I'll test later this
year sorry folks this was long enough
please help support my work no sponsors
on this video all I ask if you can like

Instagram you guys take care I'll see
you guys on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
