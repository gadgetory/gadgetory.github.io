room I just be Sony 650s a little while
ago and although they're only $99 at the
time they sounded nearly identical to
the $300 beats solo2 wireless but the
sony MDR 1000x was featured in my top 5
active noise-cancelling headphone video
making it one of the best ANC headphones
that you can get and as of late soon has
been killing it with your Bluetooth
speakers now it would be totally badass
if I can afford one of their TVs to but
focusing in today's review I'm checking
out the XV 950 and ones they're very
similar to the XP 950 B ones but instead
this model offers active
noise-cancelling slightly better battery
life and comparing to last year's model
we're going from bluetooth 3.0 to
bluetooth 4.1 for improved range and
performance but before I get really deep
into this let's look at the price these
retail for 250 dollars at the time this
video as always I'll place my affiliate
links in the video description below
click on those links and they will give
you the most updated prices in real time
so sit back relax and hopefully my
videos can help you make that purchase
decision welcome everyone to another
review
go over the physical features the 950 n
ones are simple yet very much functional
the headband up top has reinforced and
supported with a metal band that extends
to the arms each side features textured
plastics that Elm it does feel quite
hollow especially when you tap on it
however it does make the headphones feel
lightweight not more my comfort test
quite shortly here
moving down the headband does graciously
fold in which is always a plus and
they're able to collapse into a smaller
profile for traveling oddly with my
review unit the carrying pouch was not
in the retail packaging moving on I
would have preferred a metal hinge for
peace of mind it's plastic but
performing my stress test which Alma is
over the top here at least I can confirm
there's no creaks that I've noticed
there's nothing flexing I would say that
is of a concern also the metal band does
retain its shape jumping into comfort
there's very minor wear fatigue at the
crown of the head after two hours of
straight wearing and I didn't have any
issues with the clamping force along the
jaw line either making these headphones
quite comfortable the air comes in for
do extend a bit more than my liking
making the headphones look a bit bulky
here being mindful to retract the arms
every time you wear these do help them
doesn't affect comfort too much the
removable ear pads are gargantuan as
well but as stated earlier everything is
indeed functional with these ear pads
the 950 enones offers commendable
passive noise isolation and with my ears
they fit perfectly inside they're
wearing these at the studio with
temperatures around 70 to 73 degrees
after 30 minutes of wearing my ears do
warm up but I never had nasty
ear sweat another benefit with these
thick air pad they do help with sound
leaking if you were using this in a
quiet environment say in a library your
neighbor will hear faint music and it's
noticeable if only they paid attention
if you were on a train bus ride public
transportation it's barely if audible at
all especially when other background
noise is present now going over the
features and buttons the right ear cup
has the typical pause play forward and
backward controls which are very easy to
reach volume buttons are nearby which
would have benefited if they were
further raised or offered some sort of
texture it takes a little bit of muscle
memory over time to
I need left ear cup there's power and
bass affected turn on Sony's extra bass
features directly below that is the
microUSB port no USB type-c just yet a
three-and-a-half millimeter port for
physical connections and very last is
active noise-cancelling to be toggled on
or off now some things I would have
liked though it would have been very
helpful here to have some sort of base
adjustment on the headphone themselves
now you do have an option to control the
amount of bass in the app but without
your phone it's either blasting bass or
it's not now with the microUSB port
you're able to charge the headphones
when connected to your PC but I've
experienced headphones that aren't able
to play through a USB connection and
charge the headphones all at the same
time
with the XP 950 and ones they charge but
they don't turn on at all for use
seconds if you intend on using the three
half millimeter chord for a physical
connection the volume level is
dramatically reduced I noticed I was
able to listen at 80 to 85 percent vibe
with the wire a test for me to achieve
the same loudness via bluetooth I needed
only 50% of volume or lower basically on
the positive side if you are using the
wire extra bass and noise cancelling
still works unless if you have no better
life left or you want to conserve
battery the 950 s will still work would
be wire while the headphones are
completely off of course you'll lose
extra bass and noise cancelling but
you're still able to enjoy your music
now since we touch based on battery life
Sony's claiming up to 22 hours of use
which is very good now let these things
on a 50% vine with extra bass on let it
play for an entire day straight here I
was able to get 32 hours and 12 minutes
to be precise here which is insane we're
talking over an entire day of playing
before it dies again crazy how wireless
range has been improved here I was able
to walk 50 linear feet away from my
phone until these signals start to skip
and that's what a wall in between so all
right here enough about the physical
stuff here let's talk about active
noise-cancelling I tested this walking
through the city I wore this in a local
coffee shop here and were these randomly
in various environments
sadly active noise-cancelling was really
a big letdown
I've definitely both QC 35 these sony
1000x
sennheiser PXE 5 50s and stuff for more
antsy headphones over the past several
years here no
thing blocks out 100% of the noise I'll
admit that with these with the nine 50s
I can hear car horns clearly going off
here I can still hear construction going
on behind me environmental noise is
still very apparent the competitors and
muscles down the sound quite
substantially probably nine 50s do
struggle now jumping into the audio test
when you're using this wirelessly these
things are loud and 40 percent it's good
at 50 percent it's equivalent to most
other headphones that are playing at 70
to 75 percent volume loudness will not
be an issue going into the audio
experience basis the biggest reason why
you would get these the first time you
put these on I was thinking god these
things perform like these skull candy
crushers I had reviewed a few expect
those were so basic they were literally
vibrating and shaking my ears and that's
no exaggeration that was on day one
now I'm day two that's when I started
appreciating the bass characteristics
that's Sony offered and I'm not sure if
the headphones had to break in or if my
ears acclimated to the sound signature
I recommend give it at least two days
minimum before you decide to keep or
return these now for reference on bass
the nineteen-fifties falls right in
between those Skullcandy crossers i just
mentioned and these new headphones I'm
trying to test on the channel here which
is the Beats Studio wireless Sony hits
deep in sub bass frequencies with tons
of thumb fullness and warmth for hip-hop
where bass has always been abundant it's
very much emphasized pop music is
thumping and EDM kids are moving
basically as for the mid-range there is
some inherent spillover of base into
vocals there is some droning that is
noticing singers voices at the very low
end there nothing for bass heads to be
deterred by yet this characteristic
might turn off some audio files out
there now to alleviate these headphones
from being tuned it's I guess you can
say those who only want the bass heavy
feature occasionally and not permanently
Sony allows the ability to adjust base
levels with their headphone app
available on Apple and Android now
regardless with extra bass on or
whichever setting that you have it at
the mid-range still comes off as being
pronounced having vocals stand out and
recessed the high notes do have a good
bit of roll off so cymbal crashes and
those snare drums wasn't as sharp and
pronounced as much as I would have liked
the answer audio separation the Sony
does good with
left and right audio channels but
soundstage is lacking I would have loved
more of an open soundstage to round
these out a bit more
and although Sony does offer different
some profiles once again in that app
such as concert hall or being at the
club or arena from my experience it's
not earth-shattering enhancements I
didn't find my sound stage performing
much better so in the end here if you're
looking for bass focus headphones beats
by dre doesn't even come close to these
if you're looking for bass focus
headphones Skullcandy crushers have you
feeling the bass literally with these
sony MDR XB 950 n ones here today
they provide that perfect medium for
bass lovers out there they're not
perfect but with everything accounted
for if you like bass I would highly
recommend these hands down so that's it
