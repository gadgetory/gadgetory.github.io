room noise cancelling headphones have
been really big on my channel and for
the first time I'm giving a pair of
active noise-cancelling earphones a try
Bose released their new QC 30s a
follow-up to their very popular QC 20s
which has done very well in the past
here
not personally paid for these at the
retail price of $299 make these on the
very upper end of earphones in regards
to pricing but maybe to justify the
price here the active noise-cancelling
performance might be well worth it for
you what I'll do I'll leave my links in
the description below click on my links
and they'll give you the most updated
prices in real time you never know when
they might go on sale so without further
ado my channel is here to help you make
a purchase decision welcome everyone to
jim's review going over the physical
features first it's built really well
the entire neck band itself is coated
and rubberized so when you do pick us up
for the first time it feels quite
premium though this also helps keep the
neck bit in place and not to slide
around your shirt here when you're out
on a walk or maybe in movement now on
the inside of the QC 30 here's your on
and off button it's located right next
to the battery and Bluetooth indicator
lights and also the QC 30 has the
ability to pair with up to 3 devices all
at the same time and this is very
convenient here you can cycle through
those 3 devices if you just tap on that
power button you'll hear through the
earphones here of which devices it's
selected for use pixel XL Jimmy's iPad
connected to pixel XL and Jimmy's iPad
the most frequent controls here are in
line with the right earphone volume up
and down falls in play and an inline
microphone is included for phone calls
I'll play a very quick sample here of me
at the local coffee shop in here oh yeah
that's the perception overboard is money
way bigger the girls are in a really
quick test and you hear people around me
how loud is my background paper here is
a
it's pretty loud and I can oh no a
little workout will flip here uh how the
proposed on it come put the theaters
helmet has been forefront or like a much
bigger felt a beautiful harmony from I
your voice is pretty clear but the
background on this is pretty loud going
now as you probably could tell the
microphone picks up everything in the
background unfortunately but getting
back to that controller I absolutely
love this feature on the side you can
adjust the amount of active
noise-cancelling being introduced like a
vine rocker button pressing up and down
will fine-tune the amount of ANC that
you want it's not only on or off and
although you can adjust this in the app
having a physical button right there
makes for such an easy much more
streamlined experience but more about
how well the ANC performed later in this
review
moving to the ear tips and where the
drivers are located it's smooth plastic
without that rubberized coating which is
fine here the ear tips are practically
identical to the buh sound support
Wireless that I've reviewed a few months
back and that's true if they're
interchangeable but the way they set in
your ear are practically the same the
ear tip technically are an in-ear design
but you don't feel any pressure once you
put them in and I have spoiler canals
personally myself now the other concern
that some may have some consumers or
viewers may have voiced here to me is if
the inline controller based on its
weight would tug on that right earphone
and after testing these the inline
controller barely has any weight and no
they did not tug at all the only
physical issue here that I would say
ahead with these I wish the ear tips or
the ear buds had some sort of magnetic
feature allowing the ear buds to stick
together rather than dangle when you
don't have them in your ear especially
when you're bending down trying to pick
something up now the other thing to keep
in mind for those who are not familiar
with the neck band style both different
market days as sport earphones so I
don't want to get confused here but I
didn't see any water resistance on there
spec sheet but we do intend on use this
for vigorous activities even a light jog
or so I've noticed that it will start to
shift out of place here and if you're
using this while you're walking through
the city or so working in the office may
be more casual movements they're
perfectly fine in that particular aspect
so some things I want to touch base on
here doing my standard test the wireless
signal is perfect I stood on one side of
the house with the earphones here and
the phone downstairs sitting on the
opposite
I haven't a Bluetooth single go through
several walls I never lost that
connection second even at maximum volume
sound leaking is very minimal and at 50
to 75% volume where most people use
these earphones
sound Lincoln was practically
non-existent if anything very very faint
third battery life is rated at up to 10
hours of use which is very decent
considering these are only very few ear
phones on the market offering noise
canceling as an additional feature i
personally left these at 50 to 60%
volume like on all of my tests to get a
standard result here on the channel
after 10 hours of continuous use the QC
30 still had 50% battery life remaining
that's very very impressive now getting
into the active noise-cancelling
performance they performed very very
good now keep in mind active
noise-cancelling doesn't block out
everything but the QC 30s here does
block out most I'm busy streets a lot of
that ambient air experience are
practically gone and cars driving by are
very much canceled out and of course
with music plan you can't hear anything
at all basically from your surroundings
now around crowded cafes and areas where
I filmed the microphone test it does
block out a good bit and there's still
some slight chatter still coming through
though especially if you're listening to
music from low to maybe a little bit
under moderate but in general these
performed as well as the bose qc25
and QC 35 headphones that reviewed
earlier on the channel know it seriously
a surreal experience the first time you
put these on but it's only when you turn
them off to realize how loud your
environment really is and thankfully for
me I didn't notice any cabin pressure
feeling like on some ANC headphones
however I unfortunately heard it low to
moderate amount of hissing in the
earphones at low vibe almost like white
static at times now with music playing I
didn't hear it unless I have I'm at
again medium or lower and if I pay too
close attention but most in time I
didn't notice it at all
now last moving on to audio performance
both returns with that neutral and
accurate sound signature the frequencies
across the board are equal to each other
without one overpowering the other bass
is there that's refining clean flat bass
response here allowing the mid-range and
highs to be relevant and apparent the
mid-range is clear and offers a
soundstage that is quite surprising in
distinguishing where sound is coming
from left and right audio channels are
very much
with audio in front of you and behind
you being moderately apparent as well
but the highs are kept very much in tact
without being tinging and hear ringing
and for some this sound signature is
great and very easy to listen to and
there will be others who would prefer a
bit more color in their sound signature
to be enjoyable I tempted to use my
equalizer and it does help a bit but not
by much without becoming distorted on my
end
Bose does provide an app letting you
adjust a and C and vibe levels there's
also a battery level indicator which
does help an option to change when the
QC 30s will shut down when not in use
now using the app to switch between
devices also a bonus but one major
desire which would have greatly helped
again was a built-in equalizer or some
sort of sound profile in the end the
shortcomings on the QC 35 I believe our
minor and I still highly recommend these
for the active noise-cancelling
performance which does work well and the
audio performance is very good for those
looking for an accurate sound signature
if you're okay with showing up me $300
these are for sure worth looking into so
