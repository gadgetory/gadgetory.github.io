good old days we used to have wires on
our headphones yes we did
fully wireless earbuds yes the promise
it's been out there Apple even Apple
they're making their own air pods a lot
of people were curious about them
getting involved in the fully wireless
earbuds because to this point it's been
a bit of a disaster right now you're
like what is what is this fully Wireless
like bluetooth I heard about Bluetooth
Lou no this means that each little
earbud is independent it's on its own
this company came along they're called
sky buds this is their crack at the
fully wireless year but truly wireless
earbuds now what they've done as you can
see on the back is they've included this
cool charging case which will provide 24
hours of total playtime so the case
itself is also a battery it's also got
water resistance you dope you're you're
lifting weights you're sweating three
sets of silicon fit tips so far so good
I like the packaging you scoop solid
first time set up this is where things
get a little sketchy sometimes we
recommend wearing the largest fit tips
possible for the best fit and the
highest audio quality here's a little
tip for you guys a tip about tips boom
whether it's these earbuds or other ones
if they do have interchangeable tips you
always want to have the tightest fit
possible in fact the characteristics of
the sound will change based on that seal
within your ear canal also both your ear
canals might not be the same size so
every time you get yourself some
interchangeable tip earbuds try out all
the different ear tips and if necessary
have a smaller one in what like for
example my left ear canal that's a
little tighter than the right one I
became comfortable with it over the
years Jack on the other hand I mean this
this man's got to get custom order or
something for those guys with it
press and hold the button on each sky
but for three seconds and then there's
going to be audio instructions to get it
set up you can see this becomes a
play/pause button so first things first
right in the middle here this is the
little charge case and that's a kind of
cool implement Oh
check that out Jack that's special Oh
boom
charge up this case there's a microUSB
on the bottom these are the different
ear tips we have large we have small and
I'm assuming that the media is
pre-installed the actual sky buds
themselves now they are labeled I like
that you see which one is right there's
the contact points for the charger
squeak in there and clip and then that's
it
this case is not just extra battery life
it also acts as your charger so you've
always got it with you and you want to
use them lift that up pull them out and
get to work
medium is pretty good for me press and
hold the button on each sky but for 3
seconds ok here we go
ooh oh it's like yet the movie feels
like boobs like boom she's talking to me
shake it don't you know you got to put
it in pairing mode open your Bluetooth
settings and so on rather than just
strictly being a you know text-based
audio it works a little bit better so
I'm going to try this three times ok 1 2
3 1 2 3
Oh online let's go ahead and give it a
little test on boot up my soundcloud
here real quick ok so listen I'll being
used to try and headphones everywhere
from like five dollars up to 500 maybe
even more than that 1500 no matter what
you do with Bluetooth it's never really
good to be on the level of a wired
connection but that's not really what
these things are about a huge component
here is the convenience of being
completely looking look at me I get
these are up I'm over here oh you're on
the bike you got the dog you're walking
the dog you better scoop the poop who's
gonna hate on you for that who's gonna
put who's gonna be bothered you of
course know there are phones out there
they don't even have headphone jacks
anymore so everybody's going Wireless to
some extent this is as Wireless as you
could get even the ones with the little
wire you kind of still know they're
there you're probably listening to a
compressed audio file to begin with on a
subpar amplifier for those headphones
convenience that's the play here could
be a podcast maybe you travel maybe on
an airplane like me what I will say
compared to completely wireless earbuds
the voice guiding you through the
okay tap it three times okay tear it up
and so on that's nice that actually
worked quite well and it makes sense
it's an ear but it should be audio for
the manual readily or near near near
near near near these things are tiny
look at those little guys if you've been
looking at the ear pods the Apple
earpods and those things got you
motivated you are like that's the future
I'm looking for well this is probably
just a step in that direction with a
slightly more substantial sound because
of the in-ear design the air pod is not
gonna do that right it fits just like a
regular ear pod it's kind of you can't
get a lot of low-end frequency unless
you get deep in that canal come on kids
get deep in that canal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
