they're called Das Keyboard
in fact I think I recall I've done
videos on various - keyboards in the
past but they've got something new that
they're bringing to the game now if
you're unfamiliar with them they do
mechanical keyboards that are legendary
they're like Mavis beacons best friend
Mavis Beacon reference she taught you
how to type as a kid home row
I still don't type properly no I'm like
picking and picking anyway what I
noticed it didn't exist on my previous
tasks keyboard is now white back
lighting it's called the prime 13
high-performance mechanical keyboard the
ultimate experience for badasses and
they wrote it right on a box it's kind
of aggressive now you can't get it with
other switches if you prefer MX blue or
so on anodized aluminum top panel for
improved durability that's cool full n
key rollover for faster gaming or typing
USB port right on it and a key cap
puller to remove keys for place keys and
so on legends in the keyboard game and
they got the newest they got the latest
and they got the greatest here's what
we're looking at my understanding is the
top deck is now completely aluminum
which I'm pretty pumped for Jack you've
got a desk keyboard your desk right now
they're not messing around this up here
yes that's aluminum it's it's it's black
but it's kind of got like a luminescence
to it like it's picking up the light a
little bit and almost looking kind of
gray clicky but there's no like switch
click I mean I mean if that's the noise
it turns you on you got it here they
went to the traditional feet on there I
kind of like that I think you might
switch to this one you probably want to
switch to this one well I don't know if
you can or not I might
which to this braided cable in here now
it terminates into two USB cables
gold-plated pretty nice and the reason
for that is you do have you have another
USB port here now it's only USB 2.0 I
guess it could have been nice fou 3.0
but that should work for at least
charging up your phone connecting a USB
thumb drive etc it's nice to have an
extra one right on your desktop so
that's all fine and dandy Lou but what
about the new feature and function what
about the backlight so let's dim some
lights here and watch this baby glow
boom comes to life with this really nice
white backlighting as you can see now
there are levels to it you can control
that up here via the F keys you see
they've sort of utilized the side of the
keys along top to show you the different
functions available from volume the
media buttons over here for play pause
next and so on and then controls for the
brightness of the backlight whether you
want it on or don't want it on I mean
why would you want a backlit keyboard I
guess it's pretty obvious you're in a
dimly lit environment or you just want
more contrast on the keys when you're
working at night what I like about -
keyboard is it's a little bit
understated when they do something it's
like yeah we get it you want a game
alright we're gonna we want to give you
the mechanical key switches we know
you're a power user but we're not going
to go over the top with it you can have
a nice white backlight pick your key
switches and end up with something a
little more subtle but still functional
and new prime 13 Das Keyboard
I don't know if it's the first backlit
version but it's the first one that I've
seen and I think it's just a you know
it's a little tweak on something that's
already really good like I said this one
is on Jack's desk right now while the
old version of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
