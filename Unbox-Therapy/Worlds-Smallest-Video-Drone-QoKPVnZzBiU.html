little drones tiny drones fit in the
palm of your hand today we are going to
show you the world's smallest HD video
drone so not only is this thing tiny but
it actually takes video at 720p I don't
even know how they where's the camera in
there
I don't really know called the videos HD
Eric's drones it's got a gyroscope in it
six axis altitude assistance 2.4
gigahertz and you better be 14 years old
to use it according to the box it's got
a controller a flight controller in it I
don't know we got to find out who knows
maybe you get this little guy you're
creating some cinema is it a DJI phantom
obviously not but then again that
doesn't fit in your pocket
does it I've looked at what was that
last one I can't remember maybe Jack
will sub it in right here
yeah
oh and this one is not much bigger than
that one was there's the camera right
there oh my goodness this is tiny you
can see it here in reference to the size
of my hand it is not much bigger than
the world's smallest drone here is the
controller joysticks thumb sticks
whatever you want to call them here kind
like a little Xbox controller adjustment
switches as well to keep it flying
straight some extra propellers here this
is good if you happen to break the
preinstalled ones but then again they've
got the protection on there so hopefully
you don't end up breaking those at least
not straight away and look at that you
can enhance your flight experience you
could turn into one of those
first-person views all right we're gonna
need some batteries oh it does have
juice okay where's the video feed going
there isn't a video HD I'm gonna look it
up turn on your drone and pair it with
the Wi-Fi okay your own is on there it
is videos HD oh my goodness look at this
check it out okay here we go
turn this little guy around whoa that is
crazy to have any kind of camera on
something that small oh okay
really wants to go that way easy brother
so you can toggle on certain aspects on
the display it could just be the video
feed if you want or you can have these
joysticks as well there's a lift off
button a stop button a landing button
and then adjustments that you can make
if it's like leaning to one direction or
the other to kind of balance it out
anyhow let's give it a shot here just
just drop down the stairs over there
probably like 10 feet or something
you're recording didn't even stop and it
doesn't look damaged at all these little
white guards or whatever seem to protect
it pretty well
that was pretty good that was pretty
good flight time for something this mini
Eric's drones it's legit like it says HD
obviously at 720p it's not gonna be the
most impressive video you've ever seen
but what are you complaining about I
mean look at this this is not a DJI
phantom but for what it is it's kind of
cool
even without the video if you just want
to like fly around and bother Tom and
trying to eat a sandwich it'll do the
trick it's pretty cool the world's
smallest HD video drone right there you
saw it where unbox therapy that's where
I thought you were ready to give up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
