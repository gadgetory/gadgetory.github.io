nice things about this phone right here
the p20 pro from huawei if you didn't
see that video you should definitely go
check it out I tell you about the pros
cons things I liked about it this
incredibly crazy camera including some
samples as well you really need to check
it out if you have a lot of money to
spend on a smart phone you really need
to consider this one but huh I told you
in that video that I was gonna switch to
a different smartphone and I asked you
guys for your suggestions as far as what
I should switch to and I speculated in
my mind without telling you that you
guys are gonna pick the poka phone f1y
because the thing is a crazy value at
least on paper because I haven't used it
extensively yet I mean I used it a
little bit and I was impressed how can
they do it I don't remember what was the
title of my original video how is this
possible that was my reaction and I'm
sure it was yours as well so the only
way to figure out how it's possible and
if it's real if it's the real deal is to
switch over to it I don't know about the
last time if ever I switched officially
to a smartphone with a starting price of
300 dollars USD is it gonna be painful I
don't know possibly just because it's
constantly flagship after flagship I did
use the BlackBerry for a bit that was
painful
what hilly come on I was in physical
pain it was that camera was terrible it
was a whole thing anyway whatever some
people like BlackBerry's that's fine
nonetheless that was more expensive than
this I don't think in this whole
experience of switching back and forth
making switching videos switching to
different smartphones for long periods
of time I don't think I ever put myself
through a couple of weeks on a phone
with a starting price of 300 bucks why
do I do it I'd do it for you okay we
need to get to the truth what are they
doing here where are they cutting
corners are they cutting corners or is
this thing as good as it seems cuz right
now I'm having trouble figuring out how
this thing in my hands this build
quality this product starts at $300 this
spec sheet starts at $300 Snapdragon a
four five four thousand milliamp hour
battery the camera already surprised me
I showed you in the previous video the
selfie camera bananas I mean the rear
camera also what are we doing here guys
are we all spending too much money is it
possible
but the big main brands overcharging is
that possible I know you guys think they
are because you guys are in the comments
you screaming shouting telling me
they're taking advantage of you Samsung
Apple you name them I personally think
that there's some serious competition to
the one thousand dollar smartphone this
device is not only a problem for one
thousand dollar smartphones this this
device is a problem for five hundred
dollar smartphone this device is a
problem for almost every other
smartphone now to be clear the model I
have in front of me here it's the
armored Edition it's not the base line
version I know you guys wanted some
clarification on it this is the one they
sent to me so this exact one is not 300
bucks but the internals the
specification with the exception of the
back panel would be identical to the
version that starts at the 300 dollar
price point this one has a little bit
more storage as well but nonetheless the
experience will be identical now the
reason I think that this particular
switch could be should be hopefully as
insightful for you is because it's
coming from the perspective of an
individual who's been locked into the
flagship territory with the exception I
guess of oneplus devices because I have
used those extensively and we all know
they're around 500 bucks in the early
days those things were called flagship
killers because of their spec list
compared to the Samsung's and the
iPhones and the various other more
expensive brands and flagship devices
that were out there but now you have a
flagship killer to kill potentially the
flagship killer that's kind of what's
happening here with poka phone and
honestly the reaction from you guys
it certainly constitutes this switch for
me do I really think it's going to be
painful honestly my intuition right now
is probably not
I think I'm hoping then I don't see too
much downside shifting over to this from
the p20 Pro or previously the galaxy s 9
plus or previously the 1 plus 6 or
previously the pixel 2 XL yeah that's
right
I'm switching around man I need to
figure it out for you is the $300 polka
phone f1
the best buy in smartphones the best
value for money in smartphones right now
should you be spending more or should
you set your sights on this one
exclusively is this the future of
smartphones or am I gonna find some
drawbacks some little hidden nitpicks
let's put the sim card in p20 pro sim
card there it is mm we are connected
