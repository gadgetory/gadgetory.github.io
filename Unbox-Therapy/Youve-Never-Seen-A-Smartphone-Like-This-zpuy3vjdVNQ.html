of unique a lot of different types of
smartphones over the years it's been
years Jack we've been doing this for
years how old do you feel how old what
we are old that's the thing in YouTube
years they're kind of like dog years so
a YouTube year seven human years
whoa if there's a smartphone out there
that needs to be unboxed it's gonna
happen here I have a very unique
smartphone from a company called
BlackVue inside of this box is a
smartphone with a movie projector built
into it so at any moment you can
broadcast whatever's on your smartphone
onto a wall into a large image to share
what whatever it is you're looking at
could could be YouTube there's a
projector inside of a smartphone never
thought I'd see the day this is called
the max one I believe it's available for
pre-sale right now around 700 bucks but
it's very unique you must admit so let's
go ahead and check it out okay type-c
cable to charge it up you've got the OTG
cable type C 2 micro adapter no
headphone jack on here I can tell right
now because there's a dongle C 2 mini
jack oh and then they include a mini
Jack headset to use with your dongle
okay there you go
this thing's kind of a beast it's a bit
heavy I think it has a huge battery
otherwise from the front it looks like a
pretty standard smartphone but then
things get magical when you look at the
top right there boom what wait a lens a
projector on my smartphone I didn't know
I wanted this do I want this I don't
know maybe you travel a lot and you're
like I want the content on my phone on
the wall in the hotel room that's a
possible my question is how bright can
this thing really be there little
fingerprint on it how usable can this be
oh I see a projection button it looks
like a skinned version of Android going
on here so let's see what happens I
click on a projection button I think we
need the lights off I see some light
coming out of here so I mean this is
tough to display to you here but this
guy right here is outputting that image
now on the wall here means not that far
away from it that image is probably like
50
maybe 60 inches and we got it set up
just in a way that you can see it here
with a little bit of light on of course
the image improves when you turn the
lights out completely with any small
projector you just can't have that much
light output including one that's built
into a smartphone so if you are using
this to watch movies you're probably
gonna put your other lights down
beforehand now you might be noticing
some scan lines coming through that's
just the way that the camera is
interacting with the projection in real
life you don't see any of those scan
lines so keep that in mind now the other
thing to mention the closer you get the
phone to the projection surface the
better the quality gets of course but
the smaller the image so if I move this
device closer over here you'll see the
brightness and the density of the image
improves but of course it gets smaller
still better than staring only at a
smartphone it's a bit of novelty
obviously I mean this is not something
that everybody needs but it's a cool
piece of tech traditionally originally
if you wanted to project any kind of
image you we need this giant projector
to do so now you can do it from right
within your smartphone now the other
thing I was worried about is like the
portrait mode versus landscape but when
you maximize a video it just figures it
out the projector figures it out if you
wanted to project a game or something
that would work too though that would be
weird because you couldn't control the
game I guess you would need some type of
external controller in which case you
could go ahead and project the game you
know this like an NBA app there's an NHL
app NFL MLB all the major sports they
have apps you could imagine setting up
play an impromptu sporting scenario the
UFC app I mean if you had the lights off
this thing is usable it's not the
greatest projector I've ever seen it's
built into a smartphone it's tiny but
you get the lights off and it's kind of
it's just like a portable 60-inch
display is it as bright as a an OLED
panel no okay of course not adjust your
expectations here it's in a smart phone
but better than looking at a smart phone
imagine the locker room the other night
after hockey we
we're watching I had the basketball game
the Raptors game on my phone and people
gathered around if I had this in the
locker room hit the Lights
be a little perverted to be honest a
cool combination of tech that you
wouldn't expect to see and that's what I
like to see ambitious weird products are
exciting all right so here's the thing
this device here this is non retail it's
in presale mode right now so a lot of
the specs and whatnot might not
necessarily be finalized certainly the
software itself also not finalized what
I do know here is that this thing is
gonna have a big battery and of course
this active projector it'll also be
running Android just take it for what
it's worth at this moment right here the
specs will get a clearer picture closer
to the release date it's a bizarre phone
that's why I like it look at this I'm
shining I'm glimmering right now can
your smartphone do that I didn't think
so this is like bringing a party
wherever you go if you're a sports fan I
don't know I think it's pretty cool it's
weird and that's what unbox therapy is
about sometimes uncovering the unusual
gadgets like this one the black view max
a1 if you want to check it out there's a
link in the description to the product
page or at least where you can
eventually order it I think it's a bit
of fun all right
lighten up
