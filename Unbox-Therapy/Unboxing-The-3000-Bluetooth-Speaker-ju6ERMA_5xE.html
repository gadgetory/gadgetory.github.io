to blow your mind now I probably use
that statement a little too liberally
because then they'll be like some some
item that comes into the studio which
I'm like now that is actually gonna blow
their minds
but then I've used the statement in the
past because I thought those things were
what I would consider to be mind boiling
we need something beyond mind-blowing
now that said I'm not certain that this
is gonna blow minds
I just assumed so because beside me
today is probably the most expensive
Bluetooth speaker on the planet it's
also an incredibly heavily requested
unbox therapy product it's from a
company called DVLA DVLA how much is
this I need to know I need to know
exactly how much this is if you're
looking to spend $3,000 your
expectations are gonna have to be up
here and there's even a suggestion of
pairing two of these creating a $6,000
Bluetooth setup like is this not look at
it look at that look at this these are
the expectations you have at $3,000 this
it has to be a whole experience
invented by DVLA in Paris made in France
well you don't see that very often now
I'm starting understand why it's 3 grand
4500 watts 108 DB SPL the world's most
critically acclaimed startup for the
excellence of its innovations in sound
technology Cabo gold phantom implosive
Sal sounds dangerous is this a thing
that you need to know about is this a
thing you need in your life we're gonna
find out this company reached out to me
on Twitter but I decided to just buy the
thing myself so I can give you the true
scoop here okay here we go
I might regret this I probably will in
the sense that it's like three grand but
you know me this is my job right here
there we go what it's like it just gave
birth to some alien life-form oh my
goodness
whoa oh my goodness
Jack are you kidding me I've seen
pictures of this online but man that's
different in real life with this what is
that like some rose gold going on there
is that metal hope a power cable in here
this is heavy and the reason it's so
heavy is because it creates some
enormous amount of pressure inside of
this cabinet which allows for it to get
as loud as it does this is what the
Grail looks like this is apparently
where sound is gonna come from base
should come from the sides so what do
you think should we listen to it let's
do it no I told you some kind of alien
life-form can they hear that
somethings about to go down oh I'm
telling you it's giving me life-form
vibes right now I'm having an alien
moment jeez I don't know if I've ever
had this level of anticipation in an
unbox therapy video before so now that
I'm connected it's quiet
what are we doing for music I feel so
weird just going to soundcloud right now
she's gonna play from this list all
right let's all chill out let's just
chill out are you ready to grovel at my
feet and beg for forgiveness if living
means bowing down in the lexing you
bastards I'd rather die on my feet with
my head held high
the low-end on this thing what is going
on right now this whole place is like
hmm I mean it's like you know if you're
sitting in a car and there's a subwoofer
in the back and it's just coming along
when you hear the bass oh my goodness
it's physical I can feel it in my chest
and I'm I'm a I'm in tear up Jack
it's so small what is going on here
this isn't making sense to me this thing
is crafted in such a fashion that they
can create pressure that can simulate
what a much larger cabinet would be
capable of doing because a normal
speaker this size is not doing this
it sounds like having a 12 inch
subwoofer in the back of your trunk and
then sitting with your head right next
to it that's what it sounds like what do
you do you put two of these on a shelf
you call it a day you know what else is
occurring to me right now is just how
independent the sound is like by this I
mean the separation between the baseline
and the other instrumentation it's
almost like it's happening exclusively
instead of coming at you from from one
perspective from one being am I losing
it it does not make sense to me you put
this thing around a group of people and
I do not believe for one second if there
will be one person there that's mind is
not blown I said in the beginning of
this video I've got to start to reserve
the mind blown for when it makes sense
today's that day
these French dudes figured something out
is it worth three grand well that has
more to do with your lifestyle than
anything else because three grand what
is that that's like rent
that's more than rent like what did you
spend at the bar last night huh was that
worth 100 bucks I don't know you can
pooled all your money bought a case and
got one of these to share with your pals
because that's what we're doing for just
a couple of dudes listening to music</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
