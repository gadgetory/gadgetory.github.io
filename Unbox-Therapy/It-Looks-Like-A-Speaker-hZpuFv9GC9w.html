movie theater in your personal space you
don't need to go out who doesn't want
that there are of course drawbacks to
the projector lifestyle what about when
the sunlight is bleeding in what about
the sound you have it on the wall or is
there pulldown screen as the screen
always down is it retractable this
product here from a company called -
bond specifically the flicks they put
the projector into something with giant
speakers built right into it so whatever
source is feeding into this projector
they put a giant battery in here so you
don't even need a wall outlet now
imagine the superball outdoors alright
this is what I'm trying to get it we got
some paperwork some accessories here ooh
so much plastic here we go that's
portable this can go on a picnic this
can go where you go oh this makes sense
is the audio firing this way it would
make sense right the audio fires back at
the audience that's pretty smart if
that's the case so we've got the grill
on the front on the top is a set of
controls auxilary input HDMI input
Bluetooth power switch Bluetooth switch
battery and battery indicator it's also
a Bluetooth speaker a portable Bluetooth
speaker right your projector lens
auxilary input headphone output HDMI and
a charge out that's cool an HDMI cable
included a little tiny remote here let's
see power switches for both audio and
video and then a source selector and
this is for you Jack right here do not
look into the projector dude see that
light over you turn this baby on four
bars of battery very nice whoo
fancy now there's a little focus wheel
the image will get larger the further
away the projector is from the surface
it's projecting onto DIY gallium fidget
spinner 21 million views welcome back to
your favorite series on unbox therapy
unless you what we got for volume here
can't get easy on the wallet today I've
got three cool gadgets under $15 a $15
jack they're all under $15 let's get
straight into it we're going to start it
off with this guy right here he's called
pal bot so now I'm going to test it out
just for audio over Bluetooth you can
see I've got the Bluetooth light
flashing there I've had louder Bluetooth
speakers here before but remember this
one is also a projector so you have a
giant battery a Bluetooth speaker a
portable projector that thing's even got
a handle this becomes like the central
point of multimedia and entertainment
anywhere that isn't your living room
immediately you know you anywhere you
want to take it now you have a movie
theater that's it look it it has a
handle on it it's a little bit expensive
but it's kind of unique
you'll bring something like this to a
party are you the most popular guy think
about this here this could be the
optimal setup that I just thought of
chromecast throw a chromecast into here
permanently just have it sit there and
then power it up this USB port with the
world's shortest USB cable now anybody
with a phone could broadcast to this
device talk about a party anywhere
becomes your movie theater everyone's
got a wall somewhere you're gonna buy a
Bluetooth speaker anyways put a lens in
it kaboom blow people's minds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
