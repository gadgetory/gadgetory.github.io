vicarious consumption today we've got
the GoPro LCD BacPac
which is an LCD screen for your HD hero
cameras and if you don't know what those
are then you suck at life not I'm just
kidding
they're basically incredibly cool little
miniature cameras that can endure life
in extreme environments they are
specifically suited for extreme sports
applications and they shoot in a wide
angle and in high definition but one of
the only downsides of them is that to
this point there was really no way of
playing back the footage you took at
least on the fly and that's what this
product here sets out to sort of squash
is now it's gonna be more like a
traditional digital camera and that you
can you know review what you just shot
anyway what we're looking at here are
some new backdoors for your different
durable enclosures that you're used to
putting your GoPro into and the reason
that there's so many is because each one
has a sort of different function as you
can see on the side here you've got
waterproof door standard waterproof door
for the wrist housing non waterproof
door etc etc next we've got the user
manual and it's hard to get excited
about user manuals but one thing I did
notice right away is that you've got
white text on black paper I don't know
if they guess anybody else excited but
anyway
maybe maybe I won't lose it now maybe
yeah maybe you'll say hey it's that
little black book over there there's the
manual but who cares you probably won't
need it now that you got this LCD
because the GoPro just got a hell of a
lot less complicated to use anyway on
the back here we've got our male
attachment that's the part that's gonna
plug in to the GoPro and interface with
it we've also got a speaker and now that
we can play back video
let's get closer so see here you've got
the different connectors the speaker
closer up you got the play button now
which makes sense I mean it's a tiny
little LCD but it's a tiny little camera
see what I'm saying
let's get it hooked up here you've got
this little sort of hinge piece here it
just sort of sits sits in this Cove and
spins down and clips so I suppose that
in the event that you want it to be
super durable you could still shoot
without the LCD attached it does make it
a little bit fatter so if we power on a
device we see that right away boom we
got video now no more wondering what
you're looking at you could actually
frame a shot now this to me this is a
huge improvement like I mean I used to
take a look at the GoPro sitting over
there and be like wow do I want to use
it don't want to take it out with me
today I'm gonna have other cameras too
and I you know I would decide based on
usability and now with this this new LCD
the use abilities gone through the roof
I mean we have a legitimate battery
meter rejoice but we've also got a much
more usable Settings menu that's a big
one so let's go ahead and insert the
camera into the waterproof housing so
you can get a sense for just how big it
is when it's all hooked up and as you
can see the LCD remains clear even you
know through the enclosure and we've got
a different button attachment here to
deal with that new button we got anyway
if you were unsure about buying a GoPro
before now is the time my friends it's
attachment completely changes the game
it's way easier to use more fun to use
and I'm gonna go ahead and totally
recommend you do it anyway check out our
