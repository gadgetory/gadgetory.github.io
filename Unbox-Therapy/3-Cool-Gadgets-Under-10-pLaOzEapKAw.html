gadgets to show you and each one of them
is under $10
it is the budget episode for every
single one of you that leaves that
comment that top comment Luke show us
something affordable me sometimes you
know just kind of carried away on the
channel it's like here's a smartphone
it's 20 grand no three gadgets all cool
all under $10 so number one fresh off of
Kickstarter from a company called trial
Obi they say it is the first three in
one magnetic cable for iPhone and
Android it can charge an iPhone it can
charge an Android phone if your phone
supports it it can charge one phone from
another phone it's getting all but then
on top of it it's got a magnetic
connector that you can leave insert it
in your device and then kind of like the
old MagSafe connector that you used to
have on MacBooks
you can use that but on your phone now I
think the earlybird on Kickstarter was
around six bucks for this it's eight now
eight dollars and here is the little
magnetic adapter in there as well you
have a full-sized USB connector but then
it can fold down and all of a sudden you
have micro USB on the other end you've
got this termination point so then this
guy goes in here and now that connector
right there is lightning or micro holy
smokes okay so now you're now I'm
starting to understand what's going on
here so basically this end will always
connect to the last device to the device
on the end of the chain then this one
will either go into a brick power brick
to charge that device up but if you want
to go phone to phone action that's when
you fold this down now all of a sudden
you can use an Android device to charge
up an iPhone or an Android device to
charge up another Android device so this
tip here is meant to be permanently
installed Jack can you pick that up
that's tiny look at it Alex es7 let's
see how this fits in here on the Android
side it would be like that now I don't
know if you're gonna leave that
permanently installed because it pokes
out a bit spill on an iPhone though
I phone it fits flush hey-oh let's say
that's low power 20% power let's say I
fold this end down and I grab that same
s7 and I'll just plug this in right here
you can see it says select an
application for the USB device triggers
the OTG aspect but then the iPhone is
charging so the iPhone is now taking
juice from the galaxy s7 the top
microUSB part it fits into the USB
connector in the empty space just above
it like this and now it's just like any
other iPhone cable so this end will plug
in to the wall see we've got the green
light on there boom share the love share
the juice take a sip of Android iPhone
it'll only hurt a bit all right so next
up we've got this little guy right here
now this one I think is six or seven
bucks from a company called Remo it'll
go into the headphone jack on your
device now granted if you've got an
iPhone 7 and this little tiny thing will
fit in there and give you control over
various TVs set-top boxes you can have
this thing installed in your phone you
get a sports bar or something and change
what whatever you want to watch on the
TV I don't this was also on Kickstarter
but it was successfully funded and you
can see on the back here there's an app
that goes along with it
look how tiny that thing is holy smokes
just kind of reminds me of that button
that you could add to Android you
remember that so the devices that can
control have to have an infrared input
but again that's like most cable boxes
most TVs it'll go right in the headphone
jack right there so let's try this out
fingertip or zaza remote from app store
so there's some options it's called
fingertip I'm going to try to add a
remote here and like look at that no
matter what brand you I don't mean some
of these brands I never even heard of so
I'm just gonna search for LG I don't
know let's try let's see here
what I'm pointing it the wrong way
okay so the discovery here it does work
and it was easy to set up it was just
the first LG TV preset but the issue is
the range gosh I don't know what is this
50 feet away this works on my particular
TV up to about 12 feet at which point
and no longer grabs the signal I don't
know how big of an issue that is because
most people's spaces are not as big as
this one here and then at the end of the
day the thing is like six or seven bucks
so calm down all right next up we got
this little guy here this one is five
bucks I think it's called the magnet
band it is a smartphone macro lens it'll
give you a four times magnification if
you're not familiar with macro this is
like the ability to take pictures of
incredibly small things like beyond how
your human eye would be able to
interpret something like a bug or
individual seeds there are a lot of lens
adapters on the market very few of them
are five bucks you wouldn't even notice
if that thing was in your pocket this
one has the camera in the top corner
here so let's just see how this guy
slides on there kind of fits over top
see how it's all weird and blurry but
then that's weird
oh if you're not into eyeballs I
apologize
lock it down this stuff is always cool
to me macro photography it's popular in
like nature stuff you can get really
close get a different perspective on it
how about a this Perrier cap it's up to
you and your creativity but it's a
simple little thing which is easy to put
on and easy to use here's a seven plus
works on a seven plus as well let's try
it actually on the zoom lens oh my
goodness you're even closer at this
point the individual pixels on the print
there so this thing is even better on a
seven plus alright so there you have it
three cool gadgets under $10 the crazy
amazing three-in-one cable which seems
like more than three and one in terms of
all the different things
could do and then we also had the
infrared transmitter IR blaster turn on
and off any TV switch channels and then
lastly this cool little macro lens band
which is universal this will really work
with any phone that would fit in there
five bucks eight bucks six bucks look at
that don't ever tell me again that I
don't have love for the value shoppers
out there that's three things under ten
maybe we'll make it a series</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
