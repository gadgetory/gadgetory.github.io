have a fun one today this showed up it's
called the hip shot dot and it was sent
to me from the folks over at live with
YouTube gaming they wanted to start
sending me a couple of cool gaming
related peripherals accessories I have
no idea what to expect it's called the
hip shot dot a red dot sight attachment
for first-person shooter games
compatible with Xbox one ps4 Xbox 360
ps3 pc Wii U Call of Duty battlefield
titanfall and more it's got a USB
powered LED which sits on your display
over top of your normal sights easily
attach and detach from a television 72
inch USB power cord alright
you actually stick that little suction
cup right to the TV in a claim you can
aim more quickly improve your accuracy
enhance reaction time to feel like the
real deal with the red dot let's crack
this open I'm a little skeptical who
knows let's find out so this is the
device kinda looks like a piece of
medical equipment you can't you like
beep beep anyway you can power this
thing off any USB power doesn't have to
be directly from your console and then
this little thing I'm gonna show you
this just suctions right on right like
this right to your eyeball no cool wow
that's that's actually on there right
now but the majority of the suction cup
is see-through and then the center
portion that's what is going to
illuminate supposedly increase my
accuracy which that's gonna be quite the
feat I mean I need all the help I can
get I just picked up battlefield one
we're gonna try it out together let's do
it right now see if I'm ready better ok
got myself a monitor got the ps4 and
I've got battlefield one booted up I'm
at the very beginning of the game and I
haven't played it yet looks pretty
intense so far I'm going to take this
little device and plug it into the ps4
for power you can see this lights up -
we'll see if Jack can pick that up can
you pick that up
so what you're supposed to do to set
this up go in game
they're firing out soom in you want this
little dot to be right at your
crosshairs the second one just exists
for tension of that out of the way down
here now watch what i'm talking about
when i zoom in see that how the dot
becomes the aim even though I'm only in
World War one I got the red dot sight oh
that is a flamethrower holy all my fire
I'm a fire right now
Oh what didn't last long
now the cool thing is I mean lines up
with or without l2 oh no not again with
the flamethrower this guy I'm going
right at him oh you gotta shoot his
backpack he blows up I can sense a lot
of a lot of dying is gonna happen you
would is World War one I mean should be
on bye-bye
whose tank is that it's probably Oh
I get what you're doing it with the
thing you're playing all the different
roles of different guys within the
military's what's going on so what can I
say like I think it actually kind of
does the job can you this can pick it up
there it is called the Hipshot dot I
think the name is fitting because where
this really stands to improve your
accuracy is when you're firing without
zooming in without having the crosshairs
because then it becomes really obvious
to you where they would be but you can
fire from the hip hip shot dot I don't
know all right listen you're not
sticking this thing on your TV and going
straight MLG it's not happening all
right there's no easy way you got to put
in the time you got to put into practice
with or without the hip shot dot well
you get an extra kill I don't know maybe
if you want to step your game up to the
highest levels it's time to grab that
controller keyboard and mouse put in
those hours with those Cheetos all over
your hands cuz you're special like that
you're going pro your parents are gonna
be proud of you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
