therapy and I got a real cool product in
front of me today this is the eaton
mobius rechargeable battery case for
your iphone 4 and 4s but what's special
about it is it's got a solar panel built
into the back that is correct this baby
can take advantage of the sun's rays and
boost up your power that way very cool
very interesting can't wait to get
inside and get a closer look now the
back identifies some of what you can
expect for extra time if you leave this
thing in the Sun 1 hour in the Sun
result in 25 minutes talktime 20 minutes
on the internet 35 minutes extra video
playback now you can charge the device
alternatively via USB and that's gonna
boost that baby up if you want to avoid
the Sun or if you're some kind of emo
kid that stays inside all the time I'm
just I'm just kidding but anyways you
can charge it both ways and that's
important because you might not have
access to the Sun all the time and you
might not have access to a USB port all
the time so it's giving you options and
I'm sort of seeing this device being
used in sort of emergency scenarios or
maybe you're out hiking or something
along those lines where you want to have
that backup even if it's only for a
short period of usage now as we look at
the device we've got a very simple
little instruction pamphlet here telling
you how to insert your iPhone 4 / 4s
into it and we've got a real cool little
manual here that goes into a little bit
more detail about what you can expect
through using the device as well as how
to get it all up and running now getting
a closer look at the actual case you
notice it's a little bit bulky of course
it's got a freaking solar panel in it
guys it's got to be a little bulky the
interior is a smooth material and
there's a better look at that that solar
panel photovoltaic cell I'm gonna get
all technical on you guys here and up
along top you've got the Mobius logo
along with a nice big cutout for your
camera all the controls and all the
interesting stuff happens on the bottom
of the case that's where you've got your
micro USB port a little battery
identifier etc so let's go ahead and
throw the phone into the case and there
it is not too hard to do as I mentioned
before it does add some size and weight
to the iPhone but that's not really a
big deal I don't think you're going to
use this thing all the time again
this is for people you know very
specific use case scenarios or for those
that go on long trips vacations keep it
outside with them all the time people
who ride bikes
I don't know who ever has access to the
Sun right so we've also got you know a
little battery indicator along the
bottom telling you how much charge
you've had you have you have the
microUSB port as I mentioned before you
still have access to your microphone and
speaker along the bottom that's very
important so you can use the device now
when you want to remove the iPhone it's
real simple you just slide down the
bottom portion of the case and the phone
becomes loose you can just pop it out of
there and then as you slide it back up
your phone just starts charging again so
whatever charge you have saved up on the
actual case we'll just act like an
outside power source to the phone and
then recharge the phone so that the
phone can use it in its internal battery
the same way as any other battery case
on the market but like I said before
this battery case has that multiple
method charging so here's a better look
at the back the reason for that gigantic
cutout is so that you have that LED
flash still accessible for all your
drunken photographs and here's here's a
better look at how it looks on the case
and guys I'm gonna be honest with you I
admit you know it makes it about twice
as fat it almost makes it about twice as
heavy but this is still a kick-ass
product as far as I'm concerned it
solves an issue that that is a really a
big one if you're out and about with
this thing in environments that are
dangerous or environments that are
tropical or if you're some kind of
mercenary or whatever this is an
incredible backup the Sun ain't going
anywhere at least not anytime soon and
at least until there's some kind of
apocalypse or something like that I
don't envision that happening anytime
soon so this is a real kick-ass back up
and guess what the cool people at Eaton
Eaton they sent me another one they sent
me two cases that's because one is for
you guys the details are going to be in
the next video for that giveaway so
