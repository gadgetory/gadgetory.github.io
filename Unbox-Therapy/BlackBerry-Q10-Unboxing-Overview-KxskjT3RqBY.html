therapy and today we're taking a look at
the latest device from blackberry this
is the q10 it borrows a little bit of
what it does from older style
blackberries in the sense that the input
method is once again a traditional style
keyboard but then it also borrows a lot
from the new z10 or z10 depending on
where you are regionally how you want to
pronounce that because it has the latest
OS it has a blackberry 10 on here and it
also has a very nice capacitive touch
screen speaking about that screen it's a
little bit different than what you're
used to on other smartphones because
it's a square has a 720 by 720
resolution at 330 PPI but for
traditional BlackBerry users or anybody
coming from an interface where you have
a traditional keyboard you're used to
seeing a square aspect ratio on your
screen so that's nothing unusual for you
you've got a little bit of paperwork in
the box your warranty information
product information there's a little
pamphlet here identifying the fact that
you have a Snapdragon processor inside
trying to get you pumped up about the
speed on this new device to be more
exact it has a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
chip so should be pretty snappy running
that new operating system the headset is
new I haven't seen this design before
you actually have interchangeable
earpieces here I've seen that before but
these earpieces are a little bit
different they have ear hooks on them
that fit into the cartilage portion of
your ear
I assume the idea here is that they
don't fall out as easily and hopefully
they fit a wider number of people or a
wider number of years to be more
specific you've of course got an inline
microphone for answering your phone
calls etc and then you've also got more
ear tips as I said before they're
interchangeable so you can find the ones
that are most suitable for your specific
ears you've also got a USB cable this is
pretty self-explanatory this will plug
into your portable power brick in order
to charge the device as well as sync the
device if you're hooking it up to a
computer you have a battery here as well
a relatively large battery this is 2100
milliamp hours I'll go ahead and install
this in a moment
blackberry claims you're going to get
13.5 hours of talktime over 3G on that
battery as well as up to 14 point 8 days
of standby time once
again that's on 3g this phone does
support 4G LTE to mention so you know
you're obviously going to see slightly
less battery performance if you happen
to be on that improved frequency that
improved data throughput that you can
experience with LTE so the brick is
pretty similar to the one that you get
with Apple devices it's just a small
little square or Samsung devices for
that matter and you just plug your USB
into there and you are good to go taking
a closer look at the body of the q10
you'll notice this carbon fiber like
finish on the back I'm pretty sure it's
just an aesthetic thing I don't think
this is actual carbon fiber but the
material is really really nice it's got
a soft touch to it and it's grippy it
doesn't feel like you're going to drop
the device unlike some more slippery
models on the market I'm looking at you
galaxy s4 SIM card installation is very
simple in this case I'm using a Telus
sim with full support for 4G LTE so we
should get some blazing speeds on this
device you can also find a microSD slot
underneath that same battery door so if
you want to extend the storage up to say
32 gigabytes that's very easy to do and
actually pretty inexpensive I'm amazed
at how cheap micro sd s have become in
fact I found some great prices on some
micro sd s on Amazon just prior to
making this video so I'll link those
down in the description if you want to
check out some cheap prices on some
massive micro as these since this is the
first time the device has been booted up
it takes a little bit longer than it
normally would but that's okay I'll take
this opportunity to show you guys around
the outside of the device and give you a
closer look at the inputs and outputs so
on the side this is the left hand side
you've got your micro USB as well as a
micro HDMI so you can charge the device
on the USB and you can output video on
that micro HDMI port on the right-hand
side of the devices where you'll find
your volume up and down and then there
is a customizable button in the centre
very similar to the one you can find on
the z10 or z10 on the top you have a
headphone jack your power switch a
couple of array microphones on the
bottom you'll find your main speaker
which is relatively large and your main
input microphone for when you're having
phone conversations the setup is a
little bit finicky if you're familiar
already with BlackBerry 10 then you
don't really need to go through this
tutorial you've got a forward facing
camera
well as your earpiece on the top and
some sensors I'll tell you a little bit
more about the cameras actually you've
got an eight megapixel autofocus camera
on the back and it has backside
illumination so supposedly you're going
to get better low-light performance out
of that camera it also has a relatively
bright F 2.2 lens with five elements so
BlackBerry's pretty happy with the
camera that they put into this device
the forward facing camera is not bad
either it's 2 megapixels though it is a
fixed focus camera like a lot of
forward-facing ones it will support 720p
HD video recording those so if you like
to film yourself you're all set and
ready to go
anyways taking a closer look around the
interface it behaves as you'd expect
your main input method here is touch
much like the z10 or z10 in fact it's
exactly the same except on a square
screen and of course you have this
traditional input method on below that
will likely make a lot of hardcore
BlackBerry users happy after all I think
a lot of people we're holding on to
their BlackBerry devices because they're
very committed to this kind of keyboard
they just never adjusted to a touch
style keyboard I have to admit it does
feel nice every so often to hit actual
buttons to get some actual tactile
feedback on your smart device especially
if you happen to be an X blackberry user
myself the last one that I used as a
daily driver was the 8800 which seems
like ages ago actually it was I don't
know how many years ago that was but
this device has got me motivated I'm
actually considering doing a blackberry
challenge attempting to use this device
as my daily driver for a week or
something and then report back to you
guys on the pros and cons moving from my
Nexus 4 which is my current daily driver
if you guys would like to see that kind
of challenge that kind of experiment
leave a thumbs up down below and maybe I
could do that this week anyway guys that
wraps up this feature video this
unboxing of the latest BlackBerry the
q10 if you enjoyed this video please
remember to leave a thumbs up down below
if you're interested in pricing and
availability on this device the links
you will need to check that out as well
as more technical specifications will be
down in the description thanks as always
for watching and I will catch guys real
soon on the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
