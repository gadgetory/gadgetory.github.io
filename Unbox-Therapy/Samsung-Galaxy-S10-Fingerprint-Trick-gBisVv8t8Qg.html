that again so as you know I've been
using the galaxy s 10 as my main device
for a period of time now now I've given
up on the face unlock I knew it wasn't
very secure but then I made that video
showing just how easily fooled it was I
played a video on lots of device I'm
just not using face unlock anymore not
the way that it's implemented on the
galaxy s 10 but that's not all bad
because of course this device has that
really cool ultrasonic fingerprint
scanner underneath the display of the
phone now in the face unlock act video I
explained that I wasn't so happy I
wasn't enjoying the end display
fingerprint reader very much
it just wasn't performing as I kind of
wanted it to and so I gave it some
thought I was like maybe there's a way
to improve this maybe I can register the
same finger more than once I was
thinking to myself wait I just came from
the oneplus 60 and that didn't work and
typically with the in display optical
based fingerprint scanners they won't
allow you to register the same
fingerprint more than once so for
example okay on the right hand side here
of the oneplus 60 you can see two finger
prints are registered left thumb right
thumb if I go to add another fingerprint
and I use the same thumb in order to
like improve I guess the reading
improved the image that's stored within
the phone if I do it with this with the
60 it will say the fingerprint has
already been enrolled please try another
finger so it won't allow you to have the
same finger registered more than once
maybe it has something to do with the
optical technology that's at play here
in the 60 and other in display
fingerprint smartphones but on the s 10
it doesn't work that way so to my
pleasant surprise I could go in there
and register the same thumbprint more
than once and after doing so I actually
ended up with a more accurate more
satisfying experience with the device
this is the S 10 that I've been using
for the purpose of this demonstration I
have the s 10 II over here on the right
and see I've added one single
fingerprint on this S 10 plus if I click
on there I can add another one now in
this case what I'm going to do is scan
in the same finger but the next time
around try to do it from diff
angles in order to improve the
ultrasonic recognition so I'm gonna go
ahead and just move my thumb around a
bit make sure you get those really flat
readings on the bottom part and then
also the edge readings on the top part
and now we have two fingerprints of the
same fingerprint now if I wanted to get
real crazy I could add this fingerprint
a third time this is the third reading
for the same finger in my experience it
just improves the accuracy and it
improves the unlock functionality of the
device some of you have mentioned it in
the comments I've even seen videos made
about it that you don't need to hold
your thumb on the fingerprint scanner
this is also true you can kind of lift
it off and it sort of makes it seem
faster than maybe you know you you might
have originally thought whether you lift
it off or not it's not really important
the point is you want it to work look
see see it's still it's still not a
hundred percent it still can miss from
time to time and say no match and there
is a pressure component to it based on
how hard you press down but nonetheless
it's still in my opinion not as good as
the capacitive fingerprint scanners that
have been on the back of these devices
in the past but it really improves the
in display fingerprint scanner to
register the same finger more than once
I recommend you do it and I recommend
you get all the edges of the finger to
improve the recognition there is the
added security with the ultrasonic
technology so these are gonna be tougher
to crack than the same or seemingly
similar scanner that exists on a device
like this the oneplus 60 that's just an
image of your fingerprint and for
whatever reason it won't let you
register the same finger more than once
little trick little hack I totally
forgot about it because the optical base
scanners that I had been using wouldn't
allow for it but it does work on the s
10 s 10 plus so go for it if you own one
of these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
