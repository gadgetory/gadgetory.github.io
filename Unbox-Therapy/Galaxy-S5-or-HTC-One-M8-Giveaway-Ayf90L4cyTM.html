another video and today we're in my car
which is unusual probably wondering what
exactly you're doing here well there's a
couple of different reasons we're in the
car right now first because it's a
little bit loud at my usual filming
location and so I needed some silence
and some tranquility to get this message
out second of all I'm testing out the
gh4 and this wide-angle lens on a
suction cup type of mount does a little
concerned at first that it wouldn't be
stable enough but it looks alright I
think it should hold up for this video
and possibly future videos but those
things aside I have a very special
important announcement that has forced
me into this filming scenario and that
is the fact that we're hosting a
giveaway it's been a long time since
we've had a giveaway and I've teamed up
with a good friend of mine David from
phone buff you've probably heard of him
and if not we should definitely go check
them out whether you're interested in
this giveaway or not the rules are very
simple they'll be linked down in the
description and it's gonna be your
choice between an HTC One m8
or Galaxy s5 from Samsung those are
obviously the two hottest phones on the
planet right now so it makes sense to
give away one of those two like I said
the rules are going to be down in the
description of this video but it's dead
simple all you need to do is make sure
you're subscribed to the both of us
leave a comment on both of our videos
his will be linked down in the
description that will give you two total
entries for your shot at winning we will
be announcing the winner two weeks from
now on social media so it'll be on my
Twitter account his Twitter account
Facebook Google+
I guess everywhere we have social media
so you're gonna want to make sure to be
following us there to find out if you
actually won and no spamming do not spam
the comments of either of the two videos
it'll be one comment per video otherwise
we will look to disqualify you so no
cheating
also with giveaways in the past I've
noticed that some scammers out there
like to pretend that they're myself and
go and send people messages saying oh
you've won this particular giveaway give
me all your information in your credit
card so I can ship it do not listen to
any of that the only people that win the
only winner will be the individual
mentioned on Twitter Facebook etc until
that has happened do not listen to
anyone claiming to be myself or claiming
to be David from phonebook okay that's
your warning there's always people
trying to take advantage out there and
I'm just trying to make you as aware as
possible not just for this giveaway but
for anything in the future if you ever
bump into these types of scammers
chances are it's not me it's not us
check out my Twitter account and follow
me on Twitter in the first place and
then therefore you will know for sure if
you happen to be the winner Wow that was
long-winded anyways that wraps up this
video thanks as always for watching guys
I do truly appreciate your viewership
and it's great to get a chance to give
back every so often whatever I can you
guys watch all kinds of consumer
electronics and Technology content here
on unbox therapy also on David's Channel
phone ba so to give someone an
opportunity to get a piece of high-tech
equipment without necessarily needing to
save up and buy themselves it's always
really cool to do and we couldn't do it
without the support of all of you
watching all the videos and all of our
videos my videos his videos so these
thanks as always for all of your support
make sure to leave a thumbs up down
below if you enjoyed this content thanks
as always for watching I guess I already
said that I'll catch you on the next
episode or maybe before we go I should
ask you real quick if you guys enjoy
this kind of communication here just
chillin driving around in the car some
of my thoughts etc because I've been
thinking for a while you know life is
hectic I've got you know sort of this
regimented style to how I'm making
content and it's nice to get out and
just share some informal thoughts in
this communication style right here I
just drive into the car now that I have
this amount theoretically we can do this
more often if you're into it so maybe as
a secondary note on this video let me
know down in the comments if that's
something you're interested in
we could you know just casually talk
about technology consumer electronics
things happening in the world other news
I don't know really anything there's
like a couple of pounds and then maybe
eventually we could put some guests over
in the passenger seat over there
hopefully the gh4 has been stable and
the quality looks good and the sound is
good so I don't need to really add
anything to this setup if so this would
be a really easy cool and instant way of
sharing my thoughts with you guys on a
more frequent basis all right now I'm
really going to get out of here we've
hit the record button because I don't
have all that much battery and I've been
recording for eight minutes all right
later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
