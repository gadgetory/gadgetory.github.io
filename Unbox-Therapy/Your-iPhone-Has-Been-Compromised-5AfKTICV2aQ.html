listen in on someone's phone without
even the person knowing it's not looking
good well you know Apple they've been
pointing fingers for a while a lot of
privacy talk recent tweet from Tim Cook
you know talking about privacy and then
the other thing happens the FaceTime bug
the bug of all bugs I mean there's bugs
that happen with smart phones software
but this one has gotten people's
attention because of the type of
invasion of privacy that takes place
someone can call you up via FaceTime and
without you picking up the call they can
hear what you're saying in advance of
you ever accepting the call
but also can view also can view if the
person hits the power switch during the
call to shut down the phone screen then
that enables the camera what a weird bug
how many people's lives have already
been ruined
when they're getting a call from someone
and then you just sit there and listen
for reason to change your relationship
status to single significant other
they're like oh geez maybe the boss at
work
Apple has turned off the group FaceTime
server group FaceTime is is shut down
until they can fix the software they're
just turning it off completely the
interesting thing with this story is
that Apple was alerted of this in
advance of the whole news breaking there
were smaller stories mm-hmm that kept
coming up it was this mist there's no
feedback now that doesn't really
surprise me so the reason that this is
interesting specifically is because it
is Apple obviously Apple already
garnering so much attention in this
space they've gone out of their way to
kind of accuse other manufacturers of
you know not being careful enough with
people's data our customers trust means
everything to us and we spent decades
working to earn that trust and anytime
you point fingers you leave yourself
open to more extreme criticism when the
finger swings back around it points at
you from my perspective anytime you have
like a big story like this you can't
help but have it impact your perception
of the product this exact type of flaw
could instill fear in people around
FaceTime as a product so am I gonna
second-guess pop and open FaceTime
absolutely I think other users will as
well you look at the Billboard I mean
what happens on your iPhone stays on
your iPhone that was that was Apple's
play at CES they leaned into the idea
that this was where they were better I
don't think it's anything nefarious I
don't think you know it was part of a
master plan to get access to phones
without people knowing my intuition is
that it's a mistake and mistakes happen
too
all big companies there have been
breaches Google had a breach recently
through Google+ they're just shutting
the whole thing down
as a consequence so anyone can be
impacted by this and it's a consequence
of us sharing more and being connected
more than we ever have before it's not
an excuse for it by any means it's
terrible we're gonna see more of this I
really believe it we're gonna see more
and more of this weird stuff going down
you know when people start to cover the
webcams on their laptops you see like
the webcam cover I mean we might see a
future in which some of these devices
might have Hardware shut offs to make us
feel comfortable that we actually have
privacy in certain moments a Google
assistant in the background you got the
the Alexis in the background look at
that Google just came up on the phone
when I said it like this one I'm talking
about and then you get the cameras
always looking at you could we see a
future in which hardware devices
actually have physical shutdowns
to instill confidence in users that they
can have a private moment at certain
times I know some people on Twitter
we're getting bombarded with unknown
calls and those people didn't even need
to be picked up to be granted access to
your to your life to the point where
they have to turn off their phones well
you could be anywhere you could be doing
anything
who knows what a guy like you gets up to
you don't want to know exactly so that's
the main thing that's the lesson learned
that's the moral of story today don't do
anything you wouldn't do if you were on
FaceTime because you probably are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
