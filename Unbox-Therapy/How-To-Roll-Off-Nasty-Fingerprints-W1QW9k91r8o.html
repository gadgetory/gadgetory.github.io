unique your fingerprint belongs only to
you that's kind of cool but they also
kind of suck let me tell you why police
will use them against you that's not
what I meant no they suck because on
your gadgets they get everywhere every
gadget company on the planet has a
glossy little surface this nasty kind of
Jack did this he marked this up
beforehand actually his hands did try to
talk to him about it
oh it's having fun he doesn't even he's
upset now today we're looking at
something called the eye roller liquid
free touchscreen display cleaner now
I've tried all the sprays I've tried all
the cloths microfiber this go with the
t-shirt everybody knows that move right
there I hate it well these guys look at
them oh hi we're the eye roller we're
here to solve your problem are you
though
are you really or does your product suck
is it all a lie is it a big marketing
Fiasco look at the image on the front
I'd click on that you clicked on this ha
ha it's kind of like a little almost
like a lint roller that you would use on
some clothing to remove Linens except
this one is targeted at fingerprints
it's pretty inexpensive but this is ooh
pull that off
sticky material moment of truth as you
guys know this thing now that's a
fingerprint magnet look at that
gross and as you know you take the cloth
in many cases even with the spray you're
just kind of like pushing the smudge
around sweaty eye roller comes in oh it
works even better on the iPad are you
seeing all that this thing actually
where have you been all my life I roller
I'll tell you my number-one concern at
this point is like how long does this
thing remain active and effective okay I
got a laptop here as well you're not
supposed to be touching the screen but
if you're a guy like Ryan sometimes you
forget that you just start let's see how
she fares Oh
why is that so satisfying just watching
those fingerprints die
all right last stop what if you just got
glossy gadgets you've seen this glossy
plastic on something you know what it
works but it's not as amazing as on the
glass is this gonna replace every cloth
and spray in your house no it's not but
man it's doing something what's your
Excuse now huh
