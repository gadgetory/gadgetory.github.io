me you you me Jack I started a challenge
ambitiously a few days ago giving up my
smartphone challenge and the challenge
was only seven days a week long that's
how long the challenge was is but I'm
quitting I'm quitting the challenge I
can't I've realized how much a
smartphone has become an extension of
your mind and how you really do feel
lacking inadequate without having access
to that thing
not that I know that already but like to
actually do it there's this overwhelming
fear to this point right now this moment
right now I have been using this
intentionally dumb phone instead of my
smart phone in the first couple days
I'll tell you sunshine and lollipops
rainbows and Here I am standing in the
line at Subway and I'm paying attention
to what's going on around me and I'm not
on my phone the whole time when I wake
up in the morning I'm not grabbing my
phone and laying in bed with my neck
cranked up against the headboard for 48
minutes when I have other things to do
but there was still this nagging feeling
it's the way we are now man it's the way
we are and it truly is an extension of
our consciousness whether we like it or
not and that little drip that you get
every time you engage with it and all
those emails that you can't see and all
that information and data that's flowing
that is so hard to turn off so I'm
quitting this dumb phone challenge I'm
not saying it was a bad idea how can I
get behind something and successfully
complete something that I know
so obviously partway through is simply
not gonna stick the rest of the universe
is moving along I mean you're getting
text messages and you're getting even
though I'm here with the text gosh I'm
like what am i doing I'm nervous what am
i doing I was getting texted links
what good is a lake without a browser
but I'm on the fringe to begin with in
what I do for a living I'm engaging and
interacting with the latest and greatest
stuff I'm on social media this entire
business this sculpt the reason you see
me and I see you is social media it's
embedded in this relationship there's a
phone like this have a place yeah I
think so
like I said there were those glimpses
those moments where I was happy to have
my time back and where I I realized that
I was watching things around me instead
of a screen yeah that that stuff did
happen that promise is real maybe this
is a device that you could take with you
on vacation take with you to special
events where you don't want to be
absorbed by your smartphone and I think
it probably is a good idea to unplug
whenever possible and this entire speech
sounds really intense maybe it is but we
have ventured into a realm an unexpected
connection that we now have to this this
virtual space and for better for worse
that's the direction we continue to move
so the stuff that this technology has
enabled for me on a personal level on a
business level that would otherwise be
unapproachable if it weren't for devices
like that not just in front of me but in
your pockets too and when you take a
moment like this to run what happened to
be a shorter term experiment that I
originally wanted you really start to
appreciate those opportunities so I quit
this dumb phone challenge and I'll be
putting my sim card
back into my Nexus 6p love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
