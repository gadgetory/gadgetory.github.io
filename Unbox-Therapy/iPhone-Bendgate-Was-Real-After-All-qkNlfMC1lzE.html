Dundas Square in downtown Toronto that's
because I want to put all this
conspiracy to rest with the bendgate
controversy I have a brand new iPhone 6
plus so should we do this
am i the Incredible Hulk am I a
bodybuilder guys am I a regular dude so
I woke up this morning I did the usual
get on to Twitter take a little scroll
see what's happening in the world of
technology I happened upon a tweet from
the verge what was the tweet exactly
internal documents reveal Apple knew the
iPhone 6 was more likely to bend in the
previous model man you guys have no idea
back when this happened this in front of
me here this this iconic moment in video
history day we're gonna be doing the
official iPhone 6 plus bend test I got
an iPhone 6 plus bent it and in the
video guide around 70 million views
right now it blew up I sort of dealt
with it on going from that point forward
from people online media outlets and
even people in real life you uh
you created this scenario sensationalism
but here's the thing
within there was apparently a little
more truth than many of you might have
thought the thing that's happening right
now is a court case because what
happened after the fact with this phone
something called touch disease and I
know many of you eventually experienced
it because I received the tweets and
emails Apple won't replace my phone or
they want to charge me this much and I
can't the top corner is no longer
responsive to touch now because of this
lawsuit Apple was forced to release
internal documents about their own
testing within those internal documents
Apple's own documents they admit to
knowing that the iPhone 6 and 6-plus
were substantially weaker than any model
they had made previous and more likely
to bend over seven times more likely a
lot of people looked at that video and
he said loser just you're just trying to
get some views right now I didn't know
it was gonna get 17 million views
alright I'd be lying if I told you that
but the motivation to make that video
was pure I got a message from my cousin
dude I was snow
yesterday I had the phone in my pocket I
didn't do anything to it it was just in
my pocket and he bent and he sent me
this message and I was like oh my
goodness this could be a big deal you
know if these things are as weak as I
think they are then there could be other
changes that happen internally other
problems now Apple has never publicly
admitted that this device is
particularly bendable they did
eventually admit the touch disease thing
but they said it was for some different
reason they said they needed a little
bit more epoxy around the logic board to
reinforce it well people don't know this
but before I ever published a video on
YouTube I actually repaired iPhones so I
had a little bit of knowledge you know
what goes on the internal workings of
these things that guy is probably crazy
what that youtuber he's a youtuber ha
but I had a feeling that something was
catastrophic ly wrong with this
particular design and so when the 6s
came out I really want to get to the
bottom of it I took the shell from the
6s and the 6 and I went to a laboratory
a place that could do elemental analysis
to tell you about the makeup of a
particular material and realized
immediately that in the 6s Apple had
created a whole new alloy we always had
this significant presence of zinc which
points to 7000 series aluminum they
added zinc to give it more stiffness you
mean you're gonna change the whole
material I thought only three people
were affected it's not what you heard
check wasn't it only three people so
when the touch disease stuff started
coming out I was like ah that little Ben
I know how hard it is to make this stuff
and to do it well you can't fix a
problem until you identify it
obviously there was upside for me with
it with a super popular video of course
but possibly to a certain extent that
video may be responsible for that
eventual alteration and you getting a
better product Emmy I have so much
respect for the individuals that spend
their time to create amazing machines
like these this channel probably
wouldn't exist without Apple that's how
much credit I'll give to Apple my
earliest video editing software Final
Cut Pro from whom Apple my laptop I'm
using right now from who Apple if all
ever did was come on here and tell you
what you already knew that everything
was great and that's all I ever said my
usefulness to you it goes down so when
you try to beat me into submission and
say you're just a hater how does that
serve you better
you can't fix something until you
identified the problem who knows how
this lawsuits gonna go these internal
documents now they at least say the
Apple knew this thing was substantially
over seven times more likely to bend in
their previous models they at least knew
that so it's up to people like me to get
you as close to the truth as we can
something like this it gives a little
bit of validation it didn't start from
some crazy chaotic place but let me see
if I can bend a phone and watch the
world burn that ain't where it came from
so you decide you want to believe the
press release fine
you want your own imaginary truth fine
but for me the reality has been exposed
and I feel like I was on the right side
of it and I feel like those of you that
were out there that trusted me a little
bit you were on the right side of it too
but I'm gonna keep trying to get closer
to the truth and I hope you guys keep
listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
