the almost unbelievable folding
smartphone saga there are two big
players right now of course Huawei with
the mate X device I said I was excited
about it I said I was even maybe
marginally more excited for it than the
Samsung Galaxy fold but then of course
Samsung had to go and release a brand
new video
brand new footage of the Galaxy fold and
I was like hmm maybe should i reconsider
my position on excitement on how much
excitement I have for each of the two
products go ahead Willie do roll the
clip this thing looks fresh this thing
looks slick so of course we've talked
about it in the past
Samsung has taken an unusual maybe an
unexpected approach to the folding phone
situation and they showed this off in
the keynote in a limited fashion but now
there's this new footage out there
showcasing the design spinning around
showing the hinge and more importantly
showing the difference between the
external screen when the device is
folded and the larger one when it's
unfolded and this video right here may
have just changed my mind on which of
the two folding smartphones is going to
be the one to get after all the fold is
the cheaper of the two devices this one
is said to retail for what was it will
1980 1980 not cheap by any means but
quite a bit cheaper than what Huawei
suggested for their mate X folding phone
so here you can see some different
colors of the device and it also
includes this a wireless shared charging
similar to what's been showcased on the
s10 s10 plus you can see the galaxy fold
charging up the earbuds the new Galaxy
buds as well as the watch and here's the
device folding and unfolding now one
thing I noticed in this extended footage
that's available to us now for the
Galaxy fold is that you can't see in any
of the images any kind of crease where
the device folds over now this might
have to do with the fact that the phone
bow
in words instead of around back like is
happening with the may X so I watched a
few more video clips on the mate X and
noticed that you can see a bit of a
wrinkle where the hinge portion is I
don't know how big of an issue that's
gonna be but it doesn't look to be
present when you're watching these more
detailed video clips of the Samsung
Galaxy fold now something to keep in
mind the Huawei clips that are out there
some of them user generated in weirdly
lit environments on a show floor at MWC
this clip right here comes from samsung
themselves so maybe they were very
careful about how to showcase their
particular device and maybe they were
able to avoid the look of a crease in
the center comparative to the huawei
mate X so what you're taking a look at
here in this portion of the clip they're
showcasing how an app can transition
from the clamshell form factor back up
to the full screen tablet ish mode and
it's it seems pretty seamless at least
in this clip again coming from Samsung
but the experience it looks pretty
seamless and the overwhelming feeling
looking at this device in this context
in this video is that this one just
feels a lot more like a finished product
now granted there are compromises that I
talked about Indy mate X video the
biggest being that in the clamshell mode
you have a relatively small display with
bezels a chin and a forehead but somehow
the narrowness of the device the the
overall package when you see it being
held it just feels like it kind of makes
sense yes it's a version one but I have
to say after looking at the more
extended footage
it has amped up my excitement even
further for the Galaxy fold I do believe
it will be the more polished of the two
products once they do become
commercially available and I'm starting
to think that this device might even be
more popular than originally expected
you can see here they're showcasing a
quick demo of a video conference where
the extra screen real estate can be
utilized
of course gaming
is another area that I think people will
be interested in Instagram is an
interesting example of how you can have
a totally different experience than what
you're used to on a phone with an app
that you're already familiar with I'm
sure we're gonna see more of this before
the device actually launches we still
have questions I still have questions
it's a folding phone it's expensive is
it gonna be for everyone how many units
can they possibly move and is the
implementation going to be compelling
enough when I finally get my hands on it
of course you're gonna find out here on
the channel but I have to say I have to
see in this clip right here can even
more hyped up I'm getting even more
excited this is the kind of tech that I
signed up for this is the future I'm
feeling it it's looking good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
