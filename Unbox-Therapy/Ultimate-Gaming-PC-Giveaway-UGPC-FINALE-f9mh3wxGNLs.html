you'll see the ultimate gaming PC
sitting beside me
of course the monitors and gaming
keyboard mouse etcetera are not with it
but if you happen to win this system you
will get the complete package of course
now for those of you that are new to the
channel you might not know that the
ultimate gaming PC is the culmination of
a crowdfunding project on IndieGoGo what
does that mean it means that individuals
contributed money in exchange for perks
in order to make this project possible
so as a result I've been racking my
brain trying to come up with a fair way
to do this giveaway because you know
obviously I've heard both sides of the
argument you've got the people who
contributed saying it should only be for
us you know only our name should be in
the draw because of the fact that you
know we contributed and other kids could
have and other people could have and
they didn't and then there's the other
side the other side of the argument
saying hey listen Lou we watch your
videos you know maybe we don't have a
credit card maybe we didn't have a means
to contribute but we should still get a
chance to win it as well
so I hear both sides of the argument and
and the reason I think there's been so
much of a delay on me actually giving it
away is just me not wanting to hate that
comes my way from whichever party feels
that they've been treated improperly so
I've just been trying to come up with a
good solution and I think I've got a
pretty good one that I would consider to
be fair and so the way we're gonna do
this giveaway of the ultimate gaming PC
is like this we're gonna have two groups
so there's the contributing group and
then there is the regular viewer group
if you're a contributor you don't need
to do anything else you've already got
your entry in to win the system so you
can just you know chill out until the
announcement but if you're not a
contributor then I don't know who you
are and you haven't identified the fact
that you want to win it as a regular
viewer so if that's you then you better
leave a comment down below right now you
probably also want to hit that thumbs up
button because you're probably a fan of
this ultimate gaming PC but leave a
comment down below that says ultimate
gaming PC or ug PC or both I don't
really care but make sure it says one of
those two things so I know that you
followed the instructions the next thing
that I'm going to do is pick one winner
from each
the two parties okay so one winner from
the regular commenters and then another
winner from the original contributors
then there will be a coin flip between
both parties now I need to talk directly
to contributors on this I know there's
about 250 of you out there you might be
saying right now well I don't like the
way that sounds it doesn't sound like I
have a good chance of winning actually
you have an amazing chance of winning I
toyed around with the idea of giving
contributors like 50 entries or
something like that but this is actually
even better odds because what it means
is that you've got a 1 in 250 chance of
getting to the showdown round where
you'll have a 50/50 shot at winning
whereas if you were just pooled in with
all the commenters I'm I'm assuming that
this video is gonna get somewhere
between you know 15 and 20,000 comments
maybe more then the likelihood of you
winning goes down significantly so your
odds are amazing considering the fact
that you were a contributor that's what
I wanted to do just improve your odds
for going one step further and
contributing one more word for you
contributors out there I know a lot of
you guys bought the t-shirt perk in
which you know in exchange I think it
was 30 bucks or something you got you
know your your t-shirt or whatever the
t-shirt that we hadn't that we had
designed but we hadn't manufactured yet
hadn't printed yet well those shirts are
now in print right now or in printing
right now they're at the facility
getting completed and they're gonna be
ready for pickup on Wednesday I'm gonna
be out of town for a couple of days but
my boy will is gonna pick them up he's
gonna send me photos and I'll make those
public to you guys so you know hey these
things are done and as soon as I return
from my trip I'll be shipping those out
to you guys so don't panic tee-shirt
perk people you will be getting your
shirts really soon and and I've seen a
sample and they look like they're going
to be amazing so definitely stick around
for that we actually ended up printing
two shirts so there's the one I need
therapy shirt that you guys have seen
and then there's another we'll do design
that's of course will the intern for
those of you that don't know who that is
anyway he did his own design and we
decided to get those printed as well so
there should be some new shirts for
people to purchase that weren't weren't
lucky enough to get in on the perk when
it happened anyways enough about the
shirts so that covers a couple of things
couple of important things
next thing I want to say is that we will
be closing this whole thing off on
Tuesday so I'm filming this and
uploading it on Saturday the day before
the Super Bowl and I won't be doing a
live stream on Sunday like I normally do
because of the Super Bowl everyone's
gonna be watching it instead I'm gonna
move my usual livestream to Tuesday and
we'll do it Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. Eastern
and I'll do the time conversions down in
the description so Tuesday at 7:00 p.m.
Eastern time is when I will announce the
winner of the biggest prize we've ever
given away on unbox therapy the ultimate
gaming PC so I'm really excited about
that I hope you guys are too and I hope
you understand where I'm coming from
just about you know how hard it was to
find a fair way of doing this thing and
the reason that the whole thing's been
delayed it's a it's really actually
taking its toll on me there's been a lot
of stress just trying to come up with
you know the right way of doing this
thing and not trying to upset anybody
because it's never fun when you get all
kinds of haters yelling at you for
whatever reason nobody likes that so I
hope you guys can you know show me some
sympathy on that and show your support
with the thumbs-up button down below
because it has been a fair amount of
stress getting this thing finished and
now obviously picking a winner so
anyways I'll recap real quick if you
weren't a contributor on the project get
your comment in down below that says ug
PC or ultimate gaming PC in it if you
were a contributor you don't need to
worry about anything all you need to do
is show up on Tuesday to find out if
you've won which you know cry cross your
fingers because I know it's a pretty
intense giveaway and other than that
like I said before perks around their
way to those of you that haven't got
them yet we're gonna get everything
sorted out and I'll probably even do a
recap video after I return just to you
know talk about what happened what went
down during the live show Tuesday at 7
the link to my live show is going to be
down below my face in the description
you can get a head start right now click
on that link and log in so you're ready
to go when the live show happens like I
said before it's 7 p.m. Eastern on
Tuesday today is Saturday at least at
the point that I'm filming this and what
else yes I guess I'll see you there if
you guys have any questions or you're
worried about missing that live show
then
you can follow me on Twitter which I
recommend most do you do I'm at unbox
therapy and the last thing this has been
long-winded the very last thing is I'm
going to let you roll out on the credits
from the ultimate gaming PC project
where you'll see the names of everybody
who contributed and made this project
possible so sit sit down right now and
you can you can see your name if you
happen to be one of those contributors
thanks to everybody who made this
project possible and I'm sorry for the
extension on it as I said before it's
been just a difficult kind of thing to
wrap up and I'm just trying my best to
do it in the fairest way possible
