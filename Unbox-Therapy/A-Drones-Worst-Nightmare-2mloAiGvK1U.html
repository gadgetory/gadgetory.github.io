all right people
I'm out here at the University of
Ontario Institute of Technology I mean
the eighth wind tunnel I'm feeling a
beautiful wind today we're going to find
out how much wind it takes to kill a
drone let's check it out your nut is hat
off Oh
Oh
oh man I think if it hadn't kept going
up this would have been my body slammed
against here this is what I would have
look like if he kept going out with my
poor I got flattened out that was how
high did you get up to you've got 200
100 kilometer an hour winds right in
there it's amazing it creates like this
essentially this tunnel of wind out here
these people are all safe put your step
right in here where that wall begins
boom so the question is when it comes to
the drone that we're about to throw in
here it's a DJI phantom4 it's like at
what point do all of its systems for
stabilization give up completely what
point at what type of wind speed you get
slamming against that back great but
we're here to find out
and she's downing their insanity here
what's up brother
oh right now when I cross over that line
you can see the seat up there 13
kilometers an hour no problem
13 stabilizing themselves easily here we
go we're going to jack it up
I probably shouldn't stand behind it ha
ha ha ha this is what the drone is
seeing right now
17 oh it starting to dance around a
little bit now so stabilize still
beautiful at 19 20 20 kilometers per
hour you know heart of the storm
baby 23 still kicking Oh
and I thought you were ready to give up
amazingly stable
we're almost at 30 kilometers an hour
now
whoa 40 I'm getting kicked out right now
ha ha get eNOS go yeah oh boy I'm gonna
pull it out real quick
whoa this is out here 50 it's our new
shop again what do you say do we jump
back in Oh
53
ah-ho-ho miss Nikki dies in it out we
can battling it out Jorgen us go rescue
jump pretty salad I mean come on brother
holy look at it I got one propeller over
here this one busted but otherwise the
battery popped out the cameras okay you
might have some life left in it what was
that at what would you see what was the
speed about 60 right yeah if you're
diving in 60 kilometer an hour winds
you're going to have a tough time
keeping controllers today I did it a few
times oh I told Vince hold out what do
you say Jack we got a wing cuddle up to
150 kilometers an hour now we repaired
the drone replace some components I'm
going to try to dive in there which is
drone and see what happens or inspection
check out how powerful is windy give me
an idea what kind of wind we're working
with you
laughs and yourself got the optimal
environment for drone horsing out this
because of beating the first time it's
probably don't be a whole different type
speeding gonna put my pilot skills to
the test
oh we run easy
right
there we go
no match for 150 150 km/h but it did do
quite well up to about 15 kilometers an
hour which I was impressed by me yeah if
you see is it's all black now what I
think it was pretty impressive all the
systems were at play try it it's best
let's go check it out come on oh so the
damage is a little more severe this time
once again a couple of propellers bit
the dust the leg this was all both legs
got a little bit crunch oh the camera
where's the camera it never got a little
bit ripped off this is so real testing
right here alright and that's a
scientific truthfully courtesy of this
really cool facility here the wind
tunnel at University of Ontario
Institute of Technology check it out so
big shout out to them for having us in
here and now you know can you fly your
drone in wind yes certainly a little bit
of window problem you step up to 100
plus km/h and your drone might end up
looking like this shout out to DJI cool
stuff man I was really impressed
balancing itself that's time for the
next one what do you guys want to see me
doing here next let me know in the
