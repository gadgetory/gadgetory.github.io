and today we're taking a look at the WD
live wire now what this device does is
it turns your pre-existing power
connections in your household into a
network it allows you to get internet
over your power lines pretty crazy stuff
now you're probably saying dude just get
a Wi-Fi router haven't you heard about
that yes I've heard about that in fact I
got many of them but this is actually
going to serve a very specific purpose
for me my console my ps3 has been giving
me issues on Wi-Fi it's almost out of
reach and this is hopefully going to
give me a more reliable connection using
the power lines something closer to a
wired connection now since my ps3 isn't
anywhere near my router and I don't
really feel like running a long-ass
gigabit cable down there this is going
to give me similar results with a lot
less hassle plus it's going to give me
four ports the equivalent of running for
cables anyway let's talk about the
unboxing here you see we got an
installation disk I am NOT going to use
that if I don't have to and here's our
secondary box one box goes on each end
of the connection so one near the router
and one near the ps3 or whichever device
you hope to connect and we also got a
couple of power cables here after all we
got to make this live wire live so
here's one of those gigabit cables they
look to be about three feet long we've
got an on and off switch on each unit as
well as four gigabit ethernet port so
you can connect a bunch of devices on
the other end and a sync button that I
didn't have to use these things worked
right out of the box i just plugged them
in and that was it the live wire was
alive we got some LED indicators on the
front as well so this will give you guys
a better idea of how it hooks up you put
one end into the power connection near
your router the other one near the
device you want to hook up you cannot
put it into a power bar it's got to go
straight in the wall and then you
connect your devices and bingo internet
everywhere hopefully this thing works
real well I'm obviously going to let you
guys know if you got a console that's
giving you issues on Wi-Fi this might be
your solution as always guys thanks for
watching and if you don't mind give
like in a favorite after all it's those
likes and favorites that help to promote
me and that's what keeps his content
coming you know the more fans I get no
more I can make blah blah blah you heard
it all anyway guys until next time see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
