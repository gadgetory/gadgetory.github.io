a weird name for a notebook but it's
because it implies something incredibly
unusual for a notebook this notebook
goes in the microwave how many times am
I gonna say notebook in this video I
don't know put a counter down below why
would you want to put a notebook in the
microwave Lou oh I don't know because it
erases everything in it let that
percolate you get yourself a fresh
notebook fill it up with all your notes
and then you're done
stick it in the microwave set it forget
it
pull it out it's an empty notebook it's
crazy maybe you're writing your diary
and your guy like Jack and you're
talking about weird stuff delete the
evidence send handwritten notes to your
favorite cloud services so if you do
want to keep those notes you can save
them to the cloud and then erase your
notebook in the microwave and reuse it
start all over again
genius your microwave must contain a
rotating glass turntable mine has it
fill a coffee mug 3/4 full with water
you place it on the circle on top of the
notebook you let it run flip your book
you do it on the other side and then you
got an empty notebook how gangster is
that a regular Pablo Escobar
wonder if he had a notebook er I don't
remember how much this is but if you
think about it what should you really
pay for a notebook that never runs out
the infinity notebook oh it's actually
pretty nice Wow look at those pages a
little QR scanner in the bottom that's
for saving particular pages to the app
whoo it looks fancy it's a pilot ball
friction nothing like some ball friction
Wow
it's just a normal pen oh it's erasable
it's an erasable pen let's do a test
there once was a man named Jack
there's Jack Jack the elephant jack was
a sad man
no body liked Jack even more sad one day
Jack died Jack's looking like a some
kind of seal there the world rejoiced
so balloon by the way yay it's because
Jack's dead finally they're happy
finally that he's making everybody sad
longer though let's just scribble on one
two on the backside of one that's
probably what your notes look like I'm
guessing this is where the mug goes oh
shout out to they're called printerpix
so check them out I guess they do custom
mugs microwave your wave until the blue
rocket logo inside the white circle
disappears that wave logo is going to
disappear the anticipation is intense
right here
it smells like popcorn in here Jack like
this moment of truth here
okay 30 seconds is up oh the logo is
still on there
let's do a minute oh the logos gone
let's flip this baby over and let's do
uh I think 45 is probably sufficient
whoa that is so weird there's like a
little bit of butter there I think
there's leftover butter in the microwave
is the truth
and whether or not this is actually the
infinite notebook I mean it's pretty
damn faded I got to be honest that is
cool haha even this page where I was
like super junky with it to give you an
idea like this is what an actual pen
stroke looks like see what I mean like
comparatively speaking it faded it a lot
is it the infinite notebook probably not
but it's definitely going to be good for
like five six maybe even ten uses but
then if you include the digital aspect
with the app and the ability to save
your
notes I guess maybe in that sense it is
the infinite notebook because those
could go on forever otherwise look at
this even dead jack it's pretty much
done maybe I would have been more
interested in school if I could put my
notebook in the microwave although
sweating tears you were like a plus
please and then you're like nuke it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
