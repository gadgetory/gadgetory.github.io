got a top 5 video for you these are the
best Android devices of 2013 but there's
a little twist they're chosen by you
this is an audience decision I asked you
guys on Twitter Facebook and Google+ not
only which devices you like best but
then I got you to vote on the top 5
suggestions so without giving too much
away let's go ahead and count down the
top 5 Android devices of 2013 coming in
at number 5 with a total of 33 votes
collectively is the LG g2 with a large
5.2 inch display 1080p resolution and
also a very big 3000 milliamp hour
battery it's easy to understand why the
LG g2 is in this particular list it's
got a quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor
which as you probably know is one of the
best in the business two gigabytes of
RAM and a 13 megapixel camera another
thing worth noting a little honorable
mention is the Nexus 5 which is not out
yet but is rumored to be very similar to
the LG g2 so it might not be in this
list currently but if you are buying a
device after its release you may want to
consider the Nexus 5 as well coming in
at number four we have one of my current
favorites the Moto X with a total of 55
votes collectively this device on paper
doesn't have the greatest specifications
but I think part of the appeal here is
the user experience it has an OS very
similar to stock Android and the
industrial design is once again one of
my favorites it has a 4.7 inch display
which i think is sort of that sweet spot
in terms of display size it is only 720p
it's got a 2200 milliamp hour battery a
dual-core Snapdragon s4 pro 2 gigabytes
of RAM and a 10 megapixel camera which
by the way just received a new software
update which should improve some of the
results are getting out of the Moto X
camera so there you have it Moto X at
number four coming in at number three
with 65 votes is the incredibly
successful Samsung Galaxy s4 this is a
5-inch device sporting a 1080p display
it's also got a 2600 milliamp hour
battery a quad-core Snapdragon 600
processor not quite up to speed
with the newly released snapdragon 800
but still incredibly capable it's got
two gigabytes of RAM and a 13 megapixel
camera which in great lighting
conditions produces some of my favorite
images to come out of a smartphone so
that covers numbers three through five
but what about the top two devices well
we actually had something interesting
happen we've got a tie with a total of
139 votes for both of these devices you
can probably guess what they are the HTC
One and the newly released galaxy note 3
these two devices at the top of the list
are actually quite different with the
note 3 being significantly larger than
the HTC One so there will likely be
different buyers for each of these two
devices though I'd assume you'd be
satisfied with either the HTC One sports
a 4.7 inch display with a 1080p
resolution making it the most pixel
dense phone in this particular countdown
it's also got a 23 hundred milli amp
hour battery not the largest here a
quad-core Snapdragon 600 which is the
same processor as the Galaxy s4 it has
two gigabytes of RAM and a unique 4
megapixel ultra pixel camera now this
camera is quite a bit different from the
others in this list obviously sporting a
much lower megapixel count but there's a
reason for that
HTC opted for larger pixels to improve
low-light performance so depending on
the type of cell phone photographer that
you are this may be a great choice if
you take a lot of low-light photography
but if you're looking for great pictures
in you know great lighting conditions
outdoors etc then you might want to look
elsewhere to get some improved
resolution as you probably know the HTC
One has some of the nicest Hardware of
any of the devices currently available
it's mostly constructed of brushed
aluminum so that leaves the spec
champion in this particular list and
what is likely the spec champion in the
entire Android universe also with 139
votes the Galaxy Note 3 this sports a
gigantic 5.7 inch display once again at
1080p resolution it's also got the
largest battery in the group with a 3200
milliamp power rating it has the
quad-core Snapdragon
800 it's got three gigabytes of RAM once
again at the top and a 13 megapixel
camera very similar to the camera on the
galaxy s4 now the note 3 might not be
for everyone especially if you've got
small hands or are looking for a
one-handed device but if you want the
top-notch specifications in the Android
world right now you will likely be
considering the Galaxy Note 3 alright
guys that wraps up this top 5 list as
chosen by you if you enjoyed this

if the YouTube audience is the same as
the Facebook Google+ and Twitter
audience if you guys want to participate
in polls like this in the future make
sure to follow me on one of the three
social networks available or all of them
it's up to you the links will be down in
the description to make your life a

we will do more user-generated content
in the future so before we close out
today's video I want to give another big
shout out to Squarespace for helping
make this content possible what you're
looking at right now is the official
unbox therapy dot-com website which is
built using Squarespace that's right I'm
not talking about a service that I don't
personally use I put together a website
I'm really happy with using the tools
over on squarespace.com and you can do
it too it's probably the easiest way
online to get a website up and running
incredibly fast you can do all kinds of
stuff like put a photo gallery you can
put a store in there if you want to sell
merchandise like we do we have a couple
of t-shirts up on there and there are
plenty of different templates to choose
from so no matter what look you're going
for in one night you can pretty much set
something up maybe even faster than a
night I mean it took me a night or two
but if you're really quick with this
kind of stuff you could probably do it
even faster and I've got even better
news for you if you want to try out the
service it's completely free no
obligation head over to squarespace.com
slash unbox as I said before guys this
is a service that I use this is what my
website is built on so I'm obviously a
big huge fan and you
probably will be - alright that wraps up
this video right here thanks as always
for watching and I'll catch you on the
next episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
