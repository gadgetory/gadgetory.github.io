about laptops tablets form factors
thinkpads ipads all the pads MacBooks
I'm really curious about what's
happening in that space that computing
space you probably caught my x1 carbon
video in which I was raving about the
keyboard experience in search of the
ultimate keyboard experience but lenovo
also sent over their more modern
ambitious kind of computing products
which is this the x1 tablet gen 3
touchscreen it can fold bend it's a
tablet it's a laptop it's confused in a
good way my main question here is can
this thing do both can it be the best of
both worlds can you get a little bit of
ThinkPad a little bit of keyboard along
with a little bit of touch to create
some sort of a solution in between a
traditional laptop and something like an
iPad or a surface product classic box
black red white ooh
nice little unboxing experience you see
it lifts up well done we lift out the
device it's in wow that is thin that's
only part of it I'm guessing that is
crazy thin course we have a crazy thing
keyboard deck as well this is what I was
saying that Apple should have done with
the keyboard for the iPad hard plastic
with the connector but then a real
keyboard experience and this is very
similar actually to x1 carbon laptop
keyboard experience except the travels a
little bit less this is of course
thinner but you still have your trackpad
smooth trackpad you have the track point
because it is a think pad after all and
you have these nice tactile keys this is
definitely a more comfortable place than
the keyboard attachment for the iPad pro
which was one of the reasons I
eventually got fed up
with that device as a daily only kind of
device because of input via the keyboard
attachment okay so over here is gonna be
the display right right
who it is so the display but also a
tablet as you can tell and it has a
kickstand unit that's how it stands up
right this is very reminiscent of the
surface products this comes down
attaches and there you go that's kind of
what your layout looks like you can see
the aspect ratio that display a little
bit taller which a lot of people happen
to like for productivity also the
keyboard deck gives you the angle typing
via some magnets as well so that's
another thing that you look for now as
far as angles to choose from on the
display you can work it all the way down
to almost flat or you can have it all
the way up for almost up right now all
of your i/o is on the screen portion of
the device you can see we have a couple
type-c connectors with the Thunderbolt
logo as well you have a full-size
headphone jack this looks like a SIM
card slot over here you have a power
switch and a dedicated volume rocker as
well and I'm curious maybe we'll can
clarify for me but this looks like a
fingerprint scanner right here it is
it's a fingerprint scanner and you can
use that to login whether you have the
keyboard attached or not so it's a qHD
IPS display of course it supports
multi-touch as you'd expect now you can
get this with Intel's
eighth generation processors either Core
i5 or Core i7 let me quickly look at the
other items in the box here I'm going to
slide this to the side ooh of course we
have the pen it does come with a pen
fairly portable little 65 watt power
brick which hooks up to this extension I
like the little red touch on the pen
then you know it's ThinkPad got the
origin story in the color scheme now the
pen itself has a clip on it as well as
two buttons if I'm talking strictly from
a hardware perspective
I'm already
feeling better about this than the pixel
slate it just it feels a bit more
finished a bit less flimsy now the
display has a fairly large bezel it's
worth noting on the sides as well as the
top it does give you a place to grip
when you're using it in tablet mode but
of course you would always love to have
more display in a smaller form factor
like a lot of these devices it's of
course kind of top-heavy because all
your components are housed in this part
of the unit and nothing down here so the
keyboard portion is very light down here
when you close the whole unit up this is
what you end up with it is a slim
package compared to the regular x1 it's
maybe even thinner I don't know can you
tell Jack it is it's a touch thinner the
laptop model has a bigger display it's a
14-inch display on this unit
so obviously the keyboard deck on the
laptop it's gonna be flat there's no
nice little angle that you can achieve
it just doesn't have that functionality
but the keys themselves yeah I mean
they're nicer they're nicer on the
laptop by a touch so one of the things
that happens you get some flex in the
keyboard unit when you have it in this
bent up position don't know if that bugs
you a lot or a little it kind of affects
the sound as well and get that kind of
vibe to it myself I might just keep it
down for that reason yes I would keep it
down for that reason this feels solid no
flex slightly less travel I guess but
man it's a pretty good substitute for a
convertible tablet slash keyboard
attachment style device this is probably
the best keyboard that you can get
anyhow so this one gives you the touch
input it gives you the pen it gives you
the ability to kind of peel this off and
go straight into a tablet type of
functionality of course it's a bit large
as a tablet when it came to the iPad on
day to day use I was actually a fan of
the 11
inch version because it felt really
comfortable as a tablet on the couch
whereas I feel like this one is more on
the desk first productivity first and
then this you know to kick back every so
often these pen based keyboard style
inputs are really interesting to me
I hadn't invested a lot of time in them
but now that I've paid a little bit more
attention to what's going on in this
space there is something nice about
having a good keyboard attached to a
touch interface where you kind of have
this two-stage thing going on where
sometimes you're just interacting with
the pen going through emails or so on
and then you put the pen down and you
can really get some stuff done when it
comes to text input I think that's a
nice little balance going on there okay
in terms of the SSD you can get either
256 or 512 gigabytes it's gonna come
with 8 gigabytes of RAM from the factory
that's the only option in that
department this is kind of interesting
look at this you you load up YouTube not
even logged in like I'm not logged into
this laptop at all and I mean you see
the cat video there in trending and you
start to figure some things out about
how you should be spending your time
what you should be watching the
important stuff that's out there of
course I'm talking about 8 burger
gadgets put to the test
you didn't nobody saw it coming
I'm worried guys speakers are not great
ya know the speakers aren't doing it
guys I think overall it's it's a little
bit of the best of both worlds
I've been talking a lot about keyboards
because it was really the thing with the
iPad that made me want to go back to a
laptop this is for sure the best
keyboard attachment that I've used of
course you still have the pen you still
have the tablet if you need it you have
a lot of interface options here
including Thunderbolt you have every
angle you could possibly want you have
to think pad brand name you have a
fairly large trackpad all of a sudden
you're giving Microsoft a run for their
money with the surface products now I
wish it had a
a magnet can you ask for everything I
mean what have been nice to have a
magnet instead you get this guy you get
a little pen holder how does this work
like that and then what where does this
go Oh oh wow okay that's not terrible
it's not a magnet but it's not terrible
I could I could I could live with that
actually now that I think about it you
put the ThinkPad heritage you put the
keys in oh my goodness we got something
going on guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
