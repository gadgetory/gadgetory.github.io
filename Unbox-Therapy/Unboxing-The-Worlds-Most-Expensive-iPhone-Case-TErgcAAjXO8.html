maybe I don't know maybe a year ago now
I got hit up by these guys a company
called Bray and it was around the time
that the iPhone 6s launched and they
said we've got this super high-end
luxury bumper case for the iPhone oh you
know you should probably be sending that
to unbox therapy so I could show the
world what it's about now
they got back in touch with me and said
that they stepped the game up even
further they said this one's even more
luxurious than the last one and now is
for the iPhone 7 plus so in front of me
I have the latest and greatest from Bray
what kind of price you expect to pay for
something so limited well the one in
front of me there's only a hundred of
them in the world it's plated in 24
karat gold and this thing retails for
$1,000 in other words more potentially
than the iPhone 7 plus that you're going
to put inside of it but of course you're
a baller so you don't care that doesn't
affect you you kidding me I'll get what
2,000 thousand dollars dropped out of
your pocket on the way to work today
what was that thing they said about Bill
Gates Bill Gates make so much money he's
worth so much money
that if he dropped a hundred dollars in
the ground it would cost him more to
stop and pick it up than to get to the
actual place that he was going so he
could keep earning at the rate that he
was earning essentially he's making more
than a hundred dollars a second it was
something like that since there's so
many people in the audience who are just
like Bill Gates today I have for you the
one thousand dollar iPhone 7 plus bumper
here we go the experience is luxurious
from the get-go here to our dear
customers see that Jack you better be a
dear customer for a thousand bucks us
the person who follows the crowd will
usually go no further than the crowd you
hear that even the container it comes in
is made out of aluminum machined
you hear that sound effect when that
thing opens up here you go I'm gonna do
it one more time please watch it oh the
very end parts like Shing Wow look at
that
aerospace grade titanium and then plated
in 24 karat gold so there's a bumper
right there now if you're not using it I
guess you can put it back in this
wonderful case now you're looking at it
wondering what's with this what's this
extra piece okay so the way this works
is a friction fit so it doesn't really
affect your device at all these little
liners protect the device from getting
scratched or anything and so you get a
snug fit the titanium gold-plated piece
slides on afterwards now I'm noticing
here I've got number twenty four out of
a hundred and then on this side I can
see it says grade five titanium a
high-end grade aerospace grade this
brings me back to when I was
investigating the aluminum on the iPhone
6 that bent and then the difference
between it and the 6s and I got into the
whole world of aluminum braid so anyway
yes there are different grades different
metals you have grade five titanium in
this bumper all right so I do have an
iPhone and I've got me matte black
version here so we're going to put the
liner pieces on first just line those up
like this and then grab the correct
bumper piece and you want to slowly
slide that on and there you go kind of
reminds me of like a stealth bomber the
way they have those edges coming through
they're just like that my friend
you now have a very special I phone
seven plus and no one's gonna mistake
their iPhone for your iPhone once you
got this on there oh my goodness and
it's going to give it some protection as
well as I said titanium is grade five it
should be stronger than many other
metals now you still have access to all
your button actually the lock switch
feels pretty nice in there you got a
nice little groove to hold on to maybe
that's where you're supposed to hold it
you put the thumb right up in there I
don't know what mean let's be honest
like this is a it's a statement it's not
it's not practical a thousand dollar
case is not cracked
call the sane about practicality you're
talking about practice
no that's problem okay that might be my
first allen iverson reference ever on
unbox therapy this is for people who
have everything and want more and are
running out of things to spend money on
so if you want to stand out if you want
people to know that you are ballin out
of control
then gray has you covered you just won
the game a game of light</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
