make a gear video to show you guys some
of the gear that we brought with us to
CES 2013 you guys may recognize AJ if
you don't this is your introduction AJ
meet the audience not interested me AJ
give AJ a thumbs up down below alright
this is debut anyway enough about that
we're gonna go very quickly because we
brought a lot of gear to CES well not as
much as last year but still a lot to get
through in a relatively short video so
let's go ahead and get started with me
real quick before I jump inside the bag
and show you guys all them tech goodies
I want to let you know that I had the
opportunity to interview the CEO and
founder of MakerBot while I was at CES
this year it was an awesome opportunity
the video is not on my channel it's
actually over on what's trending I was
helping them out with a couple pieces of
content hit the link in the description
go check out this interview it's really
cool all right back to the gear review
so you want me to backpack I went with a
messenger this is a 10 bub egg so it's a
camera bag there's a camera insert that
you can use with it a couple different
ways to get inside so zipper if you got
to be quick and sneaky velcro you need
to see the whole interior this so
anyways let's go ahead and get straight
into it real quick you can see a couple
pouches here probably there you go micro
USB cable you got to have those and
moleskin notebook special moleskin pen
as well taking notes is never a bad idea
or maybe some pattern usually it's not a
bad idea over in this pocket the new
Samsung Galaxy camera running Android
this is an awesome device for uploading
quickly so say for example it's an
Instagram photo that you want to take
and share some of my Instagram photos
came from this device right here since
it has a SIM card slot in it you can
upload over the cell network we were
lucky enough to be provided this camera
from Telus and they also provided a SIM
card so we can upload straight away over
LTE while in Vegas big shout out to tell
us
I'll put their Twitter down below you
can tell them you love them as well next
device over here on the other side in
this other pocket zoom h2n this is an
awesome recording device for audio I do
my voiceovers I record all kinds of
audio using this thing I can do
it can do just directly in front it can
do a mid side pattern it has a line in
if you want to use it with a lav mic
takes a regular SD card and regular
double-a batteries so that means that
you're never really gonna be without
power you can always find double-a
batteries no matter where you are it's
also got a USB you can use it as a USB
mic quickly I want to tell you guys you
probably think I'm going real fast but
trust me we have - there's so much stuff
one thing I want to tell you guys if
you're interested in any of the products
we're talking about I'm going to link as
many as I can find down in the
description I'll try to find the best
price so you can find out more info down
there if I'm not covering absolutely
everything next we have headphones that
I'm always talking about these are the
XP 500s from Sony lightweight you could
wear them all day long they have great
low-end performance and they're not too
expensive definitely check out the link
on these most you guys know I'm always
talking about them but check out the
description for more info on those I
pretty much talk about this mouse in the
exact same way this is the performance
MX from Logitech it's been my go-to
mouse forever in fact I think I need to
get another one get some better battery
life
awesome Mouse tiny little receiver tons
of buttons and lots of precision so a
great little Mouse to travel with I have
this little road case here that's
because inside of here I have my Road
lav mic and I really love this lab mic
actually it's tiny you barely see it and
it has adjustable tips so you can pick
different tips depending on you know
what you're recording or what you're
recording into in terms of an audio
interface right now I have the mini jack
on there but you can also put an XLR tip
lots of other things once again link
will be down below I also keep some SD
cards in that case as well
oh this was actually not in my bag but
this is important this this was in my
bag I took it out real quick and I
should have put it back in this is the h
x9 v do a lot of shooting on this as
well guys know I'm a big fan Sony has
some amazing optical image stabilization
and when you're shooting video with a
point-and-shoot
that's important because you don't have
a lot to grip on to this has amazing
image stabilisation shoots 1080p at 60
frames or 30 frames in awesome solution
for covert shooting you know lightweight
shooting has a wicked stereo mic as well
I'm a huge fan of the HX 90 there are
numerals right now but if you can find
this one it's still a great value
they HX xx and HX xxx that replaced it
are more or less identical although the
30 ads Wi-Fi as I understand it bones
let's talk about phones you guys a lot
of you guys already know this this is my
go-to right now this is the Nexus 4 and
IMAX absolutely loving it lately I love
the form factor
I love the design really sleek slim easy
to use I also had this with me this is
the note 2 this has a massive battery so
for conferences conventions all they use
power use this is hard to beat right now
because of that massive battery I rarely
had to charge it this was this was
rocking my old phone number I was I was
managing a couple different phone
numbers which was a bit of a headache
it's forwarding some phone calls anyway
I carried two devices just to be safe so
the Nexus for my daily driver and the
massive battery on the note 2 which you
know it's also nice to have a big screen
when you don't have a laptop near you
because it's gonna give you you know
sort of a poor Oh immersive experience I
just dropped the I just dropped the the
HX 9 feet but check it out it's in this
wicked Pelican case which which is gonna
protect it just even a baby bed maybe
bidding maybe will need to get the newer
model now anyway pelican 1010 saving
lives everyday or not external hard
drive what is this a terabyte or
something like that yeah I think so so
little external hard drive you can never
have too many of those I'm running out
of spots to put stuff more stuff is
gonna fall double-a batteries you got to
have double-a batteries once again for
the 8 h2n that I mentioned earlier that
takes W values so do other things we got
more micro USB cables some business
cards these are sweet these little
balconies yeah totally recommend these
things right here you've got three power
outlets and you have two USBs on the top
it's protected it's a surge protector
it's portable and then this little thing
rotates too so if you want to go
horizontal or vertical depending on
where you're trying to plug this in this
is smart protect your electronics more
than going straight into the outlet plus
you get two USBs how are you going to
lose
and three when you're at a convention
it's hard to come by power outlets yep
so you need a multiplier you need a
multiplier what else I got
oh right here this is from new Trent
this is a massive battery backup
it's the InP 120 d two USB ports can
recharge your phone like five six seven
times I don't even remember it's a huge
battery in here full details down in the
description like everything else I've
got an extra card reader an extra
battery charger sunglasses you guys have
seen me in these babies before anything
else I believe that's it and of course
my laptop which is actually over there
and I'm using it right now to download
something so it's not in my actual bag
but it would be here and it's actually
an older generation 28 2011 MacBook Pro
that I have upgraded in a certain way
and I don't want a part yet with so
that's that's still my daily driver in
terms of laptops so that lives over
there on my desk at the moment hooked up
to Thunderbolt it's doing stuff right
now so trust me it's there trust me I
brought it okay AJ I'm done dude I'm
done I almost broke the camera it was a
lot went on but we got through it
alright let's check out what AJ brought
down to CES 2013 alright my bags a
little bigger
it's the 511 tactical I believe it's the
12 again link in the description hooked
on the front right here into all this
moly
if you don't know Mali is look it up
it's awesome so the idea is you're gonna
clip different stuff to the oats yeah
you clip all these carabiners right he's
a little some kind of mountain climbing
thing yeah tactical right ok yes that's
quite it's called tactical now G these
things are a lifesaver when you're
running around the convention all day
write this up all day every day right
right keep hydrated wish I had more
water the beats pill great little
product mine's the black one great great
for a hotel room trying to get some
music keep morale to do when you don't
like filming all days Chris what I think
we lost
morality what else I got in here I have
Oh my mouse razer believe it's the Mambo
can't remember exactly there's no boxing
video link in the description and a
Razer portable mouse pad these things
are great rubber on the bottom most
surface on the top pop it anywhere on
your jeans anywhere you get a proper
mouths most circuits mousing supposing
surface I think you just dropped it
that's cool that's alright we're into
dropping things today moleskin oh not
say enough good stuff a little skin
might not the red one yeah because that
was misplaced by a little flashy
I need the flash alright two tablets
last year oh my goodness grades this
year two one with the Nexus 7 right
actually with the Asus core upper case
how much I haven't seen before
yeah it's actually really nice yeah
check it out a place one alright I'll
try and iPad Mini again red theme red
theme going on magnetic case you guys
are awesome I have the same black in the
red yeah I didn't bring any tablets nope
I'm kind of like anti cab lately we go
actually when you're carrying around a
note too right that's that's almost
Ablett what are they saying now they're
saying phablet we got sharpies woah
sharpies get a bunch of business cards
and write names on and do all kinds of
stuff highlighter a bunch of pens and
you guys don't want to see that you got
a lot of stuff in there dude yeah it's
big big it's awesome I love it there
have another galaxy camera same idea so
this is Instant Upload we wanted to be
locked and loaded in case anything had
to get up instantaneously we at least
were prepared and ready to do that
so Galaxy camera there and I had a
Galaxy camera - that's great mine was
just wife I didn't have a sim in it but
it's even still I was uploading images
to my Instagram feed it's great
absolutely love it huge screen full
Android sweet amazing oh that's it for
their back here oh I got a spare phone
talk about my two phones that I brought
I brought the Nexus 4 as well
yeah I got the bumper and zag case on
mine I am terrified of breaking my phone
I did it to my Galaxy Nexus scratched it
scratch the crap out of he cried like a
last year at CES actually that's right
he was brand new and I cried and then as
a backup I brought another Galaxy Nexus
the old Galaxy Nexus I used this for
basically surfing and Instagram and
stuff like that right and this for calls
conserve for both right battery life is
like the hugest issue that's why most
people were rocking the note2 because of
a large bag a lot of no twos on the show
I would say majority of phones were nada
no dude people will know where it's at
yeah in here I got my music I went with
the locate what you know what's great
about it 160 gigs that's true yeah yeah
and I went with the Bose in ear Android
version headphones right that's
something interesting so the the iOS
ones will function mm-hmm but the songs
skip yeah right doesn't function
properly so also it's the three button
or two button right there you go yeah so
there's two different versions of those
headphones once again since we suck at
details the links are down link that
will give you all the data on each
particular right you know what this
thing it actually comes with a really
nice case it's proper leather so that's
what the headphones came with yeah use
it for all kinds of stuff
all right into oh dear God into the
abyss wait before you pull that guy out
yeah okay let's tell them about your
camera oh yeah like I'm gonna be
wondering how you were shooting stuff
keep in mind guys AJ shot a lot of the
content that you watched from CES yes so
I have the H X xx V which is the newer
model of behind V that little rocks
there's a problem with the focusing
right in my camera so as soon as we got
back from CES because I noticed it there
every couple videos would be a problem
I'd have to reach it wasn't it was it
was hunting for focus yeah we'd like
missed the point of focus and it would
it would catch something you know I
don't focus so I sent it in to Sony they
were real great they're taking care of
me they're helping me out but - it's
getting fixed right now right so yeah it
reminds you guys
HX 20 V he was
is more or less like my hx9 me just a
little bit newer the lens is a little
different but a basic 18 times zoom yeah
at a 60 yeah we were talking about power
this I know it looks ridiculous can you
get this out yeah okay it is a lifesaver
fact that all of these are adjustable
you can plug in bricks to all the
different locations to this guy and he's
always happy somebody's happy so every
time you go to something is gonna be
sprawled out on some table somewhere
linked up to everything so the next
conference will I'm sure they put some
happy power guys some shots of that
happy power game I got I'm a little more
organized than the way more but I like
it with the shampoo label yeah
I'm always amazed to see them alright so
this bag is gonna spill oh you're not
really gonna show it no no I'm just
gonna highlight we got look at this okay
this is quite the story I don't know if
I should be telling you guys this yeah
what do you think good okay this is just
quite the story this thing right here it
helped us to split the signal in our
hotel room and some of you guys saw the
crazy speeds on my speedtest I think we
got up to 750 down and 70 up what we did
is we just removed the wireless router
and we plug straight in to the wall and
then we split this amongst the different
laptops in the room and that's how we
got those crazy speeds so it's never a
bad idea have a switch a small little
switch this is a tiny switch actually
they've gotten a lot smaller its gigabit
too so you get some gigs a gig sure you
gotta get got a gig big a bit wicked all
right so that's that mint table table
fact you know I got I got a bunch of
large drives right I got a bunch of
power bricks right I have some of those
many 99 were you guys with all that
already I'm not gonna bore you
electrical tape just in case
Wow you know all right all right that
will all been loaded Ethernet cables
Gigabit Ethernet kid yeah go with the
switch yeah that's right you need to
have Ethernet cables with you when you
travel because the Wi-Fi is unreliable
gets pretty
pretty screwed up more cables more
cables those are mostly micro USBs this
is important yep Donna you see with all
the new MacBooks you need dongles or a
lot of them yeah yeah the retina models
and stuff so at least the 13 inch retina
that you have exactly I guess the
MacBook Air - right I think so yeah it
doesn't have he doesn't have this so if
you don't want to use wired internet you
need this Thunderbolt dongle what are
these run how much are these 29 oh I
have no idea
link in the description alright there
you go they're too much money they're
more money than they should be
the other cool thing is slim ports HDMI
break up for the Nexus 4 so you plug
this little bad boy into the bottom of
your friend Nexus 4 and you get HDMI out
plus you can charge your phone with the
mini in the bottom Micro sorry micro in
the bottom it's uh it's really great we
actually hooked it up to the hotel room
TV I have just gotten it we played
around with it so in simple terms I'll
put the video from your Nexus 4 onto
your HDTV over HDMI yeah there's one of
the few phones that supports this right
now I think the only phone right now
over micro USB micro yeah that's crazy
so HD video over microUSB the rest of
this is all cables
where are you giggles cool another one
of those Belkin that's hot these are hot
I'm going to get one I don't know if I
think they're still available if they
are I'm gonna find it link it those are
wicked we got a SD case right again a
little more organized much more
organized than me might not even labeled
numbered you know there you go that's
why these things are great
LG around keeps everything in order
that's right power brick pretty boy
right I had one of those do but I didn't
want to share sure there was too much
stuff obviously I had to charge my
laptop these things are again another
mobile power source Razzie I think it's
called the spark 2.0 yeah two USB
outputs one full battery indicator
school battery indicator it's kind of
dead right now
right but when it's full its for once
for iOS devices ones typically for
Android or other devices they use a
different amperage it's yes I can't do
with the current yes so one of the one
of them's called
optimized and the other is general so
you have two ports that you can use for
different device came in real also cool
about this is you don't need a separate
power brick so you have there's my cell
phone going off I need a silence that
but you tell them tell them about yeah
so you plug this right into the wall and
you can use that to charge of The Voice
devices while you're traveling so you
don't have to bring all those tiny
little bricks with you you can actually
use this as your brake for two devices
all right and the last thing in my bag
well melissa is on a very important call
is my 13 inch MacBook Pro Retina I just
picked this up right before the trip
really love it except for that little
dongle that I have to plug in for
hard-wired internet that's light really
light really almost as light as the air
yeah pretty close right size is perfect
too I know the 15-inch for me is a
little big
I love the 13 I think it's a press of
battery-life thing not bad they what are
they told like nine hours I don't they
say you're not gonna get that oh I've
gotten about seven right decent decent
more my biggest issue with the retina
models everything is soldered on the
board now you can't swap out the RAM
obviously you can't put whatever SS do
you want in it so as you buy it that's
the way you're gonna have to use it so
make sure to spec it out the way you
want in the first place because you're
not gonna be able to adjust that later
no did you spec it out the way you want
I did I did but whose guy beside me in
the store who didn't okay there you go
and I grabbed mine up with a pretty nice
little John I wrapped it up gotta wrap
it keep it wrapped all right cool that's
everything that's been a long video
longer than usual but there's not much
you can do about it we had a lot of
stuff to cover and so we did and
everything you watched shot was done on
point-and-shoot cameras the digital SLR
we're talking to right now didn't come
with us on this trip it came last year
didn't get used enough unfortunately in
a crowded convention environment you
can't do very much with a DSLR while
some people can but I feel that it's
better to cover more stuff cover more
ground run-and-gun get the footage and
worry later yeah
you know that's more important than how
pretty it looks it's a kind of a grungy
event trying
cover a convention and the best way I
think to do it is with small portable
gear keep it light stay nimble stay
quick this is our third major convention
so I think I think we're learning is it
oh yeah
and we'll be back we'll be back maybe
three go back to e3 I'm trying to the
Mobile World Congress that would be
pretty lame yeah sure wanna okay we span
to February we might be at Mobile World
Congress who knows
all right guys hope you enjoyed this
give AJ a thumbs up his debut video yeah
this man's looking good talking on
camera and I'll catch you guys in the
next one
all right later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
