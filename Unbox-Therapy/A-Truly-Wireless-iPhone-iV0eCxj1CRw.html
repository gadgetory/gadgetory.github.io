couple up what's up guys Lew here back
with another video and today I've got
something that you probably haven't seen
before I mean it you might have heard
about it but it does a couple things in
one package and as far as I know this is
the only product the only device that
does exactly this a case / battery
backup / charger in one unit this guy
here has the power prongs built right
into the case so there is no separate
cable to charge that's what gets you the
name prong prong also the name of one of
my favorite animals you know an animal
that is the pronghorn way up in the
mountains I don't know the pronghorn I
always liked it up to 100 percent more
battery life it's a 2600 milliamp hour
battery and all of this in the wake of
the Apple battery case that I'm pretty
sure you're aware of protective case
detachable battery backup microUSB power
and sync cable audio adapter blah blah
blah also an LED charge indicator that's
kind of cool let's get this baby cracked
open live cord free I'm just noticing
now I didn't even know this is that the
the power portion is removable from the
case portion that is cool
hello power goodbye cord blade do we
have a blade and we're not joking around
the micro USB that I mentioned and then
a headphone adapter so this will allow
you to put this slim one in there and
then any headphone you want to connect
on the case we have a micro USB port in
this location here button in that
location there assume that maybe checks
the battery level micro just being in
the headphone cut out a lightning
connector that's what's going to go into
the phone itself and then here is a
cutout for the speaker to sort of send
the audio through now one of the side
benefits of using a case like this
that you know with the iPhone you have
the speaker shooting out the bottom
instead of at you this redirects it
forward so this grill here means that
the audio is shooting at your eardrums
which is kinda ideal since your ears do
the heavy lifting when it comes to
listening down and up gotta admit kind
of cool we're going to insert this into
the case this allows you to use the
phone in a slim fashion with some
protection and access to all your
buttons and then when you want that
juice when you need that juice slide it
in and that's what the package looks
like now obviously not the slimmest
thing in the world but you are getting
2600 milliamp hours and you are getting
the flexibility of after you've got that
juice or you've charged up your phone of
simply sliding it out when you slide it
in the volume rockers line up really
nice now this button on the bottom here
is that there you go that starts it up I
guess the power icon which shows that
the device is now charging you know you
could save the battery case for later
this switch here allows you to
completely control that let us try out
some actual charging because I just
wanted to see how how this guy fits in
there like so this little mini hack of
the idea of like being your phone
charger as well now another cool thing
about this is it kind of acts like a way
to prop up your device so if you do have
an outlet in your kitchen above the
counter or something what you end up
with here when you plug it in is like an
upright way of looking at your device
this thing is curved I mean it fits in
the head you get a confident grip on
that it's really not that crazy
it looks chunky but it's it's
utilitarian I probably use it more as as
a charge dock and a battery backup
optionally options don't hate on options
there you have it guys the prong case
the iPhone battery case with a secret
you could live a cable free life you
guys know I hate cables you've seen
pictures of my setup I've spent hours
hiding cables there will one day be a
wireless future
but until then go prong yourself or look
at a pronghorn thanks very much for
watching guys appreciate your viewership
