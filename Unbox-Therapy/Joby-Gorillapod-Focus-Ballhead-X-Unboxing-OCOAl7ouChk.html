therapy and today we're taking a look at
the gorilla pod focus along with the
ball head X this is a Joby product and
it's kind of like a tripod but a little
bit different it can do some things that
your tripod can't for example it can get
super low to the ground and it can hang
upside down basically if your favorite
exotic dancer can do it
the Joby Gorillapod focus can do it
alright let's talk about the unboxing
after all this is unbox therapy where
products get naked where we get you as
close as possible to the products we're
talking about and here it is this is the
gorilla pod focus in all its glory and
as you'll notice right away it looks
like no other tripod on the planet you
can twist and manipulate these legs into
any position you please and the reason
why that's important is because you
might want to put this thing into
situations that your regular tripod
cannot get into now this package
includes the ball head X which can be
purchased on its own and it's real easy
to operate you've got two knobs here one
for panning the device and one other one
to control the other functions of the
ball head allowing you to switch the
angle of your camera etc once it is
mounted up top the reason it's called
the ball head X is because of the X
pattern on the tripod mounting plate up
top and it's actually real easy to
operate as well there's one last knob in
order to loosen it up and pull it off
and then on the underside of this plate
you've got this little tab that flips up
and allows you to tighten to your
favorite camera or camera of choice and
then you just slide it back on tighten
it back up and you are ready for
business and all of your photography
needs so here I've got my H x9 v up on
top if you haven't seen my unboxing of
this camera I am in love with this
camera and I'll better put a link down
in the description up in the annotations
you need to check out that video because
this thing shoots incredible video you
really need to consider it if you're
looking at any kind of point-and-shoot
high-end point-and-shoot but as you'll
notice here you just loosen one knob and
all of a sudden you get all the pan and
tilt functionality that you need so here
is an even larger camera this is the one
I use on a regular basis it's the Canon
60d along
with my 10 to 22 millimeter zoom lens
there are bigger lenses in the world
than this but this is still a fairly
large package the Gorillapod focus can
handle 5 kilos total which is quite
impressive for such an unorthodox tripod
so that means you can mount a super zoom
up on there if you really want to as I
mentioned her here it can get real low
to the ground basically ends up looking
like a spider or something when you get
it you know configured like this and it
can also just sort of operate like a
regular tripod if you keep the legs
straight as you can see in this
particular image here now it retails for
about 149 bucks
it's not super cheap but not super
expensive and I do think that the
materials in use here are of
professional grade so I think 150 bucks
for the combo is definitely a good value
at least in my opinion now I plan on
using this device along with a very cool
product called Sena skates those should
be coming in the mail any minute so once
I get those I'll show you how the whole
thing works together very interesting
stuff anyway guys if you enjoyed this
content hopefully you can like and
favorite this video as it does help me
out a bunch and if you haven't checked
out my new channel yet it's called the
bees feed you might enjoy what's going
on over there so I'll put a link in
front of your face as well as down in
the description I want to thank you all
for checking out my content you guys
make it possible alright guys until next
time I'll see you around later
