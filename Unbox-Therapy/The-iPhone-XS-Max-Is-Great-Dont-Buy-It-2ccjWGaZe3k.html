on any one specific smartphone in fact
with the speed at which these phones are
launched it's it's pretty much as much
time as you can spend I got this thing
going on where I'll take my main SIM
card my main phone number the phone
number that everybody has and I will put
that SIM card into a device and use it
exclusively as my daily driver whether
you like that terminology or not for
that entire period and in this case with
the iPhone 10's max it has been maybe
even a little longer than usual and I
kind of felt the need to do that because
switching over to iOS is a one-time deal
it's like once a year so many devices to
choose from in the Android space and
they're getting launched at various
intervals but in the iPhone world you
get new iOS devices once per year so I
put a little extra time on it to make
sure that I really absorbed it as much
as possible so this is the 10 s max in
front of me I thought might as well go
for the bigger one since it's newer I
guess then the regular 10s slightly
bigger battery bigger screen and the 10
s is a lot like last year's 10 which I
also used for an extended period of time
so this phone here in front of me is a
good phone I need to get that out of the
way everybody wants to make this
discussion black and white a discussion
of contrast that like one thing is the
thing and the other thing is not the
thing and honestly it doesn't break down
that way it's like so many other things
in life there is a gradient there is a
gray area and the vast majority of
things if not everything lives somewhere
in that spectrum this phone is a good
phone I used it for an extended period
of time it did what I wanted it to do in
fact in some cases very well and in some
cases better than the various Android
counterparts that I've used recently
compatibility in and out of multiple
cars where I have Bluetooth connections
this one has been the most stable
instantly connecting and never requiring
any kind of manual input part of that is
a benefit of scale this
one set of hardware and software that is
is combined in this product and then
proliferated amongst this huge group of
people all using the exact same hardware
so if you're an auto manufacturer and
you're working out your Bluetooth
profiles or compatibility iPhone is
going to be at the top of your list and
of course there's various other products
like that and accessories and so on that
can benefit from the scale of iPhone
there's also certain apps on here that I
would say are a little bit better
possibly than their Android alternatives
this part of the discussion has been
converging of recent I would say Android
has gotten a lot better in this space
but there still is this scale advantage
when it comes to compatibility and iOS
of course market share is something
that's changing rapidly so this is not a
static thing this is a dynamic part of
the conversation and this may change in
the future as well but nonetheless
compatibility very nice it's solid it's
robust the build quality is something
that I like now you know I'm not a huge
fan of glass phones but I will gladly
switch to a glass phone in exchange for
wireless charging which this device
happens to have not the fastest charging
device but it has that feature and I
like it now when you pull this thing out
of the box it's important to know that
you feel like you were dealing with a
quality device you feel like you are
dealing with an expensive device
certainly more so than some other
products you'll pull out of a box you
guys know I raved about the recent polka
phone f1 299 dollar
maybe that does happen we know what it
was about it was crazy delivery of specs
for not such a crazy price that's kind
of the opposite of this phone here this
phone has the price tag to match you
pull this out of the box and you feel
like you're holding on to something
expensive so I commend Apple for being
able to deliver a premium phone that
truly does feel premium the camera in
most situations is also good I was
mostly critical of the front-facing
camera and some of the things that was
doing to skin tones now that issue
doesn't exist nearly as much if at all
on the rear camera which otherwise can
produce some amazing images Apple has
its own version of computational
photography capable of merging
multiple photos together you saw the
smart HDR functionality that stuff is
only gonna get better with time as the
sample size increases and so on and of
course Apple can go in there and make
updates to things like Beauty gate if
people don't like the effect that it's
having on their skin tones that can be
tweaked I think a lot of people are
gonna go ahead and compare this camera
to the upcoming pixel device the pixel 3
pixel 3 Excel totally different
implementation here of course as you
know we have the multi lens scenario a
lot of where we're living right now is
somewhere in the nuance the grey thing
that I was talking about before I don't
really think your life is gonna be
impacted all that much by using this
smartphone camera first is the pixel 3
Excel for most people in most
circumstances either of those two phones
is going to suffice in delivering the
type of results that you happen to be
looking for it's gonna be a matter of
taste yes that's right it's taste a lot
of it has to do with what you're
comfortable with or what you have
pre-existing knowledge of or what your
family members happen to use like all
these pieces actually add up to your
eventual decision on which smartphone is
best for you and it is important to
remember it is a question of best for
you rather than best overall even in the
case of those DxO scores some people
still pick other images down the list on
different smartphone cameras that they
consider to be more pleasing it comes
back to this idea that there is no best
just the best for you now we can't talk
a little bit about the notch here it's
not City right now like my whole Twitter
is essentially talking about notches
it's amazing Apple they come out with it
and then boom it's across the board I
knew when I saw it on the original
iPhone 10 it was gonna be an earthquake
a notch quake so all of a sudden you
have all these bones coming out with
notches and I probably looked at a dozen
phones with notches since the iPhone 10
if I can disable the notch
I'll disable it I'll get rid of it now
Apple doesn't natively give you the
ability to do that so I put a black and
put a black background until you launch
into an app in which case you become
more aware of the notches existence what
I do like in the iPhones case is that
there's no chin to go along with the
notch at least the rest of the device is
relatively symmetrical you're housing
some some pretty cool tech when it comes
to facial rec
Nishan and so on but I should talk a
little bit about this facial recognition
it still suffers from some of the same
issues that the iPhone tended I'll be
lying in bed for example sometimes it'll
just miss or you know the the place
where I'm holding the phone is a little
bit closed and I find myself doing these
types of motions is it the end of the
world no absolutely not does it require
me to condemn the entire device no
absolutely not but it is something that
you should know about with the lack of a
fingerprint scanner on this phone there
are those circumstances in which you
find yourself either doing that or
typing in the passcode it's not every
time it's not every person's face some
people wear hats
sometimes I wear glasses it's not all
the time but it is sometimes and so it's
worth knowing about I would still prefer
if this phone and I said this about the
previous version had some alternative
authentication system like a fingerprint
scanner in the back they'll never get
rid of the Apple logo but how cool would
an Apple logo fingerprint scanner be in
conjunction with face unlock so you have
both whichever picks up first that's the
one you go with the display on here is
nice
OLED it's a must at this price point as
you know this one has it I do also enjoy
having access to a dedicated switch for
dealing with audio issues silencing the
phone and so on something they don't
like is that we still have this effect
here this is not my favorite effect yes
there are times where I use the device
on a flat surface and I'm just not a
huge fan of this breakdown right here
where you know not a deal breaker once
again not a deal breaker there's been a
lot of talk about the asymmetry on the
bottom of the device
I rarely would even look at the bottom
of the device here what's more
interesting to me is the reason for it
Apple is no longer working with Qualcomm
at all in fact apple and Qualcomm
not-so-friendly right now there's
various lawsuits disputes going on
between the two brands you know Qualcomm
they're giants out here when it comes to
chipsets networking components and so on
because of the dispute Apple chose to go
with Intel you can see there's an extra
antenna band here to support the latest
wireless protocol and this is the first
time that Apple has gone all Intel on
their device some people but the
previous gen I phone ended up with
Qualcomm some ended up with Intel it
appears to me
looking at this from a distance now and
seeing this transition it might not be
the greatest thing for customers how
much of the Wi-Fi issues that have been
reported maybe Hardware related to an
internal design that Intel is
responsible for or possibly it's a
software hardware communication thing
going on but what we do know is Qualcomm
is the market leader when it comes to
these type of communication components
so will the networking be as rock-solid
on this as the last one
time will tell I did notice that the
Wi-Fi would drop out from time to time
but then again twelve point zero point
one the latest software on here actually
claims to fix some of that or hopefully
fix some of it okay sound I was really
impressed with the sound the sound
coming out of this is definitely an
improvement over the previous one and
it's one of the best sounding smart
phones that I've heard as of right now
this is one of the best sounding smart
phones out of the speaker unit that's
out there in the marketplace it's a bit
unfortunate to me that they didn't move
to USB type-c I get it there's a lot of
peripherals out there that utilize the
Lightning port but but honestly for me I
have so many accessories on type-c it
would have been nice to just see native
type-c in there fast charging in the box
I just want to talk a little bit about
notifications in general not a huge fan
of the way that iOS deals with
notifications comparative to Android I
just find the individual cards and even
the way that notifications are stacked
within iOS are not quite as streamlined
this is a preference thing I feel the
need to reiterate this as a preference
thing that said iOS has made a number of
improvements regarding nested
notifications so at least now they're
stacked on top of each other if you are
a heavy user and you get a lot of
notifications that was a huge issue in
the past
Apple has addressed that but to me it's
still a step behind what's happening on
Android that said it's a taste thing
battery life I should say I was
concerned about the battery on here
because it is smaller than some of the
other flagship devices like say for
example the note 9 there's some power
management stuff going on here that is
obviously very effective because at the
end of the day and
similar numbers in terms of leftover
battery life it's not like I'm hunting
for a charger with this thing if you are
locked into the iOS ecosystem and you
want battery life you can go with this
max or you could wait for the ten are as
depressing as that screen might be or
will be or who knows that thing should
be really good and on Apple site they've
even listed it as the battery champion
for runtime so that's something to keep
in mind I'm not gonna go out there and
tell you that there's a $400 phone on
the market that's gonna give you the
same overall picture as what this iPhone
is going to give you as fine or good or
quality this product continues to be the
real question comes down to cost it
comes back to cost again because
ultimately that's my job here is to
evaluate these things from a cost
performance perspective you're going to
be determining what works best for you
in comparison to what you want to invest
it's the best I can do it's the best
thing to talk about for me speaking and
thinking as responsibly as I possibly
can to the average one of you to the
person out there who's a customer who's
looking at smart phones who's
considering buying a new one I'm gonna
have to say this phone is great but I
still don't think you should buy it and
this cost this one in front of me is
1100 bucks USD and in certain markets
it's even more than that when adjusted
in some places like India for example
the thing is almost 2 grand equivalent
the iPhone 10's max is a great phone the
iPhone 10s is a great phone they have
problems every phone has problems but
for those of you in the audience looking
for advice concerned with cost to
performance ratio I do not think the 10s
max is worth 1100 bucks or whatever
price it is in your local market not
compared to what else is out there if
you got money falling out of your
pockets if you got boatloads of cash
go ahead disregard everything I said and
just be like I don't care I can have 10
of those but I can't be that useful to
you anyways that wraps up this video as
you know I'm doing this switch thing I
got a switch to another phone I gotta
bring the heat so let me know down in
the comment section which phone am i
switching to next I will be switching
and I won't
be holding back stop it I'm bringing
fire to all of them I'm looking to give
you value wherever I can I'm gonna keep
doing it all right comments-section
what am i switching to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
