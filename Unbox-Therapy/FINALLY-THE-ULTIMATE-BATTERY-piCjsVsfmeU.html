another video and today I'm hoping that
I have solved one of the greatest
problems plaguing the tech community as
a whole not just people who make videos
but you as well everybody is looking for
the perfect backup battery I have been
online I've been on Amazon I look up and
down some of them are slim some of them
are bigger some of them have more
capacity some of them charge up faster
but today I think I have found the Holy
Grail this guy in front of me the power
4 plus from anchor is the first one that
really got me excited it's one of the
first as well that features USB see now
this is a big boy 20,000 plus milliamp
hours so this is for the boss players in
the tech space on the back here you can
see power cord USB see power port USB
see power line USB see now the reason
I'm motivated about USB see right now is
because I have been using a nexus 6p
recently which of course features USB C
so I've got I'm carrying around other
batteries that cut adapters going on bit
of a nightmare I'm having trouble
sleeping at night
alright let's crack this baby open it's
also discounted fairly regularly on
Amazon so check out the link to see what
the price is as of right now 10 million
happy youth these guys are a bigger deal
tonight 10 million get her going charge
her up do the dance
now the battery itself as I said this is
a big boy guys no joke right there stick
it in your backpack look at that guy now
this button on the front I'm impressed
that so it'll tell you how much charge
you have now on the end here you've got
the USB C port and then 2 IQ charge
smart ports this means you're gonna get
more rapid speed we're available and
those are standard USB so that covers
the unit also inside the box ooh look at
that
a padded mesh bag here perfect for a
little bit of protection also possibly a
place for your tables so it does come
with tape what do we have here
USB C 2 USB C micro USB 2 big boy USB
USB C 2 big boy USB that's why I'm
calling that one for now what is it I
think it's called USB a right anyway I
prefer big boy in order to test this guy
out we have look at that pretty Nexus 6p
- still one I've been using lately you
can either take this cable here into one
of these IQ ports and USB see on the
other end and go that route got a love
USB see Jack you can pick that up in the
corner there you can also this is a
quick glimpse into my Instagram account
as well you know I'm sharing behind the
scenes stuff follow me on Instagram for
more of this and more of everything else
just more but of course if you want to
be super modern and go all USBC all day
we can hook this guy up here as well and
we are juicing just as well we can go
with something like this now I'm
charging up two phones it's hard to
imagine but like this guy here could
give you substantially more life even on
a low powered laptop like the new
MacBook because of this USB see not only
does it mean you're going to be able to
charge up these devices faster but also
this thing itself and at 20,000 20,000
milliamp hours that should be a concern
of yours if you're looking for what
might be the best package in the world
of battery backups this might be one for
you I'll probably use it on watermelon
myself I'm a peaceful guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
