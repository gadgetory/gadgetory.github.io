What's up guys, Lew here, back with another video and today we're going to be doing the official
...iPhone 6+ bend test
Now, normally, I wouldn't do a video like this but I woke up this morning and saw a number of reports
Claming
... that the iPhone six plus was bending inside people's pockets. So, I decided to pull mine out of my pocket...
I've been using it as my regular phone for the last couple of days, and, upon inspection, I actually noticed a tiny little indentation towards the centre of the device
Which, kind of implies a little bit of a bend, not much, nothing conclusive, but, some of the images I've seen from other people show a far
more significant bend and the claims are that people are just using it in their front pocket which, normally, wouldn't result in a bent aluminium phone.
But, in this particular case, we have such a large device and I can see this being a significant concern for people, so, for the sake of science
Today, i'm gonna bend this iPhone six plus to see how much force it actually takes to make this thing unusable
or essentially bent in such a fashion that you would be pissed off as an owner of one of these devices.
So, without further or do, lets get into the iPhone six plus bend test
*Music Playing*
So, there you have it guys
unfortunate, but, under the pressure of my hands it does bend quite significantly, specifically around this portion here
where the buttons were
My focus was more in the center portion,
but it seems to be a weak point up here
near the button cutouts
Bottom line here is that its an aluminum phone it is going to bend
If you apply enough pressure, like I just did
Now will this happen in your front pocket?
That probably depends on how tight your pants are and how often you wearing this in your pocket
I think it could. This, this was painful to do,
but for the sake of science to let you guys know if it's an actual possibility,
it looks like it will be a possibility on the iPhone 6+
not necessarily the piece of information that you guys want to receive as brand-new owners of this device
It's probably not gonna be the most durable from that stand point,
but, it's a huge foot print, look at the foot print of that thing
This is a huge piece of aluminum and we all know that aluminum is incredibly
malleable, but now we have actual evidence on camera not just a picture of a bent phone
After the fact, yes it bends under the force of my hand pressure
Just pushing on it, the aluminum bends even with this robust piece of glass
It's time to see how Apple respond to this, if I get any updates I'll let you know.
In an upcoming video and quick reminder I got an extra iPhone, regular iPhone 6
that I'm gonna give away shortly so subscribe for that.
Maybe, this is enough information to push you in the direction of picking the
6 over the 6+ bigger footprint, bigger piece of aluminum, greater likelihood of bending
There you have it, little bit of proof right here on Unbox Therapy
Thanks for watching guys, this was painful like I said before but it's all for the sake of science.
So that you can know a little bit more info
about this investment that you're about to make.
Alright, catch you on the next episode. Later.
