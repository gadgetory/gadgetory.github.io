I show you something so unbelievable the
reason you signed up to this channel and
being a technology fan in general the
reason you got into this game the reason
I got into this game the reason Jack got
into this game to see these developments
to be up close and personal to be front
row when things like this happen
the boundaries of perception you might
think that I'm talking about going to
space you might think I'm talking about
self-driving cars no man I'm talking
about your favorite brand so you guys
probably noticed a video that I
published recently about that new iPhone
7 and 7 plus well really not a new phone
but a new color the product red iPhones
but I was kind of underwhelmed with the
hype surrounding a new color now not to
say that it doesn't look good or
interesting
I mean color is a subjective thing but I
just knew for a while you could kind of
mix up whichever color you wanted on
your phone without the commitment of
completely switching phones and the
reason I knew that is because I've
worked with D brand in the past you guys
may have caught previous video if you
don't know about these things you can
put a skin on your phone which is
nowhere near the commitment level of a
case they're about 10 bucks and you can
personalize and put whichever color you
want you could be a purple person orange
red you don't necessarily need the big
smart phone company to tell you which
color you should have and you could take
it even a step further and completely
cover the back so they reached out to me
and said hey let's show off what we got
and to spice it up a little bit we're
actually going to give away one of these
phones in each color these are all
iPhone 7 plus --is make sure to be
subscribed here on YouTube and also
follow on Twitter because the details
will be over here and of course like in
the past feed bread is gonna be handling
the logistics and shipping these things
out so it's all very efficient so 10
phones there you have it maybe you've
got everything in the world and all you
want to do is create your own rainbow
stack maybe this is you right here it's
not for me to tell you Oh
Apple for that case you probably notice
that some of these devices don't have
the cutout no Apple cut out there the
name of the brand D brand was actually
created as an explanation for this
process right here D branding your
device so like skittles or something
product red phone your own product red
product red $10 product red a couple of
red phone you know a lot of people were
saying that they were unhappy that the
product red device had the white on the
front of course in this case if you're
coming at it with a pre-existing black
iPhone if you add the red to the back
like this one then you can actually end
up with the black on the front now you
got black on the front read on the back
maybe that was the look you were going
for maybe the phone you always want it
is already in your pocket how about that
for a tagline okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
