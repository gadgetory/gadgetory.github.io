another video and today this might be
the most exciting thing I've brought you
in a while this right here it's a little
appliance that is going to chill any
beverage carbonated or otherwise in one
minute chill a beverage in one minute I
know you've been in that situation
before where you just needed a cold
beverage and you didn't have time to put
it in the fridge and sit around and wait
this might be the solution to all your
problems it is the Cooper cooler rapid
beverage chiller you can chill wine you
can chill beer you could chill soda it
could chill coca-cola chill it all
English while you're at it my
understanding is it's something to do
with the circulation of super cold water
I got to get this baby out not I mean
I'm normally pumped but I'm even more
pumped power adapter you know I'd like
to bring you guys the gadgets that are
hard to find that you might not know
about think about it you don't have room
in the fridge for everything somebody
wants something exotic no problemo
we got the super chiller it's got a
little dial in the front you can select
what type of beverage you're working
with I'm not even sure where the Oh what
if I've got a can same idea where's
English I'm in francais right now uh-uh
so you fill this baby up right here add
two trays of ice and two cups of water
oh and if you have a bigger bottle like
a wine bottle this piece comes out or a
Perrier bottle and now look at that it
can close down the can cycle is 1 minute
1 minute long that's insane
I have warm this is warm warm coke time
to add the water essentially what you're
doing here is giving your drink a quick
bath and ice bath
a cryogenic bath we need ice now if you
have trays of ice then what you're
looking for is two trays worth I've got
a bag of ice so I'm just gonna estimate
look at this whoo beautiful ice water I
place the canyon on the side wall here
close it down on the front there's a
button here that says can or baby bottle
we're gonna go a can and then start oh
oh
rapid spinning going on right now and an
icy cold bath now apparently there's
only last 60 seconds and we end up with
a refrigerator temperature coca-cola was
that 60 seconds Wow yeah look I mean you
can even see on the can look at my
fingerprint I don't care what kind of
contraction you have if you dump this in
a cooler with ice in it or if you put it
in the fridge or even in the freezer
it's not going to be as fast as that 90
times faster than a refrigerator 40
times faster than a freezer so coca-cola
is one thing but what if you're talking
about colt 45
can I try extra I want to see if I can
get even colder look at that this is
like a microwave it's like a microwave
for cold you can see JAC look at it look
where my hand is can you see that that
is buddy's cold no crazy foaming
hmm it's ice-cold I love it I love it
when a product comes across the desk
here and unbox therapy does what it
claims to do I don't care if you're into
Australian beer maybe you're looking at
an energy drink maybe it's a rock star
maybe you're amount do kind of dude this
is gonna chill it down in a minute on
demand cold tell your friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
