another video and today I have a very
special presentation a quick
presentation I have just received a
dummy unit a mock-up of the iPhone 6 5.5
inch version on my left here this is set
to be the largest iPhone ever very
similar in fact in form-factor to the
galaxy note 3 which I also have decided
here for the sake of comparison I've
also got the current generation of
iPhone on the far side here the iPhone
5s which is of course dwarfed by both of
these devices beside it now this is
obviously a mock-up unit it is not 100%
accurate I wouldn't expect it to be but
the way it works with these mock-ups is
you have case manufacturers accessory
manufacturers etc in China they get
their hands on schematics and they try
to get a jump on other manufacturers in
the space you know through producing
their accessories in advance of an
actual iPhone launch now in the past
they have been very very accurate and
they probably wouldn't be going into
production with cases etc if they didn't
have something very close to a finished
product so I have some pretty decent
confidence in a 5.5 inch iPhone gracing
the stage at an upcoming Apple Keynote
near you anyways what does this mean
what can we gather from a 5.5 inch
mock-up well a few things first of all
the biggest change for your average
iPhone user if they choose to go in this
direction is going to be one-handed
operation with a 5.5 inch device
one-handed operation takes a major hit
especially if you don't have giant hands
I think I have average hands and as you
can see I'm going to have to shift to
reach the top edge the intention here is
really to use two hands hence the word
phablet that people have been using for
a while now to describe phones that are
larger than phones but smaller than
tablets the note 3 in the center here
has been wildly popular and this is
maybe one of those occasions where it
looks like Apple is moving into a market
where Samsung already has a foothold now
both of these devices obviously
Worf the current generation of iPhone as
you can see right here it is tiny now I
don't know if this says more about how
small the current iPhone is or how big
these phablets are but as you can see it
fits inside of the screen the entire
body now comparing the other dimensions
here between the iPhone 6 5.5 inch
mock-up and the note 3 you'll notice
that the form factors are really really
similar with the iPhone 6 being ever so
slightly taller with a larger bezel on
the top and the bottom but it is thinner
as well and this actually plays a role
in making it a little bit more
comfortable to hold even though it's
huge so it's a little thinner than the
current note 3 while we're here we
should take a look at the button layout
on this iPhone 6 mock-up you can see we
have our volume buttons on the left hand
side as well as a hold switch as I flip
it around you'll see the power button
has been moved as with other large
devices putting it on the top causes
some very difficult reach problems so
they put it on the side here this is
where your thumb will likely rest when
you're holding the device in a regular
fashion the SIM card tray will probably
be in this location right here and on
the bottom is where most of the action
is you have a large speaker grille as
well as the Lightning port and then of
course in the location of the headphone
jack again this is a mock-up it's not
for sure but this is likely what we'll
see when the eventual iPhone 6 5.5 inch
launches on the back of the device
you'll see it has this gold finish here
gold ish champagne gold just like the
iPhone 5s it'll of course be available
in different colors you have this new
antenna layout this is just painted on
for the purpose of this mock-up model
but many many leaks are pointing in the
direction of a very enlarged antenna lay
out the camera protrudes a little bit
which is also kind of an issue for some
users and the flash has changed into
this circular flash not sure yet if it's
going to be the
to tone style the double flash that
currently exists this again is for the
purpose of case design so the overall
form factor is probably more important
to case manufacturers than the exact
size of cutouts so this may change prior
to launch but something to keep in mind
maybe there's some new tech going into
this that we don't know about just yet
on the front we have our standard home
button / fingerprint reader which is the
exact same of course as the 5s and then
on the top we have a speaker some
sensors and a forward facing camera of
course if you compare the fronts here
you'll notice you have that extra sensor
they're not 100% sure what that is again
it's a mock up so anyways there you have
it it's always pretty cool to take a
closer look at these things and of
course attempt to predict what the next
a phone just might look like and
interestingly enough it seems at this
point it's gonna look a lot like the
note 3 so if you've held one of those
before you probably have a pretty good
idea of what a very large iPhone will
feel like of course lacking the stylus
here I know that Steve Jobs was very
against styluses so we probably won't
see one of those on an iPhone or iPad
anytime soon alright guys that wraps up
