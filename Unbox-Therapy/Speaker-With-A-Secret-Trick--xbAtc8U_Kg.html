another video and today I got another
Bluetooth speaker now Bluetooth speaker
videos are some of my favorite to make
but this Bluetooth speaker is a little
bit different it's got a magic trick a
secret if you will
plus it's got some weight to it what
does this company make looks like make
with a Q instead of a K it's called the
sound jump wireless portable speaker
it's got a cool kind of design to it too
you can see that here 20 hours of
playtime custom to full range 45
millimeter drivers and 2 passive
radiators alright
plus a built-in speakerphone you want to
keep it on your desk and be a
businessman or a business man kind of a
cool package I'm not sure where these
guys came from it was just a Kickstarter
or something I'm not a hunter nice
package so far wow that's actually I
kind of like that look right there so
there's the speaker little rubber on the
bottom volume buttons here Bluetooth
indicator and a power indicator as well
now this is metal this is made out of
metal in a micro USB port that's going
to be to charge this guy up an analog
mini jack port for connecting an analog
audio source if you don't want to use
bluetooth and then a full-size USB port
which I assume will be used to charge up
another device so if you want to have
your phone charging while it's
transmitting audio to the speaker you
can do that too oh cool alright so it
comes with not just a micro USB cable
but a braided one that kind of matches
look at that big wow that's
that's a tough cable my friends and then
a power brick pretty slim amplify your
life with some literal amps this doesn't
go in there this is originally from
there this is a little keychain put that
on your keychain because you're proud
some stickers too so this is this is for
the super fans the mega fans maybe
you're one of them I'm gonna save the
little special feature the magic trick
till the end let's hear this thing first
whoa I'm gonna hold that now I'm
flashing that's right let's play some
tunes you can have all the features in
the world even secret ones if you don't
sound right you're out the door
is it the greatest Bluetooth speaker
I've ever heard no it is not the
champion but it's decent like there's a
little bit of low-end for something this
size so that's okay I do really like the
design to the aesthetic here is nice so
as a speaker yeah does the job best in
the world probably not but it has a
trick
this little guy lifts right up wait Lou
what are you doing it's attached by a
magnet or something I like that when
it's in there it's in there this is the
battery right I showed you that can you
see his life there dad
it powers up this unit but at the same
time the secret trick here is it's a six
thousand milliamp hour battery backup
battery that you can just throw in your
bag when you don't necessarily need your
speaker now assuming you keep your
speaker powered up this should always be
charged she simply slip it out and
you're good to go
money in the bank so obviously the micro
USB to charge it up and then the
full-size USB to charge your device so
let's test that out definitely a magnet
that holds it in there look at that and
charging cool I like these kinds of
devices that do a couple of things it's
kind of like the Swiss Army knife
approach put it all in there
get it all in get yourself a hamburger
and put all the toppings on I'll take
everything plus the jalapenos if you're
Jack I would probably use this in a
bedroom somewhere in a kitchen maybe
where you've got it plugged in most of
the time this is gonna be fully charged
then you're on your way out
you're on your way to school Oh see you
later
two-in-one transformer six thousand
milliamp hours powers your speaker or
anything else you want via the Handy USB
connection that is so important to our
daily lifestyle there you have it sound
jump
not bad next time on unbox therapy
listen I like wide angles you're we're
talking well this is a wide angle you
see me
wide angle it's a bird it's a plane it's
a wide-angle lens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
