going to talk about apples next
generation Mac Pro as you probably know
we finally have specifications on two
different models for the next-gen system
the first one is a 4 core version at
$3,000 and then there's a 6 core version
at 4,000 but this of course is not the
entire story
Apple has announced that there will be a
12 core version available as a CTO or
customization and as in the past with
the Mac Pro series specifically you've
been able to improve things like the RAM
and the hard drive space of course now
we're talking about SSD space so this
video aims to find out what is the
maximum specification Mac Pro and what
might that cost spoiler alert it ain't
gonna be cheap we'll get started with
the baseline 6 core system and work up
from there the first thing to swap out
is the CPU as stated a 12 core version
will be available in order to figure out
the rough cost
I used this chart from Intel which lists
the suggested price for its xeon e5
series the 12 core chip lists for two
thousand six hundred and fourteen
dollars that's just a cpu next i
subtracted the cost of the six core chip
from the cost of d12 core version which
produces a rough idea of the upgrade
figure the difference is about two
thousand bucks
just like that we've jumped up to six
thousand total for the most basic 12
core Mac Pro but we're far from maximum
specification we've still got to upgrade
the RAM SSD and graphics let's do the
graphics next the top spec here is
listed as the fire pro d700 from AMD
this appears to be a unique name given
to GPUs destined for the mac pro but
internally it matches the exact spec of
the currently available PC equivalent
card the fire Pro W 9000 it looks like
every Mac Pro we'll be shipping with
dual GPUs this means a top spec version
should have 2d 700s otherwise known as
the W 9000 so how much is a w 9000
workstation GPU worth oh right around 3
G's times 2 that's $6,000 of graphics
add that to
12-core upgrade and we're sitting around
12,000 bucks
of course Apple could always credit back
some value for the stock components that
are being replaced via these
customizations but in the past that's
rarely been the case Apple tends to
charge top dollar for GPU upgrades
overshadowing any kind of credit for
these stock cards let's quickly add on
the max RAM 64 gigabytes of ddr3 ECC
memory this should run around 800 bucks
lastly we'll need the maximum storage
listed as a one terabyte PCIe type SSD
drive Apple hasn't shipped this type of
storage with the Mac Pro in the past so
it's tough to determine exactly what
they'll be using that being said the
previous gen PCIe upgrade from owz may
offer some insight into what something
like this might cost the biggest they've
got is 960 gigabytes at around $1200 I'm
fairly certain that this type of SSD
form factor won't be the one used in the
next pro nonetheless a one terabyte SSD
upgrade will likely cost around $1000
rounding up ever so slightly we're now
sitting at $14,000 for 12 core 64
gigabyte ram dual d700 one terabyte SSD
mac pro but we're just getting started
we need some displays to go with this
system or we'll have trouble using all
that power option 1 the Mac Pro supports
up to 6 Thunderbolt displays these
displays feature resolution of 2560 by
1440 and cost 999 dollars each this
option will add six thousand to our
total which is now sitting at 20 grand
option 2 is even more fun Apple has
stated that the next-gen mac pro is
capable of powering three 4k displays
for the ultimate spec I decided to
select the PQ 3 2 1 Q a 30 1.5 inch 4k
monster from Asus these go for around
3400 for the Mac spec we'll need three
$10,200 total system price just under 25
grand the craziest part of all is that
someone somewhere in the world will be
sitting in front of this exact
configuration Khan
December there will always be people
looking for the ultimate and in this
case it's going to cost them big time
there you have it a 25 thousand dollar
workstation with just under 25 million
pixels now you know what the ultimate
configuration of next-gen Mac Pro could
possibly cost we will of course figure
this out when it launches in December
before I take off I want to give a big
shout-out to everyone who helped me with
the research for this video by sending
me links and having a discussion on
Twitter
those people are Austin Evans mkbhd
Detroit Borg and TLD today I hope I
didn't miss anybody but yeah we were all
talking about what kind of SSDs they
might use in this next-gen Mac Pro since
that information is not out there so big
thanks to those guys for getting
involved in the discussion and helping
contribute to this video
all right guys that wraps this up if you
