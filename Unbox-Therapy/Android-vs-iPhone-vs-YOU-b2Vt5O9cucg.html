more unique upload than what you'd
expect to see here on the channel I felt
compelled to make this video especially
because we're seeing brand new iOS
devices being announced on the 10th
which is Tuesday and the conversation is
about to get heated as you'd expect if
you have any experience here on YouTube
especially as a commenter then you know
things can get crazy down in the
comments people get all hot and bothered
regarding their affiliations with
specific brands and this video right
here is an attempt to cool things down a
little bit before all this new coverage
hits I've posted a couple videos
previously about some leaked Apple
components and if you read through those
comments you can get a very good idea of
what happens on any of these technology
videos regarding Apple or Android people
get militant you might be one of those
people and I kind of want to cool it
down a little bit if you don't mind I
think it's a bit ridiculous to get that
attached to an inanimate object you know
a phone I've got a couple of them here I
want to address yet people who get crazy
with it to the point where they're
saying things completely unrelated to
the actual devices where they just get
personal with it and angry about it
let's get specific let's talk about iOS
let's talk about Android these are two
platforms that are booming they dominate
the space in fact they have pretty much
destroyed all of their other competitors
as far as what people might want to
carry in their pockets both incredibly
successful and I think we can safely say
that both oh something to the other
platform let me tell you what I mean by
that innovation is not something that
happens in a vacuum in a single room
it's something that happens culturally
you know across the board somebody does
something better and others learn from
it and then they implement some of those
ideas in the things that they're doing
now one of the most common criticisms
you'll see from people when they're
talking about another platform that they
dislike is they'll say oh that
particular feature was copied from this
other platform now think about this from
it how ridiculous is it to get upset
about that all that all the greatest
things in life come from being
competent enough to see a change and say
oh that's better
let's do it that way if it was
agriculture or farming and some dude
down the road you know his corn is ten
feet taller you're like okay and what do
I need to do to make my corn like that
it's the same thing in technology man if
you want to be a fan okay a fan of
something be a fan of technology be a
fan of progress in general don't be a
fan of a logo that doesn't that doesn't
help you it doesn't help us it doesn't
help the entire ecosystem here now
brands might tell you otherwise brands
might say to you you know this is
special this is unique this is you need
to be affiliated with us and attached to
us forever and always but that's in
their best interest what's in your best
interest is to be loyal to other human
beings don't be loyal to some pieces of
metal and glass and plastic and
microchips and things like that if
somebody or some platform builds on top
of another one that's a good thing for
all of us applaud it be happy about it
now when this iPhone 5s launches you
know the thing that's been rumored for a
while I guarantee you people will be
saying there hasn't been enough change
they haven't improved enough things on
this device you know the stock is going
to drop and all this bullshit that goes
on after the fact change is not always a
necessity change for the sake of change
can actually be a problem and sometimes
forced change due to pressures you know
market pressures can actually make
things worse we live in a beautiful
world with many different options let's
continue to move in that direction
instead of getting stuck down in the
trenches here anyway guys as you can
tell I'm motivated about this maybe too
motivated about it but I have a unique
perspective given what I do on a day to
day basis and things I read on a day to
day basis so I don't want to influence
you too much don't take this for gospel
say whatever you want in the comment
section that's completely up to you but
if you want to take this into
consideration that would be appreciated
because I put some thought into this and
I felt compelled to make this video
anyway guys if you appreciated these
ramblings please feel free to leave a
thumbs up down below or share this video
if you haven't subscribed yet there will
be a lot of upcoming content we're going
to have iOS stuff coming up we're going
have Android stuff coming up and guess
what we're also going to have Windows
Phone stuff coming up so as you can see
I'm open to everything that's out on the
marketplace anyway guys that wraps up
this video thanks as always for watching
and I'll catch you on the next one later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
