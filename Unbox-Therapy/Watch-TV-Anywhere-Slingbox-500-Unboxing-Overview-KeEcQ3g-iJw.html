therapy and today we're taking a look at
the sling box 500 the latest and
greatest in a long line of sling box
products if you guys are unfamiliar with
the brand it'll allow you to watch your
TV anywhere now that might sound a
little bit complicated or confusing
trust me it isn't this device will
extend your living room TV experience in
full 1080p HD and it'll connect to a
number of different wireless devices so
you can watch that content from a PC Mac
tablet smartphone or maybe just another
TV if you want to sling it to another TV
in another premises maybe at your
cottage or maybe in your office like us
here if we if you want to watch some
live sports and you don't want to get
another cable subscription this is a
great really easy way of doing it so
this is the 500 model which is the top
of the range but they also make a 350
model which is a little bit more
affordable if you guys want to check out
pricing availability and compare the two
I will drop links down in the
description so you can do that now let's
get to the unboxing and talk about the
actual device the first thing that
strikes me is the design this is not
your standard set-top box instead
they've gone with a pretty cool wavy
design here so it's gonna look pretty
futuristic underneath your TV and you
get to get people asking about it saying
hey what the hell is that thing to say
it's my sling box dude on the back of
the device is where you'll notice all
the connectors you got component you've
also got standard resolution video
there's HDMI in and out you've got a
network connection point you got your
spot to connect the power cable all the
sort of standard stuff you're used to
seeing on a set-top box you've also got
some paperwork included and all the
cables that you're gonna need are
underneath I'm not gonna bore you too
much with the paperwork because this is
an unboxing video why would you need to
see the QuickStart guide the video is
the QuickStart guide but as you can see
they've included a bunch of cables which
is a good thing it means that you're
gonna be able to get up and running
quickly and that they have included
everything you will need you won't have
to be scrambling around looking for even
batteries even the batteries are in here
so over on the left hand side you'll
notice first you've got a network cable
that's always a positive thing next you
have the very important IR emitter cable
this is what's going to send the signal
from the sling box back
your DVR box so that it can input your
instructions from your remote control
you know over the internet that's how
you're gonna change channels access
on-demand you know get to the recorded
shows it's really how you're gonna
control everything so it's very
important there's also a standard video
cable and lastly a little sticky pad on
this side that's gonna be for securing
that IR emitter so it doesn't move
around and remains lined up with your
set-top box back at home now there's a
bunch more cables in here and this is a
good thing it means that you can connect
an interface with a number of different
televisions if they're a little bit
older maybe you've only got you know
component inputs or something like that
they've also included batteries as I
said before so that you can get your
remote control working right away here
is the component cable as well as a
standard stereo RCA cable and my
favorite the HDMI cable which believe it
or not isn't always included with
devices and I always complain about it
because it's just a couple more bucks
probably to them in volume is not even a
couple more bucks but HDMI is obviously
the cable of choice in this case you're
gonna get HD video as well as audio on
one clean cable so if your set-top box
supports HDMI I definitely recommend
using it so here's the remote control
for the sling box this is very important
because I don't see any hard controls
right on the box if you lose this you're
probably gonna be out of luck so
definitely keep track of that baby and
then lastly you have your power brick
for keeping the device powered now as I
said earlier I'm a fan of the design
it's hard to really say what it looks
like it looks kind of like a wave
formation or maybe a skateboard ramp you
know you can't really pinpoint what it
looks like but at least it's a little
bit more interesting than the average
component that you place under your
television I do appreciate a little bit
of extra design work it's always a
welcome thing I'll give you a few more
close-ups on the back of the device so
you can get a better idea of all the
inputs and outputs and you can decide
you know if this is gonna work for you
as I said before you've got components
standard definition picture which I
wouldn't recommend using you've also got
HDMI Network it's really everything you
need back there there's also a port of
course for that ever important IR
emitter that I mentioned earlier and the
USB can actually be used for connecting
external storage something that I do
want to mention before the videos over
is that you will need a
fairly chunky internet connection or at
least a decent enough internet
connection to stream HD seamlessly
you'll need about a two megabit
connection actually it's not that beefy
most people have it if you're gonna be
watching on mobile though that's
something to think about although on a
small screen you might not need Full HD
SD viewing can happen at 600 kilobits so
that's pretty damn cool anyway guys
that's been a quick look at the Slingbox
500 if you guys want to see more about
this maybe you want to see me connect it
hook it up I don't know definitely leave
a thumbs up down below maybe I'll
continue the content and coverage on
this device I want to thank you as
always for watching and I will catch you
guys on the next video and remember if
you're interested in pricing and
availability on this model or on the 350
model which is a little bit cheaper then

comparison
