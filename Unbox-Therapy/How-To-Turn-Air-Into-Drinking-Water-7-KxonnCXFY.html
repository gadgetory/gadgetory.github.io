about and asked myself is that really a
thing and that's the sign of a good
unbox therapy video when I have to
question whether or not the product that
somebody is pitching me is actually
going to do something that I find to be
surprising
now I'm no scientist I know it's hard to
believe but there's something I do know
about this machine right here and that
is the fact that it can make pure
filtered drinking water from the air let
that sink in for a minute
I'm sure some of your kids don't know
out there is there's moisture in the air
if you could only capture that you'd
have all the water you ever needed eight
gallons of water or 30 liters of water
in one single day that's what it will
pull out of the air it's not plugged
into plumbing you're not putting a a
water tank on top of it you can use this
thing in the desert you could use this
thing off the grid you Colo blue water
from air let's crack this open
fancy whoa it's equipped with a 12 stage
water from air filtration system
includes carbon filters a mineral filter
a reverse osmosis membrane a post-carbon
filter and three Phillips UV
sterilization lamps depending on your
environment the humidity level that will
determine how much water you can create
but as I said before it's up to eight
gallons or 30 litres a day that this
thing can pull out of the atmosphere so
it looks like yeah oh these are the
various filters here that's pretty wild
these guys don't only just make at home
units like this but also industrial
units that are much bigger than this
look it's got an air filter on it this
looks like the UV filter okay so it's
been sort of roughly 48 hours since this
thing was plugged in in the early stages
which you actually want to do what this
thing is flush it out with with normal
municipal water so you fill up the back
tank where the UV filter is and it kind
of flushes it through the system at
which point then it begins to generate
water from the air and the thing that I
noticed immediately was that its ability
to generate water is highly dependent on
how humid your environment is roughly 48
hours it was able to get a full tank now
that tank is about 30 liters so it's a
lot of water now it should be obvious
that this thing uses electricity so it's
not like you're getting this water for
free you're having to pay to run this
machine so there is a cost associated
with that a couple of other cool things
about this particular machine is that it
can do both cold and hot so it has
refrigeration as well and you can see on
the front here you have a cold button
and a hot button another thing I realize
is you can connect carbonation to this
if you like some bubbly water as I like
to call it you can hook up a canister in
here which will actually give you a
third option beyond just cold and hot
you can now add carbonation for a little
bit more of a treat this indicator will
let you know when the system is actually
generating water these raindrops will be
falling down they'll tell you when you
need to replace filters it'll also tell
you how much water you have in both the
bottom tank and
top tank so this system down here is
responsible for giving you that clean
solution sediment pre carbon membrane
mineral filter post-carbon by the time
your water is through here there's
nothing left in it that could be a
contaminant so what do you say Jack
should we give it a taste hold this
button on the cold your nice clear glass
of water who's also cold and I gotta say
it's pretty amazing I'm drinking
something that was trapped in the air
which is now in my glass I know to some
scientists in the crowd you're like
what's the big deal yeah of course
there's moisture in the air but the idea
of a machine like this this can consider
in your office and you're not lugging
any water in here it's pretty amazing to
actually experiment with from a cost to
performance ratio
this isn't like magical it's this still
a cost associated with it that you
should be aware of but I think as an
alternative as a backup and to service
places that might not have access or to
avoid the abundance of bottles of water
you know the whole ecosystem that exists
there for waste and so on that's really
where this thing comes in I think this
is for anybody who wants a
self-sustaining water production system
anyone who's off the system who doesn't
have municipal water access to water in
places that are deprived of water places
like the west coast in cottages it would
be awesome to have these up there where
you might be concerned about the the
quality of water but if you can find a
way to get power to these there it is
you have clean water now to enjoy
I thought it was cool I think you might
think the same water from nothing water
from the air eco low blue check them out
this is not the only machine they make
and who knows this might be the future
of water right here</div></body></html>
