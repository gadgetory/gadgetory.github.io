brand new video and today we're going to
be talking about the newly released iPad
air 2 I've also got the original iPad
air here for a comparison there are of
course some improvements to the new iPad
is it going to be worth your while worth
your upgrade of course this unboxing
will hopefully help you decide the new
version includes touch ID now it's a
little bit thinner a little bit faster
otherwise fairly similar so without any
more hesitation let's go ahead and get
this baby sliced open now this is the 16
gigabyte Wi-Fi version so the base model
there are of course bigger versions
available 64 gigabytes 128 as you can
see on the front of the box here an
incredibly slim design everyone seems to
be working towards this ultra thin kind
of a look is it what consumers are
asking for I'm not really sure everyone
I talked to seems to think that extended
battery life would be more important so
yes it's definitely thinner though is it
really that significant hmm okay let me
put this other one down for a moment
finish this unboxing have the usual
plastic covering the actual iPad this is
the Space Gray version of course it's
also available in silver and gold you
have your eye sight camera on the back
as well as a microphone in that location
on the bottom is where you're going to
find your speaker as well as the
Lightning port for charging up the
device the touch ID lives on the front
here similar to the iPhone 6 6 plus 5s
they all feature a similar or exactly
the same touch ID you have your forward
facing camera volume buttons are on the
side and the power switch is up on the
top inside the box we have the usual
goodies from Apple including the power
brick which is a 10 watt a little tip
here is you can use this power brick to
charge up your iPhone as well and you
can get a slightly quicker charge by
using that slightly larger more powerful
brick we have the paperwork from Apple
which we have now seen many many times
warranty information
the world-famous legendary Apple
stickers as well and then a lightning
cable to get your device charged sync
etc here is the actual iPad which I'm
going to go ahead and boot up quickly
basically identical to the previous
version other than the fact that you
have a slimmer design the main story
here is the fact that they've gotten it
even thinner than before fairly marginal
to be honest with you I mean you can
tell when you're holding it a little bit
almost forgot to mention the previous
version had a hold switch orientation
lock the new version does away with that
likely due to the slimmer form factor
honestly guys not a massive difference
here of course I can tell the difference
I could identify with my eyes closed
which is which but is it really worth
the upgrade if you've got the previous
version iPad air I would say no only
because this is a very marginal and
iterative update unless you really need
touch ID or maybe if you're a heavy
gamer and you could take advantage of
the faster processor then maybe you want
to go ahead and go with the latest one
but otherwise if you can find a cheap
deal on the original iPad air that might
be a better bet for a significant
portion of users anyways so there you
have it the unboxing of the brand new
iPad air 2 can you tell which is which
which is old which is new you're not
going to sit here with the original iPad
air wishing that you have a slightly
thinner version or maybe you are there's
a lot of people that are early adopters
and touch ID on an iPad not nearly as
valuable as having it on a phone for
example which you have in your pocket
and is out in public more often I mean
it does depend on the way that you use
your iPad but for me mine is primarily
used at home alright guys that wraps up
