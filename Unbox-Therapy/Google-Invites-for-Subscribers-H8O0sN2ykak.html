here and as the title above implies I
think I've got a few Google+ invites to
send out to people and what better
people to do it for then the unbox
therapy community of course so if you
guys aren't on that social network yet
then feel free to hit me with your email
address either in the comment section or
if you don't feel comfortable doing that
then you can send it to my youtube inbox
just put something about the Google+
invite in the title so that I can sort
through it easily and then I'll send you
guys an invite so long as they remain I
don't think there's a limitation I don't
see a number at this point and so far
everybody I've invited has been able to
get on straight away so hopefully this
continues for a while and hopefully you
can get one but like I said the sooner
you jump on it the better your chances
so go ahead and shoot me that
information and then come join us on
that social network over there I'm
probably going to do some kind of a
review on Google+ maybe in the coming
weeks as after I sort of learned how to
use it etc and I'll probably tell you
what I like and what I don't like
but there's no doubt having used it for
maybe 48 hours now no not even 48 hours
that it's a major player and it'll be
interesting to see how Facebook evolves
and adapt to sort of incorporate some of
the user interface that it looks like
Google+ has pioneered anyway guys don't
want to bore you with that stuff yet and
especially since you're not on the
network yet so go ahead and do that and
I'll see you over there until next time
guys thanks for watching</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
