with another video about the BenQ joy
bgp - that's that little mini projector
that i unboxed recently and is also part
of this contest now I'm down here in the
family room you can tell by the funky
drapes in the back here and I've got the
gp2 with me and that's because I'm going
to do something really cool and exciting
with it now that contest you know you
guys were congratulating me for winning
and you came out in droves and supported
me on the first video on the unboxing
video but believe it or not that contest
is not over it's five weeks long and
there's a prize for every week so you
can resubmit a new video every time now
I figured that you guys would probably
get behind me again since you came out
so crazy on the first one so I'm going
to drop a link down below where you guys
can vote for this video now because we
need to get this one up to the same
point that the last one was and to me
this one's probably even a little bit
more exciting for some of you and that's
because if you look closely at the frame
over here you're not only going to see
the BenQ projector but you're also going
to see a games console down there an
Xbox 360 the Gears of War Xbox 360 so I
figured why not show you guys what this
little projector can do when hooked up
to a games console on any wall in your
house in your living room wherever you
want to put it in fact on this wall
right over here which you guys can't see
right now I have a 46 inch Sony flat
panel and I'm going to be projecting
right next to it to show you the
difference to show you the impact of
what a projector can do now this little
projector happens to be a great solution
for gaming because of the fact that it's
an LED projector it's got this crazy
lamp like 30 thousand hours that's a lot
of game playing in the past you know you
didn't want to wear out your bulb so you
didn't want to have long gaming sessions
on your projector with this one that's
not the case it's very well suited as a
gaming device also because it's got HDMI
on it right here this one little cable
it's a mini HDMI to HDMI connector
that's all you need to interface your
games console whether it be your ps3 or
xbox 360 with this particular projector
so super cool in a number of ways let's
get right to it I'm going to waste
more of your time remember the link to
help me out and vote again and help me
in this contest is right down in the
description but let's get into the
gameplay I'm going to spin this camera
around turn the lights off and show you
what this baby can do one second here we
go
alright so here it is booted up and I've
got it next to my 46 inch Sony and right
away you can see it Dwarfs it it's very
hard for me to portray through video
just how impressive this screen size is
I went ahead and booted up a little bit
of Halo anniversary here to give you
guys a quick impression now normally
you'd have the lights off completely but
in order to give you context against the
regular flat panel I kept a lamp on over
to the right hand side but this is
ridiculously immersive I have to tell
you guys if you have this kind of money
it's about 500 bucks to invest in
something for gaming get-togethers or
just you know even for yourself with
30,000 hours this makes a legitimate
case against a traditional TV assuming
you have access to a dark room on a
regular basis because this experience is
amazing it's unlike anything that a
regular flat panel can give you just
because of the size I mean I think we're
looking at almost a hundred inches in
comparison to the diagonal measurement
of that Sony which is just about 50 or
maybe even a little bit more this thing
can actually be blown up to 160 inches
maximum so if you got a wall that big
then you can get catch it came that big
but anyways it was hard for me to to
show you guys how big this is so I
decided to get up step in front of the
camera here I'm not a small dude I'm
about six feet tall so this is no joke I
mean if you sit in front of this thing
you feel like you feel like you're at
the movie theater but for games I mean
it's incredible anyways if you guys
enjoyed this content hopefully can like
and favorite this video and also
remember I'm still in this contest this
is still going on
if you don't mind click the link in the
description and make sure to vote for
this video I know you guys already voted
for the other one so it shouldn't be too
hard for you guys to help me out on this
one and remember keep voting until your
fingers are bleeding nah just kidding
whatever you guys can do to help me out
is incredibly appreciate it and I
appreciate you just for watching this
even if you don't want to go vote so
