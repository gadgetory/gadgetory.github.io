therapy and this is a cardboard box yes
but there's something very exciting
inside it is a color conversion kit from
Z Tron for your iPhone 4 and coming soon
your iPhone 4s this is for those of you
that like to personalize the appearance
of your electronics and I want to set
your device apart after all the iPhone
being such a ubiquitous device got when
everybody seen one so on and so forth
all the more reason to make it your own
and the conversion kit I've got here
from Z Tron is the metallic silver
they've got many colors to choose from
they've got red blue they've got gold
for the the major bling players and what
you're gonna want to do is check out
their website I'll put a link down in
the description once again the company's
called is e-tron I want to thank them
for sending me this product and yeah you
can see if any of those colors suits
your taste
they also offer a send in service if you
prefer for them to do the work after all
this might be a little bit intimidating
to some but for me I enjoy the challenge
so let's go ahead and see if I can get
inside this is the newer style iPhone 4
they've lost the Phillips screws you
don't have this very special type of
screw but z tron will send you a
screwdriver to deal with it and once
you've got those removed the back panel
slides off i'm not going to show you
guys every step of the procedure because
there are many but i'll give you a look
at some of the easier ones to do because
after you slide the back panel off
everything gets more difficult you've
basically got to pull every component
out of this unit the logic board the
battery the camera you name it so it's
not going to be for the faint of heart
again this is for people who feel
comfortable inside of these kinds of
devices dealing with super uber small
screws I'm talking smaller than an ant
and probably about 40 of them so again
if you really want to have this done if
you want to personalize the flavor of
your iPhone and you don't feel like
dipping into your iPhone the way I am
here then definitely choose the send in
service you know for the peace of mind
they're not going to mess it up so
anyway these are the easier steps I
won't get into the more difficult
Booya the finished product just like on
a cooking show look at me it's all done
and ready to go you're not the wait and
as you guys can see it's got a super
reflective shiny silver finish to it and
it's definitely going to stand out you
can't say it won't it's not going to be
to everyone's taste like I said they've
got a lot of different colors on their
website maybe something will suit your
taste but again this is for people who
want something different you know
obviously if you're satisfied with the
original color then you're going to
stick to it but this is going to give
you that little extra Flair that you
were hoping for when you chose the
iPhone who knows maybe one day they'll
ship them in different colors but until
then we're out here on our own you know
if we want to uh if we want to do
something special to them so anyway guys
I hope you enjoyed this video as always
if you enjoyed the content hopefully you
can like and favorite it and definitely
check out Z Tron's website
it's down in the description as I said
before after all they sent this to me
and I really you know hope you guys can
go give them a hit at least and check
out what's available so anyway guys if
you haven't checked out my new channel
that's one last thing my new channel is
called the beast feed once again that's
youtube.com slash beast feed that's my
news channel and a lot of people from
this channel have moved over there
definitely come check it out if you
don't mind and until next time and as
always thanks for watching I'll see you
