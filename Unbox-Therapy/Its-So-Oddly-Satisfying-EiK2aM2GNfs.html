to show up here at unbox therapy you
guys know that there's an address just
published on the YouTube about page and
people they just they go they see it and
they're like you know what I want to
send something to Lou
sometimes it's something very expensive
very high-tech other times it's a
chocolate bar you never know what you're
going to get I appreciate everything
that comes through there though
seriously so does Jack Jack even Jack
gets a lot of nice letters so if you
feel like you need to say something to
Jack you can send that to that address
as well but also I get stuff I never
knew about I get stuff I never heard
about these little things in front of me
are apparently blowing up everybody
loves them I've never seen one before
I've never tried one before they're
called fidget spinners I'm telling you
I'm just learning about this right now
as we go I got a note from a friend of
mine he's actually not a friend I mean
he knows me I don't know him I know him
now the company is digit spinners from
the village of Wellington small village
Wellington she apparently also in
Ontario so he's not too far away
apparently these things are super
popular right now for people who like to
fidget if you're wanting people I'm one
of these people I got my leg the leg is
tapping all the time right up you should
see me what does this piece say adda VHD
one of these can apparently help it's
like a stress reliever now you've
probably seen spinning tops before this
is like a different take on a spinning
top you don't need a platform to spin it
on its spins in your hands you keep this
in your pocket you're fidgeting with the
fidget spinner and apparently it is a
very satisfying experience now they
don't look like much they look kind of
bizarre actually I believe you hold it
there like Oh hohoho there's ball
bearings in there you hold it there like
that and then you spin it and of course
it spins way longer than you expect it
to and it makes this very satisfying
noise listen
oh ho ho and you and you know what you
do you keep looking for the perfect spin
they're all a craze right now alright
these things are blowing up here's a
different style how do I hold this one
hold it right here okay oh this one this
one's more precise oh you got to hold
that one well that's like an unbalanced
one there's nothing satisfying to me
about this one
Oh do you see now that I got no adb
anymore I'm cured I'm probably doing it
wrong people are going to tell me I'm
doing it wrong why is this so satisfying
the sound or the smoothness of it
alright hold up there's one more in here
and it looks the most elaborate look at
that one mmm absolute champion right
there the key is it has to be perfectly
balanced weight wise so each peg has to
be identical to the other side it has to
be balanced and then on the inside you
have a ball bearing you know something
like you would normally have on a
skateboard or something like that so if
I spin it around and then put my finger
horizontal look at this
I shouldn't balance it right there like
that she does yeah like that
boom
oh man are you picking that up jack how
satisfying that it like how badly you
want to spend one of these right now and
and and meanwhile you're like but I
don't get any to spinning I'm telling
you you got to try it you got to spin
the thing and then you realize you put
one of these in your desk at work I feel
like you could deal with all the stress
in the world
give her a good swing you just like you
know what it's going to be alright just
spinning like the universe right now to
eat man I feel like I'm understanding
the craze now this is what I'm here to
do I'm here to tell you when the new
craze hit bring it to you first on unbox
therapy I mean I'm pretty sure we're not
first here but now you know it's not
going to solve real problems in right
get your life together you got to wake
up in the morning you can't like
completely neglect your responsibility
you can't not take the garbage out just
because you have a fidget spinner here
but when you need a little pick-me-up
you take a sip of coffee take your
spinner</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
