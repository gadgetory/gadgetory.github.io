another video you got will because I
really think he's gonna enjoy this
package that's sitting in front of us he
doesn't know what's inside are you
excited to find out what okay let's go
ahead jump inside the box like we
normally do and see what it is and then
hopefully set it up and try it out you
wanna do that part do what all right
okay so this is a big box this is
probably well this is definitely the
biggest box you and I have open together
for sure Oh huge I told you
wow that over there okay oh you know
what it is yet yeah this well is called
the Anki Drive and it is one of the most
sophisticated race car games
that exists in the world these are
intelligent cars that drive around this
giant track and have a race oh wow okay
oh geez out first I'll go to college I
think so this is how they charge up see
how there's like a little USB port there
so that's how you're gonna charge up the
cars whoa kind of looks like a
Lamborghini whoa okay one check out the
other ones walk
so lots of cool colors in the box here I
a wanted this one do you have to hold
them
no they drive on their own they're smart
these cars are smart you see on the
bottom there you see how they have this
little sensor well that's what that is
inside of there that's why you charge
them up they actually know where they
are on the track so they have very
intelligent races with one another you
have to turn the little toy huh
no you don't even need to they're just
smart they have their own brain sort of
is that crazy you'll see how this works
when we set it up this one about to find
out cable cables but here's something
really cool what you have is you have
one usb on on one end and then on the
other end you have three micro USBs so
you can charge three cars at a time dr.
bad news not good to lose a knife in a
movie oh boy
now we need a bigger spot than this
table okay now we're gonna search for
Anki a nki Anki Drive it's downloading
downloading right now so I guess pickle
so as you guys can tell from that last
clip we've had an absolute blast playing
with Anki Drive it's this really
interesting merging of the virtual video
game style world along with the physical
world actual cars driving around a track
getting up and running is really easy to
do
you've got the Anki Drive application
here which will allow for you to play
through a couple of different modes
either race mode battle mode or practice
mode although there is even battling
within the race mode your car is
equipped with weaponry that you can fire
off through this application and that
was probably the most fun element trying
to disable your competitors by shooting
at them and your competitors trying to
disable you so one of the main things
you want to upgrade very shortly after
starting the game is your weaponry and
your shields so you're disabled less
often and therefore you can win the
races it's a really cool implementation
and it actually reminded me a little bit
of Mario Kart you know when you're
trying to hit the other racers with
shells and other weapons etc except this
time you're doing it with cars and where
you get to see a physical reaction to
you shooting them you get to see them
stop in the middle of the track as you
whizzed by and one of you guys is
actually gonna have that experience as
well because I've got an extra Anki
Drive right beside me for one lucky
viewer it's dead simple all you got to
do is be a subscriber and go and follow
Anke drive on instagram I will link them
down in the description actually all the
details will be down in the description
so one lucky viewer you get your own
Anki Drive alright guys that wraps up
