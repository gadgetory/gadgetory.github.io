the clip head over to the link in the
description let's head over to Amazon

Ultimate Ears for 99 bucks if you caught
my video on this you know this thing
creates beautiful sounds now you do need
to buy the white one it's the last one
left available at $99 so if you're cool
with the the white color $99 for a UE
boom
that's easy that's an easy choice this
is another speaker we're in the speaker
Department right now this is the Eton
rugged ruckus
this one is solar-powered with bluetooth
it has a solar panel on top that charges
it but also charges all your other
devices so you can be outside washing
the car charging up your phone playing
back some music 47 bucks regular 130
gold box dealing today it's two
different sets of headphones my
recommendation out of these two is the
sennheiser HD 598 these are incredible
headphones for ninety five dollars
regular price listed at two hundred and
fifty what on the left hand side we have
the bose soundtrue headphones $74.99
regular 179 we're gonna keep it in the
headphone department these are the extra
base bluetooth headphones from sony
they're $100 off for bass heads people
who want to rattle their skull not about
style here it is all about bass moving
off of headphones and into storage
everything from SanDisk is on sale
whether that means a $59 internal SSD or
a flash drive micro SD card slot you can
see 128 gigabyte microSD for 39 bucks
128 gigabyte USB 3 flash drive for 28
bucks let's move over to the world of
power I think everybody who has a
PlayStation 4 should have one of these
it's a little dock for charging up your
controller so you don't forget to charge
them and you don't have cables going
everywhere you just find a little home
for that clip it on no problemo so it's
20 to 99 it's regular 35 it'll charge
two controllers keep your controllers
charged without even thinking about it
another power device it has a little
stand 5 USB ports 50 Watts 10 amps can
charge tablets phones and with the
little stand there you can keep your
device nearby at night you can keep
juice by the bed and who doesn't want
juice by the bed apple juice orange this
thing I love it is a pivoting power
strip it's small it's like this big
14.99 I've talked about it before some
surge protection 3 outlets that pivot
then you get 2 USBS as well plus it
supports 2.1 and up until this point
this is my favorite little power strip
surge protector to take with me and it's
only 49
this one is in here because it's just
insanely cheap a laptop backpack with a
dedicated laptop pouch for $12.99 I
don't know it's made by targets though
great reviews and $12.99 go tell your
parents you need lunch money and buy a
backpack I don't know what you can do
about the food you probably still need
the food that's not okay don't do that a
hat a knit beanie hat for the winter
which has a Bluetooth headset built into
it what comes in a bunch of different
colors regular 50 bucks for 29 it's just
in the Hat ears are warm and toasty
everybody's asking me about TVs I just
want to say some I've been messing
around with the 4k OLED stuff you know
that you probably caught the video if
you didn't you should go back and watch
it OLED is crazy it is so much better to
my eyes than the stuff previously
available now we actually have
attainable OLED for a reasonable price
if you're looking to make an upgrade on
a television for like the next 10 years
you should seriously consider it these
are not the best deals in the world I'm
talking about a $5,000 TV for the 65
inch model but if you can do it if you
can step up to the 4k OLED you're about
to change your life it's gonna be
state-of-the-art for a long time if you
can afford one of these go for it if you
can't and you must have a TV I did pick
something fairly affordable over here a
43 inch 4k LED TV from LG and this is
three hundred and ninety seven bucks if
you just want to get something in 4k so
you can watch unbox therapy videos in 4k
you could do this TV right here for 397
but don't forget what I just told you if
you're all about that bleeding edge see
if you can reach into the bank account
and make something happen on that OLED
flip a couple burgers if you have to do
it all in the name of OLED alright that
wraps it up don't forget the D brand
thing go watch the clip the clip is
crazy maybe I'll see you at the NBA
all-star game
get yourself a skin alright that's it
