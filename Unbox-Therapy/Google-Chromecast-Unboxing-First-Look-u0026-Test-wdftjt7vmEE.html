picked up the brand new chromecast which
was announced yesterday and there was
some next-day shipping available on
Amazon but they sold out pretty quickly
I don't know if there are any remaining
right now but I will link it down in the
description so you can check the pricing
and availability at the time that you're
watching this this thing is 35 bucks and
it claims to do some pretty impressive
things for that price I'm excited to
check it out see how it operates see how
it works as you can see on the back here
promises to give you you know your usual
smartphone functionality on your
television
you've got Chrome capabilities YouTube
capabilities Netflix and anything from
the Google Play Store and it does all of
that in an incredibly tiny little device
I wanted to do a really quick unboxing
because it is such a brand new device
this is the thing this is all you need
this little guy right here it looks
about the size of a USB key and it has
an HDMI on one side a micro USB on the
other side and then what looks like a
little button and then what looks like a
little but yeah and then a little button
as well probably the power button not
100% sure but that's the device that
does all the magic you will need USB
power for it so I assume that's the
other part that's inside of here plug it
in attach USB power switch the input set
it up and you are good to go yeah so
here's the other items in the box you
have a USB cable a tiny little USB power
brick right here and then lastly you
have an HDMI extender so I guess if your
HDMI port is not all that accessible or
you can't fit the dongle in there you
have a an option to extend it using this
HDMI extender and then there's a tiny
little manual that I almost missed in
there a tiny little manual for it but I
don't think I'm gonna read that I don't
think I need to because judging from the
getting started guide on the inside here
it looks pretty damn simple so I'm gonna
go ahead connect it to this flat panel
over here and see what it can do I
decided to hook it up to this smaller TV
actually because I thought it would be
easier to demonstrate the setup process
since the HDMI port is kind of hidden on
this one I did need to use the extender
and I do want to mention it gets on
there real tight so it's probably not
gonna come off by accident if you do
need
use the extension and then on the other
end you have a little LED light that
will tell you if the device has power
you use the little USB to get that baby
going now setup is a little bit finicky
you can only do so right now with a few
different devices or actually a number
of different devices you can use Mac OS
10 point 7 and beyond I believe as well
as Windows PC and then Android mobile
devices in my case I'm using a laptop
here and you have to navigate yourself
to google.com slash chromecast slash
setup and after that it'll pretty much
get going on its own it's pretty simple
you just click Next Next hook into your
wireless network put in your password
and then the chromecast will be
available to you there is an extension
that you install into your browser into
Chrome which will then give you the
ability to broadcast whatever it is that
you're seeing in Chrome whether that
means a tab or YouTube video you can
still see the authentication process
here it asks you to match up the two
codes on each of your two devices and of
course mine were matching so that
allowed me to move on to the next step
but after that you're pretty much ready
to cast as it says on the screen it will
remain in that state until you push
something over to it so you have a
couple of different options if you're on
YouTube for example right in the YouTube
video on the bottom portion there is a
capture a cast button sorry and you can
click that button and then just cast the
video portion of your page or if you
want to get fancy you can cast the
entire Chrome tab so if you're on a site
like Amazon for example I just did this
for an example of course you can see me
scrolling through here there's a tiny
bit of lag but actually pretty damn
useful and I can see myself using this
for a number of different applications
so you can either cast a tab and see
your entire web browser or you can cast
an independent video but everything is
pretty seamless and much quicker than I
expected it to be especially for a $35
device this thing is actually pretty
impressive the story is exactly the same
on your mobile device in this case on my
Nexus 4 I opened up YouTube and boom the
button was there so I could start
casting from my nexus 4 as well I've
been told or I've read sorry that there
should be an iOS
app coming out shortly as well so you
can start to use some of that
functionality too but anyways it's
working right now on Nexus devices other
Android devices and on my laptop I think
the killer functionality for me is from
my laptop to broadcast a real YouTube
experience up to a bigger display and
then still have the inherent YouTube
functionality that comes with using a
laptop like commenting rating and all
those important elements that you can't
currently get in a lot of the television
based YouTube apps so anyway guys that
wraps up this first look at the
chromecast from Google $35 and you're
getting a somewhat like an Apple TV
experience this is a pretty compelling
product as I said earlier in the video
you can check out the links in the
description I hope it's still not sold
out though it might be if you guys

and then what looks like a little button</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
