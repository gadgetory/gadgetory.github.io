therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Star Wars Kinect limited edition
Xbox 360 console bundle
you've got the r2d2 style console
included along with the matching Kinect
sensor done up in a stormtrooper looking
white and then you've got the c-3po
style controller which has a gold-plated
appearance to it those are the special
inclusions you've of course also got the
Star Wars game you've got a 320 gigabyte
hard drive included you've got that
chintzy Xbox LIVE headset that I'm
always hating on I probably shouldn't be
at least to get something to get you
started on live let's talk about the
unboxing let's take a look at what's
included the first thing that's going to
greet you is this little booklet here
which says Kinect Star Wars on it as you
open it up you'll see some boring setup
information to stop you from kicking
your TV when using Kinect telling you to
place at a safe distance away of course
and then you've got a poster a
commemorative Star Wars Kinect poster
featuring both r2d2 c-3po and a little
picture of your newly purchased console
on the bottom so here is that console I
just mentioned I'm going to put that to
the side for a quick second in order to
remove the other items that are in the
box here here is that game that I
mentioned it is not packaged for
individual sale of course only for use
with this bundle and it will only work
with Kinect it does require Kinect
you've also got Kinect Adventures which
is included I believe with all Kinect
bundles and then a little bit more
paperwork from Microsoft telling you to
get your avatar up and running next
we've got the gargantuan power adapter
from Microsoft and I'm sure you've seen
one of these before if you haven't here
it is I'm not going to bother opening it
up it's basically the size of a brick is
that why they call it a power brick next
you've got the power cable which plugs
into that gargantuan adapter and this is
kind of a pet peeve of mine these
console manufacturers still include only
composite cables no HDMI cable could you
imagine what it would cost to throw an
HDMI cable in here I mean keep the
composit cable for people on old-school
TVs just throw
the hdmi-in as well I mean this I've
actually seen people you know rocking an
HDTV proper flat-panel and using the
composit cables only because those were
what was included you're giving people
the wrong idea here Microsoft and I'm
looking at you to Sony so anyways here's
the head unit I was mentioning earlier
and it's got a little bit of padding
along the neck so it doesn't receive a
broken neck in transit and you've got
the chrome Xbox 360 logo along the front
this nice white finish which is going to
be good because it probably won't have
too many fingerprints attracted to it or
dust or anything like that not like
glossy black I'm sure you guys all know
glossy black is tough to keep clean here
is that el cheapo headset that I
mentioned before and I really shouldn't
hate on Microsoft because they do give
you something to get up and running on
Xbox Live unlike their competitors and
here is that gold-plated controller at
least it appears gold-plated guys this
is not actually gold-plated obviously
and I think it's pretty cool-looking you
know you can see me waving in the
reflection it is super reflective in
this unlike the Kinect sensor probably
will get fingerprints all over it on the
bottom you've got the exposed wiring
which is c-3po esque
and that's also where you can connect
your headset of course just like on any
Xbox 360 controller I think this is one
of the cooler looking of the collectors
edition controllers you've also got the
new rotatable d-pad which I think all
new controllers are shipping with very
cool looking very unique definitely
going to get noticed sitting on your
desk or in your living room the back is
a little bit more boring all you've got
is this matte black finish but that's
okay it'll probably be durable unlike
some other finishes so as you guys know
I've unboxed a number of different
collectors and editions including Gears
of War modern warfare 3 so on and so
forth one thing I did want to mention is
that the other two editions that I've
unboxed included two controllers whereas
the Star Wars Edition here only has the
one might have something to do with it
being a Kinect bundle unlike the other
two so you're also going to get some
Duracell batteries included to get that
controller up and running but enough
about all those items let's talk about
the main attraction of course that is
the r2d2 looking console right here I
think it looks pretty bad
ass let me know down in the comments
what you think you've got the Star Wars
insignia along the side as you can see
there including you know some cool
geometric shapes cut out along the
different venting patterns etc the top
trim is not a super high gloss or
anything like that instead it's a more
sort of dull metallic looking finish
even though it's plastic I'm just
talking about the way the finish appears
here's the front of the unit of course
you've got the Xbox 360 logo on the disc
drive your power button a couple of USB
ports of course for your different
peripherals and as I flip it over to the
back here I'll give you an idea of the
i/o you've got of course the industrial
automation logo in the bottom right
corner and to the left of that is where
all your ports are you've got three USB
s your Kinect input as well as an
Internet input if you're not using
Wireless of course you've got an AV in
and out and the HDMI port that I wish
you could use out of the box without
having to take a trip to the store
alright I'm going to chill out on that
topic guys sorry the top is simple
you've just got some venting which is
done in the white coloring so here's a
look at the game it's actually got two
discs inside I didn't know that we've
got the game disc as well as a game demo
disc probably has something to do with
the fact that this was developed by
Microsoft Studios and then on the left
hand side is where you're going to find
all your paperwork including some
unexpected DLC you're going to get the
bonus c-3po character for Star Wars
dance mode I know you guys excited about
that don't pretend you're not some more
warning information about using Kinect
man these guys really don't want you to
put a hole in your TV I can't blame them
and then of course the Kinect Adventures
game which I'm not going to unwrap here
because I've done it on numerous
unboxing so your next question is does
it make the special sounds hell yes it
does it sounds like r2d2 it doesn't just
look like them so there's different
sounds for opening the disc drive and of
course powering on and shutting it down
so very cool overall if you're if you're
a big fan if you're a collector then
you're definitely going to want to take
a look at this it's even got a little
secret on the inside of this trailer you
can read it there you go you got r2d2
talking to obi-wan
so anyway guys if you're a big star Wars
fan or if you're looking for an Xbox 360
right now you want to get something a
little different then this console might
be for you you might want to take a look
at it and one more thing if you guys
