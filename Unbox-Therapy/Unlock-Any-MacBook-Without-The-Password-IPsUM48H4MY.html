Twitter or following the tech news
recently then you might not know that
something very serious happened last
night I guess so sort of in exploit and
it's not even really an exploit because
it seems too simple it's a problem
essentially on every single Apple
computer running the latest software
running hi Sierra you can get in to
anybody's laptop without the password
it's incredibly simple to do anyone
could do it you could do it it's not
just a local scenario where a person
gets in front of your laptop and unlocks
it without you knowing this could also
be an issue on public Wi-Fi if you might
have screen sharing turned on for
example and someone can come in and
potentially access your device remotely
now the reason for making this video
isn't strictly to show people how it
happens
but also to inform you so that hopefully
you can make the changes necessary so
you're not susceptible but also so you
can share it and let anybody in your
life with a macbook know that they need
to update their system real quick so I'm
using wills laptop he updated his to
high sierra and let me show you what i'm
talking about so i'm logged in right now
but if i go to system preferences users
and groups you'll see will is the only
admin on the system but if i click this
little lock in the corner here get rid
of wills username and just type root all
lowercase and then enter it unlocks the
whole system I can do anything now I
could change his password I could create
new users I have complete access now you
might be saying well he's already logged
in so is that really such an issue well
let me take it a step further for you if
I log out of wills account and then just
pick a guest user for example as a guest
user you should have no authority
whatsoever but if I go back up here now
to System Preferences users and groups I
hit the same lock icon use the username
root again no password it unlocks the
whole deal so I can select wills user
now and reset his password completely I
could set it to anything I want all of
Wells information is available to me
everything he's got in there
it's a complete unlock I'm in I got
access to all what are you trying to
hide well but all joking aside this is
serious stuff this is like the highest
level type of issue you could ever run
into all your passwords anybody out
there with a password on a Mac running
this version of High Sierra you have no
security right now essentially no
security now the word is that Apple's
aware of this and they're issuing a
software update so the main thing here
is go and look on your system right now
if you're on high sierra and look for a
new security patch if it's there it will
say in some kind of heading like
important update do this right away
alternatively you can change the
password to the root account of your
system which seems like a good idea
right now so just add a password to that
user that isn't a blank field obviously
so there it is a little public service
announcement run the update if it's
there and as I said let people know all
right
everybody knows somebody with a MacBook
so tell them they've been otherwise
they're out there like a sitting duck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
