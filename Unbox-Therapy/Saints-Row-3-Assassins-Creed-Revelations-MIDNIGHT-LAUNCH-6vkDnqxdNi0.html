another midnight launch it seems like
these things go on every week well they
have actually gone on every week year in
November all the games companies are
trying to get their content out before
the holidays and I'm out here for
Assassin's Creed as well as saints row
the third and some Halo combo pack that
I don't think I'm going to pick up and
the other thing I want to mention is
that the Saints Row Edition there's a
special edition called the Platinum Pack
and it comes with the headset well my
Evie games up here as well as the game
stops up here are not going to be
carrying that platinum pack so I got to
pick that up tomorrow from Best Buy so
tonight it looks like it's just going to
be Assassin's Creed and to be honest
with you guys this particular launch
looks a lot less busy than the other
launches I've been to recently the
modern warfare launch comes to mind as
well as the battlefield launch this one
is more laid-back more subdued there are
a few people in the store there's nobody
lined up out front here I'll give you
guys a quick look so as you can see I'll
give you a zoom in there's really nobody
out front although they have let maybe
half a dozen people inside so like 6
people but there are a few cars lined up
as you can see over here so some people
care but it ain't any a Call of Duty
game you know you know that those games
just got a crazy following as you guys
know and these ones are you know not not
as big at least not for now but it's
unbox therapy so of course I'm gonna be
here the last thing I want to talk about
is my tip I got a tip for all you people
who come out here to these midnight
launches I've got a special meal a
special meal that I like to bring along
on these things first and foremost beef
jerky you gotta have the beef jerky for
the protein energy and then also of
course vitamin water you got to stay
hydrated this is a tough gig being out
here staking out these midnight releases
as you guys knows so that's my tip
anyway guys until the unboxings until
the content is up on the channel I'll
see you around later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
