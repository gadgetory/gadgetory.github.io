this this is kind of a highly requested
device when I first spotted I was like
that's an interesting design they've got
there I would love to take a look so I
think did you get in touch with these
people will he do will he do ladies and
gentlemen to the rescue as usual he
reached out to Oppo we have the Renault
check this guy out as you guys know I
recently switched smartphones I'm back
into the Android universe for the time
being and who knows maybe this one is
compelling enough to justify a switch
over to this one next
alright so 10x hybrid zoom 6.6 inch OLED
display that's cool
ultra night mode and 4065 milliamp hour
battery with luke flash charge 3.0 okay
so that's that's some exciting stuff
right there alright so pricing willsez
starts at around 575 so that's kind of a
compelling price point a little bit
below your typical flagship mirrored
finish on the black with like a gradient
color thing happening from grayish
blueish purple-ish was cool here the
camera unit is completely flush with the
glass back no camera bulge whatsoever
alright so update on the zoom
characteristics it's gonna be 5 times
optical 10x hybrid this is uh this is
called the Oh doc my guess was that it
was to elevate the back glass panel of
the phone up off the table a little bit
so that the lens section wouldn't
scratch and according to will that's the
case that's exactly what that is for it
moves a little bit because of that but
only if you tap the top of the screen if
you tap anywhere near the bottom where
your keyboard would be it still sits
flush they gave a like a pretty cool
looking case actually that's a better
than usual case for a freebie that's in
the package you can now see this giant
cutout on the top that's because this
one has this one has a different take
you're gonna see it in a minute the
entire back channel here cut out it's
kind of cool got a quick charge loop
power brick you also have a USB type-c
cable there's a sim tool inside of you
and there's also a headset it looks a
little bit better than usual fits in the
ear and you have multiple
ear tips in order to get the right fit
looking at the device you have your
power switch over on this side and it's
indicated here by this cool little green
color the bottom is your type-c
connector as well as your SIM card tray
speaker unit in that location as well
volume buttons up down over on the other
side and then if you look at the top of
the device you get your first sense of
where this pop-up camera is going to
elevate right away you're gonna realize
this is a full display situation I mean
we're basically we're in era now of full
screen displays no not necessary
full screen no knotch no cutout just a
clean look and this one is six point six
inches oled so it's actually a pretty
nice looking display as well this is
really actually very similar to the one
plus these might very well be the same
display or or quite similar I will say
on the oneplus device it curves over the
edge like the glass curves to each side
this one is flat but they're very
comparable and they're the same size
fingerprint setup it's a in display
situation optical based fingerprint you
can see we have the color OS skin on
here which is quite a bit different I
mean look at that it's quite a bit
different it got some iOS inspiration in
there but even there it's different the
display looks good especially after
boosting the brightness so the oneplus
has a resolution advantage but they're
both OLED and you're probably not gonna
pick up too much of a difference now
what about the magic trick obviously the
camera module that's what most people
are interested in whoa and you can
actually you can actually get a glimpse
of yourself there Jack I don't know if
you notice there you are this one the
whole top moves now you may recall
previous Oppo devices some of the first
I ever looked at with motorized cameras
or the whole back piece kind of moved up
the Oppo find X which was one of the
first I ever looked at with a motorized
camera this one is sort of inspired by
that in fact that a lot more of the top
portion moves it just kind of sneaks out
of there so what about the quality of
the thing oh I can I can tell already I
mean it's got some serious beauty
features actually I should just mention
like
independently I could get myself souped
up Jack all-natural and what do we have
to say you know what that's not bad
that's pretty good actually
that's very I would say that's in line
with our expectations you can pick up
like specks on my shirt like specks of
dust so far so good on the front-facing
camera now the rear one so you have the
5x optical the 10x Hybrid and if I click
this button here we go to two we go to
six we go to ten the focusing distance
on the 6x this is not gonna be great for
like macro stuff if you wanted to shoot
a plant like this one or a bug or
something this is super wide boom
1x 2 X 6 X 10x and the focusing distance
comes into play again now let's keep in
mind at the 10 X it's a hybrid situation
so there might be a bit of quality loss
and it looks like there is a tiny bit at
least in our sample right here and you
get an idea for just how versatile a
camera like this is you can get all
these different perspectives so the only
other implementation similar to this one
would be on the p30 pro from Huawei in
which they have a 5x optical zoom as
well and then of course the whole hybrid
situation that happens beyond that gives
you a lot of versatility from a photo
perspective fully wide 1 X 2 X 6 X
10x
you know what actually that pictures not
bad at all and that's at 10x I could see
maybe if you go to a lot of like music
shows or something like this Jack you're
far away from the stage and sporting
events and to get an idea of just how
much closer you are all you got to do is
scroll back a couple and realize hold
man this is one X this is your stalk
this right here is your stock
perspective I mean that's a totally
different situation so versatility I
think that's the name of the game with
this product what's the story of this
phone at this point it's full display
motorized camera tons of zoom and a
decent spec list and a price point that
also happens to be lower than the sub
flagships or the competitive flagships
or the flagship killers as they're
called like like the 1 plus 7 pro so
that's the angle here all right so we'll
load up a loo later video here and see
how the audio sounds for dialogue recent
upload this was apple's take on like a
modern workstation computer that they
were gonna have desktop class graphics 1
plus 7 Pro comparison since I have it
here a lot of people at the time I
wanted something that sounds better the
oppo sounds better cheaper price it
sounds better
you've seen it's more clarity it's more
detail I just it's just a slightly
better speaker experience you have a
snapdragon a 55 Adreno 640 GPU you can
get it with 6 or 8 gigs of RAM and 128
or 256 of storage he's kind of an
interesting package if I dare say so
myself this color OS thing that's a
hurdle to overcome I would of course go
in here install a launcher I would
configure I would customize it remind me
well you said 575 USD that's a
compelling package really when you think
about it
so it's also got a night mode on it I'd
say the package is pretty compelling now
I'm starting to understand
why this was a requested device he's got
a lot of interest from you guys
669 for the phone on my left one plus
seven Pro 575 for the phone on my right
you don't get the 90 Hertz display and
that thing it doesn't show up on camera
and I know I've only been using this for
a little a little bit but it gives you
this sense of speed it's not a huge deal
it shouldn't be a deal breaker but it's
something worth noting what can I say
choices they're out there in the world
it's also interesting and exciting and
here's a new one a new choice to add to
the mix maybe you're looking at this now
little bit of extra reach Coachella the
whole story who knows I think it's
