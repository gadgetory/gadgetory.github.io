keyboards over the years all the coolest
all the weirdest all the most unique
this device it's a thing that you
interact with all the time pretty much
every day if you work on the computer
live on the computer game on the
computer you're in front of a keyboard
let's kick it off with this one here
it's called the Expos economic
mechanical keyboard very simple
packaging here it's a nice white box the
most obvious thing that you'll notice
about this one is probably different
than yours is the layout look at that
that is that is super unusual the reason
that an ergonomic keyboard in general
has this type of layout is because of
the way that your hands kind of rest
down on the table and with a straight
keyboard right you might have to bend
them back a bit to get in the correct
position where naturally the wrist kind
of wants to go this way and so these
keys are meant to follow your fingers
essentially look at this you'd normally
have a space bar right across the bottom
instead you have this split design so
there's two spots for the space bar and
in the middle they've utilized that
space for control shift and enter button
and a backspace which is kind of cool
because that gets used frequently having
it there instead of there might save you
a couple of seconds it has some feet on
it too so you can get a better angle
there you see so now it's even even more
in line with how your wrists want to
live while you're typing so it's
optional mechanical key switches with
Gator on red black blue or brown and
it's also got RGB adjustable lighting
and apparently the casing here is made
out of an aluminum alloy the whole thing
feels real solid so type-c the standard
USB all right let's see what this
backlight looks like oh look at that
this this area in the center here lights
up it's glowing like a oh and the RGB
starts moving around there we go okay
you can see that a bit better now
definitely if you look along the top
from pink purple orange red green and so
on you can of course configure this
however you like you can have it cycle
like this stick to a particular color
but that's kind of what its gonna look
like for a person like me okay that's
already like not a sophisticated typing
machine typist I'm already kind of
pecking around this is a very foreign
experience could could I get used to it
possibly like look at me I'm reaching up
here you're definitely not gonna open
this up and immediate
we feel comfortable with it unless
you're familiar with the ergonomic
concept all right so that's the expose
next up also equally unusual it's a 60%
mechanical keyboard these things are all
arranged
since this keyboard is small you're
gonna be missing certain keys like even
the directional keys so as you can see
here by holding the function key you
actually end up with these functions
coming back to you in like a duel like a
key combination scenario this one is off
Amazon it's very affordable it's also
mechanical this one has key switches
called red switch these are I believe
the same as the switches in the last
keyboard I was looking at okay let's
crack this open here wow look how small
that is this is tiny
mmm look it look how slender and sleek
that is it's only 60% of a regular
keyboard the only thing that strikes me
immediately like whoa what am I gonna do
without that is the directional keys but
of course holding down your function key
you can turn these other keys into your
up down side to side if you use them of
course the layout a lot more familiar
here a lot more traditional and the
bottom is pretty straightforward oh very
nice this is a lot more similar to what
I'm using right now whoo zoom in on that
orange blue Oh like a split look at that
the triple setup so this is not the
brightest backlight in person you can
see it a little bit when you look at it
directly but anyway you can cycle
through there's a few different settings
as I mentioned before and of course the
focus here is shrinking down to the bare
necessity of what you need a keyboard to
be now if I take out this next keyboard
you're gonna see how just how much
smaller this thing is comparatively this
one is from a company called Maya Nicks
and they sell it with these
interchangeable key caps like this it's
also backlit it's also RGB but much more
of a classic layout so look at this one
here full-size and now this is really
gonna help you appreciate just how small
the 60% keyboard is look at that it
looks tiny comparatively speaking I like
this look at this thing
very nice solid build mechanical key
caps we have a cable here with the
little bungee on it which i think is a
cool look a full rubberized mat on the
bottom ooh
very little slip there maybe
not as much of an incline as you might
like but reasonable Oh another thing I
like on this the OS key it mean it
actually says OS as opposed to being a
Windows key or the Apple key this will
work on both platforms so why have a
dedicated key that can't be
interchangeable that's very cool
also in the package we have a sticker a
little bit of paperwork look at the look
at the inside of the box is that cool or
what why does that remind me of The
Simpsons why does that make me want a
donut well I know why because there's a
picture of one right there also a silca
packet which as you know is Jack's
favorite treat but you're not jack so
where's jack okay so that's the layout
of the keyboard let's plug it in and we
see the RGB lighting again not super
bright but really the purpose of these
back lights is for dim environments
anyways okay last up we have a wild one
this is the retro classic from Azio azo
I have featured their products in the
past in fact I featured one that looked
almost exactly like this which I was
like this thing is over the top
steampunk style keyboard they went even
further with this one the artisan series
retro classic
this one is primarily in my opinion for
appearance you want the ambient
environment maybe you go this way so
three colors are available there's this
one with the copper and the black
there's also a full black onyx version
and then there's one called posh which
is white mostly this is the most
steampunk looking version of the retro
classic and they claim it's gonna be the
right height with an adjustable incline
look at the unboxing experience whoa
that is wild oh my goodness
it has like a leather deck in there holy
smokes alright this one wins for
unboxing experience braided USB cable
guys this actually smells like leather
right now it smells like I'm at a shoe
store like I'm getting a fancy leather
shoe and this one is completely
different look at it it's actually like
a typewriter this would take me a while
to get used to much like the ergonomic
one but like I said I think this is for
a certain type of environment maybe it's
a it's at the front desk is the
receptionist to like some cool business
has this thing sitting there you walk in
you're like whoa look at that thing this
is that keyboard this is all legit alloy
on the outside with the copper plating
the copper coloring it's heavy
move in now let's plug this in real
quick I mean you can already see it
shining through but go ahead turn off
the lights look at that that is some
bright backlighting a ton of contrast
through those key caps so this is
obviously a really cool look I mean
that's what this keyboard is about all
right so there you have it four unique
keyboards this one might be the most
unique it's certainly the heaviest and
it feels the highest quality but for me
the one that I would most likely put on
my desk in fact I'm gonna go put this on
my desk right now the Maya Nicks I don't
know what it is this keyboard here is
just speaking to me it's the color it's
the gray I'm gonna customize the keys I
think I like the fact that the whole
bottom is rubber it just feels really
solid don't forget we had this little
guy the 60% keyboard I think this is
gonna be popular for a number of users I
feel like you've got to be a power user
I feel like these other two keyboards
here are more focused on power users
even though this one looks the same once
you use this thing there will be an
adjustment period and then this one here
which is the ergonomic layout I don't
personally have a ton of problems with
the traditional layout but I can see how
given a certain number of hours spent on
a keyboard you might get sore in the
wrists and so on so there's a few
options there for unique keyboards hope
you guys enjoyed it let me know down in
the comment section which one would you
go for I'll drop links down in the
description to each one question time
we've got some good ones today first
stuff from Mohammed Ben said it did you
still playing hockey some of you know
some of you don't in fact there's some
videos that would expose the fact that
yes I do play hockey and I still play
one of the few ways I maintain this
physical structure right here I just
think like why would you exercise like
lifting weights it's boring get out
there play a game hockey is that thing
for me so I play twice a week I'm in the
offseason right now cuz I play in the
summer I play in the winter two separate
teams two times a week get on the ice
alright have a Molson Canadian and get
out there maybe have the Canadian after
the Olli okay so here's one from Marcel
studio which game console is the best
one for you Xbox or ps4 ok the truth
here I don't play very many console
exclusive titles like titles that only
exist on PlayStation or only on Xbox one
of the series that I that I did get
invested in in the past that was
exclusive was Uncharted so because of
that game I've generally been in the
PlayStation Camp but here's the thing
like these are more comparable than they
are different so you can't go wrong with
either the PlayStation Camp or the Xbox
camp I know people get fired up you
gotta be on this one you gotta be on
that one I would say follow the
exclusive titles that piqued your
interest and then grab that console but
anyway my playstation gets more use ok
here's the third one from Silvio do you
watch Game of Thrones
well in fact I did watch the first
season all right so I was like I'm going
along its medieval things are
interesting the cinematography and then
the Dragons started coming out towards
the end and I was like oh man I don't
know if I can keep nothing like I think
it's cool but I just wish it had to just
stayed like this a little bit less
mystical I don't know is that even
they're gonna be so mad at me now for
this it wills mad at me right now I just
wanted it to be like a long form of
Braveheart or something like that that's
all I want it don't put any spoilers in
the comments I know everybody loves Game
of Thrones so so be it all right I could
deal with a little bit less of the
magical mystical side of it that's just
me so there you have it your questions
have been answered remember in this
video leave your questions down below
one more time because I will be
answering them in the next episode you
