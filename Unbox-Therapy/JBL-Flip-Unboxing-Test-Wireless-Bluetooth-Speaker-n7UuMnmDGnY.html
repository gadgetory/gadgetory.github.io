therapy and today we're taking a look at
the JBL flip a portable wireless
bluetooth speaker it's rechargeable it's
also got a microphone inside of it which
means you can answer phone calls and
speak to people right through this
portable wireless speaker but of course
the main function here is to listen to
music at a better volume then you can
get out of your smart phone or even your
tablet for that matter it does feature 5
hours of playback it's incredibly
portable there is a cable included as
well as a power brick this is going to
be used to charge the device but you can
also use it to power up the device so
you can use it tethered to the wall if
you choose to but like I said before
you've got five hours of wireless
playback they've also gone ahead and
included a portable little carrying case
here which takes a portable device and
makes it even more portable as you can
see it's made out of neoprene it has
some orange accents it has a zipper on
the top and as I said before this is
just going to increase the portability
you can put it into the case throw this
into your bag and you've got five hours
of decent audio that I guarantee is
better than that which your smartphone
or tablet is already currently offering
on the top of the device is where you'll
find all the controls here you'll see a
power button as well as volume up and
down and then there's a phone icon of
course for answering phone calls the
power cord plugs into the back and right
beside it is an auxilary in so you can
use this speaker with devices that might
not be Bluetooth enabled you just need a
mini jack cable and you're good to go
now get anything set up is really easy
you hit the power button it will flash a
couple of colors then go to your phone
this is my nexus for my brand new Nexus
4 which I love actually hit that thumbs
up button guys if you want to see a full
review on the Nexus 4 but anyways it's
just like setting up any other Bluetooth
device it'll show up when you go to
search for Bluetooth devices then you
connect to it and you're ready to play
your audio through the actual device so
I'll jump into SoundCloud and give you
guys a couple of samples here so I'll
shut up for a minute and let you guys
listen
now depending on your listening
environment at home it's tough to really
portray to you exactly what this thing
is capable of but it is a very powerful
little portable unit that did blow me
away it got a lot of volume if you guys
want to know any more information about
this device one check out pricing and
availability there's a link in the
description to help you do that I want
to thank you guys as always for watching
my content and I'll catch you on the
next video very soon all right later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
