therapy and today we're taking a look at
an iPad 2 case a tough a rugged case
from a company called OtterBox this is
the reflex series and if you don't know
who OtterBox is they've been making
incredibly rugged tough cases for
electronics devices for a long long time
and the iPad 2 is no exception this
particular case feels tough straight out
of the box it's got a protective
covering on the front that's that clear
portion I just showed you but what's
special about it is that it can come off
and act as a multifunction stand for
both media consumption and also for
productivity when your iPad 2 is laying
down on a table for example now the main
components of the case are these two
panels here in my hands and it's got a
soft felt like interior so you know it's
not gonna scratch up your iPad 2 now the
fit is really snug so you're going to
want to take note if you've got some
styles of screen protectors or a jealous
skin or something on your iPad that's
probably not gonna fly but once these
two panels are slid together you get a
sense right away for how rugged and
stable this whole package is gonna be
now something to note the back of the
device is black so you're going to get a
little bit of fingerprint action on
there in a bright environment my
environment is super bright that I shoot
in so it probably won't be so bad as it
showed up on camera here now the special
part is this stand that can also be
carried around as a protective aspect of
the case it's gonna allow for you to you
know line up your iPad either in
landscape mode for media consumption
portrait mode for me to consumption or
there's also this sort of productivity
mode which gives it a decent angle for
both typing or for use when you're
standing up for example so here's a
better look for some still images here
of what it looks like in those different
orientations and as I mentioned before
incredibly convenient and the nice thing
is you don't have to remember to bring
something separate it's already part of
the protective case so you're probably
gonna have it with you now you can
choose to either install this stand on
the front side of your iPad for you know
extended trips where they're going to
put this thing into another bag and you
want to protect the screen for example
that's probably the way you're gonna use
it most often but it will also fit on
the back which is kind of cool
now when the whole package is together
it's an incredibly solid I mean it feels
like a tank I'm not gonna lie it feels
like you could drop it I don't throw it
around in this video if you guys want me
to throw it around I'll do it just let
me know but as I mentioned before you
can also wear it on the back of the iPad
- and that's kind of cool because you
might want to be using the iPad while
toting around the stand in case you know
you come into a scenario where you could
use it so having the option of wearing
it on the front or back is kind of nice
now you've got nice cutouts for all of
your different ports and buttons here
whether it be your headphone jack your
microphone you've got your power button
as well as your little hold slash
orientation switch your volume rocker is
easily accessible and you've got a nice
large cutout for your dock connector and
of course the camera - as I mentioned
earlier in the video now the whole thing
slides apart real easy so if you do have
to dock the iPad you can just pull the
bottom portion off instead of the whole
thing and as I mentioned earlier the
whole thing feels super rugged when
you've got it all set up as I said
before OtterBox is known for robust
cases that you can bang around in fact
on the back of the case they say there
are air pockets in each corner so the
corners are actually the toughest parts
and those are the parts that are most
likely to hit the ground when you drop
your device so it should be pretty
rugged as I said I haven't fully tested
it yet but it'll be cool to throw it
around and see exactly how it survives
