and welcome to the very first edition of
unboxing xed this is where i show you
products and you pick what you want to
see unbox next so first we've got the
ps3 headset just came out 7.1 surround a
Malaysian wireless a lot of you guys are
interested in that I'm going to bet that
you'll choose that one first next we've
got the wireless keypad for ps3 I've
wanted this for a while finally got my
hands on it ready to show it to you guys
in beautiful HD as we do here on unbox
therapy next we've got the samsung 3d
starter kit this is going to come with a
couple of pairs of active shutter
glasses as well as the three shrek
blu-rays i guess they're 3d blu-rays
those are included in there too and then
we've got Katherine the deluxe edition
for ps3 I've had this on the shelf for a
while there's a lot of extra stuff it's
kind of a an interesting came here so I
want to show you guys that too and let
me know if you want to see it and next
we've got the samsung skype camera
that's for your LED flat panel and it's
720p HD as well going to let you skype
on your television of course if you want
to do that kind of thing it's going to
just be a convenience thing you know
just to have it there even though you
know obviously skypes on your other
devices as well but it's going to be
cool to just sit back in your couch you
know and skype if you need to so there's
a couple other items over here on the
couch i'm gonna pull this camera off the
tripod and goes go freestyle so the
first thing you'll notice is this power
supply here this surge protector sorry
and what's cool about it has this master
power port that controls these other
five so if you turn off the device in
the master it will turn off the other
ports perfect for your TV of course and
your other devices connected to it we've
also got this super slim flat panel
mount which only sits off the wall half
an inch so super slim perfect for those
new slim LED televisions and as you
might imagine there's my just pick this
up this is the 55 inch samsung d 6500
LED and the reason that i picked it is
because of the super slim bezel on it's
got barely any bezel at all and the
reason why
I needed barely no bezel is because of
55 inch television will barely fit here
this is where it's going to go and this
was really one of my only options but
I'm happy about it anyways because this
Samsung has all kinds of crap built into
it a smart TV and all that stuff i'm
going to show you guys and Netflix
YouTube you name it and a relatively
easy to use user interface so anyway
guys in the comments say what you want
to see next and whatever gets the most
votes then I'm going to get to that
video first but you're going to probably
see them all and if you guys enjoyed
this content make sure to like and
favorite it it really does help me out
and until next time thanks for watching
and stay tuned for your pics alright
later guys
you</div></body></html>
