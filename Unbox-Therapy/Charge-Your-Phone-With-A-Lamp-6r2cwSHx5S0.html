the what's up guys thing instead of
trademark if you will what's up guys Lew
here and I'm still making videos whether
you like it or not today we're talking
about a lamp this is a weird one you're
like a lamp Lew not tuning in for laps
well this is not your everyday average
lamp I wouldn't bring that to you
I would only bring you a lamp if it did
something special and this is that lamp
this lamp will charge your phone I think
it's pretty cool so let's go ahead find
out what this thing is all about this is
a very important part of any lamp
it's a lampshade a little wrench the
actual electronic part of the lamp
that's it that's the cool section for
all the cool kids now the reason that I
like a lamp that charges your phone I
mean there are other pieces of furniture
out there like cables and stuff but the
problem of the table is a table is not
something that you normally plug in
right so having to run something down
there and plug it into the wall now your
tables plugged in I mean I guess it's
not a huge deal but a lamp on the other
hand well that's plugged in anyways plus
it's got light and if you got one of
these cool Philips hue bulbs all of a
sudden now you got different colors you
got ambience
you're gonna impress the ladies just ask
Jack what happened he put one of these
little LED bulbs next to his bed next
thing you know he's got a new girlfriend
he's buying a new place he's going on
vacation next week this is the kind of
stuff that might happen for you with a
fancy colorful light bulb Jack that
staying in the video I don't care what
you say should I look at the
instructions here
I guess I have to
No oh wow there's a usb on the front too
check that out see that so if your
device doesn't support wireless charging
all of a sudden now you still get a
fresh USB I like that idea now you know
as well if anybody stands a chance at
putting wireless charging in everyone's
home probably the Swedish help convince
you with their Swedish meatballs
this video is off the rails in a way
like almost like we've never been on the
ribs he's upset he's got a question but
he calls IKEA and everything's better
all right wrench time here man check out
this this little wrench here bingo you
know what I do like so far about this
lamp beyond the fact that it's super
high-tech there's a lamp in room but I
do like about this lamp
it seems actually like pretty high
quality this braided power cables it's
good look ah take that off look at this
friendly little lamp right here bulb I
have a fancy bulb they go all kinds of
different colors you have an app for it
so you can control it from your
smartphone it's a high-tech lamp
let's give it a high-tech bulb 25,000
hours I mean how long is that even is
that my whole life video is not about
bulbs well it is but it is not the lamp
let's give this baby some juice this is
the moment of truth right here what do
you want me to do so you want me to just
oh how cool jack just drop it on your
charging and now imagine this thing is
beside your bed that's genius
so the next thing is can you just be a
lab - let's see here yes you can
so the lamp is now connected you could
probably I don't know if you can see
this app here with the Philips hue bulb
you're getting a dimmer essentially
which the lamp doesn't have by default
this one whoo look at that little pink
for you maybe some blue match the
sweater over to some red they're green
look at that holy smokes
see hello so now I don't know we might
have the highest tech you could turn me
back on now we might have the highest
tech lamp on the planet right now
colorful bulbs controlled by a phone
wireless charging USB port built right
in high tech for you guys
unbox therapy people you just got it
cool this lamp on the planet quite
possibly did you charge your phone with
your lamp last night maybe after you got
this definitely go to school the next
day guess how I charge my phone with my
lamp
that's right teacher here's your Apple
