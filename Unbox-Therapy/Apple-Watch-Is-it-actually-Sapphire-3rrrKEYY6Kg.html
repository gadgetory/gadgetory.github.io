here back with another video and today
I've got something that I think you're
going to be interested in if you've been
following my channel recently then you
know I've done a couple of videos about
the Apple watch I did an unboxing of
this Apple watch right here which is the
standard version the non-sport featuring
a higher-quality or more expensive
materials but I also did a video before
that a scratch test on this component
here which is the glass from the Apple
watch sport it's called ion X and it's
not nearly as hard as pure sapphire
apparently up until this point sapphire
crystals have been of a certain shape
and a certain style for many traditional
watches so I went out and did a little
bit of my own research I even went to a
jewelry store and bought a watch so in
front of me here I have a tea so watch
now I've been told that most if not all
Tissot watches feature sapphire crystals
this one for example if you turn it
around and look at the back you will see
it is branded as stainless steel
water-resistant and sapphire crystal so
a legit 100% sapphire crystal on this
watch I wanted to compare that to the
sapphire crystal that exists on the
Apple watch maybe Apple was using some
unique material or some kind of a
process to get the sapphire in the shape
that it's in on the standard Apple watch
or maybe that they weren't necessarily
using the kind of sapphire crystal that
we're used to this my friends is a
diamond tester this tests the
conductivity of various materials it's
used mostly for evaluating jewelry and
fine stones like diamonds hence the name
but it actually works perfectly fine on
materials like sapphire as well mineral
glass will have no effect on this scale
when tested when you touch this probe
against it
whereas sapphire or materials like it
diamond so on and so forth which are
very conductive materials will have a
different type of readout it will go as
far as seven or eight on this scale
depending on the sensitivity so this is
a
definitive test for determining whether
or not you are dealing with a sapphire
crystal on a watch you have to have your
hand on this metallic portion on the
other side of the diamond tester and you
also need to be holding the object that
you're testing because it's actually
your body that will complete the circuit
and allow for the test to be accurate so
in front of me here I have various
devices I have my phone I have the Apple
watch the more expensive Apple watch I
have the glass from the Apple watch
sport right here I have that tea so that
I told you I purchased with actual
verified sapphire glass sapphire crystal
sorry on the front and then I have the
LG G watch R on the far left so we're
going to go ahead and test all of these
different surfaces so we can find out
once and for all if Apple is using
legitimate sapphire crystal in the more
expensive Apple watch so I'm going to go
ahead and turn on the diamond selector
to how serious does that sound now you
will need to set the sensitivity this is
built-in for various sizes of diamond
stones that you might be testing in this
case I'll put a relatively low
sensitivity on there it will either
react and you'll see the meter go up the
scale or it won't at all so let's start
with the G watch our from LG so you have
no reaction here at all so we know
immediately based on this test and the
conductivity of this material that we
are dealing with glass now we can expect
a similar readout from the iPhone 6
exact same effect now if I go ahead and
test the glass from the Apple watch
sport once again glass no reaction at
all certainly not sapphire or any kind
of special material so let's go ahead
and move on to the critical stuff here
I've got the tea so watch
traditional-style watch that I purchased
for about 300 dollars with a verified
sapphire crystal upon touching it you'll
see the meter jump all the way up so the
sensitivity setting that I have
is presuming that this is diamond
because it is a really big surface of
material and I have the sensitivity set
for that kind of reaction now lastly we
have the Apple watch which many have
disputed whether or not it's legitimate
traditional watch style sapphire because
of the shape of it and and the unusual
manufacturing process that it would
probably take to make it here's the test
and what you'll see is it gets pretty
high flashing up to 1/8 it becomes
obvious that Apple is certainly using
sapphire crystal here we're seeing
something fairly innovative here from
Apple in their manufacturing process
that they were capable of producing
something so unusual in the watch world
a sapphire crystal in this particular
shape with this rounded edge believe it
or not the production of sapphire
crystals for watches is a fairly
complicated thing I will drop some links
in the description to describe and
explain more and once you do some
reading or a little bit of research
you'll understand why this is such an
achievement and why there were so many
people doubting that it could actually
be that material given the current
production methods for sapphire crystal
for watches alright guys I hope that you
enjoyed this video if you did make sure
to leave it a thumbs up down below also
share it with your friends anybody who's
wondering asking questions trying to
decide between the Apple watch sport or
the Apple watch the next step up I can
tell you this is stainless steel and
sapphire just as they say and this is
one of the hardest materials on the
planet so it should be incredibly
resistant to scratches or at least as
resistant as we could ask for this is a
great material alright thanks again for
watching and I'll catch you on the next
episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
