see we got the best buy Express vending
machine here yes you can buy gadgets now
straight up a vending machine I've never
seen this before although I've seen it
covered before they got everything from
beets products down on the lower level
here some Bose products as well
obviously headphones are probably a hot
seller in something like this I see an
HTC Flyer tablet in there it might be
the most expensive item some Canon
cameras along top so lots of different
things you might have forgot before you
came on a trip the only problem is the
price point most of these things of the
exact same price that they'd be in store
except you're not paying for an employee
so they house kind of you should be a
little bit less you can take a look at
the interface over here as well it's all
touch based you know you can kind of tap
the screen and then select the specific
category it's actually pretty intuitive
you get a cart sort of like online
shopping and then just like your
favorite pop or candy vending machine
your product pops out right below of
course you've got to swipe your credit
card first so anyway guys I thought this
was kind of cool I hadn't seen one
before
so I figured I'd get it to guys and let
you see what I saw
all right until next time I'll see you
around a channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
