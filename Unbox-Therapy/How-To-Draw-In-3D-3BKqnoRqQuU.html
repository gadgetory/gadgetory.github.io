on this planet today yesterday and
tomorrow is that where there is a tattoo
parlor there will be a motorcycle been
that way since Aristotle what's up guys
Lew here back with another video and
today I am checking out something quite
interesting this is called the creo pop
and to be completely honest with you I
know very little about it but that
generally makes for very nice unbox
therapy videos what I do know is that
it's a 3d printing pen now that sounds
kind of confusing essentially this thing
outputs some material some plastic type
stuff that as it exits the pen it turns
into sort of a structure and object it's
also safe too like I was thinking what
about this hot hot stuff coming out hot
plastic coming out of the tip I don't
know apparently it's safe different inks
available to it including elastic
magnetic glow-in-the-dark I'm excited
here you can see some people also having
fun this guy is trying to step all over
my beard game just doing a poor job
let's go ahead and crack this baby open
this is the pen that's the pen
whoa we have the ink some paperwork
instruction manual do I need to read
this probably a drawing Matt oh cool all
right so I can draw right on top of that
mini USB cable to charge up the pen I
assume maybe I should read the
QuickStart guide I don't know is this no
let's check out these inks
what are they see this is why the manual
is probably important Jack look at these
little rubber things you know what those
are no you don't these are gonna give
you different outputs depending on which
one you select let's get one of these
babies going red orange and what is that
it's like a cyan and remove this nozzle
crack open the pen so the nozzle
actually comes through the end here
power switch this is pretty intense is a
couple different modes here filling mode
or light only mode so there's different
speeds for extrusion of the material oh
I got something oh wow that's wild it's
hardening in place it's amazing that I'm
actually drawing something vertically
right now what that is completely
hardened
whoa that one's a little bit more
tightly knit you can tell people in
those pictures look at the stuff they're
making right now the solicitous girls
making a flower over here this dudes
making a rocket ship or something I
don't want I'm gonna do I'm gonna draw
Jack the flood okay easy foot is stuck
to me right now
here comes the leg to another leg now
this is the body arm another arm go
ahead jack I get the ears on there a
couple of hands on there he's doing some
athletic pose you ever posed like this
check this is wild
what else might be cool maybe like a
tree do you think maybe a tree Wow Tim
Burton would have a Nightmare Before
Christmas they'd have a tree like that
I'm trying to convert the tree and put
branches on not bad see now this is
where you might want to switch into
light only mode now I just hardened that
baby right up
like this guy's a little bit long wonder
if I can just break this guy off you
know it is like some kind of dr. Seuss
style tree let's switch colors that's a
great idea
I'm zoning out I'm in like I'm in child
mode right now I'm just it's just so
cool to be crafting something in real
time and in vertical space yeah that's
fun you're in there jack just hanging
off the branches like the chimpanzee he
is there you have it
crao pop creativity for days it's the
ability to draw in 3d with plastic and
the limitations are you as you can see
I'm severely limited here on unbox
therapy I get to try out so many so many
things I never knew existed my
appreciation to you for putting me in
this position and thank you for
continuing to watch all this cool stuff
hope you guys appreciated it enjoyed it
