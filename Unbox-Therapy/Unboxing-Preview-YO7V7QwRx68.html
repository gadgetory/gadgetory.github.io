and I wanted to give you guys a quick
unboxing preview of some of the items
that were piling up on my desk here
that's just because I want to give you
the option of what you want to see
unboxed next just let me know down in
the comments which item speaks to you
the most so the first one I've got here
is the henge docks click and this is a
device I got a first look at at CES 2012
it basically takes your apple wireless
keyboard and your wireless magic
trackpad and turns an inch one
streamlined device that you can also use
with your media center if you've got a
mac mini media center something like
that or just a clean way of keeping your
input devices tidy on your desk the next
item is the sync by 50 these are over
the ear wireless headphones from SMS
audio i also got a look at these at CES
2012 now I've got the legit retail
packaging in front of me what's special
about them is that they use clear
technology which gives you lossless
audio unlike bluetooth they should give
you CD quality wirelessly very
interested to take a closer look at
these the next item I've got is the
onlive game system this is a cloud-based
gaming system if you haven't heard of it
yet you might want to check it out i'm
very excited to get a look at this all
your games live in the cloud you can
pick them up and play whenever you want
no getting up to change discs or
anything like that so I definitely want
to get a closer look at that as well and
then lastly I've got gran turismo 5 the
collector's edition the reason I picked
this up obviously this has been out for
a little while when I was in Vegas I
forgot my charger my proprietary charger
for my sony HX 9v so i took a trip over
to the sony store at Caesar's Palace and
they had this collector's edition that I
hadn't actually seen available anywhere
else at least in a long time since I
didn't have it yet I said hey why not
pick it up it was also pretty cheap I
think it was only like 69 bucks so let
me know what you guys want to see unbox
first unbox next on the channel which
ever one gets the most votes the most
comments that's what we'll be up anyway
guys if you enjoy my content hopefully
you can like and favorite this video and
definitely stay tuned to the channel
because whichever you guys pick down in
the comments is going to be the next
product alright guys until next time
I'll see you around the channel later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
