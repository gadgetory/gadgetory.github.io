together a quick video to tell you guys
about some of these sample images that
have come out from this brand new iPhone
4s that was announced yesterday most
people left that keynote a little bit
underwhelmed with the specifications and
upgrades that are coming to the iPhone 4
some of the upgrades are not obvious
they're not external they're not
physical redesigns but this new camera
and the images that it supposedly
produces are quite impressive at this
point and maybe just maybe they will be
able to sort of help Apple out and help
Apple avoid some of the backlash and
some of what occurred in the stock
market yesterday after the announcement
so right up behind me here is one of the
samples this is actually a cropped image
I turned it into a 16 by 9 aspect ratio
so there's even more resolution than
what you're seeing there I'm going to
bring up a few here in the video so you
can get a better look at just what they
look like on your screen I have to say
I'm impressed right now at what we're
seeing
of course these images were probably
taken under optimal circumstances you
know Apple gives themselves the best
possible shooting scenario for their
sample images as you might imagine
nonetheless these are impressive and if
you can make these with a telephone with
a phone that is what 9 millimeters thick
or something like that then then you got
to be excited about it some more specs
on the camera it's got an F 2.4 lens
i've got to say i don't know if i've
ever heard of a camera on a phone with
such a large aperture so you know it's
going to be decent in low-light also
it's very fast and this again was
covered in the keynote yesterday we'll
have to wait till the actual phone is
launched to check this out but it's
supposedly you know substantially faster
than anything else that's on the market
i think they're saying 0.5 seconds in
between frames so if if it can do that
and if it's your phone then you got to
be impressed by it so anyways hopefully
this camera performance and these new
images that came out helped some people
feel a little bit better about this new
device especially people who are waiting
a long time to
potentially upgrade it'll be very
interesting to see how this thing does
in real-world tests in order to see if
people can replicate what we're seeing
up here this kind of fancy stuff anyway
guys as always thanks for watching and
stick around the channel for you no more
iPhone 4s coverage I'm going to be
picking it up on the 14th the day that
it comes out and I'll let you guys know
exactly what is possible with this
device and if it's worth your
hard-earned cash alright guys I'll see
you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
