sponsored by Legal Zoom what's up guys
Lew here and today I have an interesting
unboxing for you it's a little bit
different than usual but something I'm
excited for nonetheless this is a very
special extreme edition of random access
memories from Daft Punk somebody tweeted
this at me I can't remember who right
now so sorry if I if I don't give you a
shout-out right here maybe I'll drop
your name in the description if I can
find the tweet this is a super amazing
Edition which includes a vinyl record
now I don't have much experience with
vinyls but I do happen to know that with
this particular recording there is
significantly more dynamic range on the
vinyl recording than what you're going
to get mastered in CD quality I decided
to get myself some vinyl equipment
equipment to playback vinyls so I have a
turntable some new speakers a little
phono box in order to take the recording
from the LP and turn it into something
that my computer can understand it has
USB on the other side as well as rca's
out to your speaker system so anyways I
guess this is my entry into the world of
vinyl and I am starting with this really
super crazy edition of random access
memories it is a very very heavy box
first of all it's made out of some kind
of canvas it looks like and this thing
is not cheap either
I'll link this down below as well if
you're interested but just be warned it
is not cheap I'll remove the plastic
here it's obviously the first thing to
do then I will go ahead and remove the
top lid now I haven't done a ton of
research on this I don't know exactly
what's inside as far as all of the items
included but I do know there is the
vinyl and that looks like the first
thing that we see here holy smokes okay
so here you have random access memories
the actual record on the back you can
see the song names written out in this
cool kind of cursive font then there's a
little protective sheet next up we have
hmm and unmarked oh no not unmarked
there's like a little I don't know if
you guys can see that on the camera
there you go
so there's like a little slightly
different black tone there and I guess
I'll get everything out of the box and
then open them up independently this is
pretty insane for an unboxing this feels
really uh uh luxurious I guess Wow Wow
so this looks like artwork yeah let me
see let me get a closer look at this and
check it out it sure as hell seems wow I
don't even wanna get my finger prints on
it's definitely artwork whoa
it's some next-level stuff I guess
they're not gonna get damaged too easily
I hope not
oh it's like the layers inside the
helmet whoa I don't want to mess that up
so these are translucent layers within
the world-famous Daft Punk helmet okay
let me pull these out for a second so
the back layer I guess it's just black
yeah in order so that you can see them
all whoa that's crazy and then this
piece goes on top you end up with that
look right there
well that's nuts so I hope you guys
understand what I'm saying might not
make a lot of sense and I'm doing a lot
of booing and eyeing but that's a pretty
cool including this is like next-level
ok next up we have a similar piece of
artwork this time with the golden helmet
and once again you get the same
translucent items on the inside I'm not
sure what the best way to display all
those is maybe you take them all out
independently and then do some kind of
like series of frames on the walls I
don't know that would be pretty cool
whoa all this whoa wait a minute ok hit
a minute a couple more pieces of artwork
it seems whoa this is pretty cool as
well so you have on top confidential do
not duplicate and this is again some
kind of robot EXO skeletal type of
drawing I guess you know if you're going
to manufacture this
robot thing there's another one to me
check this one out
this one looks sort of the same flipped
a little bit I'm gonna have a serious
Daft Punk theme going on inside my
office after this is finished being
humble whoa
what is this whoa can you I don't know
if you guys can make that out properly
these are slides bring it closer this is
difficult for you guys to make out but
here you have actual film slides what
looks like hmm that's the live
performance it's a live performance of
get lucky because I see Pharrell in
there anyways apologies for that's
really difficult to show off
35-millimeter I guess it's a little bit
wider this just keeps going this is a
labyrinth of random access memories
goodness here is a book again kind of
tough to make out the title but that's
cool like that stealth kind of looked
canvas just like the box and if I open
it up you're what so you have a bunch of
different rack units for electronic
music random access memories Columbia
Records there's a forward with a legit
book hardcover book wow this is pretty
badass you guys are probably fun trick
well I'm so excited I don't know I mean
normally I'm just unboxing stuff I
totally know what's inside this is a
legitimate surprise because I don't get
to do very much stuff like this and this
is you know really nice artwork inside
of here it's got that fresh smell to it
like it just came off the presses as
well so there's studio shots in here Wow
I guess what you're seeing is a behind
the scenes sort of photo look at the
production of this record this is crazy
so it's about again I'm guessing it's
about 40 pages long but you can see all
the different artists that they had come
into the studio to help create the
record amazing all right
I probably shouldn't show you the whole
thing anyways pretty awesome so this
book is included I'm going to look at
that in more detail after we finish up
here what's next is there something else
in here I don't know feels like it is
another sheet something soft it could
just be padding yet oh never mind look
at this whoa these are pretty badass so
these I did actually read about not too
much but do I pull the whole thing out
or do I pull yeah I just pulled it Wow
there's some serious weight to that it's
just like some superhero right now
okay these let me unwrap these there's a
gold-plated one and a silver plated when
they look like some out of Star
Trek and how do I maybe I'll need the
knife you got to be gentle when we use
the knife alright I'm going to use a
knife
these are USB drives one of them is
gold-plated
I believe and one is silver-plated and
these have uncompressed digital versions
of the records is like vacuum sealed
it's like getting into Fort Knox right
here so uncompressed digital versions
you know for everybody who wants to
listen on their computer and maybe you
don't want to make a digital copy of
your vinyl so you are supported with
these drives right here now I don't know
where the USB end is going to be because
it just looks like a triangle right now
diamond shape oh I get it I'm starting
to get it it's really heavy that's tough
to portray to you in this video this is
heavy so that's officially badass this
is like machined metal I suppose you
could you know offload the music and
then do whatever you want with it but
listen listen to that can you guys hear
that
that's real metal gold-plated crazy and
this one's the same I guess I should
open it up anyways might as well and
then lastly we'll go back to the main
record and open that up as well these
are these are really really cool look
check these out man these are really
cool there are people who are serious
purists and they buy all of their
favorite music on vinyl and get you know
a huge collection together I am NOT one
of those people at least not yet but
this has got me kind of excited about
the concept of taking your favorites and
turning into them into something other
than a digital file oh wow okay so this
is a an interview Giorgio Moroder the
our am interview cool that's I don't
know if that's exclusive to this version
or what there's two sides so it's an
extended interview it makes you feel
like the music itself is a lot more
special then you know you thought in the
past okay so lastly we have the actual
record random access memories right here
on the front you have the dual helmets
smash together open it up what that's
badass that's some kind of translucent
piece of electronic music equipment
keyboard obviously and then
of course you've got there's the record
itself with the golden label I feel like
it's 1973 and I just got that hot new
that hot new record and then here's the
rest and this has the silver label as
you can see side three inside four okay
so I am officially in the vinyl business
now thanks to somebody tweeting this out
at me and me spending too much money on
it and now I got to figure out if the
change in audio quality is something I
could get addicted to I can definitely
get addicted to unboxing music like this
this is really really damn cool if
there's any other amazing cool special
edition music out there that you guys
know that that's in packages like this
you can tweet them at me at unbox
therapy because chances are I'll be
interested in now I am probably going to
spend way too much money on music but
hey at least the artists end up getting
paid for what they do which is you know
kind of tough to do in the music
business today or at least maybe tougher
than it used to be I don't know that's a
totally different discussion because the
argument is that more people are in the
music business now they're just not
making as much money they make a living
but they're not like super duper wealthy
crazy wealthy Daft Punk wealthy uh but
this unboxing video is not for the
purpose of that discussion it's to give
you a closer look at this really
kick-ass killer edition of random access
