this phone is weird that phone is weird
it's more weird than the last weird but
it doesn't end you see I got an email
the other day he says I got the banana
phone Lou you need to see the banana
phone is that a real thing is that a gag
then I read a little further he's like
you get the banana phone and a
percentage of the profits from the sale
of the banana phone will save gorillas
and I was like I like gorillas I'm sure
the gorillas likes bananas probably
doesn't care about the banana phone so
much there's some sort of a connection
here this thing is a bit of fun it also
says smile more don't take yourself so
seriously are you sitting on the other
end of this lens saying that's
ridiculous how dare they banana phone ah
yeah I don't need that Louie what do you
smile more see you're busy getting angry
you're like where's the Galaxy S 12 you
don't smile more you know it's a banana
phone have a laugh lighten up what do
you say Jack partner for you he'll be
waiting for you when you get home this
is the banana phone says banana phone
there
looks like volume up/down answer and end
phone calls microphone I'm guessing an
earpiece that's it if you walked into a
place like your friend's house or
something and you were like hey man
how's it going he's like oh yo he's like
one second though yeah because oh wow
look where they snuck the micro USB to
charge it that's it you may have
realized at this point that the banana
phone is more of an accessory than a
replacement for a smart phone this is
actually a Bluetooth device this is very
ergonomic as a banana would be it curves
around you answer and end your phone
calls on here it's like a Bluetooth
headset in the shape of a banana
did you notice yet
what he thinks about that power on its
flashing I think it's in pairing mode
let me check my Bluetooth out banana
phone I mean that's just fun seeing that
pop-up so let's go ahead and call well
real quick yo it's a what it's a banana
phone yeah really sound clear
better than the s9 new comparison video
banana phone versus s9 sound quality
good night just say mary had a little
lamb
well sing jingle bells or something okay
just do a gorilla voice here's the thing
I gotta tell you on this one well this
is super comfy to talk on and it's more
cozy than uh you know your smartphone
holding that brick up there who would
have thought the banana was the shape we
needed here daily driver material right
here okay I'm gonna let you go well have
a good one it is one of those products
that you wouldn't believe existed until
you you saw it
existing and then you would say oh I
believe it exists there's a fun twist to
put a smile on your face it's a bit of a
gag gift with a positive spin to it in
the world of tech where everybody's
taking themselves so serious by this
don't buy that get your life together
send the message put it in the calendar
move the three o'clock to four o'clock
and the four o'clock to 3 o'clock why
would you in a world like that every so
often you have a little laugh alright
it's the banana phone save a gorilla
save Jack while you're at it basically a
gorilla slightly evolved slightly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
