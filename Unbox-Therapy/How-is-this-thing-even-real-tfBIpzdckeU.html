you get the banana phone and a
percentage of the profits from the sale

looks like volume up/down answer and end
phone calls microphone I'm guessing an
earpiece that's it if you walked into a
place like your friend's house or
something and you were like hey man
how's it going he's like oh yo he's like
one second though yeah because oh wow
look where they snuck the micro USB to
charge it that's it you may have
realized at this point that the banana
phone is more of an accessory than a
replacement for a smart phone this is
actually a Bluetooth device this is very
ergonomic as a banana would be it curves
around you answer and end your phone
calls on here it's like a Bluetooth
headset in the shape of a banana

flashing I think it's in pairing mode

lamb

I gotta tell you on this one well this
is super comfy to talk on and it's more
cozy than uh you know your smartphone

a good one it is one of those products
that you wouldn't believe existed until
you you saw it
existing and then you would say oh I
believe it exists there's a fun twist to
put a smile on your face it's a bit of a
gag gift with a positive spin to it in
the world of tech where everybody's
taking themselves so serious by this
don't buy that get your life together
send the message put it in the calendar
move the three o'clock to four o'clock
and the four o'clock to 3 o'clock why
