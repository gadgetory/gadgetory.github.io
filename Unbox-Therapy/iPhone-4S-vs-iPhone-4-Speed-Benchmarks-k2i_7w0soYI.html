unbox therapy and as you probably know
things are heating up in relationship to
this iPhone 4s that we're all expecting
this week for delivery and the reason is
because we got some preliminary numbers
some benchmarks hitting the web that are
basically putting this iPhone 4s at the
top of the food chain as far as speed
and graphics performance for a handheld
now whether you're comparing apples to
apples in the case of the 4 - the 4s or
Apple's to androids this device has
basically impressed anybody who's looked
at these benchmarks now very quick
disclaimer benchmarks are not the be-all
and end-all there are oftentimes things
at play that don't necessarily show up
in the figures for example browser
optimizations so on and so forth and
benchmarks are generally a
representation of a software and
hardware relationship so the software
differences in the iOS platform and and
the Android platform are going to lead
to slightly different results so keep
that in mind when we look at this
figures but if you're expecting an
iPhone 4s or considering one you are
definitely going to be impressed by what
we're about to see especially
considering that the 4s carries an 800
megahertz a5 and and some of the Android
competitors are rocking significantly
higher clock speeds so we're looking at
an antique calm awesome sight in
relationship to benchmarks etc and what
he's done is he compiled a list of the
different benchmarks available on the
web
he's made it real clean and easy to look
at so this is where you're going to want
to go if you want to examine these
figures further but I'm gonna give you
the rundown necessary right here so the
very first benchmark we're going to look
at is the SunSpider JavaScript benchmark
this is a browser performance benchmark
talking about how quickly you're going
to load web pages so on and so forth the
overall performance in a browser and as
you guys can see the iPhone 4s is is
pretty high up there though there's one
device that's faster and that's the
Galaxy Tab 10 9 which is running
honeycomb and that's a full-fledged
tablet of course but in comparison to
the iPhone 4 you can see that the eye
for us is almost twice as fast in the
browser obviously lower figures in this
particular benchmark indicate better
performance as we move down the list
we've got another browser performance
benchmark this one from right where and
in this case higher figures are better
as you can see the 4s tops the entire
list again almost twice as fast as the
iPhone 4 which we've got down here and
almost twice as fast as a number of
different Android devices something to
keep in mind is that these Android
devices are going to improve on this
benchmark figure when they do get new
software at this point the software
they're running is pretty old and
everybody's expecting Ice Cream Sandwich
very soon which is going to improve some
of these figures probably bring them
closer to where this Galaxy Tab 8.9 is
scoring obviously running 3.1 a little
bit further down we've got geek bench
now geek bench is an overall sort of
computing benchmark it's going to give
you a general computing score that's
day-to-day processing etc and as you
guys notice here the iPad 2 is still
significantly faster obviously it's got
that higher clock speed at 1 gigahertz
instead of 800 megahertz but not not a
hell of a lot faster than the iPhone 4s
and the iPhone 4s has basically doubled
the iPhone 4s figure here as well
same thing goes in the processor integer
performance you've got a similar
relationship between the iPad 2 and the
iPhone 4s and you've got that doubling
in performance from the iPhone 4 so
again if you've used an iPhone 4
exclusively for the last year or so then
this thing is likely going to feel a
little bit faster in daily use you're
actually going to notice this this is
not something that's just going to show
up on a benchmark you're gonna notice
something that feels a little bit
snappier a little bit smoother or so on
and so forth and the last thing we want
to talk about of course is graphics
benchmarks everybody wants to know how
can the thin game and as you might guess
it's similar to the rest of it rest of
the benchmarks the iPad 2 being at the
top again it's kind of it's kind of
strange to compare an iPad 2 in this
category because you can't stick it in
your jean pocket but it's there in case
you've used an iPad 2 then you know kind
of what to expect from a performance
standpoint and once again
in relationship to the iPhone 4 this is
where we're seeing a big big improvement
you know some have suggested 7 times
it's almost 7 times are almost exactly
seven times performance improvement from
Apple's a4 chip all the way down here at
the bottom of the list here's the phone
I'm using right now the Nexus S and as
you guys can see I mean we're on a
different planet with these figures so
we'll have to wait and see how the new
Android software bring some of these
Android of what device is closer but as
of right now
graphics CPU web browser you name it
this thing is coming off impressive and
it's all the more reason to be excited
for the release as I told you guys
before I will be in line like a crazy
man
I'll cover the entire lineup as well as
what's going on at the mall and so on
and so forth on this channel here I'll
be reporting and as soon as I get it you
know whether I got to pay somebody in
line or whatever the hell I got to do to
get it on this Chen I'm gonna do that
for you I'm gonna put together the
highest quality unboxing and review as
quickly as humanly possible so as soon
as I get it I rush back home you got the
idea so definitely stay tuned to the
channel if you haven't subscribed yet
you're gonna want to do so because as I
said before I'm gonna get that thing up
here as soon as possible so you guys can
get real up close and personal with that
new device anyway guys as always I want
to thank you for watching and supporting
my content you guys make this stuff
possible and until next time I'll see
you around all right later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
