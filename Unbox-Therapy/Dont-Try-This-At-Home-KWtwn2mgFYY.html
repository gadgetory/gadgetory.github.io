another video and today i am bringing
you something practical this my friends
is the first washable keyboard i've seen
with actual real keys it is the keyboard
that loves a wash now I know you're
staring down at some grimy keyboard and
I'm telling you to change your ways if
you're in an environment where you like
to eat your Cheetos overtop your
keyboard like most of the people here on
YouTube then it's time for you to step
up your hygiene and maybe take a look at
the k310 from Logitech the key
characters are laser printed UV coated
you can rinse it off there it is in the
sink so our job of course here on unbox
therapy is to test this guy out I've got
coca-cola maple syrup I don't have real
maple syrup because I would never waste
that holy material ok what do we got
here oh wow aggressiveness a really long
USB cable with a little protector on it
look at this there's even a little tool
here which stores on the bottom you see
that Jack for getting even closer
maximum 50 degrees Celsius water okay 30
centimeters submerge in five minutes max
underneath and then don't use a hair
dryer to blow it don't put it in the
dishwasher either that makes it a couple
little feet on it so I could see these
things being deployed in in hospitals in
kitchens uh bathrooms why would you need
a keyboard in the bathroom Jack Stephen
King if you're a Stephen King you gotta
be typing everywhere you go cuz that
idea might you might strike and you're
like right of course that's the way the
guy dies
see the keys kind of appear to be
floating a little bit now let's let's uh
let's reconfigure the set here and let's
do some experimentation okay so I've got
the worst to the worst we're gonna start
with the stickiest stuff on the planet
and jemima this is fake maple syrup all
right so for the record get the real
deal all right splurge a little bit pull
your wallet out get the real deal
have you had real maple syrup give it a
shot take it from a Canadian oh oh
that's painful
looks like pancakes smells like Waffle
House what's up next ketchup oh good
lord
lucky that well mustard I don't know oh
oh no shake mustard worse than regular
it's the no shake this combination of
smells is a little much right now
there's a little bit of soft honey
oh oh and then of course coca-cola
whoa it's not even fair listen if you're
eating at your desk and this happens
you're a wild animal I got some water
now come on water do your thing you know
what it's all rinsing out kind of nicely
the next step is of course to test it
out moment of truth gave it a proper
rinse in the sink we need to plug it in
obviously it still has to work otherwise
all those shenanigans were kind of
pointless let's see here yes sir
unbox there feels good works well all
the keys are in good working order yes
it's a washable keyboard this has real
keys on it and it's washable am I the
only one who's excited here wait I want
to do it the other way there we go I
like that look better</div></body></html>
