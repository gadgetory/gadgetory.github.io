go further what's up guys Lew here and
we're taking a closer look at the LG
booth here at CES 2013 this is something
they're calling the world's largest 3d
wall and I'm not doubting that that's
exactly what this is it's similar to
their display last year and LG seems to
be one of the remaining manufacturers
that's still pushing the idea of 3d
content in big 3d displays not that the
other manufacturers don't still have it
but this is still there the major thing
you take away from visiting their booth
here at CES 2013 so as you can see here
they want you to experience LG Cinema 3d
world and then hand you a pair of
glasses to do so but something that
interested me a little bit more this
year is this 21 by 9 ultrawide monitor
and as you can see it's very unusual
it's not like something I've seen before
it has this unique 21 by 9 aspect ratio
now that's good for Hollywood content
cinema content that's in this aspect
ratio but for me I'm more excited about
the application as a Productivity
monitor because this means you're going
to be able to get a bunch of windows
open in a form factor that makes it very
easy to be productive so you know you
know me I got a bunch of tabs open all
at once this means I'm going to be able
to see more of what I'm working on in
one display it's 29 inches and it's 2560
by 1080 in terms of resolution there's a
bunch of ports on the back I can see a
USB 3 they're actually a bunch of USB so
it looks like it has a USB hub as well
as an HDMI port and I've been told as
well that it's a dual input so you're
going to be able to put more than one
video source in at one time
so anyways I'm excited about this I
might pick one of these up actually
because it just looks really enticing to
me this is a 21 by 9 screen from LG a
brand new form factor in the desktop
monitor / small display space anyway
