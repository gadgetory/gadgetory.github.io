another video and this is one that I
think you've been expecting it is time
for my take on the new iPhone the new
old iPhone the iPhone se I thought it
was gonna be called the 5 se because
essentially this thing is an iPhone 5s
plus rose gold essentially of course the
internals have changed here they're
going to get better performance out of
this model and the camera is better and
so on to your average buyer out there
this thing looks a lot like a much older
iPhone in fact as you'll see that's an
iPhone 5s that thing is how many years
old you know how you have dog years and
cat years and then you have tech years
and in tech years one year is a person's
lifetime here we have a device that many
could could confuse for something a lot
older and yet people are still motivated
to get it and that is part of a bigger
conversation about smart phones in
general and what people are looking for
maybe your phone is kind of more like a
hat or a pair of socks or shoes or
something where not everybody has the
same size hands not everybody should
have the same size phone I get that the
whole R&amp;amp;D department that would have
existed for a smaller iPhone in a
similar kind of appearance package as
the 6 and 6-plus they got to take a nap
they get to take an extended vacation on
this one because they were like I got it
take some iPhone 6 components cram them
into the current case for the iPhone 5s
money in the bank and I'm not hating I'm
not saying that this this phone doesn't
serve a purpose and doesn't have a
perfect customer it certainly does and
we move so quickly through technology
anyways that there's a case to be made
for holding on to some of these iconic
designs but you cannot deny that a group
of people who would have been tasked
with creating a smaller iPhone a new
generation smaller iPhone they got to
take a nap on this one that's a bit of a
rant to kick off this video let's jump
inside these boxes and check out the new
old iPhone we've got the silver model
okay course the gold this is definitely
a nice design
I do not deny that and hae-in world of
say cars for example they don't remodel
them every year or even every two years
when you've got an icon you stay true to
that you stay consistent
there's your rose gold now why are there
two space grey
well that's because one of them actually
has a skin on it matte black stealth
black blackout D brand they actually
hooked up all these phones so if you
want a skin check them out link in the
description and then of course the stock
Space Gray and you can see how that baby
looks right they're having deja vu
look at this thing look at the way that
fits in my hand you see that this is
really what Steve Jobs was all about he
believed that the device should be able
to be used in one hand people started
using these things for multimedia
watching a ton of video and they wanted
bigger screens people wanted everything
in one place and phones got better and
phones got faster essentially sit down
on the couch and stare at their phone
all day and he wanted a big screen to do
that there is something to be said for
being able to completely operate every
inch of your device with one hand I'm
gonna pick the black one and set that
baby up real quick man this feels small
s7 just gobbles that up insert sim card
to activate the only people out there
that require that that's one thing Apple
knows how to do right there it's so
clinical so clean another thing that
considers the fact that this is it's
gonna be an inexpensive foam it's 399
bucks in the world of $300 phones $300
phones ain't what they used to be you
get a lot for $300 these days touch ID
is still pretty good
I gotta admit it's quick you can restore
from iCloud backup iTunes backup set up
as a new iPhone or move data from
Android there it is your iPhone se in
all of its glory now the camera is one
of these areas where you're going to see
an improvement that's one thing you got
to give to the iPhones they take great
fast pictures no doubt about it
everybody knows this so the camera on
the se is the same 12 megapixel shooter
that you would get the
in the 6s but unfortunately the
forward-facing camera the selfie camera
in this case is actually gonna be a bit
of a downgrade from the one that exists
on the 6s so what you're working with
here in terms of battery is 1642
milliamp hours certainly not
monstrous battery here's the thing this
isn't really this is a tough product to
digest look what I got going on yeah I
got I got boxes and products scattered
everywhere but it is a tough phone to
digest instead of looking at what a
small iPhone a modern small iPhone would
be you just go back to the flagship from
once upon a time I'm not calling it lazy
it's a bit unfortunate that we don't get
to see the execution of some new ideas
from that very talented engineering team
that I'm sure exists over in Cupertino
no doubt they will sell a ton of these
and no doubt there will be a bunch of
happy users who were in love with their
older smaller iPhone that are happy now
to have updated specs and a better
camera but for me I feel like maybe we
missed out on an all-new freshly
designed mini iPhone and to me that that
might have been interesting to take a
look at and what I know at this point is
there is an exclusive device inside the
new</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
