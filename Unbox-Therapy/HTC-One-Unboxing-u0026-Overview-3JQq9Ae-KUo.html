therapy and I am very excited to finally
have my hands on the HTC one I've been
watching videos about it and learning
about it everybody seems to be saying
that it is the most beautiful most
brilliant Android device available I'll
be putting it through its paces and
finding out for myself and I'll get to
do it in the unbox therapy style that
you guys love at least I hope you still
love it if you do make sure to keep on
hitting that thumbs up button down below
that just lets me know that you love it
anyways let's go ahead and look at the
specs on the back of the box it is a 1.7
gigahertz quad-core processor Snapdragon
600 inside of this device you've got 32
gigabytes of storage 2 gigs of RAM 1080p
full HD screen at 4.7 inches for an
effective PPI of 468 that's incredible
that's the highest resolution display
you can get on a phone there are other
1080p phones but they're all 5 inches so
the pixel density here is unbelievable
you also get that new HTC ultra pixel
camera with an F 2.0 lens and relatively
wide for a phone camera as well at 28
millimeters you've also got Beats Audio
built-in so presumably you've got a
little bit better performance on the
audio front but most importantly you
have forward facing speakers unlike you
know every phone in the world up until
this point
finally forward facing speakers now you
may notice the unusual unboxing knife
this thing is an absolute beast I will
also link that down in the description
as well so let's go ahead and jump
inside the box and get a closer look at
the HTC One and everything that is
included in the retail package the first
thing you're greeted with is the device
I'll put that to the side for a moment
get through the more mundane more boring
accessories then we'll jump back to some
beautiful visuals on the device shortly
so the first extra you're going to
notice inside the box is a set of
headphones they aren't beats branded but
they do seem to have Beats styling
because there are red tips they are
interchangeable so you can pick the most
comfortable and suitable size for your
personal ear canals you'll also notice
an inline microphone making these
convenient for answering phone calls
like
head set that's included with a
smartphone these days so I do give them
a few extra points at least for having
slightly different styling they're not
just straight-up white or black and they
also have what looks like a tangle free
cord it's got that ribbon style cord so
presumably they won't get tangled quite
as easily as standard headset might
you've also got a USB cable micro USB to
USB used for charging the device and
that cable will plug into this USB power
brick this is what you will plug into
the wall when you need a little bit more
juice you've got paperwork as well from
HTC and a little tiny tool for inserting
your micro SIM this is pretty standard
especially on devices that are as thin
as the HTC One so here's that paperwork
that I mentioned earlier some warranty
information etc and then lastly you have
a couple of stickers from HTC so you can
rep the brand on the bumper of your car
on your laptop or anywhere else you
might place a sticker so here's a closer
look at the actual device the main
attraction here the front identifies HTC
blinkfeed boomsound and Zoe so those are
some special features included and as we
remove the last piece of packaging here
you can start to appreciate the build
quality the design and you can start to
figure out what all the reviewers have
been raving about this thing is
absolutely beautiful the front is
dominated by that large 4.7 inch 1080p
screen the back is done in a beautiful
aluminum which is curved and very very
thin very nice to hold the camera is
flush with the device unlike older HTC
devices where the camera protruded a bit
and on the front we have forward-facing
speakers which is a big deal and has
been covered in the ads for the HTC one
but finally I mean jeez it's been a long
time that we've been dealing with
devices firing audio in all kinds of
different directions down back up
anywhere but at us which is kind of a
strange thing and these are big speakers
too and loud so HTC has really brought
the heat with this device from a
hardware design and engineering
standpoint I will agree with everyone
else that this is the most beautiful
Android handset no forget about it the
most beautiful handset available right
now if you guys are interested in
pricing and availability on
device the link will be down below so
you can go and check that out but as you
can tell I'm a big fan so far I haven't
used it for an extended period but the
hardware is definitely on point one
little mini drawback for me is that the
power button / you know the lock button
is on the top where I usually prefer it
on the side of the device on the side
here you have your volume rocker and on
the front is where you'll see your light
sensor as well as your forward-facing
camera on each side of that top speaker
the back also features an LED flash to
go with that flush mounted camera as I
said before and that is of course that
very interesting ultra pixel camera
which I will definitely be putting to
the test shortly so taking a closer look
at the interface you do have the new HTC
Sense now you know you guys know I'm a
huge fan of the stock Android experience
I generally prefer that to a skinned
experience but this one feels snappy as
hell I mean you really don't notice that
there's anything on top here I probably
won't use the blink feed features though
I don't know right now
granted I just opened this thing up but
as you guys can tell this has the
potential to be a multimedia powerhouse
with that 1080p screen with that fast
processor with those wonderful
forward-facing speakers I mean this
thing is going to be really tough to
beat and the new Galaxy s4 definitely
has its work cut out for it going up
against this wonderfully designed
beautifully engineered and powerful 4.7
inch HTC One you guys could tell that
I'm a fan I think you probably will be -
