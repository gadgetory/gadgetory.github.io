another video and today it is a special
product that does more than one thing
this is the Piper NV and it looks at
first like a camera kind of like a
webcam or something but it's actually an
entire security system in a box it has a
built in motion sensor traditional
motion sensor a wide-angle lens that can
see in both day and night and it also
integrates with other home automation
now you can control this entire thing
from your smartphone either on iOS or
Android and it even has a siren 105
decibels siren built into it so if
anybody is on your premises in your
house and you don't want them to be
there the siren is definitely a great
way to let them know it's also got a
microphone and speaker so there is
two-way communication if you want to
talk to your kids pets some people yes
like to talk to their pets and their
pets feel more comfortable that way
moving around the box you can see some
of the features highlighted here so it
is a panoramic HD video night vision as
I mentioned before the back offers up a
little bit more detail you can see here
that you can get notifications you can
watch live and recorded video all from
your smartphone you can also remotely
control lights and appliances by pairing
some accessories with this Piper NV it
uses the z-wave automation controller to
interface with some of those other smart
accessories like door sensors windows
sensors now the camera has an incredibly
wide field of view it's also got ambient
light temperature and humidity sensors
the motion sensor that I talked about
earlier let's go ahead and open up the
box and take a closer look at the device
school packaging here oh wow so there it
is very cool looking as a nice metallic
stand here and it is optionally
wall-mounted as I mentioned before you
can see the super wide angle camera lens
in this location couple of LEDs and then
a motion detector
now this motion sensor can be configured
to activate the camera on motion so it's
recording when you want it to and then
you're only seeing updates when
something's going down
that's easy so we have a QuickStart
guide here tells you how to get it set
up three steps and you're good to go
little sticker our battery is included I
love it when manufacturers include
batteries you don't have to go searching
for them I've said it before I'll say it
again and then you have your power
adapter pretty simple stuff everything
you need to get started in the box so as
mentioned setting it up is pretty
straightforward you remove the stand
first followed by this little backplate
one two three
bingo so there we go we have power now
you can see the LED is lit up and I am
going to now download the application
Piper it's ready whoa did you hear that
Piper's ready
I like Piper's voice did you hear that
with the accent you can search for Piper
in the App Store and it'll come up as
the top hit so I'm going to install this
if that lens is super wide almost like a
fisheye now I will go ahead and create
an account that's the first step
named Piper we can we can have our own
name for Piper how about Jack what do
you think Jack okay so now I have the
app loaded up and you can see this is
called the dashboard gives you quick and
easy access to the various functions of
your Piper and most of the UI takes
place on the bottom here where you can
switch between dashboard vitals live
video controls and then rules so moving
over to vitals this is a cool layout for
distinguishing when things that might be
unusual or going on within your space
you can see temperature as well as
moisture
bright versus dark you have sound where
it can tell you if it's been loud versus
silent and then of course the motion
there's a little human there which would
signify somebody being in your space so
busy versus still and when it happened
within the last 48 hours so here's a
quick look at the live video feed from
the Piper which is facing out into the
studio and one thing to mention before
we talk more about this they're giving
away a free one there's a link in the
description if you want your shot at
winning
your very own Piper so what's
interesting here is that the angle of
view is so wide 180
agrees to be exact but if you want you
can turn this into four separate
viewpoints focusing in on different
portions within the room could be the
couch in this angle here or the chair as
it is in this portion over here and then
you go super wide in another section so
you almost end up with four different
cameras in one or at least effectively
you get four specific view points so you
can zoom in on different portions of the
room zoom and pan and then rules this is
the cool part so what happens here is
you have a ton of control over how you
interact with your Piper you can have it
send you a notification if motion is
detected if a loud sound is detected or
if the temperature changes you can set
those up for various profiles here are
the rules for stay mode rules for away
mode rules for vacation mode that you
can set up then lastly we have the rules
for notify only mode which will send you
a notification regardless when it comes
to motion sound same kind of stuff
let's go in and select one of these
modes let's say I go with if motion is
detected when I'm in stay mode I can
record video every time motion is
detected I can get a notification push
message a phone call email or a text
that's very cool notify a trusted circle
and then last thing we have sound siren
and unlike having a super long video
feed you're going to have snippets of
just highlights so you know that
something's going on and it's worth
watching instead of looking at dead
space when you have it set to away or
vacation mode or whatever that might be
now one more thing to mention about the
Piper is it'll store your video clips in
the cloud up to a thousand in fact and
there's no monthly fee for doing so
unlike some other products that are on
the market so there you have it a cool
little security system in a box with a
ton of sensors packed into a tiny little
package not only do you have a camera
here which is wide-angle and easy to
monitor it will also record clips but
you also have this traditional motion
sensor and a bunch of other sensors as
well and maybe my favorite feature the
siren there's nothing like that piercing
sound to let a thief know that you see
him she know he's there it's time for
him
to leave without all of your stuff
