this moves up to the second place in the
global smartphone sales share Huawei
Technologies overtook Apple to become
the world's number two smartphone maker
in the second quarter this year
registering and on your growth of 41
percent was the first time that Apple
had not been the number one or number
two smartphone company in terms of
market share we don't know much fire but
it's math folks are - what I do the
whole Wow so I wanted to talk a little
bit about some information that came out
recently CA na ly s calm these guys they
do these reports on the smartphone
industry of which I am of course very
invested makes so many videos on
smartphones pay attention to the
marketplace and so I like to know
exactly what's going on where the
marketplace is going because that
matters to you it affects you it impacts
you it impacts what ends up in your
pocket so Huawei overtakes Apple to
become number two smartphone vendor in
q2 2018 I know you'll be like there was
no new iPhone you're tracking the wrong
period but here's why this is
significant this is the first time that
Apple and Samsung have not been in the
top two spots of smartphone sales in any
quarter in seven years since the second
quarter of 2010 seven years is a very
long time we're talking about the
smartphone business as a whole now when
we're talking about seven years Apple
and Samsung they have flip-flopped in
those top two spots you can kind of
track it yourself very infrequently
Apple has beat Samsung in terms of
market share but overall either one or
two for seven straight years and Huawei
has ended that not only did they end
that with 54 million units shipped to
Apple's 41 million units but they did
sell with 41 percent year-on-year growth
skyrocketing in terms of volume and a
lot of that has to do with the honor
brand which is actually responsible for
two-thirds of this growth pointing in
this direction of budget devices being
the future of devices in general when it
comes to volume now the reason this is
important is because it inserts an
individual into a particular ecosystem
if your first device is an inexpensive
honor device and you get familiar with
Android you buy all your apps on there
you use those messengers whatsapp
so on it becomes harder for Apple to
eventually get their teeth into you
their teeth into you for you to get your
teeth into their Apple some people will
say yes but Apple is out there realizing
the majority of the profits in the
smartphone business sure you're correct
they are in fact Huawei has stepped away
from a profitability focus and instead
they're focusing solely on this rapid
growth let's get people in the door give
away the free hotcakes and maybe they'll
stick around and buy the bacon and the
sausages you see what I'm doing here now
obviously their devices are not free but
they have so many options at the lower
end and for those in for you on Twitter
and in other places they want to tell me
that Apple doesn't care because this
sitting there counting their trillion
bucks which they are but the reason they
need to be concerned is because this is
the long game all right
this is not about your lifetime this is
about forever in the smartphone business
in the technology business you need to
get people in the door and continue to
do so in that same quarter apples
year-on-year growth was only 1% will
always 41% that's a lot of new customers
and they did that with no US presence
yes clearly we always overtaken them
while we've not allowed to sell phones
in North America so all of those sales
are coming clearly from elsewhere you
know you guys have probably heard but
the complications selling product in the
United States for huawei honor and so on
they did this everywhere else
number one smartphone manufacturer in
China they account for 27 percent of
smartphone purchases in China outside of
China the p20 and p20 Pro more than
doubled the shipments of the P 10 and P
10 plus so people obviously like this
device now what does this all mean for
Apple I know lots of you are iPhone
users out there and you're sitting there
thinking lu am I getting an iPhone
pretty soon what about these new models
how is Apple going to play this promise
you Apple cares and the reason I know
they care is because they are finally
looking at a more budget version out of
the gate now don't tell me that in the
past when they let the old model hang
around that was their budget version
that's a scam we all know it look at the
MacBook Air right now that's not a
legitimate purchase in this day and age
this time around that's different we've
seen the leaks we've seen the rumors
shifting certain components LCD displays
cutting costs because they're looking
this report just like I am and just like
you are you need to get people into your
ecosystem you need to get people using
your services now I should talk about
Samsung real quick because they're also
on this chart
they've been number one for a very long
time from the wide variety of smartphone
products that they make down 8% their
stuff is not selling as great as it used
to but that's still 73 million units
they're moving a lot of units but they
are also taking a close look at this
I'm sure wondering where they need to be
from a product offering perspective to
keep moving in the same direction that
Huawei is moving in right now now one
more thing to reiterate here Huawei is
not currently selling in the United
States for various reasons if that
changes you can expect to see an even
bigger number here in terms of growth
the United States very big smartphone
market talking about customers opening
the front door hanging out a little bit
they're looking around I can't tell you
what the next device is but they're
getting more comfortable with the idea
of brands that aren't called Samsung and
aren't called Apple and now you know
that would you give Huawei a shot P 20 P
20 Pro is that in your future let me
know maybe you have concerns leave a
