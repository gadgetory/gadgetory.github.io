couple of sweet deals to share with you
real quick I saw these things develop
online and I was like you know what the
audience needs to know about this first
things first
Xbox one you might have heard of it it's
a console well it's got a lot more
attractive recently because of the fact
that titanfall is set to launch
officially at the beginning of March and
in anticipation Microsoft has paired
together the title as well as the
console in the US for a combination kind
of purchase and the good thing here is
that you're not paying any more than the
stock console which you can still buy in
a box out of Best Buy right now so don't
do that instead preorder this combo kit
because you're getting titanfall for
free so the link is down in the
description for u.s. viewers for UK
viewers something similar is going on I
did a little bit of research but instead
of titanfall it's FIFA 14 that you get
for the same price as the stock no game
console the next thing is regarding Gran
Turismo 6
I've actually been holding off
purchasing it even though I'm a huge
Gran Turismo fan I just haven't had a
lot of time
but now it's even more enticing at a
brand-new price it's 39 dollars in the
US and Canada those links will both be
down in the description so that's a
discount from the retail obviously and
then in the UK this is weird in the UK
it's actually the cheapest at 20 British
pounds which works out to about 33 US
Dollars so I know a lot of people in
Europe often complain that things cost
more over there
but as you can tell that's not the case
for this particular item so no more
complaining ever again I don't want to
hear it $33 Gran Turismo 6 for those of
you in the UK so I covered a few
different countries here if you don't
live in one of these countries I
apologize it's just that these things
came onto my radar and I thought you
guys will be interested in finding out
if you appreciated this quick update
please remember to leave a thumbs up
down below and also feel free to share
this video with your friends that you
think might need to know about these
eels also if I find deals that don't
necessarily make it into a video they
are often found on my Twitter account so
make sure to be following me there I am
at unbox therapy thanks as always for
your viewership now go do some shopping
alright guys catch on the next episode
later links in the description</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
