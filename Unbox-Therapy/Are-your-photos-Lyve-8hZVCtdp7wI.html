another video and today I've got
something interesting to introduce to
you or maybe already know about it this
is the live home a hard drive but it
comes with a specialized application for
helping you to backup your photos videos
etc and it has a really interesting
physical feature that I haven't seen
before
let's jump inside the box and find out
what makes this thing special really
easy box to open here don't need any
special blades or anything like that on
the inside the first thing you will see
is the live home and you'll probably
notice this screen on the front that is
going to be how you set up the device
it's also gonna be a spot to display
some of the photos and things that you
have stored on here so a really cool
feature this will look cool standing on
your desktop and displaying some of your
recent images the unit features 2
terabytes of storage and on the back is
where you are going to interface with it
that's where you've got all of your
different ports including an HDMI port I
assume that would be used to display the
video output you've also got an Ethernet
port in that location if you want to use
a wired connection or if you prefer you
can use Wireless of course you get a
little bit better speed on the wired
connection as you know with networking
wired is top performance but most people
will use this wirelessly of a USB port
as well as a headphone jack in audio
port and then a power supply port
otherwise a nice streamlined looking
device it's got a white matte finish so
it's not going to attract too many
fingerprints you'll also notice an SD
card slot on the side and that's pretty
cool because it'll allow you to backup
your photos and videos without the need
to use a PC or Mac you can just extract
your SD card from your camera insert it
in here and then use the interface via
this touch screen to get everything up
and running I'm gonna put this down for
a moment and show you the other items
inside the box you've also got a power
brick it comes with this detached
power prong so depending on where you're
located you'll get the proper one
shipped out to you as you can see I of
course have the North American power
plug here also inside the box we have a
tiny little slip in order to help you
get up and running plug in the live home
get the apps relax and enjoy now I
already have the app installed on my
iPhone there's also an app for Android
so the live app can actually work
standalone without the need for the
external drive if you don't need the
extra storage as you can see here I have
it installed on my phone and you can
actually try this out for yourself I'll
put a link in the description if you
want to try the app as you can see here
it's already begun backing up my images
and organizing them this is called the
digest and it separates your images by
day so you can go back and relive
memories in a little bit more easy
format it also looks back at moments
from this month a year ago which is
pretty cool you also have a timeline
view if you prefer that method of
navigation favorites just added for your
recent stuff and then photos and videos
independently if you're looking for one
specifically and then sources and this
is where you can see the various devices
that are connected to live in my case I
have my iPhone of course and then the
live home which are both connected and
in sync and I can add other devices here
as well I'm gonna plug this baby in
right now and then hopefully show you
what the interface is like and how to
get it set up ok so now the device is
booting up as you can see here you have
this nice color touchscreen on the front
and you're greeted with the logo that
says live a little loading bar down at
the bottom here so the first thing
that's gonna do is scan for wireless
networks after you've connected to the
web it'll ask you to either create a new
account or to sign into a pre-existing
live account and as I mentioned earlier
in the video I did so on my iPhone prior
to recording this so that I'd be ready
to go I'm gonna go ahead and put in my
credentials so now I'm signed in and
there's a little bit of a demo here
showing you how to use the inner
face explaining the easy import either
via a USB Drive or an SD card next up
it's telling me to get the app which I
already have and something that's cool
about the app is you can have it
installed on as many devices as you want
and then access all of the images and
videos that exist on those devices from
one interface so here it's running a
sample of what the device will look like
sitting on your desk except of course
it'll be streaming through your images
it also has a nice little clock here and
as I move over you can see the status of
the device free space that's available
there are no photos no videos but I
could navigate those different sections
here as well it's two terabytes so
that's a lot of photos and videos you
can also adjust the settings from in
here the screen saver how quickly it
comes on the users what's under general
so here we can export to USB restore
from USB network stuff time zone you've
also got a brightness setting here so
depending on how bright you want it to
be you can actually scroll through so if
you have this sitting in a relatively
public place in your house when people
come over they can scroll through images
and quickly browse using this almost as
like a photo frame now if you have this
device in a bedroom or something like
that there's even an option to turn the
screen off completely so maybe you don't
want to have the ambient light on
although I think it would be cool as
like a bedside kind of clock type
situation as long as you could toggle
the brightness down so it wouldn't be
bothering you but the main thing here is
you have a pretty device that unlike a
lot of attached storage doesn't need to
be an eyesore in fact in this case it's
actually going to be presenting some
information that sometimes we have
trouble displaying as you know there are
images and videos on all of your devices
but how do you get them into one place
how do you get them onto a place where
you can actually display them because
often times they end up living on those
screens and not out in public so there
you have it the live home they also make
a studio version which is similar
without the screen on the front if you
don't need or want it anyways that wraps
up this video if you guys enjoyed it
