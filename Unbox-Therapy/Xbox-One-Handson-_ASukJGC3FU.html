am at the Xbox HQ Xbox one HQ on Bloor
Street West in Toronto and we're getting
a preview of a bunch of different games
for the next-gen Xbox console I am
playing Ryse son of Rome right now and
I'm getting my ass kicked so we're gonna
show you around and give you guys some
gameplay footage from all the different
titles that we get to try out so next up
was Dead Rising 3
smashing zombies and such I was told
though that it was on dummy mode which
probably explains my domination in this
gameplay right here blood and guts
galore as you can tell Dead Rising 3 was
one of my favorites that I got to play
but then again who doesn't love a zombie
survival game next up I got to try out
force of 5 another one of my favorites
I'm a huge fan of racing games and force
a 5 looked crystal clear it was very
responsive the controller Rumble was
also on point helping to identify when
the car was veering off paths etc it's
much more precise than the previous
generation Rumble that sounds
complicated but you really need to try
this out to understand what I'm talking
about speaking of the controller it's
obviously an all-new design and I'm a
big fan it carries forward the feel from
the 360 controller with some
improvements and refinements like I
mentioned with the rumble functionality
I also tried out a new headset from
turtlebeach the ear for 7 very nice cans
with a good seal around your ear they
were capable of blocking out all the
noise and commotion from the venue so I
was impressed from a preliminary
standpoint though I would like to get an
extended trial with these so I can you
know do some more testing etc some
dedicated unbox therapy viewers also
dropped into the space on Bloor Street
for some versus mode on the new killer
instinct big shout out to both Connor
and Matt
for coming through to play me and mostly
kicked my ass although I believe I did
win one game before I left I'm down for
a rematch whenever though all in all I
had a great time visiting the Xbox one
HQ a very cool setup and cool people too
