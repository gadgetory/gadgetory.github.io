chance to check out the call of duty
modern warfare 3 limited edition Jeep at
the Auto Show yesterday and I thought
you know what this would be cool to
share with you guys I know you guys are
big gaming fans and this is a very
unusual Jeep in fact there are only 200
of them on the planet you can see you
got the modern warfare branding as well
as the Call of Duty branding in the
seats and then on the front glovebox
area you've got the Call of Duty logo
once again embossed in that location and
here you can see the identifiers that
this is number four of 200 of this
particular special edition so as you
guys can tell this is a real rugged Jeep
Wrangler it's all black they've also got
the black rims on some nice big rugged
tires so you know this thing's gonna be
capable of some some off-road activities
I don't know about warfare I don't think
this thing is specked out for warfare by
any means but you do have some space in
the back if you want to carry some
weaponry with you a place to keep all
your guns and whatnot and you've got
some rugged floor mats that look like
they've been upgraded potentially and
this was a real hot item at the Auto
Show everyone couldn't wait to get
inside the kids were scrambling trying
to get you know a seat in here for a
quick second I'll go ahead and jump in a
cockpit for a moment and see what it
feels like to pilot this vehicle right
here and I noticed one more modern
warfare branding on the speedometer
there so you can always be reminded that
you've got the special edition Wrangler
this ain't no regular Wrangler anyway
guys if you enjoy car content I actually
got some more footage at the Auto Show
of some cool sports cars some very
unique sports cars including one that's
worth a couple million bucks so if you
want to check that out click the link in
the annotations I'll put one down in the
description as well that video is longer
format it's on my second channel the B
speed and I get to check out some really
really cool vehicles the manufacturers
were nice enough to let us you know
behind the velvet rope if you will to
get a close look at some real expensive
cars so click the link in the
annotations or down in the description
if you want to check that out and as
always if you guys enjoyed this content
if you enjoy this vehicle right here
then remember to like and favorite the
video as it does help me keep doing what
I'm doing there you can see me looking
all militant up in the Jeep and
otherwise stay tuned to the channel

that happens I'll be announcing the
winner the winners to both of the major
giveaways one happening on each of my
two channels so stick around for that
and until then I will catch you guys
