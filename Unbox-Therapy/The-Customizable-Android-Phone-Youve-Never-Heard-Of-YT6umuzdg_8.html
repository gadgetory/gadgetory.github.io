expand in this particular case I'm
pretty sure you have not seen this set
up in front of me this is a system it's
not just a smartphone it's from a
company called nuance and the product is
called the Neo see the thing about the
Neo device is the fact that it can be
completely customized visually but all
these other boxes represent various
looks that you can give to the device
smooth black suede gray two-tone dark
wood two-tone natural wood smooth khaki
suede gray suede white now this device
is pretty much exclusively available in
Japan right now and that's why I'm
pretty sure this is probably your first
exposure to it all right so let's slide
these accessories to the side for a
minute and take a peek at the main
device okay the whole packaging and
branding is very unique okay look at
this unboxing experience whoa all right
so it's downloading an update right now
but I'm gonna check out the other items
in the package here so this is a USB
type-c to traditional USB it's a braided
cable that's pretty nice so this thing
is booted up now I ran the updates who
are like about 7000 updates now the
first thing that strikes me is how much
this reminds me of that Nokia device the
Lumia it was also a Windows Phone very
similar design with the the flat top and
bottom and then the curve on the side
it's a comfy phone to hold anyway this
is the stock configuration that's on
here right now it's like a black plastic
it's no fun it's very straightforward
the fun stuff is over here the
customization but I should go over some
specs with you before we get into that
quick charge USB type-c it has a big
battery it has a 34 50 milliamp hour
battery and it can recharge up to 70%
within one hour through quick charge ok
that's cool
32 gigs of storage stop but a micro SD
card slot for expansion the camera is
made by Sony and it's backside
illuminated that's a f/2 lens on the
back with a 28 millimeter field of view
the front one is 8 megapixels it's a 24
millimeter lens and f-22 bands we should
show them this because it is a Japanese
phone and if anybody's crazy enough to
order this thing up communication bands
here 4G LTE on those bands 3
- gee quad-band okay cool you can see
what's supported there it has the
fingerprint sensor on the front all
right it's right in this location it's a
pretty standard spot for a fingerprint I
mean it works it's pretty quick
well my talk about is pretty quick okay
display specs are not gonna blow you
away it's a five point two inch screen
that's made by sharp and it's 1080p now
another thing they claim is that this
glass they claimed this glass is
indestructible but it's not running like
Gorilla Glass it's some it's called
Asahi it's some Japanese version of
Gorilla Glass I guess stock Android
experience so it's kind of Snapdragon
625 in it you're probably not purchasing
it for the immediate hardware that comes
in the box instead you're looking at
these guys right here you want the
custom feeling you want the custom vibe
you can put wood natively on your phone
without a case let's get into the fun
stuff all right I'm gonna go with the
natural wood and the suede gray DIY
smartphone going on here whoo that's
actual that's natural wood oh there we
go
tiny subtle nuance logo up there and
let's go is this a bottom this is a
bottom suede gray look that's oh oh I've
never seen a smartphone like that in my
life
the suede on the bottom the wood on the
top that's a first for me
woah it's very soft I'm having some
positive feelings about this in general
at least the idea let's do another look
whoo look at that now that's really
reminding me of the Nokia device now ooh
I like the dark wood that's it that's a
design statement these guys they can't
really go out and compete with the big
dogs so they have to take this kind of
side angle this sneaky approach the real
stories about the customization about
the fact that it can look exactly how
you want it to look there's over 600
variations and you can switch them out
very easily if you pick up one of these
packs and all of a sudden it's like
completely change the look at your phone
so if you are gonna buy this it's going
to be for this purpose this thing is not
gonna blow the doors off the smartphone
industry but it's a cool little
development and that's why I thought it
would be interesting to you look at that
right there with the wood and the yellow
whatever you want it's up to you take
back control of your smartphone
alright time for your favorite part of
the video the question-and-answer
session today I've got a question from
Luke Tyndale have you ever built a
computer I would think this would be
kind of obvious seeing as how I've
dedicated a huge chunk of my life to tag
that said it is mostly consumer
electronics smartphones things like this
yes I've built many computers long
before I ever shot a video and published
it to YouTube in fact that's kind of how
I got my start I think like a lot of you
out there there's something so
compelling about picking your components
getting the screwdriver out upgrading
other aspects now granted the first few
computers I had we're not as
configurable some of that early stuff
was more embedded and I was a kid so I
just didn't have as much money to deal
with that but as soon as I could
convince my dad to let me go out and buy
some components from the local computer
store I was building computers I'll be
there with a pen and a paper with the
different specs if I have this much to
spend what kind of graphics card am I
gonna I mean I would do that for fun and
I'm sure many of you still do I highly
recommend maximum experimentation all
the time open things up figure them out
it's exciting who knows where it'll lead
you me you me um you probably have a
channel like this eventually here's a
good one what's your ideal beard and do
you want it bushy and full or do you
prefer it trim down I like that question
I like the mid-range in the winter I'll
let it get a little push I play hockey
alright now if you watch any hockey you
know in the playoffs the guys they let
the beard go a little bit if it's colder
outside it turn into a bit of a
lumberjack it's okay in the summer it's
a little hotter
I'll keep it slightly more trimmed I
don't really have a rule regarding this
I think you just know for your face when
it's getting out of hand you know and
then you toggle it down alright the
third and final question for today from
Brian levy do you produce your own
background music now I have I have done
it before but of course we're publishing
so much content practically every day
here I just want like a wide variety of
music to choose from so I work with a
number of amazing music producers on
soundcloud that provide me with an
abundance of stuff to pick from so I can
stay inspired especially while editing
when you when you throw a track onto a
timeline when you're editing a video it
kind of it brings a special light to it
it just makes it very exciting I've
granted Mike background to a certain
extent is Musical like I was producing
music making music long before I had a
YouTube channel I had like a converted a
converted school poor
ball that was acting as a music studio
used to record bands I mean on some
level that's one of my major passions I
would love to spend more time doing it
some of you know I even put up a second
channel where I thought I was gonna
experiment with music a lot more than I
have had a chance to so hopefully I can
find a way to balance out work life and
music and maybe I can I can make some
more who know it's a lot of fun it's
very therapeutic but then again so is
this channel so there you have it your
questions have been answered remember
leave your questions in the comment
section of this video here and you may
make it into the next video I want to
answer your questions let's do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
