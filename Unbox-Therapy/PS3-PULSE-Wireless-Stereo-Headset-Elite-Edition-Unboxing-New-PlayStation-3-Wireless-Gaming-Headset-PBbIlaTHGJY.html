therapy and today we're taking a look at
Sony's brand new wireless gaming headset
this is for the PlayStation 3 and it's
called the pulse as well as the Elite
Edition headset this has a couple of
special features including something
called base impact which is a
configurable base switch which allows
you to move between whatever you feel
comfortable with in terms of base levels
it's also got 7.1 virtual surround sound
it's got a noise cancelling microphone
and on-screen headset updates because
you have that two-way wireless Bluetooth
communication but you don't need to use
it wirelessly this version here is also
going to function with a 3.5 millimeter
audio jack because it does come with a
cable and can be used in a wired manner
so you can use it with your smartphone
or in the case that they've shown on the
back of the box your PlayStation Vita
pretty much anything that supports the
3.5 millimeter standard so taking a look
inside the box the first thing you'll
notice is the cable that I just talked
about so you can get up and running in a
wired fashion if you choose to you've
also got some paperwork from Sony I
won't bore you with that let's get
straight into it and take a closer look
at the actual headphones but there is
actually one more item in the box
besides the headphones that I should
mention real quick and that is your
wireless transmitter this will need to
be plugged in to the front of your ps3
console although it'll work with any of
them whether you're using a Fat Boy a
slim or the new super slim that I
recently unboxed if you haven't seen
that video yet you might want to check
out my channel so you can see that
particular unboxing so next let's take a
look at the main attraction in this
particular video which is of course the
new pulse gaming headset wireless stereo
gaming headset although it does still
have that virtual surround sound that I
mentioned earlier the first thing you'll
notice is you've got a nice amount of
padding here they're using a synthetic
material not getting real leather here
although most headphones don't ship with
that but there is a significant amount
of padding that should make these
comfortable for extended use you'll see
here the first switch that we're going
to mention is the sound - voice switch
which is of course going to balance the
difference between game sound and chat
sound so that's a pretty cool way to
configure that particular element you've
also got a power on/off switch not only
does it have an LED to let you know
whether the headset is on or off but it
so gives you an audible beep so if the
headset is on your head you don't have
to take it off to know whether or not
you've turned it on or off
you've got the VSS on/off switch the SS
of course is the virtual surround sound
on the bottom of the other ear Cup
you're going to find your 3.5 millimeter
connector as well as the USB port to
charge up the headset for wireless use
you've got a mic mute button in order to
of course mute the mic here's a closer
look at that VSS on/off which is very
similar to the mute switch you're also
going to have on the other side of that
year cup you're going to have volume
which is using a slider as well you've
got minimum and maximum once again major
configuration available right on the
actual headset which is a major major
plus here's a closer look at the base
impact slider that I talked about
earlier in this video and the reason
that's cool is because you don't just
have like a couple of different levels
of base response instead you've got this
massive slider so you can really
fine-tune it to suit your particular
gaming style or whatever it is you're
into even if it's music now in and
around the headphones you're going to
notice some really nice materials and
use here you've got some metallic
features in fact including that spun
look that I just showed you you have a
split headband as well which should help
with long gaming sessions and not
getting too hot on the top of your head
there's going to be a little bit more
breathability and the next thing worth
mentioning is if you take a closer look
on the inside of the ear cup you'll see
that the transducer is actually angled
and I went ahead and removed the padding
to give you a better idea of that that's
going to help with your spacial
awareness and it's going to give a
better virtualization of that 7.1
surround sound that was also talked
about earlier so overall a very cool
looking headset if you're interested in
more information pricing availability
etc there's going to be a link down in
the description if you enjoyed this
video please remember to leave a thumbs
up down below it does help out a bunch
and as always thanks for watching and
I'll catch you guys on the next video
