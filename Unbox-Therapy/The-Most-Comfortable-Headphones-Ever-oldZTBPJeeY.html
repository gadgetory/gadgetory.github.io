first here on the channel previously but
that's not the whole story it's more
complicated I made a video about the
like baseline sleep bones these things
that you wear that are headphones but
you sleep with them on their comfy but
after that video went live the company
reached out to me and they're like Lou
thanks for making the video but those
are not our best products we've taken
some of your concerns and other people's
concerns and put them into a newer
better version this is sleep bones 2.0
still sleeping these ones have a new
material so my complaint previously was
that they were too hot I was getting a
little warm under there a little hot
under the collar there bluetooth now no
cords no strangling in your sleep and
supposedly they're better sounding so
what a package 10 to 13 hours of
playtime on a single charge machine
washable and streams up to 30 feet away

cable micro USB for charging this up I
hope it has a little bit of a charge and
is this the Oh some troubleshooting and

nicer it's like a kind of like that
Under Armour Nike dri-fit high-tech
situation God why don't you give me a
call when I'm making a video hello I
think I found the button press and hold
for three seconds to turn it off what
about on oh yeah oh never mind
okay came right up the way this works
you've got two actual speakers in here
right there sewn in there they fit over
top of your ears these ones actually
feel even
our low profile than the last ones the
controls and electronics are in the back
here and there's a button which is on
the seam oh yes this is much more
company we're right they weren't lying
that is much more comfortable and cool
if you like me before you go to bed you
listen to podcast you listen to some
calming music you listen to some
meditation vibes this right here man are
you kidding me
maybe you're not even sleeping maybe
you're just on the couch you're trying
to find a comfy location and you got the
big headphones on you're just trying to
watch your videos in peace this is about
comfort you've been on an airplane
before
you can't get how do they get that
measurement right how do they know the
distance the ears
you're not doing that with normal
headphones leaning earbuds you still got
the pain in the ear canal you don't need
that in your life improve your life
