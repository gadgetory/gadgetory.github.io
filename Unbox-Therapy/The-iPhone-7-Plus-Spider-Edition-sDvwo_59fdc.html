phone cases in the past it's getting
harder and harder to innovate in this
spaces like everything you could
possibly imagine I showed you a phone
case with a lighter in it so if that
doesn't tell you that the case the phone
case market is crazy the maybe today's
case well this is for the iPhone 7 plus
and this one is the original dual optics
lens solution for iPhone 7 plus but it's
not it's no longer dual optics now it's
six in one six lens interchangeable
system on your phone it's insane look at
this picture you can see that it's like
when they zoom up on an insect you can
actually see how many hosel eyeballs
they got going on like a spider or
something Jack love spiders give you a
little nod jack well not up and down Oh
Jack does not apparently Jack does not
like spiders a fisheye lens a macro lens
a wide-angle telephoto super macro and
another telephoto now remember on the
iPhone 7 plus you already have two
lenses this is another lens times three
for each lens six length that's ten six
lenses total full-body protection as
well don't forget that the wide-angle
lens gives you 120 degree field of view
think of that kind of like that GoPro
appearance that GoPro look fisheye goes
even further to 180 degrees Oh already
alright so the lens piece it slides on
like this there's a little rail there
that it clips into and then you end up
with something that's pretty easy to
slide up you can even put your finger
there and it locks into place with each
lens set one there next one next one
alright so let's do a little
demonstration let's see how this thing
operates I have some wonderful fake
grass here so we could get an idea of
what the iPhone does without this and
then what it does with there is your
stock iPhone setup boom photo what makes
the seven-plus cool is the ability to
zoom optically move to the other lens
grab focus boom now go back to the
one-time zoom and slide up to the first
set of lenses here
there they are so you can see we got
substantially wider now very wide shot
so you still have your zoom on the other
lens you're not giving up your other
lens when you when you have the
wide-angle enabled now I'm a big fan of
wide-angle shots you can see now how
much wider that frame is normal Y
beautiful wide let's go back to our
wonderful fake grass here and move up to
the next one okay now the next setting
is a ten times macro and a twenty times
super macro whew such details so close
and if I flick in one last time oh my
the double macro it's insane I'm seeing
the fibers on the fake grass this is the
first stage macro and you can basically
see the print the little dots of print
in the text I'll take this photo
but then when I toggle this one up to
the next level
there's our super macro super I'm even
on the word super how perfect is that
I'm on the word super right now that's a
crazy amount of detail and of course if
I just went back to the iPhone lens here
nothing good luck to you good luck the
closest you can focus is somewhere
around there in other words pretty
standard just like Jack would have over
there so our last setup here we're gonna
flick all the way to the end this is
where we're gonna get our fisheye effect
whoa
now that's very wide and you have that
old-school skateboard video look you'll
see the whole setup that's pretty cool
we can also move over towards Jack's
location in a nice wide frame of Jack
over there putting in work so once again
I can move from mega fisheye wide to a
more familiar focal range there very
cool so essentially what this is doing
is its overlaying a new piece of glass
onto the glass that you already have
and it's acting as an adapter making
that original lens behave differently
through the optics that you're putting
in front of it this is the most lenses
I've ever seen on one case that all
stays together I think the most useful
stuff is probably the wide-angle as well
as the macro the macro is gonna let your
phone do something it just couldn't
possibly do otherwise this is stuff that
photographers have been playing with
through interchangeable lens systems
forever and I guess what you have here
in the case of the switch six it's an
interchangeable lens system in one
package in a case for an iPhone 7 plus
and of course you could remove the lens
unit completely and still get the
protection of the case put this in a
little bag somewhere carry it with you
and then go full artist full tourist
mode when you need to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
