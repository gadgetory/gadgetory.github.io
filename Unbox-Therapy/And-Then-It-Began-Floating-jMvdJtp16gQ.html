another video and today I'm back with
something unusual as you've come to
expect here on unbox therapy this is a
big giant thing I have an address things
show up alright don't send me anything
that's alive those are kind of the rules
a giant bluetooth speaker you may have
seen it you may have heard of it it's
called Mars by crazy baby in the past
I've done things that float before this
is no exception so if you like things
that float then this might float your
boat
got this thing kind of looks like a
MacPro
this upside down Jack I blame you so the
way these things work usually what you
end up with is a unit like this the
saucer the flying saucer now this guy is
gonna probably be your high end and then
this big two portion is likely going to
be your low end some USBs on the back
Jack you could probably pick that up
USBs on the back Jack so you can charge
two devices a power brick here now this
guy I guess what are we
so that's smart it kind of fits on the
top and stays charged that way let's
power it up and see what the deal is I
assume that means that this guy on the
top is charging and there's a power
switch on the back so I'm gonna press
Anna some indicators here that mean it
has its own power switch it does have a
switch on it bit of an odd nothings
floating though don't you make me read
the manual good charge before using Mars
for the first time while we're doing
that now but I'm guessing the reason
we're not levitating right now is one of
the two is lacking some juice roly-poly
all right listen I'm back apparently I
don't know how to charge things up when
I hit the button the power switch look
look at whew oh I gotta move this way
look at that okay time for some bangers
I don't know I think it's cool right it
looks cool look at it it's all fancy the
way it goes up and down you hit the
button I mean it's like a spaceship you
got a spaceship now spins down hits it
starts charging that thing's portable
you take it with you may sound
not-so-great uh go check out my other
Bluetooth speaker videos for some of the
better values there but if you need to
flow if you're on those floaty vibes
this is probably as good as it gets
whoa I don't know it makes you feel a
little weird</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
