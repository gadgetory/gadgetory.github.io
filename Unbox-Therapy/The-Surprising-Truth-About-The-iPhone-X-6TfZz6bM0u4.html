video in which I discuss my recent
change in smartphone back to the Samsung
I think I'm gonna stick to the s9 plus
there were a number of reasons why I
switched back to this phone but not one
of which was this potentially faster
internet connection on LTE I happened
upon this article on Bloomberg which
states that Apple's iPhone trails both
Samsung and Google in internet
connection speed via mobile networks
they used an enormous a tremendous
amount of data from the world's most
popular speed test at least I assume it
is the speed test that I use the one
from Okhla bucola that fun to say that's
the famous speed test app that you
probably have on your phone as well this
tremendous amount of data that they can
sift through and say okay this
particular device generally connects and
has a speed test at this speed and this
other one at this other speed so the
reason this is interesting is because
this is a very important characteristic
of your smartphone this is what you want
to do you want to stream content load
web pages so here's the speed test data
and keep in mind this comes from an
article on Bloomberg which I will link
down in the description the s9 based on
a hundred thousand tests at an average
speed of thirty eight point nine
megabits per second now remember this is
on cellular connectivity this is not on
Wi-Fi or anything like that the s9 plus
was a little bit lower at thirty eight
point for the iPhone ten on the other
hand twenty nine point seven a drop of
almost ten megabits per second on the
iPhone when compared to the s nine we
have the Google pixel to excel here as
well and it fits in between the two of
these at thirty three point nine
megabits per second now something to
keep in mind when it comes to the iPhone
10 eight eight plus Apple uses various
components for their LTE or cellular
connectivity those components can either
come from Qualcomm or from Intel the
unlocked Apple iPhone that you get from
the Apple Store will likely have
Qualcomm components in it whereas the
iPhone that you buy through AT&amp;amp;T is more
likely to have Intel components
Qualcomm's latest modems are usually
speedier than the ones built by Intel
but Apple
uses software to keep the speeds of the
Qualcomm chips closer to that of the
Intel devices beginning to sound like
another one of these conspiracies going
on downgrading the capabilities of the
Qualcomm based devices strictly to match
the Intel based devices so that they
have uniformity across the board I
thought hey this is some interesting
information here it's an interesting
development and I fully understand that
the number of variables in play are vast
but nonetheless I wanted to see for
myself if I just grabbed my sim card
swap it between these three devices will
I see a significant difference in the
neighborhood of 10 megabits per second
or maybe I'll find something different
all right so I'm gonna go ahead and load
up the speed test and do three separate
tests on each of these devices I'm gonna
make sure as well to select the same
server for each of these three which is
located at the same distance I'll then
be swapping my sim card between all
three to make sure they're on the same
carrier as well this is a real-world use
case scenario holding on to the device
the way a normal person would and it's
all on the exact same network okay so
here we go we have the numbers the
numbers are in they seem to meet
actually exceed the difference that was
found in the original Bloomberg article
as you can see in my case here in the
center I have the s9 plus ranging from
74 point 7 megabits up to 85 megabits
per second down this is the pixel to
excel over here which just like in the
article fits in between the s 9 plus and
the iPhone 10 and then the iPhone 10
down at the bottom now what really
stands out here is just how much faster
the s 9 plus was on all three tests so
we took all three tests from each phone
in order to find an average the s 9 plus
is actually 26% faster on downloads than
the iPhone 10 and things get even worse
when you look at the upload speed
average the s 9 plus is 55% faster at
uploading across three tests compared to
the iPhone 10 now the pixel on the other
hand is only marginally faster than the
iPhone 10 when it comes to downloads
it was 7% faster as an average across
the three tests and upload speed it was
30% faster than the iPhone 10 now to be
clear we are in the Toronto area and
these are operating on the Rogers
Network and obviously when it comes to
speed test we need to keep in mind the
wide variety of variables involved in
determining what's responsible for the
type of speed that you're getting but my
findings here alongside the Bloomberg
report are seeming to point in the same
direction and the truth is you may very
well have the exact same experience if
you run a test like this yourself so if
you have access to multiple devices pop
your SIM card out and see what you end
up with now you can decide for yourself
how significant that is depending on
your scenario and if you're like I don't
know I don't really need a 20 plus
percent improvement in download or a 50
plus improvement in upload or maybe you
know in my neighborhood I'm getting
awesome numbers on the iPhone 10 it's
quite possible but it seems to me the
superior product from a communication
perspective is sitting in the center
right here so maybe it's something we
should be taking a closer look at
because I think it's a significant
characteristic this is interesting stuff
especially if it's because Apple is in
some way through software toggling back
the performance of their Qualcomm
hardware just to match up with the Intel
stuff that's being sold on different
carriers then things get real
interesting Bloomberg said that I did it
nonetheless
