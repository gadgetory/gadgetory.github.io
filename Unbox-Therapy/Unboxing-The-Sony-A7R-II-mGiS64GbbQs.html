you put it jack
all right so it's camera time I am back
with another video for awesome stuff
week this is the new a7r from Sony a
massive megapixel monster I just see the
way I put that together day 42.4
megapixels on a full-frame sensor it
also has something I'm really interested
in which is five axis stabilization in
the body that's image stabilization if
you're unaware now normally that's in
the lens itself and the problem with
that is you know some people they want
to go use vintage lenses or specialty
lenses like I like to shoot on
wide-angle and often those won't have
any kind of is so having it in the body
means you can run around run and gun
Jack knows what I'm talking about and
you can end up with smooth shots
nonetheless especially important for
video so let's jump inside the box and
take a closer look at this guy
now I said also it's a full-frame sensor
that means the 35 millimeter equivalent
when you stick a lens on here as opposed
to having to do some weird kind of
calculation to figure out exactly how
wide a particular lens might be we've
got some nice weight to it also a strap
a battery charger now this is pretty
cool I noticed that we've actually got
two batteries included that way with
your external charger you can have one
charge it up all the time while another
one is in the body now this body feels
pretty comfy that's that's sort of my
immediate reaction to it it's it's a
little bit heavy but that's kind of the
idea it's super rugged right this unit
here is the body itself so you will
still need to pick some glass for it but
of course that is the whole point of an
interchangeable lens system is that
you're gonna have a couple of different
lenses for different purposes I've got
one in the back there that I'll install
onto the camera not in the back where's
my lens where'd you put it Jack very
fast now what I'm interested in is video
mode after all I make videos probably
know that already
this is also going to have a microphone
input separate microphone input as well
as headphone monitoring again super
useful for video makers and it's got a
bunch of different formats too but if
you're about that professional visual
life then it's worth selecting the
highest end codec even as i zoom out and
it becomes a little bit tougher to keep
it steady
it's actually pretty cool awesome now
obviously you want to see what I'm
seeing you want to see what this thing
is capable of so let's go ahead and take
this outside see what it can do alright
so now you're looking at me through the
a7 r2 in beautiful 4k well the 4k is
beautiful not so sure about me
sorry about it it's in the name of the
holidays is it hey yo what are you guys
doing what are you doing more like well
get other Santa beers there√≠re I'm just
testing up this camera
oh it's maybe you want to sin no thank
you
no I have to take care of this camera
all right there's a berry Santa who
where is it better huh
that is it's a tie it's a tie it's a tie
all right thanks for having me on set
guys I'm out of here
see you later thanks man Luis thanks for
documenting the amazing moment so there
you have it a 7r2 from Sony big
full-frame sensor beefy body shoots 4k
video a bunch of megapixels for your
stills and as I said earlier one of the
most interesting things is this embody
image stabilization so you can use your
old-school lenses that don't feature
that and still get non shaky video
that's a thing that's my thing prefer no
shakes to shakes at least in the video
world thanks very much for watching guys
