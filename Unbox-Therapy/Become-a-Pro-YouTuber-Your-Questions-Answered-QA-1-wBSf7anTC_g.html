had a chance to sit down and put
together the answer portion of my very
first question and answer session if you
missed my last video that was the
question portion and people left a bunch
of comments in the comment section of
course with all of their questions and
concerns so on and so forth some people
were a little bit pissed off or upset at
my title of the video I mean I really
don't know why I'm going to come back in
this video with the actual answers relax
it was like two minutes of your life
but anyways without further ado let's
check out what those questions are and
I'm going to try and read through them
real quick right here because they were
like I'm gonna try and address twenty or
so but there were like pages and pages
almost 100 pages full of comments so
these are the most popular ones first
and foremost Lew how do you afford all
that tech with 132 thumbs up from this
particular question this particular
comment sorry but it was asked more
often than that one time and every time
it was asked in those hundred pages of
comments I got a bunch of thumbs up so
I'm going to break it down for you guys
real simple first and foremost all the
tech you've ever seen on the channel has
not necessarily been purchased by me
some of the stuff is sent out by
manufacturers because they want exposure
that's offered through the channel you
guys watch it you guys get interested in
products and they want access to you
guys as viewers so sometimes that means
that they send stuff out sometimes that
stuff that you get to keep other times
most often it's stuff that you have to
send back and then of course there's
stuff on the channel that I did by
myself
but in truth my answer is pretty boring
the way that I afford stuff is because I
work hard you know the the more that I
put into what I do here on YouTube the
more that I'm rewarded there is an
economic exchange that takes place and
my interest happens to be tech and it it
also helps to build the channel and
since the channel is my business it's
what I do full-time it makes sense for
me to invest in tech and to know about
it and to enjoy it and and all that kind
of stuff so it's kind of like an
investment in what I'm doing here it's
not like I'm just blowing money for the
sake of blowing money and it was a
personal interest of mine prior to do
this channel here on YouTube so it's
always going to be something that I lean
towards in terms of my purchasing habits
I'm sure there are other things in my
life that are not as fancy as some other
people but you know I make those
sacrifices to get the things I want and
to invest in the kinds of things I'm
interested in so anyway guys that's been
kind of long-winded I should go into the
next question here which is very closely
related and also has been asked a number
of times what is your job Luo what is
your job this is my job you're looking
at it you're watching me you guys are
supporting me in what I do for a living
I decided a little while back after
seeing some success here on YouTube that
I wanted to give it a real go that I
wanted to invest both my time and money
into this project right here I thought
that the web needed it there was a space
for higher quality unboxing videos
because a lot of people were very
amateur out there and the only way
really to do that is to make it you know
your job make you become very serious
about it and so that's what I'm doing
and I do want to thank all you guys for
supporting me up until this point and in
the future because I do love doing this
and you guys make it possible I know
you've heard me say that before but
trust me for me it never gets old
because you guys are half the equation
you're half I'm half I got to make
content you got to watch it so on and so
forth so I really really do appreciate
it
how can a 13 year old kid make money to
buy tech stuff well I don't want to be
boring I don't want to sound like your
parents but truth be told to be in the
same situation that I'm in you sort of
have to behave the same way that I do
and what that means is getting really
serious about what you want to do if you
want to do this seriously if you want to
do this for a living
then you need to work really really hard
you basically have to become absorbed in
the content be constantly creating
thinking of ideas editing you know it's
not it's not always as fun as it looks
you guys see the finished product you
see a few minute video it all seems real
simple and sweet but trust me guys it's
a lot of back end content and work and
things that go on to get to that
finished product it's not as easy as it
might appear but if you're 13 years old
let me tell you some work hard and if
that means in the beginning getting your
hands on items that aren't necessarily
the top tier items like iPads and
things like that don't be discouraged
get your hands on any product you can
your friends product your no cheaper
product etc and then put a shitload of
time into the actual production make the
production value top-notch on what you
do have and believe me people will
notice you'll gain some momentum and
that'll help you justify the cost or
maybe you know convince your parents for
for example that this project you're
working on is not just for personal
gratification but that there might
actually be a future in it as well how
much this is this is always how much
money do you make you know specifically
on YouTube if if you've ever seen a sort
of popular YouTube address a question
youtuber address a question like that
before then you probably already know
the answer if you haven't the answer is
I can't really tell you that as part of
a contract the contract that you sign
here on YouTube you can't disclose
specifically what your earnings are I
will tell you that it is not incredibly
simple to earn a living through doing
this I don't want to discourage you if
you want to work hard if you want to
kick ass you can do it so that's about
all I can say on that matter but but
like I said before don't be discouraged
by the fact that you're not going to
earn a lot of money right away as many
things in life the more you put into it
the more you can get out of it why do I
find you attractive um well that's
obvious I mean doesn't everybody know
this is a tough question there's been a
lot almost 300 videos on the channel
right now I'm gonna say my Galaxy Nexus
that's the phone I use on a daily basis
and just because of the fact that I use
it so much I'll answer that one for now
but obviously my MacBook Pro is up there
as well do you have a girlfriend or wife
this case asks all the time this guy
went one step further if you do is she
hot thank you very much Yellowknife
Empire I do and yes she is hot is your
wife always on board with you buying all
of these gadgets and toys well yes of
course she's bought into this program
here she believes in what we're working
on here on unbox therapy so yes she
fully is behind everything that I'm
doing here I assume there would be some
limitation if I you know try to buy a
spaceship or something
I doubt she'd still be on board do you
hooker yourself to fat woman I'm
thinking of trying that for an HTC One X
um I've been thinking of doing this
ain't no I'm just kidding never done it
don't recommend it in fact do you prefer
the Xbox 360 or ps3 for gaming okay this
thing this question here gets asked all
the freaking time it's one of the most
annoying questions I'm not going to lie
because they're so similar there are so
few games that are not cross-platform
these days and there are so few things
that both consoles don't do or don't do
well it's it's really tough to semi if
you have to ask the question and just
get both consoles
for the love of God but if not you'll be
happy with either I mean I've been
spending actually a lot of time on the
Xbox recently I really like the
dashboard redesign but then you know the
PlayStation has the blu-ray drive I mean
this is a toss-up there is no clear
answer so as I said before if this
really bothers you this question if it's
if you can't sleep at nothing because of
this question then just buy both already
I love me some bass when I play dubstep
though sometimes I smell burning rubber
or plastic what should I do man stop
listening to dubstep I'm just kidding I
love listening to dubstep the next one
this is a very serious one guys you know
don't don't joke about this one are you
pregnant 46 thumbs up Junior 4 1 1 8 I
am not pregnant at the moment but we are
trying dudes can't get pregnant
ok in the movies they can what was that
movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger do you

xbox gamertag is beast feed one word be

session Q&amp;amp;A session that I've done here

question if I didn't will do the
again don't worry to those that were
