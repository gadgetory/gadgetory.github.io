stuff about drones drones are cool you
know that we got a fresh drone video for
you the folks over at autel they saw my
last one and they were like listen we're
about to bring our AGame
to unbox therapy and I said let's do it
it's called the x-star premium for a not
so premium price a very affordable price
in fact I first saw that picture I was
like okay kind of interesting a little
bit flashy you got yourself an orange
drone but then I realized what it's all
about the sky and clouds are white why
would you drum be white you want to see
where it is when it's floating around up
there now this unit also has a gimbal
and camera pre-installed capable of 4k
Exmor R sensor it's also got some pretty
impressive flight time up to 25 minutes
34 miles per hour top speed and you can
send it off 1.2 for miles that's pretty
impressive
video resolution 4k up to 30 frames per
second if you need more frames you can
do so in 2.7 K okay oh yeah also on the
front seven-day-a-week
customer support whoa wow you can see
that the gimbal is installed right now
but it's actually removable as well here
are your propellers silica gel for Jack
little lanyard to show your love couple
of antennas at the top here this is
where your device goes at the top could
be an iPhone could be an Android device
and that's going to give you your visual
on top of that there's also an LCD
display in that location there that's
going to give you altitude range battery
the battery on the unit comes out like
this I'm guessing what happens here look
at that oh that's smart that's the right
way to do it okay so this goes into the
battery to charge it up and then your
other connector over here goes into your
controller so one power brick for both
units I like that a record button and
then a snapshot button for still image
you can appreciate the 4k camera
tiny that thing is in there and it's
also got a micro SD card
by default pre-installed comes in the
box but of course it's drone and the fun
part is flying it so let's go do that
it's as simple as powering up this
remote powering on the aircraft then
connecting the device it'll show
connected up here it shows the battery
life of the aircraft you also see some
conditions listed over here the wind
temperature and precipitation it's got a
gimbal on it so that's sort of this
motorized contraption that keeps the
camera incredibly stable sending it up
in the air is easy first you start the
motors with this button then you move
over to takeoff at which point it'll
just kind of cover there and then you're
on to the thumbsticks
you are steaming through the air here
are the photo settings as well as video
settings for K 24 frames is what we shot
it will also do 4k in 30 frames you can
select the ISO shutter speed and then
exposure compensation as well the things
a pleasure to fly to be honest with you
it's all super straightforward I mean
it's really foolproof to be quite honest
if you haven't tried a drone before
you'll see what I'm talking about if you
give this one a shot give it a trial run
you're gonna be addicted just like I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
