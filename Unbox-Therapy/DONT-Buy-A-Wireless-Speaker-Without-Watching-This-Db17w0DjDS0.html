been excited for we have something
contending for the top spot of a very
competitive product segment a product
segment that I have explored to a great
degree personally that segment is
Bluetooth speakers now I've done plenty
of videos on Bluetooth speakers as some
of them are lined up over there the
diamond box the latest biggest diamond
box is over that that thing was loud and
don't forget one of my favorite videos
all-time the DVLA phantom they live in
upstairs upstairs but there has been one
speaker requested above all the others
it's over here this giant box sound box
Black Edition
it's pretty heavy rechargeable keep the
music playing 30 hours it's using
Bluetooth or auxilary input they clean
weather drink and shockproof what is it
spring break with a beer pong and
jumping off the house into the pool I do
not recommend doing so volume up to a
hundred and nineteen DBS Baltic birch
plywood black aluminum frame those sound
like good materials that thing looks
serious what do you think jacket I bring
this to the parking lot after hockey or
what it's metallic boom
black edition with the badge on it oh oh
now I like how on the corners they did
these bumpers your controls are over
here off indoor outdoor cold clicky oh
look at this day lodge polar bear in
search of a meal of any kind if he does
not catch at least one bird he may not
see another day in the Arctic Nature
doesn't care about you if you were out
there you without your fancy little
outfit feed a little bowtie think of
polar bears got time for that so I'm
guessing the sound sort of changes or
possibly the volume depending on if you
pick indoor or outdoor mode a Bluetooth
indicator light and yogs iller e input
north american power cable european one
your power brick ah this is the battery
okay but where does it go oh wow it's
pretty solid and then this piece clips
in there I can pull this battery out and
use the same AC adaptor and just plug
this into here that's smart and really
do this out there
hey the og original dummy bear okay go
that's for you for you guys will do
endorse let's uh play you some music
here's my boy soft eyes very clean clean
loud sound I wonder what happens if I
flip it to outdoor kablammo
well I do
ladies and gentlemen Willie do what was
the cartoon with Bo Jackson Wayne
Gretzky Michael Jordan was it called Pro
stars you see that over there he's got a
handle on it you know that it work yeah
go see if it works what they do ladies
and gentlemen
[Laughter]
it might be the loudest it's so hard to
know for certain even in the outdoor
setting yes it carries further there's
more high-end it's still not breaking up
too much where you're like mmm it's
really built for parties it's built to
be outdoors
it's got the big handles on it as a
package deal for a party speaker I think
it might be tough to beat seriously
sound box this is the Black Edition I
think it's pretty good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
