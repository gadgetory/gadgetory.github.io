another video and today I have something
that means a lot to me because when I
was a kid I was really into these things
well maybe not this one exactly but
Swiss Army knives in general the idea of
a multi-function multifaceted objective
a gadget if you will in fact one of my
very first gadgets I ever had was a
pocketknife this thing in front of me is
the cop enchilada the big cheese in
world of Swiss Army knives the childhood
version of me would appreciate this
moment let's crack open now practical
all right I don't know about that what
do we have here okay a battery of course
Oh
oh my goodness an altimeter barometer
watch all in this little screen right
here you know it's still pocketable
though maybe I was a little over the top
in terms of practicality I mean if you
could only have one tool you know how
they always say like if you go to a
desert island and you can only take one
record with you for the rest of your
life what would it be what if the same
question existed for one pocket tool all
right battery oh that is cool the Swiss
Army logo is a button this is like a
watch style battery right here there we
go whoop barometer timer alarm stopwatch
temperature it's got a thermometer on it
and then the time which I haven't set
yet Wow what are we working with all
right
flathead blade bottle opener larger
flathead and oh can opener right right
right right
can opener versus cap lifter magnifying
glass never know when you might need
that you might be looking for Jack
Phillips solid Phillips by the way
hires a screwdriver with like a Torx bit
and you can flip it and change it out oh
wow and there's actually extra bits in
here another little Torx a flathead
couple of options what is this it's a
flashlight can you make that out ha oh
that's like a little saw blade style oh
that's an even crazier saw look at those
teeth cut some twigs with that oh I need
to know what that is a reamer or a punch
is what that's called that's not the
classic the classic knife blade is still
on there somewhere try not to stab
myself I don't think you're intended to
like open them all at once scissors do
we have scissors yeah what an amazing
contraption here oh I'm also noticing a
ruler in here I almost missed that
inches and centimeters on the other side
a file with some little tiny teeth on it
as well what's this oh oh I got a look
that one up a pharmaceutical spatula
gotta be your favorite Jack right there
Wow am I ever running out of space here
a pruning blade so there you have it
various can openers bottle openers
pruners blades serrated blades
flashlight screwdrivers corkscrew holy
you got it all a little tweet you got
tweezers toothpick and a pen almost
missed that like a pretty good
pretty good-sized pendant obviously not
the most practical version of each of
these tools but when combined but
seriously though use one tool at a time
the right tool for the job</div></body></html>
