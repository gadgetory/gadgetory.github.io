recently about the new iPhone the iPhone
10's max because I'm using it right now
it's my current evaluation but today
we're going in a completely different
direction as we should talking about the
other end of the market this is my very
first exposure to the new emerging brand
real me and this is very popular in
India this device in front of me the two
pro real me 2 pro is gonna sell for
around $200 does it give you one tenth
of an iPhone like holy smokes and
surprisingly you have a competitive spec
list at that price you probably saw my
experience with the Polka phone this is
going even cheaper it's going even more
affordable and the specs are a little
bit different there they are dropped
down a tiny touch but they're still
really impressive at this $200 u.s.
price point this is the real me 2 pro
all right Oh real quick I do have a
couple of extras they sent me two extras
so might as well do a giveaway if you
guys are interested I'll have a link
down in the description yeah you can
probably possibly win one of these some
paperwork a case they're giving you a
basic case but it's nice to have
nonetheless here is the device mine
looks to be blue in color it appears to
have this really nice tiny little notch
the crown jewel style of knotch
this mirrored finish on the back
fingerprint scanner is in the back also
dual camera setup at the top this is -
16 megapixel cameras flash on the other
side while speaking about the cameras
the one on the front here is also 16
megapixels for your selfies the bottom
of the device houses a headphone jack
micro USB so unfortunately no type-c on
this device and then on this side we
have the volume up and down as well as
the SIM card tray which happens to be a
dual SIM card tray we have a quick
charge power brick this is actually
branded Oppo if you're unfamiliar with
the real me brand it is a sub brand of
the Oppo brand so if you're familiar
with those products this one is going to
share some features and function
with Apple so it has prompted me for the
fingerprint face or passcode unlock I'm
gonna do that real quick oh when do face
plus do face alright fine the display
looks pretty nice check to help this not
CH to me if you if you have to have a
not CH this is kind of the way to go
here
because it's the least obtrusive
compared of course to some massive
notches like the iPhone and others let's
try out the face unlock it's pretty
quick actually face unlock pretty much
instant that's like an instant face
unlock let's do the fingerprint while
we're at it it's not the fastest that
I've ever tested but it is satisfactory
in my mind that's a good start so far
for a $200 phone I do want to show you
the other color options so this one was
the blue one but it also comes black
version that they sent me similar finish
with the mirrored look over here it's
reflective very similar to the blue and
then last up is like this teal --is--
color a silverish white appearance
similarly reflective so there's your
various color options so I was talking
about the display it's fhd plus this is
6.3 inches surprisingly large display
considering the form factor they say the
screen to body ratio is over 90% it's
available with four gigs all the way up
to eight gigs and as much as a hundred
and twenty eight gigs of internal
storage it's got a Snapdragon 660 series
processor in here and as we know from
past devices the 600 series is actually
a good value and also tends to be great
on battery life
speaking of battery this one has a 3500
milliamp hour battery inside which given
the size of it is actually kind of
impressive exact resolution 2340 by 1080
it's a TFT LCD and the math there works
out to 409 PPI so actually pretty decent
16 megapixel auto HDR functionality and
a 2x zoom there's also a beauty mode
Oh AI mode which is off by default I
appreciate that
okay let me just grab this little phone
right here in our studio lighting that
is pretty decent where's the plant can
you pass me the plant Kirk make sure we
got it not bad
what do you say Jack two hundred bucks
you're probably spending too much on a
smart phone
let's check the front-facing isn't any
fancy magic are you gonna try to smooth
me out here I'd rather be real me
get it see what I did there I'd rather
be the real me boom that's a $200 phone
selfie 16 megapixel front-facing camera
Jack you're spending too much on smart
phones video modes it can do 4k up to 30
FPS if you're interested so there's a
few different versions for different
markets I'm noticing right now and each
of them has different frequency bands
available there's one specifically for
India Thailand Indonesia Pakistan
another one for Vietnam Saudi Arabia and
UAE and then there is a global all
country version which actually like the
GSM version I'm noticing it has 850 900
1800 and 1900 megahertz so depending on
what market you're in you may want to
clarify which version to pick up you'd
be surprised there are a lot of versions
of these phones which could possibly be
used on the network you're on right now
so just check that out in advance
curious about the speaker so I'm gonna
load up YouTube real quick stock YouTube
kissing challenge 81 million views 360
panorama day you see that there Jack
this is the world we're living in guys
pitbull attacking a guy Lamborghini like
it's worse than we all thought everyone
gets kissed see the wet competition
girls shocked by wrapping over driver
why are the girls in the uber dressed
that way how it's made ice cream that's
the only one that deserves anything
learn something for once please utility
life live it posted a photo a selfie
that I shot on the iPhone tennis match
the speaker for dialogue it actually
sounds pretty good
all right though it's not the worst I
ever heard it's not the best I ever
heard it's unfortunate it's a single
speaker
let's adjust okay adjust our
expectations for the price point let's
be realistic and be responsible this
thing starts $200 USD please remember
that the speaker is okay now I do have
to mention something the skin here it's
a bit out of hand I hate to break it to
you real mean
Oppo Xiaomi whoever you are just slap
Android one on it all right please the
skin game it's an old game I know I
could put a launcher I always put a
launcher but out the gate if you've
already got Android one it's a major
step ahead give me an Android one
version it is incredible what is being
done in the smartphone market place I
continue to be shocked how can you
deliver a product at this caliber for
around 200 USD I don't know maybe I'll
even switch to it if you guys are
interested especially when you're
looking at $200 device that has a really
unique implementation of the knotch we
have to reconfigure our process for
evaluation of these things to reflect
the value because there are amazing
things happening at the low end and this
is just another example you know
speakers not amazing I wish that it had
USB type-c obviously I talked a little
bit about the skin how I'd love to see
something like Android one but those are
nitpicks
real me too pro starting at 200 bucks
USD it's gonna make a lot of people
happen and don't forget to extras you
guys can win one check the description
for the giveaway details do you have it
real me two pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
