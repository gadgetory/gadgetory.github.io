another video and today I'm bringing you
something exclusive right here on unbox
therapy we're talking about the galaxy
s6 as well as the G s6 edge yes that's a
real thing you may have seen some images
floating around the web of what these
two devices will look like but today I
bring you a couple of high-resolution
samples that you haven't seen yet as
well as the full list of specifications
for both devices this of course is days
before the actual announcement so
therefore making this an exclusive video
so without any more hesitation let's
jump in to the images as well as those
specs so first up we'll take a closer
look at the backside of the galaxy s6
and you'll notice it's occupied by a
brand new camera this features an F 1.9
lens and with that large aperture you
can expect better photos in low light
and a shallower depth of field when
you're looking for it so these two
devices are essentially identical with
the exception of the physical edge being
added to the edge version that edge will
give you some custom capabilities like
the ability to put a clock there as well
as some other minor tweaks the edge also
adds a slightly larger battery with a 50
milli amp
power rating advantage but this is very
minimal and you should essentially look
at both devices is the same with the
exception of that edge functionality so
with the GS 6 and g s6 edge Samsung has
made a move into a more premium feeling
device the materials have completely
changed here you are now dealing with
Gorilla Glass 4 on both the front and
back of the device along with an
aluminum frame so metal and glass
premium feeling but there is a
consequence here that you're no longer
going to have a removable back there
will be no micro SD card slot you're not
going to have a removable battery
obviously and it's no longer going to be
somewhat water resistant like the
previous generation so you're gay
a little bit in terms of functionality
but you're gaining a little bit back in
terms of a premium feel rounding up the
physical characteristics of these two
devices they will be slimmer and
narrower than the previous generation
Galaxy s5 now let's go ahead and get
into the actual internal hardware both
of these devices are gonna feature eight
core processors three gigabytes worth of
RAM you're gonna get a 5.1 inch 1440p
display lastly and maybe something I'm
most excited for wireless charging
natively that's a big one for me I
really enjoy wireless charging it's one
of the things that I've asked for on
devices for a very long time and in the
Galaxy s6 will feature it now while
wireless charging is amazing there's one
more feature that I think you guys are
going to like a lot the fingerprint
sensor has been completely reworked it
is said to function very similarly to
touch ID now there's no more swipe like
on the previous version
so hopefully this comes a little bit
closer to the iPhone counterpart and
people actually use it instead of just
having a passcode and completely
ignoring the tech anyway guys that wraps
up this video and all of this
information hopefully you found this
useful and now you know a little bit or
a lot about the Galaxy s6 and s6 edge
before the official announcement keep it

future I know you guys appreciate it if
