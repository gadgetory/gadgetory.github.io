alright and you'll probably need to hear
it as well the product itself now I know
the angle you're coming from you're
going through emotions in your mind
right now you're thinking about your
response but I want to talk to you
before you leave they comment down below
this might not be what you think it is
that's the truth this thing showed up
here at first I was like what kind of a
troll is this these people high and
mighty what do they think they're what
do they think they are then I looked at
it a little bit closer this thing right
here it's called the no phone well in
fact it's a few different versions of it
the no phone original the no phone air
and the no phone selfie with the air you
can pretty much tell so you can tell
what's going on there there's no phone
in there now the no phone original and
selfie are not that much different each
one is a little bit of a twist but there
is no phone here you'll probably have a
phone you might be watching this video
on a phone if that's the case keep
watching but this thing here it
represents a concept it represents a
thought some people might be a little
bit too attached deed the like you been
at dinner you been in some sort of
gathering and you see it tracked people
that trap their luck and it's not
extinct into this device people even if
they use it as a crutch they got nothing
to say so what are they going to die
while we're here because it's going to
be too much effort to actually
contribute the people that depend on you
to have something to say sorry what did
you ask me something I would know
because I was halfway deep over here and
some meaningless thing these guys are
trying to make a statement is this a
product that you're going to buy no
probably not
but I'm here on unbox therapy with the
opportunities at least tell you that it
exists and to explain the concept this
product is for people who are too
addicted to their phone now you might
think the discipline plays a role here
but I don't know I have seen people from
every spectrum of the universe with all
the discipline in the world still locked
into that thing hip
I'm telling you there's some magic at
play does that little dopamine hit oh
you got a heart that's cute you gotta
like was it a song that's nice we are
not immune to it that is stimuli that's
that nicotine because you don't have a
needle in the arm doesn't mean it's not
happening this is the no phone it's a
fake phone for people who are addicted
to real phone the no phone air and
invisible phone for people who use their
phone too much zero missing six
addiction zero gigabytes of storage
no headphone jack as a shot at Apple
right there and no Wi-Fi and then you
know phone selfie for people who are
existing to looking at themselves the
most famous people in the world are all
this half the time looking at themselves
snapping a photo staring into the abyss
looking for some level of meaning
following that social media going man it
would be nice to be like that and I'm
just giving it to guys straight how I
see it I'm immersed in this world I'm
not immune to it one of the creepiest
things you will ever experience in your
life and I know from experience you will
see a person attempting to craft the
perfect selfie but you see it as an
outsider you take a step back and you
see the mold then you see that look on
their face as they attempt to perk up
pop their lips out and do it whatever it
is that they do it is an awkward feeling
you have inside of like knowing that the
emotion that that person is attempting
to portray through that lens is not a
real one it's an S has the stuff people
are putting out there is an act it's an
S there's a social reward potentially
associated with you take you snap that
selfie while you're in Spain or wherever
it is that you're visiting and then all
of a sudden the social reward comes
creeping in all those people on your
social media they start saying boom boom
boom and you circle and Bowl that's a
little win for you but what it's those
because how did you actually feel
eventually because you then had to go
back you had to go back to do it all
over again and maybe through that
process you forgot what the real world
version of that might have been maybe
you had a conversation with a stranger
you should
somebody's hand I don't really know now
right now you guys think it sounds like
I'm lamenting on some reality that
doesn't exist anymore that's probably
true not saying anybody's wrong for
doing it I'm just identifying the
progress the unavoidable progress this
thing year instance I don't know maybe
claw back a little bit of it ah a thin
light and invisible design a no-phone
error feels like nothing in your hand
because it is nothing in your hand but
down your smartphone and pick up the no
phone err it's like nothing you've ever
seen it might be the perfect gift for
somebody who's obsessed and I can't tell
you the number of times I'm locked in I
like the Instagram discovery page and
I'm like why even it's this stuff I even
what I'm not saying there's no such
thing as decent time spent on there
there's plenty of times where I watch
something I'm like you know that was
valuable to me you're meaningful to me
there's also playing at times right I'm
locked in with the hypnotic beam hitting
these retinas the no phone acts as a
surrogate to any smart mobile device
enabling you to always have a rectangle
of Sloot cold plastic to Klutch without
forgoing any potential engagement with
your direct environment that's kind of
deep look at this thing a slab of
plastic possibly the most pointless
product of all time
so it's like a 3d printed there you go
Jack's no phone it's perfect for jet
this would be an interesting experiment
though you stick this thing in your
pocket I don't know for a week or
something when do you stop reaching for
it when do you stop feeling those
phantom vibrations associated with your
notification never again experience the
unsettling feeling of flesh on flesh
when closing your hands that's deep
alright maybe it's a gag gift maybe it's
pointless or maybe it gets you running
off on a tangent like I am right now
this time we can go deep on you looking
at yourself
that is bizarre there's a mirror on the
front that's you that's you and that's
me
and as you were about to take a step
deeper into the evaluation here with
this guy who exactly are you are you the
are you the presentation the person that
that people know on
personal level or are you a fabrication
of yourself I know you guys didn't sign
up for this today
you'll clicks on a video thinking you
were about to see some new gaijin I went
deep on you but the truth is every so
often you got evaluate you got to see
where you're at and how you got there
discipline is feel a thing you can do
something about this you can pick and
choose and do a better job of curating
what you're exposed to the stimuli is
everywhere you know this I don't need to
tell you your eyeballs are included your
smartphone is included use this video as
an opportunity to take a step back just
examine how its influencing you at least
that's what I did this is a stupid
product but that's what makes it
interesting
every so often give yourself a no phone
throw a football or something kids or
don't play video games till your eyes
bleed your life or is it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
