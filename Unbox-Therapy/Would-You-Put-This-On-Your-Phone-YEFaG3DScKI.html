so I'm not your sneaker guy this is not
the shoe Channel I've never shown you a
pair of Yeezys before I really love the
soul and how rugged it looks but here's
the thing
today represents a change a convergence
of worlds so to speak your pals at Nike
decided to get into the smartphone
accessory game and that is noteworthy
that is something that I just had to
share with you in front of me today I
have Nikes first sole collection sneaker
sole iPhone cases it's a limited
selection right now as you can see here
but apparently what I have in front of
me are replicas of the soles of very
popular Nike shoes so if you happen to
be one of these sneaker heads a Nike fan
and so on now you can take that love to
your tech you can answer phone calls
while holding on to your favorite soul I
think this is a little a little bit of a
test for nice I don't think any of these
are even available for the 7 plus so I
think it's a little test to see if these
things if people bite on these and then
maybe they'll make more but right now we
have an Air Force One replica case in
blue I believe this is the only color it
comes in the Roche foam case in two
different colors aqua teal ish greenish
I used to be into guitars in the old
days a lot of those fenders had this
color on them and they used to call this
color seafoam green pretty
straightforward right but what I want to
find out today is how authentic are
these I took it a step further let me
just I've got a bet I'm just and I
actually got some fresh kicks kaboom we
have a pair of
roche and we have a pair of Air Force
Ones
what is it Santa back here made from
100% thermoplastic polyurethane little
history on the Air Force one first
produced in 1982 then discontinued the
following year it became a first Nike
retro sneaker when it was re-released in
86 so took a few years off you know
what's really cool is when you when you
look at basketball shoes from early days
compared to what they're wearing today
it's a whole different ballgame now see
what I did there
ballgame careful not to cut through it
maybe I'll do it what are we doing here
can I do it without the knife maybe this
is a hole okay that wasn't actually
terrible whoo you can see the
inspiration here you turn it over to
this side you have a f-1 it's a pretty
standard tone case all right if this
didn't have Nike on it it would not be
$35 Jack you're a sneaker head you spend
a hundred bucks plus on every single
pair I mean you get crazy with the Kanye
stuff now you spend thousand tell me you
can afford 35 for a case that represents
you I doubt it right away I'm saying it
doesn't quite feel like the sole it
definitely looks like the sole but I
don't know if it feels like it we're
gonna find out let's get these other
ones over the shoe is designed to be as
simple as possible by keeping only what
was absolutely necessary these are super
lightweight okay it's the same material
so straight away we're not getting the
real sole the insole was designed to
mimic a freshly rate Zen rock garden
anyhow there we go Desroches you've seen
these before everybody has them ooh you
know what that's pretty good man it's a
different material sure that case looks
like it's just chopped right out of the
soul that is some sneaker love right
there for your iPhone goes in super easy
now you're gonna rep your favorite
sneaker when you answer your phone if
you still talk on the phone okay you've
seen this a thousand times as well Air
Force One this edge here with the ridges
that's what's being replicated right
here that's what they're trying to show
off there you've seen that footprint
before Hey look at that I can match that
right up right like that that is cool
like that that's how it looks on the
device Nike is in the case business Air
Force one brooch how do you feel about
this is this where Nike should be will
you be running out to get one of these
in maybe most importantly if you could
have any shoe which one would it be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
