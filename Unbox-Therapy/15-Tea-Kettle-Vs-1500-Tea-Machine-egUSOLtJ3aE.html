other thing you can do can you get
cultures I'm going to expose you to a
culture you might not be aware of that
is the teen culture and I'm not going to
do it by myself I'm going to bring in
big t Tom as well
it's called T for you and I I'm
legitimately pumped to check this out a
$1,000 T machine or maybe even $1,500 I
don't know I'm going to link it down
below some I didn't know is that people
are making T wrong
you included what do you got you get the
hot water you got the bag according to
these guys that's all wrong you're not
bringing out the the maximum flavor from
that T am I going to be able to tell the
difference between a tiny little tea bag
across a few cents is that it is it
excuse me I want you to see bag worth 20
tea bags three dollars who are you going
to ask for your tea data big t Tom I'm
going to compare the two depending on
the type of tea that you put into it
along with an app on your smart phone
determine the perfect temperature and
amount of time to grow is it brew infuse
the water with the flavor of the tea
leaves
now tea is a ritual around the world
right inland tea time all the time China
Japan every week why is that important
the point is it's important and people
take it very seriously and this might be
the most serious way to take it so if
you've got $1,500 burning a hole in your
pocket this might be the best cup of tea
you ever had in your life anyway check
this out I feel like this box here might
have tea in it but they also sent over
this one it's got a barcode on it and
you drop this on the top and it
instantaneously knows okay you got me
you got two along you're about to get
down with the oolong and it'll brew it
whatever that is I don't know four
minutes oh wow oh my god holy look at
that ancient dragon 2007 we have ears on
that wheel wisdom and grace I don't know
what you've all been waiting for
a whole babies that's the carafe right
yes a water filter what's the point in
making tea if you don't have nice
tasting water this is your cleaning
brush whoa oh look at that I mean it
sure ain't a kettle - water filter here
little fits in the bottom there like
that mmm see there's a filter in there
once again and that's because you put
loose leaf tea right in here lining it
up
oh that's easy well so this slides in
here it's not going to impact the flavor
because the inner wall is made out of
glass and even the outside is bpa-free
plastic this is it I think we're ready
to go it's the moment you've all been
waiting for it's time to bring it in RTX
first base Oh step right up
what do you have to say to the people I
don't have today this here taking chute
no no three things they need to know
about tea three things the tones and
flavors okay maybe I have overestimated
Khan's expertise here but the truth is
he drinks more to you than I do so that
therefore makes you today's expert sure
green tea versus green tea so we have
cheapo green tea no offense
sadly all right I'm sure you guys you
guys are in the game that's fine and
then we got the super duper machine
which one are we going to do first let's
do people it doesn't smell anywhere near
as inviting as that box all right you
get a bag I get a bag and we ever had
tea together remember no this is a
ceremony you realize that so
I mean it tastes like tea work it around
work it around
how would you rate this teeth scale of
one to ten totally fine
just five it's satisfactory I'm not
trying to put anybody down like this is
still this is what it is maybe you go
this route and you turn it into a
totally different can you enter the next
dimension Green Bennet genmaicha in my
chest genmaicha
oh hello there alright let me open the
app about to experience tea like never
before
so this this guy she connects to your
Wi-Fi and that's how it speaks to the
app whoa hopeful cool Oh baby this is
about four-minute process for this
particular green tea oh whoa Oh baby I
would rather smell that then drink the
other one I mean oh man that spoke it's
like keeping a bath yeah it is
unbelievable the tea will stay warming
here for up to 90 minutes oh man
yeah yeah really you hey Nick
I'm checking a little bit more really
yeah oh man I got things going on in
here
I got things happening in here it's
definitely good shot so here's the thing
you're probably seeing Lou this is not a
fair comparison you took like high-end
loose leaf tea and you compared it to
like some little paper bag from the
supermarket I agree with you but the
reason a machine like this exists is to
completely stop you from having to go
through that whole process it's to take
a guy like me doesn't have the time to
become a connoisseur and like put it all
in one place
I'm not going to be drinking something
of this caliber if I got to do it all
myself and I'm steeping and how long and
it's I'm telling you I'm not a tea guy
but for me like something different
happen right there it's happening in my
mouth right now and it continues to
happen is it a $1,500 thing that's
happening in my mouth
maybe not for Tom a $1,500 cup of tea
isn't something that's ever going to be
a part of their universe but if it can
be a part of your universe you might
want to take that trip you might want to
take that trip</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
