about a week now and over the course of
the last week I've had a chance to
really put it through its paces and find
out what it can do and what it can't do
and unfortunately I found it can't do
more than it can do at least in my use
case to be honest I really bought the
Boxee Box hoping it could deliver web
content in a smooth and seamless way and
it still seems to me like it's more
focused on media streaming as far as
your own content is concerned stuff you
own or that exists on your server
there's a lot of content providers out
there that have provided apps for the
Boxee Box like you see here but in my
case being up here in Canada often I'll
run into applications and content
providers that have managed to block us
out and and I'm assuming block out other
regions as well around the world so
that's something to keep note of if you
hope to you know purchase the Boxee Box
outside of the United States if you look
around this list here you can see all
your sort of favorite favorite web
content providers if you look in the
bottom left corner you can see youporn
which is obviously in addition to the
repository afterwards but I could see it
being popular for that kind of usage for
people who want to put this kind of
stuff up on a big screen which I'm sure
a lot of people too and to be honest
with you when you think about web
content in general there's a massive
amount of it I mean really an unlimited
amount of it and that's why it's kind of
to me at least useless to hoard all this
media keep it on a server somewhere and
then feed it back to yourself over and
over again I'm more inclined to get new
stuff all the time
get something that's current I'm not
nearly as interested in going and
watching some movie from 10 years ago
it's just it's not something I do now
there were some positives to the Boxee
Box this being the biggest one this is a
this is a dope remote control that's
right
dope is the only way to describe it and
it's it seems so simple like somebody
should have done it a long time ago but
they
having it slim it's appealing you have a
full-size keyboard on the back I don't
know what I'm saying full size not full
size like a computer but full size
meaning it spans almost the entire
remote and you can easily thumb type on
it and to be honest with you this might
be a better buy you can actually
purchase the remote on its own and hook
it up to your computer
in which case you can sort of lean back
from the screen a little bit in your
chair and you can sort of get that boxy
experience without having to purchase
the Boxee Box because let's be honest a
lot of us are using computers that are
more powerful than the Boxee Box itself
another big problem I had was with
YouTube to be honest to me the load
times were not what they need to be the
whole purpose of YouTube is that it's
instant immediate you can bounce around
and I didn't have that experience so for
me the Boxee Box isn't is a don't buy if
you're interested I say wait hopefully
some bugs get ironed out hopefully this
becomes more the Internet content device
that we all hope for</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
