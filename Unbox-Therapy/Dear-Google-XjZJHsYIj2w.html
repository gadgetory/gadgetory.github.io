video of this device right here the
pixel three XL man there has been so
much talk about this notch up on the top
notch City I mean it's been referred to
IC memes about this notch it's a meme
worthy notch now I think a lot of people
we're hoping I would talk a little bit
more about it in the original video so
here we are we're gonna have a dedicated
video talking about this particular
notch it is huge it is a big notch and
it's not too many people's tastes in
fact it seems to have stolen the show
especially in conjunction with the chin
of the phone the chin and the knotch
together creating this ensemble people
have been so displeased with this
particular layout that they're saying
they want to pick up the regular pixel
three instead of the XL now I am NOT
gonna make a case to defend that thing I
am on record many times to take I am NOT
a fan of notches every single time that
I've had the opportunity to disable a
notch on any phone I disable it I
promise you can go back and watch all
videos I have been doing that now
certain manufacturers don't allow you to
do that and some do I think all should I
definitely think that Google should now
I've been told that they are thinking
about or probably going to enable the
option by default in order to disable
this notch but they have a kind of
different implementation as things stand
right now so I want to use this video as
an opportunity to possibly influence the
future and maybe even ask Google to
change their implementation of what
they're currently doing with this notch
so Google I know you're listening I know
you're watching listen to what I have to
say here think I'm gonna save you some
criticism some potential criticism on
this implementation so first up yes you
can disable the notch right now even
though this device is not publicly
available but the way that you do it is
via a developer option I'm gonna show
you how to do that right now so you go
into your settings down to your system
from there you'll see about pixel 3
Excel select that and then rapidly click
on the build number
that simple stuff that allows you to
enter developer mode this would be the
same on a previous generation pixel and
so on you are now a developer okay
that's simple now what that does is
within developer options which are now
available to you it gives you some
knotch
configuration settings which are a bit
interesting so right here within
developer options there is a display
cutout option this is not an option by
default on the phone in the default
software but it does live currently in
developer options if I click on that you
can see you have the device default
that's the knotch
as you've seen it then you can hide it
then you have a corner cut out double
cut out and the tall cut out so hide
which is the most interesting for most
people does this can you see now now
because this is an OLED display actually
does a pretty good job of completely
blacking out the top portion and giving
you a bezel a forehead and chin similar
to the regular pixel 3 if that's the
look that you're going for now of course
when you look at this thing you're like
man it looks sort of old-fashioned that
is a huge chin and forehead this is
where things get a bit weird and this is
where I want to speak to Google directly
in hopes that maybe we can rectify this
implementation I said this on Twitter
earlier but the best use of the notch
real estate in my opinion is when it's
blacked out but utilized as real estate
for the various icons that live at the
top of your display so you have your
Wi-Fi connection battery life your clock
those need to get lifted up into this
region here as they have been on other
manufacturers devices
I think these phones should ship with a
knotch blacked out and then utilize the
real estate up there in the corners
instead of creating the eyesore that we
all happen to be used to at this point
or familiar with for some reason Google
just pushed down the icons and created
this giant forehead without utilizing
that space I'm not sure why maybe they
just mapped over the software layout
from the smaller pixel and just created
a dimension that's identical maybe they
wanted to create some degree of symmetry
between the forehead and the chin not
really certain but I want to ask right
now sincerely before I switch over to
this device completely is there
away Google to move these icons up into
the notch zone so we at least get some
degree of usefulness out of that real
estate as opposed to just completely
blacking it out because it's hard for me
to block it out as it stands right now
it just pushes everything down look at
how much more real estate I get all of a
sudden all this stuff jumps up into the
area that would be blacked out Google
you just got to listen up go in there
and do this it's going to be a lot
better off I promise
other weird ones in there which might be
interesting to you like a corner cutout
I have no idea why that is in developer
options or why you would want that maybe
even more funny a double cutout which
puts a notch down on the bottom maybe
this is an indication of some potential
designs that Google was thinking of I'm
not really sure so let's see where this
goes
follow the thread I'll have an update
for you
not City time to evacuate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
