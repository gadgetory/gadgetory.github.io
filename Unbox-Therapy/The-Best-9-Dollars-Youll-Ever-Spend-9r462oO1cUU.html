completely wireless earphones earbuds
headphones and so on you have seen the
mini Jack connector vanished we are now
living in a wireless reality now one of
the issues with that wireless headphones
are expensive but today I've got some
good news for you or maybe it's good
news
I don't really know for a set of
wireless earbuds that wait for it are
available for $9.99 Evan t5 to be more
specific now yes that is a promotional
price but that is why I am bringing you
this video wireless Bluetooth and for a
while as it goes are like a hundred
bucks are we really living in a reality
now where $9.75 can get you decent
wireless earbuds I'm gonna find them
these are from Aliexpress and it's
really the only place you could get the
deals that I'm referencing it's only for
a day
so I've coordinated this video around
this incredible price quantities are
limited at that $9.75 so go check that
out I buy a lot of stuff over there I do
it frequently if you just check the
shipping it's surprising some of the
stuff is actually warehouse in the u.s.
now so you get it quicker than you might
expect now these ones are from a company
called blue do I've featured their
products in the past
it's the turbine te standard verse
inside you've got an ear hook ear tip
user manual case and a charge cable and
then on the back here there's also a
microphone built-in so you can answer
and end phone calls I'm having a moment
here of trying to figure out how you
manufacture a wireless earbuds this
packaging you put it all together free
shipping you do it for nine seventy five
what's going on here how is this
possible it's incredible it seems
magical maybe it is here's a little
travel case a flat micro USB cable to
charge up the headset so this headset
comes in a few different colors like a
silver and black but it also comes in
yellow blue red green oh my goodness I
should make you aware of another deal if
you're not a fan of earbuds style
bluetooth headphones this one is also on
sale but I believe there's even fewer
quantities of this in China there's a
special
happening right now at this time that
you're watching this it's kind of like
Black Friday but they call it singles
day and as this crazy deals on products
it's a huge sales day a link of both in
the description but this one here goes
from like a hundred bucks down to thirty
I'm just letting you know some
interchangeable ear tips as well as ear
hooks so this is a style that goes
around the neck
you've got the inline controls and
microphone charge port up at the top
teehee
oh okay straight into pairing mode
connected just like that $9.75 a phone
it's really incredible alright let's see
what we're working with you that's
ridiculous I'm happy that we made this
video because this is ridiculous
nine dollars and seventy five cents
right now when you're watching this
video for these that's a steal that's
ridiculous that doesn't make any sense
there's got to be a loss happening for
this particular promotion walk into a
store and see what you get for nine
seventy five then I get it giving you
nothing they give you a boot out the
door you did nothing for nine seventy
five it's not the best headphones I've
ever heard obviously alright you don't
expect that I didn't expect that I got
to reevaluate the way I'm looking at a
lot of different things in nine seventy
five seriously these ones are
surprisingly loud also I didn't know
what to expect opening these up I
thought they might be a good deal but it
turns out they're a better deal than I
thought so go check them out cuz it's a
temporary promotion over on Aliexpress
for this singles day promotion there's
like all kinds of things that are on
sale it's like thousands of products so
make sure after you click the link in if
you add these to your cart take another
peek around also I'm sure there's plenty
of deals to be had just make sure to
select the country you want it to ship
from from the drop-down menu and you'll
see different ship times it's like Black
Friday before Black Friday and you can
get earbuds like this for nine seventy
five can you get a happy meal what's a
happy meal can you get a combo at
McDonald's these days I'm telling you
it's close
