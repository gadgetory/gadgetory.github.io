all part of the intro in case you're
wondering okay what's up guys Lew here
and I'm very excited today because not
only did I get to experience Google i/o
and much of San Francisco that you see
behind me but I also received a
factory-fresh
LG G watch this was just announced at
Google i/o and it's one of the first
Android wear devices a SmartWatch
obviously I did play with a version that
was in demo mode at their presentation
but this is the retail version this is
the one that I'll be testing out wearing
linking up to my device using for
notifications etc all right so come on
in and take a closer look on the back
here you can get some of the information
you can see it is water and dust
resistant ip67 I believe it can be under
a meter of water for about half an hour
something like that
so washing your hands is not going to be
an issue with this SmartWatch on you
haven't always on screen it happens to
be an IPS display which apparently is
important for battery saving it has a
nine axis motion sensor as well so it
can tell when you lift it up to look at
it it's got a 400 milliamp hour battery
and of course it has a microphone for
reacting to your voice commands enough
about the box let's take a closer look
at the actual device so there you have
it the LG G watch so we'll pull the
watch out first it has a black band
installed it does also come in a white
version now I'm a big fan of the charger
that the LG G watch ships with it's a
lot less of a headache than the Galaxy
gear charger that I used previously or
really any charger that I've seen with a
SmartWatch this one is dead simple you
just place the watch on top of this
little platform and magnets hold it
together and of course you just insert
the microUSB on this end into the power
adapter and this will just lay flat on
your bedside or wherever it is that
you happen to charge devices it's also
really small the form factors tiny so
carrying it with you not a big deal
Samsung needs to learn something here
the Galaxy gear charger was a big
headache still hater to this day now
let's see if we can boot this thing up
real quick the watch requires the
installation of Android wear on your
phone so at this point we're assuming
that's an application a companion
application for the device that allows
for it to operate but it's currently not
in the App Store at the time of filming
is it will launching very very soon at
which point I can give you guys a lot
more detailed demonstration of the
actual device but for now we can do a
physical comparison to see how the LG G
watch stacks up to for example a
standard G Shock watch a lot of G's
there um but I have a fairly large wrist
so I like to wear larger watches as you
can see here so this one on the other
hand and most smartwatches
are kind of made to be unisex and so
they're not really huge which some
people will appreciate but you can tell
it's not as big as my G Shock watch but
it's also not dainty it doesn't look
like a girly watch or something like
that the objective here is to build a
watch that would would look good either
on a male wrist or a female wrist
speaking of the band they showed off
some leather band options as well to
sort of class up the device if you don't
want to use this standard stock
rubberized band but it does have a nice
texture on the inside and it is soft
touch it's going to be going to be
comfortable and I would assume it would
also be fairly durable as well a fairly
basic unboxing video and overview of the
physical device as I said before the
Android wear application currently not
in the app store at the time of this
unboxing so that's how you know who this
is a fresh factory-fresh unboxing no app
for this thing even yet but as soon as
it's available you'll probably see some
more info and possibly more video covers
from me doing a more elaborate
demonstration probably going to check
out the Samsung device as well as the
Moto 360s which are at the Moscone
Center right now
