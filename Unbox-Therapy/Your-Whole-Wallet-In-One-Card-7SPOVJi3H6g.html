seriously solve some problems it's this
promise of one single physical digital
card to replace all your cards I might
have in front of me the actual solution
to the problem all right take a look in
your pocket right now how many cards are
you carrying around and I'm not just
talking about credit cards debit cards
I'm also talking about membership cards
this box in front of me
houses the future beep a brilliant card
look at that
it's even cool-looking the fused card
look at how slender that thing is it is
it's the thickness of a regular card
first thing you noticed was this screen
on here I mean your card with the screen
how cool is that
kaboom all my cards are going to be in
there and I can cycle through them this
is exciting
a traditional magstripe so if you're not
using the chip and pin scenario you're
just swiping all right who wants to
carry all these around we asked Tom
earlier I like Tom what do you got you
got some gift cards
it's a George Costanza situating this
will plug into the headphone jack and
allow you to take card like this or
credit card otherwise and slide it
through there and kaboom wirelessly
transfer the information of your current
card to the fused card this is the
charger microUSB on this end will slide
in like that and it'll charge up rapidly
and give you 30 days the idea of having
30 days and it all happening rapidly
with this little slender thing not such
a big deal to me currently that said I
probably would still bring one backup
card I don't know in the event of some
sort of malfunction okay so the app you
want is up here it's called the e card
manager Ryan Ryan texting me
unbelievable unprofessional as you would
hope there's a verification process here
press power and multi button at the same
time kaboom register card okay they got
the pairing request for the Bluetooth
it'll generate a pin code there's a
request to pair here's where I'll put
the code in we recommend to set up a tap
code for e card security create a series
of six
tap codes by pressing on three buttons
randomly if you're worried about
somebody getting their hands on your
card this tap code pretty much
alleviates that so now this is the main
interface and you can see here I can set
up a payment card or a membership card
so it can take a barcode a magnetic
swipe or a direct input this will
actually work through the iPhones
adapter okay so they want the fat side
down the thin side of the reader at the
top part where the screen is okay I
think I got that I don't think this is a
payment card I think this is a
membership card I'm gonna call this card
popcorn
popcorns in there and let's see it has
the number there which matches what if I
go to barcode this it brings up let's
see if it grabs it oh it does right away
so then I can just call this movies and
now we have movies and popcorn in there
let's try and do the direct input for
that one so the card number is here I
assume that's the card number let's try
this Starbucks
boom the Starbucks card is represented
by the barcode this is like when you use
the app at Starbucks the loyalty app now
they could just do that with the card
now this process will be identical for
credit cards tap the payment card option
here plus and it's the exact same
process here this bar on the front here
when you're scanning a card it's kind of
like when you're programming a
fingerprint into a fingerprint sensor
it's like tap it a few times this bar
kind of goes across so I was wondering
why I was having to swipe it I guess
it's so that it gets an exact reading of
the mag strip on your card as you can
see here I can toggle through the
membership section between movies
Starbucks popcorn and so on and then if
I hit the multi button it'll switch over
to my payment cards I have a single one
Amex right now so level one security is
to just use it as you would a normal
card level two security is that it has
to be connected to the phone and then
level three security is a lost card
detection and alert if the Bluetooth
identifies that the card is not in the
range of the phone you're going to get
an identification you can't lose your
wallet like that alright so there you
have it
possibly the future of payments one card
to replace all of your cards it's pretty
amazing
this little scanner to insert cards into
the fuse card this tiny little charger
which you will likely only use once per
month I know a lot of you out there
you're going to be like hey man but what
if there's a malfunction or I'm
traveling or something like this or just
dies completely well what I would do
what I will do is carry one payment card
alongside that one which will replace
the other five let's say or six the
membership card thing is very cool as
well on its own because all those
programs you sign up for them it all
sounds so great but you never carry all
those cards with you unless you got this
giant cinder block in your pocket and no
one wants to do that so maybe all of a
sudden now you're earning points on
everything you're scanning here the gas
station a drugstore you got them all
firing on Full Tilt because of the fuse
card that's kind of cool so keep in mind
this is early right now it just went
into power saving that's cool battery
life my name look at that who doesn't
want to screen on their car this is the
most high-tech car out there you're into
tech this is probably the future</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
