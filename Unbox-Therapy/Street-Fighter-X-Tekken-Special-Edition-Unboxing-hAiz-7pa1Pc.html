therapy and I've got another game
unboxing for you this just came out
recently it is street fighter cross
tekken the ps3 special edition and there
are some extras included in the box here
that obviously do not come with the
regular edition I'm going to give you a
quick rundown of what those objects are
now the main thing here is you're going
to get a little Street Fighter arcade
cabinet piggy bank kind of thing and
I'll give you more information on that
in a quick second you're also going to
get a little bit of an art book and
supposedly some DLC so let's take a look
inside and show you guys around now the
very first thing I want to mention after
getting inside here is that the arcade
cabinet piggy bank is not the easiest
thing in the world to a sample now in
fact I didn't I didn't really know what
to expect given the fact that most
special editions don't require very much
assembly but this particular one here
required quite a bit of force you had to
push the components together in a way
where you felt like you might break it
but my piece of advice is just apply
direct force as best you can here you
can see on the bottom of some of the
components there is a choking hazard so
it is for individuals seven years and
older if you are under 7 years old
you're probably not watching this this
video so that's not a huge deal and here
you can get a better look at just how
many components there are required for
the construction of the arcade cabinet
piggy bank and I'm not going to make you
guys suffer through the construction I'm
not even going to lie it took me like
half an hour to get this thing together
not because it's super complicated but
because because you don't know how much
pressure to apply when clipping the
components together anyway once you've
got it all up and completed you got a
you know stick the little decals on
there there you can see a slot for coins
along top and then you've got a little
twist off door on the bottom for
extracting your funds once you've
decided that you've saved enough cash
who knows maybe for the next video
that you're going to go pre-order buy or
who knows but as I said before this is
quite the task quite the endeavor I've
heard of people actually asking for
instructions video instructions on how
to build it but like I said before it's
not super complicated it's just about
plying enough pressure when clipping it
together so this looks like the user
manual here which is kind of weird is
actually outside the game case I'm not
sure why I guess we'll get a better idea
once I get inside the game case so the
very first thing you're going to notice
as I open it up is what looks like
another manual on the left and then the
game disk on the right but something
that surprised me as I was flipping
through here is it's sort of a hybrid
it's half manual half comic-book special
limited comic book if you will on the
other side if you as you flip it over
there so a little bit of a surprise they
have packaged this booklet together in
order to serve two functions the old
kill two birds with one stone kind of a
deal anyways you get an idea of some of
the artwork inside of that comic book so
here's a better look at the game disk I
know you guys like to get an up-close
look at the game discs and the artwork
on there and then here's one last close
look at the piggy bank slash arcade
cabinet little collector's item there
you can check out my installation of the
details I think I did alright I did
pretty good anyway guys if you enjoyed
this unboxing then hopefully you can
like and favorite this video as it does
help me out a bunch and one last thing I
want to talk about is if you haven't
friended me on Facebook yet please go
ahead and do so that's where the
conversation is happening
that's where hits the fan no but
seriously is where we can talk about
things maybe not always
unboxing related it's a very cool place
communicate and I keep track of it so
anyway guys if you haven't friended me
there go ahead and do so link is down in
the description it is facebook.com slash
my name I'm going to put it up in front
of you on the screen as well I'll see
you over there and I'll see you on the
next unboxing alright later guys thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
