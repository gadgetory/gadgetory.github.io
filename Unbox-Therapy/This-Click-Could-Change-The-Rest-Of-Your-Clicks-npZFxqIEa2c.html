world just got better I have been a fan
of the MX master series since it came
out and even before that the performance
MX that's been the mouse on my desk I
like a substantial Mouse with a lot of
buttons all started with a scroll wheel
like a loose kind of spin to it which
you could you could modify whether you
had that little click eNOS or a smooth
scroll that's it I was hooked from that
moment forward the MX master 2s the
thing that Logitech is promoting mostly
is this cross computer control called
flow dual connectivity you can connect
via the included unifying reciever or
over Bluetooth the view computer
supports it's completely up to you so
you don't need to carry around that
little tiny receiver if you don't want
to and you can also pair up to three
computers to one mouse click the button
on the bottom and switch systems track
even on glass a fast rechargeable
battery which will give you about 70
days of battery life here's a better
demonstration of how the flow function
works you can see the cursor moving from
a MacBook to a Windows laptop even copy
and paste text images and files between
them I feel like this is the most
comfortable Mouse to hold on to I try to
convert people
I see somebody using some other Mouse
I'll run across the room and slap it off
the table I mean that's how aggressive
it gets at times you got to have a nice
Mouse they changed the logo a little bit
it's now just logy it's for the
youngsters I love this texture they put
on there it has some grip it's still
smooth I can speak from experience here
it stays the same for years of use
there's a dark field sensor right there
and these will light up to indicate
which system you're on whether it's 1 2
3 microUSB port on the front to charge
it up this button on the top will change
the behavior of the scroll wheel so you
hear this here listen to this you get
that nice crunchy now that might be
something you're into hit this button on
the top that became loose now and look
at that now it's freewheeling if I want
a freewheel on the fly check this see
that a little more force and you get the
best of both worlds this entire section
here is cool
Keable you see that i'll have that set
up at least on on the macbook as a way
of organizing Windows so I can I can hit
that button and then see all the
different windows that I've got open but
of course it is programmable and then
you have this vertical scroll over here
very smooth and then you also have a
forward and back button here that's your
receiver for whatever reason you don't
want to use bluetooth a relatively long
microUSB cable so right about now you're
thinking loo what is so special about
this mouse the main thing that that
Logitech is pushing here is this flow
technology and you can see the supported
devices here and now you can copy and
paste not only text but other files
images documents and so on between two
different computers up on the same
platform or also cross-platform
computers Windows and Mac and this is
actually a good illustration this is
what you're used to seeing where you can
essentially program each button you see
how you're connected the battery life
and if you have multiple devices like if
I go to your devices here you can see my
old MX masters the other two and then
the new one I just noticed the color so
the black version on the old model had
gold trim this one has silver trim you
can also modify the point and scroll the
speed the flow button is where things
get a little bit different download and
install this software on both systems
and then you pair your mouse with both
computers so that's where this button on
the bottom comes into play and then all
you have to do beyond that is make sure
that the two systems are on the same
wireless network and this is where you
set things up kind of like you would do
with a multi-monitor setup if I pull
this other laptop over here we're gonna
have some magic right now here we go
let's try and just move this cursor
across and see what happens look at that
did you see that can you see the cursor
on there Jack got that there it is now
let's go back over and we're back over
here now move over to the edge and then
we're over here now there is a second it
kind of takes a second when you get to
the edge of the display I assume that's
intentional probably because it wants to
make sure that you actually want to go
to that next display there's not just
floating around too easily let's say
what about copying and pasting something
I'm gonna copy that go over to the other
display paste it whoa that was
absolutely seamless
okay the 100 PNG I'm gonna copy that
then go over to this other system and
paste it and here we go
that was instant and you can see it's
the same file that's genius this is very
easy to establish and let's say there's
just a bunch of text over here or maybe
a YouTube description or something come
back over to this system and command V
look at it now this one does also charge
up a bit quicker it has fast charging so
we can get 70 days of battery life in
three minutes
this one's around 120 bucks you can find
deals on the old version if those two
features are not imperative to you so
I'll link both versions down below as
well as my original video on the MX
master but I can pretty confidently say
at least for me in my opinion this is
the greatest mouse on the planet you
like the best then settle for nothing
less well I didn't even you see with the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
