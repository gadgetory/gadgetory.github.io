go further what's up guys Lew here and
I've got something cool to show you from
the show floor here at CES 2013 it's a
little bit different from what you're
probably seeing in your YouTube feed
right now this is a police car from the
future and as you can see it looks super
mean from the outside you've got the
classic black and white styling the big
chunky black rims as well as that big
push bar on the front but the story here
is not about the exterior or the looks
it's actually about technology because
on the inside of this police car it's
very unique they've they've taken some
cues from Tesla and put a massive screen
in there a massive display which is
touchscreen and it's connected to a PC
which is in the trunk so that the
there's no longer a need to have a
laptop in the front of the car like
previous old-school cop cars used to
have you've also got a big huge
floodlight on the outside which is
pretty straightforward but this one also
adds a camera so whatever is being seen
by the use of that floodlight you're
also going to be able to capture video
content of whatever it is that's going
on out there on the inside as I said
before the dash is dominated by this
large touch panel which is connected to
a PC in the trunk so there's no need for
all that clutter of having a separate
laptop here is the keyboard this is the
way you interface with that PC it looks
pretty rugged and tough it's also got a
trackpad there and as we move down we
can see some of the communications
aspect of the cockpit this is by
Motorola as you can see from the logo
right there the backseat has been
improved apparently you can see there's
now a molded portion for where the
criminals arms will go this is still not
a place that I would recommend wanting
to sit in but nonetheless if you are a
criminal and you are watching this your
life just got a little bit more
comfortable not exactly luxurious but a
little bit more comfortable on the top
of the car you can see there are solar
panels so the police are jumping on the
energy-efficient bandwagon I'm not sure
how these are going to be utilized I'd
assume probably to cool the cabin or
maybe for some of the many electronics
that are in the trunk here this is where
your
DC is house as well as your
communications devices and there's a
bunch of Ethernet cables not sure if
they're gigabit but a bunch of Ethernet
cables going between all the different
devices so they can speak to one another
and there's probably of course video
cables going to the front of the cop car
to power that touchscreen display anyway
