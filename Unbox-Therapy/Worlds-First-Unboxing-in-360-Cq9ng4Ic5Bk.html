another video and today I've got
something special that's why I'm in this
special location in fact this is not the
studio environment you're used to
instead I'm in the South of France on a
beautiful day and this is my very first
possibly the world's first 360 unboxing
video what does that mean it means pick
up your phone get on the official
YouTube app and look around move around
and explore the environment there's a
lot to look at but as I said it's an
unboxing video so we're going to be
checking out this HP workstation laptop
the reason why is because since there's
this emphasis on 360 you've heard about
360 you've experienced 360 you know a
lot of people are apprehensive about how
to how do they get involved how do they
get started with 360 because one of the
fears is there's going to be this crazy
kind of workflow to get from A to B on
360 and it is a very resource intensive
task when it comes to stitching video
together which is something that anybody
who's shot 360 is probably familiar with
you need a lot of horsepower
to make that process something you're
going to want to do that's what this
workstation laptop aims to do so this
guy here is called the Z book it's
configurable in a number of different
ways this one that I've got actually has
an Intel Xeon mobile processor now if
you're unfamiliar with Xeon the Xeon
brand it's because it's been used in
workstations mostly suppose to consumer
products when we're talking about
workstation grade getting that into
something that's mobile is really
compelling it doesn't stop there though
it's not just workstation processors but
also graphics too and look this guy that
is slim
it's actually only about four point four
pounds with a 15.6 inch 4k UHD display
check that out
lots of ports on it too well after all
it is a workstation so you've got USB
three full size HDMI this is really cool
these are two Thunderbolt three ports
Thunderbolt three capable for insane
transfer speeds if you're like me and
you're on the video production side you
know how important having fast access to
external storages this is going to let
you have high-res video files possibly
360 video files on external storage and
still get that quick access to it
internally the storage on this is
something I haven't seen before stock
either its PCIe SSD but up to two in a
range configuration inside of a single
laptop that's pretty amazing and we all
know PCIe is about as fast as it gets
for mobile storage so cracking it open
let's check out the inside here see the
keyboard there as well as a very large
trackpad the screen the display as I
mentioned before 4k uhd you can see it
has this matte finish on it that's
something that people on the workstation
side tend to look for of course less
glare it's also IPs meaning that the
viewing angles should be better and
there should be less color shift
associated with other display
technologies
pretty slick actually we also got
dedicated buttons for Wi-Fi sound on
this side of the laptop there is a
full-size network jack as well as a
couple more USB threes and then lastly
an SD card slot so a fully featured
workstation laptop with some specs that
were used to seeing in desktop style
designs Xeon is in here as I mentioned
before and it's got a
or gigabyte up to four gigabyte graphics
options in the Quadro lineup Quadro
series from nvidia again this is stuff
you're not used to seeing in a laptop
that exists in this series right here so
that's pretty damn exciting anyway there
you have it 360 video the new frontier
360 unboxing videos I hope you've had a
good look around this environment it's
really amazing this is hopefully a
little bit closer than standard flat
video could get you to what it feels
like to stand here and unbox in the
South of France haha thanks for watching
guys take a look take a look back watch
it again and see if you can find
something else going on that you didn't
see the first time because once you once
you play back these 360 videos you
always find something new to look at
alright that wraps it up I'm going to go
stitch this video together this one
right here the one you're watching on
this workstation
that's the workflow I'm talking about
later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
