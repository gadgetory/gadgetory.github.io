and right now we're looking at Metal
Gear Solid the HD collection which
includes Peace Walker Snake Eater as
well as Sons of Liberty all on one disc
for the first time ever the three epic
titles now what's important here is
they've been up rezzed remastered
modernized they've gone all the way up
to 1080p to take full advantage of our
modern flat panel displays and of course
the ps3's capability now that's a
beautiful thing because these games
really do deserve that new-age treatment
you know they're timeless I mean you can
play these things over and over again
and now you can do it on a modern
console with modern functionality like
that resolution so on the right hand
side what you're gonna notice is the
game disk with some actually some pretty
nice artwork on it as far as I can see I
do appreciate that and then on the left
you've got the user manual which is
fairly substantial as you'd imagine it
would be considering the fact that it
represents three separate titles so bit
of a novel here definitely some
nighttime reading for you Metal Gear
Solid fans I'm just joking around and on
the back you see some DLC being
advertised but nothing about getting it
for free or anything like that now you
got to come you got to pay to play am i
right
so once you get the game disc insert it
into your PlayStation 3 you're gonna
notice that there are a couple of cool
features on the disc itself including
some visual manuals for each independent
title now that I actually prefer these
style manuals to the ones that come in
the book because they're colorful
they're uh press hey they're on your
flat panel they're up there huge in my
case they're up there 55 inches on my
Samsung so I do appreciate that as
opposed to looking at a little tiny
manual and you know what you'll notice
is they have some some cool artwork in
them as well in fact the Metal Gear
Solid 3 manual here you'll notice has
some comic book-like
action in there so definitely a real
cool way to browse through the original
manuals and decide which title you're
going to play now they've done it in a
very elegant fashion you just scroll
left to right decide which one you're
gonna start on which one do you guys
think I should start on I don't know
I don't know which one I want to play
first let me know down in the comment
section which you think is the best of
these three titles if you're a metal
gear fan
and if you're a metal gear fan you
probably already played through all of
these three releases you probably pick
this up a while ago because it has been
out for a little while but I think this
is gonna mean some some good holiday
gaming for me because you know these
ones you can put you could put some time
into that's for sure
