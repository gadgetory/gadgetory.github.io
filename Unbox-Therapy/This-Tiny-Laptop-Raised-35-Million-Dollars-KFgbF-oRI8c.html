be the world's smallest laptop it's from
a company called gamepad digital as you
can see on the side it says pocket so
they're trying to imply that you could
fit this thing into your pocket you'd
have to have a rather large pocket and I
don't know how comfortable that would be
nonetheless this thing was incredibly
popular in fact it is raised
I believe close to 3.5 million dollars
on IndieGoGo so people are obviously
interested in tiny laptops so let's go
ahead jump inside the box and see what
this thing is all about so this looks
like the power brick which you can
already tell it's about the size of some
quick-charge bricks for smartphones and
you can see here that you have a USB
type-c connector okay cool also in here
a USBC cable look at that look at that
little guy it's like slightly bigger
Nintendo DS XL whoa made out of aluminum
a solid aluminium brick there now the
version I have I believe is running
Windows but they do sell a version with
Linux as well and the price is somewhere
around 500 bucks which sounds kind of
expensive for something so tiny but
maybe that's the reason you want it so
far
first impressions here on build quality
very it's almost MacBook Eska that's
kind of funny
look at that look at this little guy it
also happens to have a touchscreen so
you can reach up and immediately
interface with it all right so as
mentioned USB 3 standard headphone
output HDMI output of the micro HDMI
variety and the USB type-c connector
which will also be used to charge the
unit let's go ahead and boot this up
alright so it's loading up Windows right
now Windows 10 it's not the brightest
screen I've ever seen you can tell like
with the white background you can kind
of get a better sense for how bright
it's gonna be so the display is actually
1920 by 1200 and that's in a 7 inch form
factor alright so here's some of the
specs on this unit specifically it has a
quad-core 1.6 gigahertz Intel Atom
processor 8 gigs of ram 128 gigabytes of
storage this is Gorilla Glass 3 on the
display I mentioned before it has a
of cooling the wait is under half a
kilogram at point four eight zero and
they're claiming a 12-hour battery life
with this lithium polymer battery that's
inside all right let's load up a video
here and get a sense for how it sounds
and what the video looks like I'll load
up and unbox therapy video let's just
make sure I'm running it at a high
resolution that's a pretty nice looking
display right there now let's go ahead
and hear the speaker while we're at it
seems to be muted right I mean the
speaker works but oh my goodness it's
it's quite tinny and of course you have
the headphone jack you've also got
bluetooth on here so that said though I
am impressed with the visual here the
actual video itself at 1080p I mean it's
it's probably above my expectations for
something so small so here's the thing
you're probably thinking okay so it has
a nice display
it's got good battery life so it's a
little maybe it is maybe I can't I can
just watch videos on the go but then why
do I need to I mean might I already got
a phone it has a huge display on and I
can watch videos on there but I think
the difference here is that this form
factor allows it to be propped up by
default no special equipment just
immediately in a form factor where you
can enjoy it while you're eating lunch
whatever it is that you do on an
airplane you have limited space pop this
thing open and because of the hinge you
can get the exact right angle to enjoy
your content now of course if that was
all it was you wouldn't have this
keyboard you wouldn't have a full PC so
I think what's happening here maybe it's
a multimedia focus for someone but can
they get a little bit of work done I
suppose that's possible but with a
keyboard this tiny I'm not sure how
that's gonna work out so let me do a
quick typing test here now one thing
that's strange me you do your hands bump
into each other this little pointer
thing obviously nowhere near as
effective as a trackpad now there's no
room for a track but how could they
possibly have gotten a trackpad in maybe
you could carry around a tiny little
mouse that's possible and then of course
you have the aspect of the touchscreen I
could reach up and touch it but that
seems so weird on such a small screen
look at this my finger is bigger than
any possible touch point let me like
look at that you have to be pretty
precise alright let's check out this
pocket ability real quick going to my
left pocket here regular pair of shorts
oh my goodness it's gone it is surely
pocketable now the question is but I use
this just kind of straight out of the
pocket with my thumbs that's something I
was curious about that
backspace lines up pretty well I say I
wanted to type unbox therapy you and Bo
X I can still thumb tight so maybe the
real move there is to just use touch and
your thumbs and now it's a truly
portable device Wow I can reach
everywhere in there look at that they've
really surprised me on the fit and
finish plus it technically does fit in
your pocket and I can't say that I've
ever put a laptop in my pocket I don't
think I'm gonna shift too many people
away from a dedicated laptop as a whole
but hey this might be useful to you plus
remember the power brick is tiny too
it's like a smartphone power brick
that's your whole travel setup right
there plus let's be honest your phone is
probably already USB type-c so now it's
one charger for both there are
sacrifices you're making here in
exchange for mega portability for
something that they've said is
pocketable full Windows 10 I suppose on
its own it's kind of impressive there
are plenty of things you can do with
Windows I mean you do almost anything
with Windows and that's kind of a step
up on the other things that might fit in
your pocket like a mobile device a
smartphone and so on there are some
things that you're still incapable of
doing on those platforms as far as set
of functions that you could fit in your
pockets this might represent it that
said you might be sitting there thinking
ok it's around 500 bucks I mean I could
get a laptop for 500 bucks and yes I
have to carry a backpack possibly or a
laptop sleeve but I'm gonna type better
I'm gonna get a bigger display that I
can watch things on I'm gonna get better
sound so yes it's for a very specific
group of people who need ultimate
portability and possibly the versatility
offered up by Windows alright so thank
you very much for sticking around to the
end of the video today we have a special
segment I don't know if this goes over
well we might continue this segment
inside a Q&amp;amp;A section where you guys can
ask me questions about anything I guess
may be related to a previous video
which was recently uploaded or maybe
related to nothing at all that I've ever
done and I don't know
it's up to you you ask a question I
answer it so I went out on Twitter last
night and I said hey at the end of
tomorrow's upload I will be including
some of your questions I'll probably
pick I don't know three and then I'll
answer them and maybe we'll do it all
over again if it goes well so here we go
let me load up my Twitter here and see
what some of those questions were all
right here's one from Zig our Trivedi
what do you think your audience's age
group is now this one's actually easy to
answer because I have analytics
available to me where I can check and
see what the age group of viewers is and
the majority are between the ages of 18
and 30 somewhere in that range and
mostly male in fact I think the
viewership is close to 95% male so if
you're not in that group if you're one
of the five percent of females watching
say hello in the comments down below
you're part of a very special group and
the 5% thank you okay here's another one
our H L asks what was your first
smartphone and this is kind of tough
because I'm not really sure what
constitutes a smartphone but I did have
a Palm Treo I don't know if you remember
that device it had the keyboard on it it
was kind of like a blackberry the
interface was similar but of course was
a palm product had that antenna that
stood up at the top now at the time
they're only there's a handful of
applications none of which were really
that great but it did sort of feel like
the future and then after that believe
it or not I had an Android device before
an iPhone I had the very first galaxy s
maybe there was an iPhone in between
there okay here's a question from CES
prinkle or C sprinkle and the question
is what is the most mind-blowing product
you've ever had on your channel this is
obviously tough because there's been so
many I don't know maybe like 1,500
videos or something like that it's
really hard to pinpoint over the entire
period of the channel the most
mind-blowing but there have been many
and a couple come to mind immediately
especially a fairly recent one which was
the DVLA phantom speaker if you haven't
seen that video you definitely need to
go and check it out it's a Bluetooth
speaker but the very unusual design it's
about this big can sit on a table and
can linked up to others it's very
spensive but it will blow you away if
you sit this closer you just like how is
that sound coming out of that package
it's true it is truly mind-blowing then
the other one that comes to mind is a
little bit older it was the unspeakable
cup this is a cup it's like a regular
travel mug it has some technology on the
bottom that stops it from tipping over
you can slap the thing all right you can
knock the thing of course if you really
want to knock it over you can but it's
very difficult to do so certainly if it
was accidental it would likely stay
standing up so if you have a hot coffee
in there if you look if you like to have
a drink near your computer or something
like this you can knock it over at the
time I was amazed you should go check
about that video as well if you want to
see me attempt to knock over a nun spill
of a cup I end up just slapping anyway I
don't want to spoil it go check that out
alright so there you go a little trial
run of the end of the video Q&amp;amp;A now you
guys can ask me whatever you want you
can ask me about this video the last
video any video any personal question is
completely up to you and you can leave
them here in the comments of this video
that you're watching right now because
I'm gonna come back to this video before
filming the next one and answer some
more questions at the end of the next
video that's a lot of words there but I
promise that I'll do it and hopefully
you guys enjoy this segment if you do
leave a thumbs up down below just to let
me know as well and there you go a
little bit more dialogue back and forth
hopefully I can give you guys some
useful info in this segment of the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
