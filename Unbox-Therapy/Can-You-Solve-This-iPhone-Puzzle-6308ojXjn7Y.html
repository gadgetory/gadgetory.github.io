for that next crazy gadget so that you
don't have to buy it so that like I do
and I tell you if it is worthwhile at
all or if it's just strictly crazy
unless you're into that guy like Jack
you never know what he's in it today is
one of those days is this thing right
here what does it paws look man I saw
this on Amazon I like the people need to
know cuz that pink whoops that's a word
I like to use called janky so when you
can't really describe why something is
off well that's off my friends that just
might be janky it's one of these camera
adapter situations for your iPhone which
gives you all these different lenses but
this one does so in some kind of puzzle
technique so today I've got the one for
the iPhone 5 5 s and se but they also
make it for the bigger phones the 6 and
so on on there there's a fisheye lens
telephoto is super wide a different wide
and a micro lens not macro ok
interesting it's all built into this
case on the back of the box they give
you a little example of what to expect
you see in this one like that's full
fisheye so you see the surroundings
there as well maybe this is the future
probably none ok oh I see that it also
has a tripod mount on it there we go
push the phone in side to side there's
also a cleaning cloth for the various
lenses oh haha you remember that game
there's a game like this when you're a
kid I guess if you need to quickly
switch between certain ones you're gonna
have to play the puzzle a little bit so
you go traveling and you want to pretend
that your smartphone is really a DSLR
this is one way to make sure it's all on
you at the same time what is this part
over here me whoa is that a USB
integrated 8 gigabyte memory stick to
store some of those extra photos you
took that's cool alright thank you
there's also a little tiny compartment
there secret compartment on what you can
put in there alright keep it legal a
little tripod mount listen you're a
professional now you're pointing this
thing at people get your tourist outfit
on
those hats you know the hat I'm talking
about with the vest you get the Hat you
get the vest and you're ready for
Disneyland you think you're cool right
now
in high school you got a certain look
going on you got all your friends you're
too cool for school but you know what's
in your future that hat that fast this
thing in Disneyland
get the rose gold iPhone se it's a
really tight fit when that thing is in
that's it that's a bit of a scary fit
well listen you're committed to the
cause here don't forget the Hat invest
what do I got here what should we kick
it off with your maybe this will be
better if I use the video mode there you
go
now I'm gonna slowly slide up one of
these and we ended up with the micro so
everything's out of focus where's the
focus point here let me use this little
card oh my god oh my it's right up
you're like touching and it's a huge
magnifier what do you guys got like a
coin coin to be cool anybody got a coin
Ryan you got no coins what do you broke
oh that's crazy this is like some
bizarro detail in there let's move to
the next one here so we're back to
normal
we switch to fisheye boom holy
wide-angle you see the whole area you
mean you even see Jack over there look
at them I need some meat on those bones
what are you for breakfast huh a cheerio
you know I mean like one cheerio get it
back to normal
I do throw a little zoom on there
beautiful I mean that one's pretty
straightforward you can easily
understand that no zoom zoom and that's
not digital that's optical that's an
optical adjustment now we're going into
my favourites which are just basically
wide lenses
I love wide angles I speak to you with a
wide-angle lens all the time so here we
go number one that's that's a nice
little adjustment right there see just a
little bit better field of view you want
to get all your friends in the frame
this is super wide so also also very
wide but not quite fisheye that might be
my new favorite right there that's my
new favorite nice and wide a little bit
of distortion ton of stuff in the frame
this is what I look at guys you know if
you think this job is easy I'm getting
fried by these babies all day you know
what this thing is this thing works does
the trick and it's all on you at the
Saints you could get creative maybe you
don't want to take the plunge into a
DSLR system maybe you want it all in one
package if you just want to embrace your
inner tourist and just get on with it
take that trip snap those photos have
those moments possibly change your life
this might be the way to do it</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
