another video and before we get into it
I want to mention an opportunity for two
people to come with me to Iceland for an
incredible tech experience you have no
idea what you're in for
click the link in the description all
the details are on my facebook page join
me on the ride of a lifetime so
sometimes things show up here and the
packaging is not magnificent this was in
like a plastic bag but that did not
affect my excitement now I'm going to
tell you what this this thing is in a
moment here but first I want to do a
little demonstration over here I got
some great Oh headphone great headphones
no problem here put them on you're
listening to music loving life then it's
getting late or you're on an airplane
you start to doze a little bit you know
any inevitably leaned up against
something when you're trying to got a
pillow you're not comfortable getting
stabbed right now nothing against these
headphones it's not what they're for
so I'm browsing around Amazon and I'm
like what's the solution for this is it
earbuds well here's the problem with
earbuds even the slimmest of earbuds you
put them in and you lay down and now
you're scabbing yourself in the ear
canal there's nothing worse than a sort
air canal so I found these they're
called sleep phones and the idea here is
it's like a headband with very slim
speaker units in it that are designed to
help you listen to whatever you like
while you're sleeping or while you're on
an airplane or while you're leaning up
against something trying to get
comfortable in fact the way they say it
is pajamas for your ears well let's give
it a shot
hmm so oh that's like there's like a
control area probably some electronics
there and then the the speaker units
appear to be one here in one here
guessing we do it like this what you
guys think about that look you're on the
airplane who cares what you look like
relax
getting a little warm right now similar
to the video where I had the giant
pillow on my head you know whose idea
that was
I didn't take this part off a little
twister there we go this is the moment
of truth and like I said expectations
super low here
listen to me they're not very loud
they're not gonna compete with your
earphones headphones earbuds some I like
about
of just being able to don't move around
you know you're not having to read make
any adjustments as you move around you
know what I just I just realized
something what if you go is this a
double look at that now I'm in the
double zone check me out
I don't know how much they are they're
not that expensive I remember I'll put a
link in the description sleep bones
catch a nap or two you're terrible this
is another example of something I love
more now than when I got it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
