many different bottles on the table
right now I'm wondering the same thing
every so often Jack calls me in here he
tells me we've got work to do and I'm
like you know I don't know what you're
talking about buddy and today this is
what I find personally I think the man's
got off the rails a little bit but what
did he do he emptied a bottle of Grey
Goose is that a man you can trust
didn't think so no seriously there's a
reason for this setup right now I've got
a product in front of me it's a
Kickstarter right now as I understand it
they sent me an early prototype it's
there's not even any packaging here this
is the unit it's called the cork and
this little guy turns any bottle into a
Bluetooth speaker never even knew that
would be something the humans would want
apparently it's interesting in fact
their Kickstarter already passed the
goal so this unit can fit on top of any
bottle just like that boom and now that
bottle becomes a speaker you're confused
I'm confused Jack's always confused it
looks like a Bluetooth speaker to a
certain extent but then it's got these
strange little adapters on it the
speaker unit can work with various
different types of bottles so this tip
here would obviously go on a bottle like
this this other one is slightly more
flexible and that goes on usually taller
bottles anyway it doesn't really matter
you don't need to worry about it because
when you get the product it comes with
both and they're kind of attached like
this this thing charges up via microUSB
it uses bluetooth and has a single
button on the front should be good for
about 12 hours of battery life now why
would you want this instead of a
traditional Bluetooth speaker the idea
here is that this is way more portable
right it fits in your pocket in most
environments there's a bottle somewhere
these things there are always in our
lives so they're calling it something
what did they call it upcycling instead
of recycling like you're upgrading the
functionality of a bottle maybe you've
got a favorite bottle sitting around but
the point being is that there's also
kind of a custom component in the sense
that you can find a bottle
that you think gives you the best sound
or the most fun night you see it comes
in a couple of different colors black
white silver and look this this kind of
burgundy which is perfect for the wine
connoisseur in your life I can see you
already you're at that party going no no
no no no I'll be handling the music this
evening and everybody's like how does it
sound
this thing is this all worthwhile find
out next time on a press and hold for a
couple seconds it's in pairing mode
time for some tunes I got to connect to
this baby real quick ok so it's a
speaker on its own very directional
though grab the great goose whoa
the bottle adds the pace without the
bottle again with the bottle somehow
what ends up happening here is that the
low frequencies get amplified with the
added resonance of a chamber in this
case a glass bottle now I notice on this
Grey Goose bottle that they actually
drilled a hole out a port on it this is
like DIY speaker scenario here that one
has a little more crispy news to it
right out of the port it does work as
advertised it certainly gets an added
kick and amplification from a bottle
plus you get to be that cool kid that
just shows everybody that you could turn
their bottle into a speaker they're
sitting there you're like you know I can
make that a speaker and they're like
excuse me and you're like pass it over
quick rinse booyah
bingo now you sell the party it's going
to have way more low-end than a
Bluetooth speaker of comparable size
that doesn't have this added
functionality for sure everyone's got
some fresh new ideas on what to do in
this space
turn any bottle into a speaker be the
champion show the people what's up let
me tell you you can't do it do it
somos vos bottle speakers for gays Grey
Goose for Jax</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
