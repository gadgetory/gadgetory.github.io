another video and today we are going to
be checking out what might be the most
highly regarded high-end set of
headphones on planet Earth these are the
legendary HD 800 from sennheiser there's
a link in the description so you can
check them out but just be warned little
bit pricey but hey on the bleeding edge
when you're looking at f1 cars you don't
expect to pay Honda Civic prices do you
dislike the f1 car so we're gonna listen
together you and I but it's not just
about the headphones I've also got a
special amplifier which is tuned to be
paired with the HD 800 2h DVD 800
sennheiser you know the deal these guys
are at the top of the game and have been
forever with a German name like that I
mean who knows they're sitting around
testing tinkering twisting let's start
with the headphones you can tell this is
a giant box they're giant headphones
when you have big drivers on each year
it's gonna be big also these are meant
for at home listening Oh
Oh try and take that all in try like
absorb what that might mean to you think
I like the satin in here that's some
Terminator looking stuff right there oh
manufacturing number as well as made in
Germany it's all about sort of angling
the transducer on the inside keeping the
back open quarter-inch termination point
here and an incredibly thick durable
cable you're listening to this on
headphones that in most cases have been
tuned dynamically to give you contrast
to the impression of dynamics a
headphone like this is aiming to
reproduce as accurately as possible the
original recording so what Sennheiser
has here an amp to sort of back up the
transparency associated with these
particular headphones wow you got the
window here a number of different ways
to interface with the amp as you can see
analog ins analog outs who's better than
you right now okay so I've got like a
basic turntable over here and I've got
some records Black Sabbath super 8 J
Dilla
Black Sabbath paranoid unbelievable
alright says war pigs
can I get deep with you for a minute
first up that's the longest period of
time I've ever spent here and unbox
therapy with my mouth shut I knew there
was a video happening I went somewhere
else for a minute seriously when you set
it up like this you get the vinyl out
get the amplifier you get yourself a
nice set of headphones part of it is
about the ritual everybody's saying oh
vinyl hipsters I can't tell the
difference give me my mp3 all right I
feel you it's about the whole package I
mean think about it when's the last time
you even sat down and listened to a song
that length straight through about doing
anything else not on your computer not
cleaning dirty dishes I mean you just
you just sat there you shift your
commitment and you start to look at
things a little bit differently maybe in
a slightly old-school fashion where the
kind of critical listening you're doing
the attention your pain and ultimately
your evaluation of the music changes
based on them do I sound like an old man
right now maybe I felt like I was in the
studio seriously I felt like I was with
Ozzy Osbourne felt like Jack was Ozzy
Osbourne awareness that's the word I
want to use awareness
you just feel aware of everything that's
happening there's a lot of separation
between the various instrumental
components another one that showed up in
the mail it's called super ape
I'm visualizing I have a very like warm
warm feeling inside them
next up J Dilla I'm hearing in some of
that instrumentation of the slightly
more clarity more definition what can I
say to you that it's not going to be for
everybody but you have the means and the
love of music and you want to interpret
it possibly closer to the way the artist
intended it's hard to imagine getting
closer than where I just go</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
