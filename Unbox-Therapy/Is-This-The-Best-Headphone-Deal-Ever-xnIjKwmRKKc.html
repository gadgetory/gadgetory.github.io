the reason why is because I'm about to
hit you with a deal a crazy deal
depending on how aware you are of how
legendary this set of headphones in
front of me actually is so recently
master I've got in touch with me and he
said we got these new headphones that
are coming out we would love for you to
make a video I said let's do it they're
called the HD 6x X and what they are is
a reissue a remake of retail on the
legendary HD 650 from Sennheiser now if
you don't know about those headphones
they sort of started this movement into
the audiophile style headphone being
accessible and available in the average
person's home open back listening around
the ear cup design that was the HD 650
and HD 650 people are still buying them
all the time between four and five
hundred dollars that said mass drop they
were like let's team up with Sennheiser
and we think we can do it a step better
we're gonna make a few small tweaks and
we're gonna hit the people with a far
better price what is that price Jack
$200 limited availability 2 HD 6 xx this
is gonna be a $200 reference class
headphone Wow a nice box n hyzer box to
keep them in oh look at those babies if
you've ever seen the 650s before you
know they weren't this color but now
there's this like deep blue kind of
coloring here and look at these nice
giant ear cups on this that's what I
love I want it to be all the way around
the ear look how deep that pocket is
there now I've talked about it in the
past the advantages have been opened
back generally speaking this gives you a
wider perception of sound the ambience
and the room almost has a personality if
you want to lean back and get the
ultimate experience at least in my
opinion you probably want something open
back and that's exactly what these are
for what for 200 another thing I'm
noticing straight away is how
lightweight these are these are made in
Ireland that's interesting and
course adjustable as you see here the
branding so that you know it's a mass
drop exclusive collaboration you can see
the mass drop logo in that location over
there so the previous version had a much
longer cable which is great for at home
listening but not so useful when you're
on the go they took the ten-foot cable
from the 650 and turned it into a
six-foot cable in this case the other
thing they've done for on-the-go
listening is giving you a native mini
jack termination for a 3.5 millimeter
instead of the 6.3 millimeter quarter
inch jack which used to be the default
termination on the 650 so when your
phone is in your pocket yes you can now
connect these directly to your phone it
looks like these have detachable cables
let's just verify that yes they do
they're headphones what are we here for
me we gotta test these babies out I've
got a turntable in a tube amp but then
I'm gonna do the unthinkable I'm gonna
take these beautiful headphones and plug
them directly into my phone and see what
happens whoo-hoo let's just let's just
listen to some music real quick no big
deal
if you've never listened to an open-back
headphones before there seems to be a
lot of detail surrounding each
independent instrument this idea of
having a lot of space for each one of
those instruments to breathe
look at that vinyl right there that
beauty $200 are you kidding me they
claim I can go ahead and chuck these
babies straight into my phone so here we
go let me tell you something your
mileage is gonna vary on this depending
in the power of the amplifier on your
particular device for me it's like these
are these are beauty headphones right
you're gonna want to get the most out of
them so even on a mobile device I
probably recommend some sort of small
pocket amplifier just to put a little
bit of oh just to put a little more
juice on the wire because once you heard
it like this you kind of wish that's
what you ended up having on the mobile
as well you know what I'm saying and
that's the unique scenario with the HD
6x X and I know a lot of people wish
that they could step up to that
different style of listening experience
and believe me this is a this is a
totally different thing from that pair
of beats that you see sitting on a shelf
at the local Apple store it's not the
same thing in the 200 bucks it's just
might need these in your life I'm just
gonna jump back to Highline Miami real
quick cuz that's just I just want to go
out like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
