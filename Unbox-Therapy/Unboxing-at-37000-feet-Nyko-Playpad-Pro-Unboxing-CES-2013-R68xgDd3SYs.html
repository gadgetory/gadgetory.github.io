therapy and today I've got a very
special video for you this is the
world's first unboxing video that takes
place at 37,000 feet up on an airplane
so definitely smash that thumbs up
button down below here you can see I've
got my trusty plastic blade in order to
get into this box right here which is
the Play Pad Pro from nyko actually been
very excited about this device and
something interesting here that we
actually got our first look at this
device at CES last year this year we're
coming back with the actual controller
if you guys are unfamiliar with it it's
a wireless controller for your tablet or
smartphone it'll work on Android or iOS
and it'll allow for you to have an
analog more traditional input for some
of your games they say that it works
with thousands of titles here you can
see again it'll work with Android and
you can remap the regular touch controls
that occur on your tablet or your phone
in order to correspond with the buttons
the tactile buttons that exist on this
controller it has a rechargeable battery
inside as well so you're going to be
able to play wirelessly without having
to have it plugged in or tethered to the
wall in any way that's kind of important
so getting inside the box it's actually
pretty simple unboxing you've got a
little bit of paperwork from Nyko and
that's just gonna tell you how to get up
and running with your device how to get
it paired it uses Bluetooth technology
to pair up to your phone I mean pretty
much every smartphone has bluetooth so
that's not really an issue same as every
tablet we did test it out with the iPad
Mini and it worked on the iOS side it'll
mostly only work with iCade games so
games that are specifically catered for
tactile controls but on the Android side
there's an app that allows you to get
you know really specific about how you
want to map the buttons from a number of
popular titles so as you can see here
you have two analog thumb sticks as well
as your d-pad you've got your
traditional triggers on the back as well
your shoulder buttons there's a microUSB
port that's what's going to be used to
charge up the device you can also see
there's some LED indicators there to let
you know what the status of the
controller is and on the back you have
to select which mode you want to put the
controller into depending on if you want
to use it with iCade or if you want to
use it with the app on Android etc so as
you guys can tell pretty simple unboxing
here one
keep it simple for such an unusual space
to be unboxing and this is definitely
not my studio I'm on the tray table here
as I said before at 37,000 feet here you
see the micro USB cable that's the only
other thing in the package so anyway
guys I hope you appreciated me taking a
risk and doing this up in the air please
leave a thumbs up down below and stay
tuned for all the awesome CES 2013
coverage coming at you real soon all
right later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
