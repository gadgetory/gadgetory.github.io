therapy comm and this is a little bit of
an unusual one for us today we're taking
a look at the Dyson air multiplier and
if you're wondering what the hell is an
air multiplier it is a fancy ass name
for a fan but this isn't really a fan I
mean it does what a fan does but it does
so in an untraditional way without any
blades and supposedly that's going to
give you a different experience than
what a traditional fan would give you
instead of getting an intermittent sort
of a breeze this is going to give you a
direct and streamlined breeze anyway
we'll try and get it out of the box here
and see if it stands up to all the
expectations after all this is not a
cheap fan help here it goes for around
400 bucks so I mean I doubt that it's
worth that I doubt that most people
would consider it worthwhile but the
fact of the matter is this is more than
just a fan from the standpoint that it's
a conversation piece I mean when it's
standing on your shelf or whatever
you're going to put it people are going
to ask how the hell does that thing work
it's really a feat of engineering and an
interesting product on its own whether
it blows it not but anyway getting back
to the unboxing here we've got two
components now I'm probably not going to
try and assemble this thing on camera it
might be a bit of a blooper reel but
we'll take a look at the two parts that
come in the package the first is this
airfoil it kind of looks like a turbine
on the side of an airplane minus the
turbine portion just the front side of
it but uh don't ask me to explain to you
from a technical sense just how this
thing operates basically it appears like
it sucks air in through it and blows it
out in a straight stream and that's as
much as I want to understand at this
point after all this is not the Science
Channel the next component we have is
the actual motor and I believe this
takes some of its technology from
Dyson is learned in their vacuum
cleaners after all that's what they're
most widely known for so there's some
sort of a cyclone in here now this is
actually adjustable as well so you can
direct the fan up or down and it'll also
pivot so we can spin around the room
kind of like those old-fashioned fans
you might remember that did the same
thing here's what the fan looks like in
operation it's a really cool looking
thing and some it almost looks like a
sci-fi kind of a device if you just saw
it in a house you might not know right
away that it's a fan but as you can see
it adjusts up and down here it is one
way and then the other and you can
actually have it adjusted while it's
pivoting on the front you have your
power button your intensity knob as well
as your toggle switch to toggle the
pivot on and off anyway this has been an
unusual one but I hope you guys enjoyed
it after all it's a pretty interesting
device</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
