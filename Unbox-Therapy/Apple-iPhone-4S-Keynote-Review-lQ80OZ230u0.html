about to tell you everything that you
need to know about the new iPhone 4s
believe it or not there was a ton of
hype probably too much hype because this
device is probably more similar to the
iPhone 4 than it is to say an iPhone 5
that people were predicting we might get
today so first and foremost the price
you're gonna see the same price point as
the previous generation and you're going
to see a price drop on the older
generation so the iPhone 4 as it was
will still be sold but now it'll be at
$99 along with a carrier contract
instead of the previous one $1.99 but
you're gonna see a slight hit in the
storage you're gonna have 8 gigabytes of
storage instead of 16 now you're getting
a new processor so internally I suppose
you could say this one is significantly
different the new processor claims to be
quite a bit faster better graphics
performance etc they're calling it the
Apple a5 instead of the a4 which makes
sense the new incarnation of course the
next thing is a much better camera from
watching the live blog and taking a look
at some of the technology there they've
added a few extra megapixels but then
you've also got an improvement in the
sensitivity of the sensor so you've got
an 8 megapixel camera now instead of the
previous 5 and very excited to see
results of that once this thing actually
hits next we've got an improvement in
video performance of that same camera
it's gonna be able to shoot at 1080p
instead of 720p it'll do so at 30 frames
per second and you know Apple has said
in their in their keynote that they're
really going after the camera market
they're not worried about necessarily
being the best camera on a smartphone
but that they think this new camera can
really compete against proper pointed
shoots will we'll have to wait and see
if that's the truth the next thing that
is actually kind of surprising is that
this one is actually a little bit
heavier than the previous model and some
have suggested that's because this one
is a legitimate world phone it's got
both gsm and cdma antennas in it
internally so pretty cool stuff most of
what the the other things that got
mentioned
in the keynote we're relating to
software improvements in iOS 5 that
being the new operating system but I'm
not really going to cover those in this
particular video only because most of
those features and functions are going
to be available to people on the older
hardware so really all that we've seen
in some very minor tweaks to the
hardware nothing you know shattering and
so you know I guess if you were sitting
around waiting for some major
announcement some major iPhone 5
redesign etc then this might be
disappointing to you but Apple does have
a point in saying that the iPhone 4 is
incredibly successful and it does do
many things right
they've also claimed to you know fix
that antenna issue it was supposedly
widespread I've met people who have
experienced the issue and others who
haven't you know it's sort of up in the
air no pun intended but they claim to
have improved it by allowing for antenna
switching so that the antenna can pick
between which and antenna has better
reception so if one happens to be
covered by your hand then automatically
the phone will select the other antenna
as far as as far as trying to receive
signals so pretty cool stuff but I gotta
say I'm a little bit underwhelmed but
you don't have to worry I'm gonna pick
up this phone anyways it's gonna be
featured here on the channel so
definitely you're gonna want to hit that
subscribe button up above I'll put an
annotation over here too because the day
that it hits the moment that it comes
out I'll be with you the whole way and
I'll give you the highest quality
unboxing review and comparison that is
humanly possible so anyway guys as
always thanks for watching and I hope
you stick around the channel I hope you
subscribe as I said I got a lot of
coverage on this phone coming up we can
find out if it is as underwhelming as it
seems at the moment or if this new
processor is seriously a big improvement
alright guys see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
