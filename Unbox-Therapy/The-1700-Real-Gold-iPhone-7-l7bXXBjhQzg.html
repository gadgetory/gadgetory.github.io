fired up about a new iPhone a red iPhone
fancy and flashy and all of that it's a
red iPhone but here's the thing there's
an iPhone color out there there's an
iPhone style that isn't quite as
well-known it's a custom approach to the
most luxurious iPhone possible because
as we know it's about the status it's
about letting people know that you
couldn't be caught using just a regular
everyday iPhone like this one look at
this weight you see them everywhere how
can you feel special about a plain black
iPhone you probably can now this thing
isn't cheap to begin with 256 gigabyte 7
plus but the thing is a guy like you or
a girl like you you got money burning
holes in your pockets where did that
singing come from the money is burning
holes in the pockets like why is the
money hot why is it burning you're
looking for something unique let the
world know that you're not like everyone
else well today I might have the
solution to your problem and you
couldn't tell that right away by looking
at this box see this looks the same as
the iPhone I just showed you over there
but that's not what's in here and if you
take a peek around this you can already
tell something's a little bit off me
says 256 gigabytes that's good but what
you're probably noticing is that this
wrapper on the outside well that's not
how I phones look coming from the Apple
Store now the reason that this thing is
wrapped up this way is because someone
has already been inside this box and
that's what you're here to find out
about all right here we go
does it make any sense probably not but
it's my first time ever looking at an
iPhone like this
oh this my friends is not like any
iPhone you've seen before because it's
gold look at that and I'm not saying
like gold like it's got the little
champagne tint
I'm not saying gold like rose gold I'm
saying gold like gold the gold rush the
Klondike the Klondike bar why was it
called a Klondike bar these guys this
company they take a regular iPhone 7 or
7 plus and they played it as you can see
in 24 karat gold what would have been an
iPhone like this which as you can see no
longer looks like that the only thing
maintained on the back in black is the
antenna lines and I assume that's
because those portions probably art
metallic possibly the plating on the
Apple logo is a mirrored finish
everywhere else it's kind of a matte
finish the buttons as well as the SIM
tray have their own plating on them as
well 24 karat gold the life of luxury
otherwise known as the life of Jack
inside the box it looks like they
included everything else this is
something that a few different people do
there is surprisingly a demand for this
even at this price point so this year is
about 1700 bucks this is about a
thousand or 970 retail a substantial
increase in price for some real gold to
be in your hands I'm gonna put it up I
want to make sure that this is all legit
I'm actually noticing something
interesting here if I flip it back over
if you look at the font here on the
iPhone looks a little different than the
font here this is a bit more bold but
part of me wonders if when the plating
goes on if they have to maybe re stencil
yeah we made it
yeah okay so it is the 256 gigabyte
these guys are legit if what you've
always wanted in your life is a 24 karat
gold iPhone 7 7 plus because you want to
feel like some kind of sultan some kind
of King you know who has Conor McGregor
actually does have a golden iPhone have
you seen it cuz you forgot what you get
to do with the
Golden iPhone is you get to go in the
mirror like this and snap a photo of
yourself like casually like you're not
trying to imply that you have a 24 karat
gold iPhone that you're just it's no big
deal I'm actually it's actually just a
picture of me in the mirror you see like
oh just that's how you win Instagram
would you rather fight Conor McGregor in
an MMA match or Floyd Mayweather in a
boxing match you know what it's a pretty
nice job here they did is it worth it
guy like Jack maybe to me probably not
to be honest you could do a lot of
things with $700 go on a vacation like
Kong the $2,000 gold-plated iPhone 7
plus where did you hear about it unbox
therapy that's where huh boom</div></body></html>
