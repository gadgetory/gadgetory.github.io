internet and you know me alright I gotta
go out of my way to try to get it cuz
it's so weird
somebody somewhere who saw the meme on
Instagram and was like I'm gonna build
that and that's what happened here this
my friends is the home button for iPhone
10 an adapter that brings back your home
button if you just if you're feeling
nostalgic if you feel like you miss it
this is an insane product for insane
people you're gonna have this dongle on
there just to protect just to get the
home button back now you have a giant
dongle it's not just the home button
it's also got a headphone jack and a
charge port on it I should just open
this up support listen music and charge
at the same time support new iOS eleven
point two point one no need app just
plug and play then they go on to show an
iPad there so I think it's a software
thing if you have a lightning port you
would hope that this thing will work now
don't be deceived by this golden ring
around the outside this is no touch ID
that might be cool in the gunman Bay
there
wait a minute this sounds like rock
and/or roll so anyway here's the moment
of truth we plug in the little adapter
here do we get a prompt to anything does
it say anything to me the question is
does it work let's try a a double tap
for multitask
what do you say well hey so let's say
I'm in Safari alright then I want to go
home boo Aliexpress what's the price
oh so it's 20 bucks but I I mean you get
the adapters anyhow I don't know why you
would you would really have to miss the
home button to justify purchasing this
you don't want a dongle dangling
dangling dongle but I mean it functions
it does the multitask and it'll take
your home some headphones here let's see
if those are functioning correctly oh
it's a little uh it's a little wobbly so
let's see if it works my volume is
locked at 4 it what's that about it's
working oh there I don't know why I can
adjust it now okay yep
okay we got headphones now can we charge
it as well the old charge and listen
charging listening so I guess in the
case of this adapter here at least you
get the novelty of the home button it's
kind of funny you know your friends are
like you don't have a home button on
your phone anymore and you do and you're
like oh yeah I'll bet you a hundred
bucks that I have a home button on my
iPhone 10 and they're like no you don't
and then now you got a hundred because
you won the bet and so this thing was
free it's a novelty thing it's a funny
thing I'm glad there are factories that
can look at a meme on an Instagram page
and turn that into a product that can
look at an iPhone 10 and say you know
what you want the home button we're
gonna give you the home button no matter
how ridiculous it is
you got the home button back you're
charging you're listening and you got
the home button like a real enthusiast
this episode of unbox the P has been
brought to you by mass drop and the new
force II dc-3 which just dropped on
their site and is available for a few
more days these are in ear monitors that
are a hundred bucks but perform in the
same neighborhood as much more expensive
in-ear monitors inside the box earbuds
themselves and the first thing you're
going to notice is this cool braided
cable which likely is not going to
tangle as easily give this translucent
blue shell a removable cable as well if
you do need to replace this one you can
do that without needing to throw out the
entire earbud I noticed as well they've
included a carrying case and there's
another cable in there also
now this cable here also has a
microphone as well as a button for play
pause and in order to answer phone calls
hang up and whatnot
so I've got some foam tips a couple of
different sizes and also silicone tips
so you can figure out which one fits
best and is most comfortable for you so
it's got a lexan polycarbonate
translucent dark blue shell high
resolution balanced armature drivers
high quality earpiece designed for
ultimate sonic performance that's a
comfy earbud I'll drop a link down in
the description just remember this drop
is limited so you will run out of time
eventually so if you want to check these
