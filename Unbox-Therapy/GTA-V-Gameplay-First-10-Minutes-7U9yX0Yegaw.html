15 minutes of the newly released GTA 5
wanted to give you guys a little bit
more information than you're used to
here on unbox therapy so here it is a
little bit of gameplay I don't know
maybe we'll serve off the controller at
five minutes or I don't know well I
don't know what we're gonna do but let's
just start playing add a game it took a
while to install there was a bit of an
update or what the hell was that will be
it was just an installation this I think
it was like eight gigs or something
hey gig so what was like half an hour
before you can start playing yeah that's
unlike that what was that other tip you
told me that you read online um don't
install your play disk because if you do
then it's probably gonna like a game
yeah where'd you read that
Potocki okay Kotaku that's like the
legit source yeah apparently there's
some issues with installing your play
disk right now that way yeah if you want
to if you want to play with like the fan
off just install it with the USB a good
USB and that's it work yeah words of
wisdom
Willy dude there you go so guys this is
just a quick little demo I don't know 10
or 15 minutes of the the first little
bit of the game just to give you a
better idea but we might be doing some
more extensive gameplay videos over on
my second channel which you should go
subscribe to right now which is called
the beast feed and I will link it down
in the description that's where our
podcasts go up you should check those
out too but maybe we'll play a little
bit of GTA 5 now as well because we've
got the game we're both big fans and I
don't know we got a pretty cool setup
over here so we figured we'll do a
little bit of gaming you guys have asked
for it for a while alright so here we go
the beginning what did I say where are
we
all right look alive back right here oh
they're giving us a little demo radar
shows where we're at some kind of
robbery go to the guard some kind of
cold environment based on the outfit
move now moving very quickly will do shy
open fire all right about this guy
couldn't they have moved a little faster
I mean look at these automatic weapons
these guys are you still sick man no
matter what's real or not it bring up
the phone
got it you're like the natural dude
well I got to do trigger to trigger it
you got slack please what here we go
detonate yeah what am i blowing here oh
I got you the stage yeah okay perfect
time to get some of that cash money
when I get through here oh sweet look
just as fast as this guy can move for
now or what I think if you tap a I think
it might work
yeah that's a little faster holding hold
good
yeah it's faster bear with me here guys
haven't played this series in a long
damn time
alright here we go listen to that
soundtrack will you do you feeling that
soundtrack gets you amped up

where audience see this guy ran away
happy
it is a bad idea sure you go around is
this a bad idea right now I'm is a bad
idea right now billing it though
I don't think so I'm peaking out too
much man a bad idea right now I think
you know when when when my color changes
a little bit I'm getting a hit right I
think slow with your screen turns red
yeah hit things so that's the universal
I'm getting hit right the screen
changing color where this game plays
good
more cops yeah these cops it seems like
some kind of small town but the cops are
legit lots of cops and lots of 30 coats
and pretty cool old ass cop cars
holy crap alright action-packed

probably see me and shoot me anyway some
cups 10 minutes if you guys want to see
