going to be taking you on the official
office tour you've been waiting for it
for a long time and today you finally
get a chance to take a closer look at
the brand new unbox therapy headquarters
we have everything set up so you can
check out how we work and also how we
relax we have a gaming setup in there
and everything else so come along for
the ride and I'll give you guys a closer
look
so this is the lounge area at the unbox
therapy headquarters and as you can tell
this is where the lounging takes place
is where people relax take a little
break or even have to work maybe play
some games etc so as you can see over
here on the far side this is the anchor
of the whole space it's my 55 inch flat
panel from Samsung I did a video on it
you can go check that out if you haven't
seen it yet I will link all the products
mentioned in this video down in the
description so the description is your
friend go and check it out but anyways
we got the 55 inch flat panel really
nice panel below it some better speakers
because you know flat panels aren't the
greatest at pre producing audio so this
is the JBL I believe it's the SB 200 i'm
ight be wrong but huh anyways it's a
surround sound like speaker that outputs
a virtualization of surround sound so a
small package yet it still sort of feels
like sound is coming at you from a
number of different directions I've got
a little bit of storage down below
and a couple of other items down here
this is a little PC that I made a while
ago mini ITX PC as we move across you
can see in this case this bookcase /
cabinet that I recently put in we've got
on display some of the different
products and product boxes of things
that have been featured on the channel
some stuff that hasn't been featured yet
some stuff you'll recognize for sure you
can see in here we got the ps3 box the
BlackBerry z10 box or z10 if you're in
the US some headphones we have all the
Nexus devices as well you can see
there's the box for the Nexus S the
Galaxy Nexus the Nexus 4 of course we've
also got the new wireless charging orb
there's some iPhone boxes up above that
and then down here you can see my
MacBook Box there's the latest iPad box
I mean really so many boxes here is the
head from the Killzone 3 Helghast
Edition that's an unboxing from a long
time ago still a really cool thing to
put on display and as we move down a
little bit further you'll see some
consoles this this is the PlayStation 3
and white of course the super slim model
and then we've also got the dns-323 from
d-link that's a backup device which is
networked you can stick two hard drives
in there
then all the computers in the office
space can access those hard drives for
backup or for file-sharing etc the
Nintendo Wii U is also in here and then
as we move down a little bit further
you'll see the brand-new receiver this
is an on keel receiver full details like
I said before and the linkage will be
down in the description and the idea
here is that I've got all the HDMI
from these different devices feeding
into the receiver so then I can only
send one nice clean HDMI to the
television so I don't have to be worried
about having a big mess right in front
of the TV you've also got the limited
edition Xbox 360 down there the halo 4
limited edition console which also came
with the game of course that's also down
in that location in case you guys missed
it so that's one of my favorite designs
on the Xbox 360 it's got that kind of
translucent design so everything will be
hooked up shortly but I did want to get
this office tour out to you guys so this
is just sort of a first look at some of
the items inside of the new office space
moving up you can see some of the
statues they're called figurines action
figures whatever you want to call them
these are the guys that ship with all
those collector's editions that have
been featured on unbox therapy in the
past we've got of course stuff from
Uncharted we've got stuff from infamous
we've got stuff from Ghost Recon
Killzone Max Payne over here Batman
Gears of War as you move along a little
bit more sass ins Creed so lots of
different game franchises represented
through the statues that come with those
limited and collector's edition box sets
that unbox therapy is famous for
featuring of course and as we move down
in this cabinet on the other side you
can see some other items some other
boxes as well we've got you know the
call of duty modern warfare 3 special
edition console the special edition
controllers and the game and the 320 gig
hard drive the system is actually still
in there not in use at the moment we are
using the controllers and we will use
that one shortly there's also a box to
the camera I use the Canon 60d which is
a very popular camera for video makers
here on YouTube and then as I open this
case up a little bit more you can see
some of the some of the stuff that isn't
so pretty that we have to store like our
different tools and stuff
far down at the bottom and then of
course more boxes have the tournament
stick the street fighter tournament
stick up there as well as the Sony 3d
viewer this is the personal 3d viewer so
that you can lay back on the couch and
get really an incredible 3d experience
if you guys missed that video you should
definitely check it out and more details
on that or down in the description as
well the last thing to mention on the
far side over here is where all the
games are this is a special sort of game
case so it's a really easy way to store
all of them we've got some PlayStation 3
games at the top who knows what the new
consoles coming out you know we'll
probably have to make a couple more
shells for all the new games that come
out too
there's also some Wii U games down at
the very bottom as you move down and a
couple of blu-rays but a pretty good
collection so the other thing to mention
over in this corner right here is our
mini-fridge which is very important
because you know people get thirsty
working up here in the HQ and this is
where we keep all of our beverages right
now we've got pretty much one no two
beverages you can either have water or
an imported beer not I shouldn't say
these are all imported most of them are
imported I told will to go pick up some
beers a couple days ago and I said
listen if you can't pronounce the name
on the side of the tall can then buy it
because that's that's what we're looking
for so anyways
lots of imported tall cans in here so
hey if you want one here you go there
you go for you I'm just kidding on top
here we have the g27 race wheel this is
world famous race wheel of course and
whenever you know we're playing playing
some racing games we can pull that baby
out and set it up but it kind of lives
here on display when it's not in use we
also got the new leather couch brand-new
red leather couch I've been saying that
we're going to get a couch in this space
for a while and the guys have you know
been nagging me about it saying Lou we
got nowhere to sit nowhere to chill so
we picked up this couch it's pretty cool
look I think and it makes the space
quite a bit more welcoming and as we
move along over here this is where the
controllers live as well as some other
sort of general storage but you guys
have seen the special controller video
by now so you've already seen most of
these in detail but this is the drawer
they live in so when you're playing a
game whatever it's really easy to reach
over grab an extra control
for somebody else whether it be Xbox
Playstation the Nintendo Wii U or
otherwise so that's a quick look at the
lounge now let's move over to my actual
work setup so this is my work setup you
can see it's dominated by the 27-inch
display this is the cinema display
thunderbolt display whatever you want to
call it sports a large resolution of
course 2560 in terms of pixels across
well above 1080p so it's going to mean a
lot of work space for me you know I'm
doing a lot of web stuff a lot of video
stuff so having a little bit of
workspace is always a good thing you've
also got my microphone right over here
this is a broadcast quality mic full
specs are down in the description like
everything else but this is what makes
me sound beautiful it is the
electro-voice r e 20 and it's
specifically designed for spoken word so
for broadcast etc so it works really
well for all my voiceovers and all the
voice work that I do also the
world-famous xB 500 s from Sony which
I'm always talking about an incredible
value
Stoopid comfortable of course I mean
that in a good way they're really light
I could do a little fashion show for you
guys check that out they're not the
prettiest looking headphones but who
cares because if you're like me you
spend a lot of your day with headphones
on your head and comfort is probably
more important than anything else so I'm
a big fan of these they're incredibly
affordable I'll link them down in the
description if you can still find these
you have to pick them up incredible
value we've also got the - keyboard this
is the Mac version so you have your Mac
Keys on here like your command key etc
it's a mechanical keyboard so it helps
me get work done faster of course you
know most people feel that mechanical
keyboards are far more precise when
they're typing out long emails you've
also got my audio interface down here
I'm a big fan of this audio interface
it's the Apogee one it's a USB interface
and has really high-quality analog to
digital converters so what that means is
that when you speak you're speaking in
an analogue way and it's up to your
interface to then turn that into digital
information Apogee has some of the best
converters out there and this one's
amazing because it's in such a small
form-factor it's portable I can take it
with me on trips and still keep that
high
quality audio when I send my broadcast
quality mic into that interface there's
no point in having a good mic if you
don't have a good interface to receive
that audio signal you've also got my
MacBook Pro over here that's at the
heart of the entire setup that's still
what I'm running today as my main laptop
this of course is a 2011 late 2011 model
but I did so many upgrades to it and I
customized it in so many ways that I
just didn't want to say goodbye to it
you know I replaced the optical drive
with a hard drive and I also replaced
the traditional hard drive with an SSD
you can see the entire operation in a
video hopefully I can link that as well
so many links in the description you
must check the description but anyways
it is of course my trusty macbook pro
that has not let me down 15 inch of
course and as far as far as specs go it
is a quad core so it's it's fairly
snappy when it comes to video work if I
have to do video work on it you've also
got my favorite Mouse on the planet it
is the performance MX from Logitech I
say it's my favorite just because of the
ergonomics you know the way that it fits
into my hand also the number of buttons
I'm a big fan of using you know expose
and and spotlight and a number of other
things in Mac OS 10 so this makes things
a little bit easier I don't have to
reach for my keyboard beside that you
can see an iPad Mini which I'm probably
using more than any other tablet right
now
I have the Smart Cover in red a lot of
people did this red on black sort of
selection when it came to the Smart
Cover on the iPad Mini so that that I'm
usually more than any other tablet right
now I think mainly because the battery
life is so amazing and also for some
reason just because you know I'm not
reaching for the larger ones maybe
because I spent so much time on the
computer with a larger screen anyways I
don't really know moving along a little
further you can see my nexus for my
daily driver in terms of smartphones
it's sitting on top of the wireless
charging orb so for those of you that
were wondering why you'd want a wireless
charger it's because I just strictly
pull it off like this and then just
place it back down throughout the day I
never forget to do so that's just where
the device lives and it's always
charging because of that so a really
cool sort of way to keep your phone in
an upright position in the
Doc's orders position so you can see
notifications text messages etc coming
in but you're still charging at the same
time on a nice little base like that
without the need to no wiggle with the
little microUSB that I'm not a huge fan
of so it is a convenience thing and it
is overpriced but it'll be linked down
below nonetheless like everything else
next you have a small Dell screen over
here which I've had for a little while
and I still really like it's actually
sort of like a computer monitor and a TV
in one in a couple of different ways
it's got an HDMI input which not all
monitors back then had when this one was
purchased it's also got a pretty decent
speaker system on the bottom with a
headphone output so that means that I
can you know just very easily plug in
headphones or a headset depending on
what I'm doing I have the Gears of War 3
Xbox hooked up over here so the halo for
Xbox is hooked up to the the big display
over in the lounge and I've got the
Gears of War 3 limited edition Xbox
hooked up over here with a pair of astro
a40 s up on top there you go with the
MLG tags trust me I ain't no MLG caliber
player but I can pretend um so anyways
that's going into this screen right here
and because this is based on a computer
monitor
there is really no input lag at all and
another reason that I really like to
game on a small screen is for some
reason I find it easier to sort of track
you know players especially in like
first person shooters etc you can really
see the entire frame a lot better than
on a big panel so I would definitely
recommend if you want to get competitive
with gaming if you're not just if it's
not strictly entertainment and you want
to do a little bit better think about a
smaller monitor on a desk or something
like that this one I'm not sure if you
can still get it but I'll link something
similar down below you can get something
similar from Samsung and they're really
affordable you know a couple hundred
bucks and you're ready to go on the desk
you've also got the beautiful the
wonderful Nexus 10 which is of course
incredibly nice to look at you've got
that ridiculous pixel density on there
and it's incredibly thin too so this is
just a beautiful device to show things
off if you want to show somebody a video
really quickly and pass it over them
this is really a beautiful way to do so
most you guys have seen some of my
coverage on
Nexus 10 you're also going to find the
modern warfare 3 special edition
controller that one is kind of funny
that one's hooked up to the Gears of War
3 xbox right now but that's just that
just worked out that way for the purpose
of this video you got my backup Drive
over there that's a list C Drive I
believe it's only one terabyte I will
need something bigger very shortly
because I'm running out of space in
terms of backups having to overwrite
backups right now you have the
PlayStation Vita which also is featuring
some special grips you see these grips
right here make it a lot more
comfortable to hold especially if you
have average to large-size hands it
feels a lot more like a traditional
controller remaps the trigger buttons as
well that's a very very cool little
contraption to make your Vita a little
bit more comfortable and of course the
Vita is there as well my knife which
everybody is always asking about this
once and for all will be listed down in
the description so you can finally go
buy one if you really want one that
badly it's a cool little knife from a
company called cricket or CRKT
and it opens in a unusual fashion so you
press this little function portion up
here and it flips out like that so it
flips out from the side you close it in
the same way a lot of people get freaked
out when I first show it to them they
don't feel comfortable using it that way
but it's actually pretty easy once you
get the hang of it and it is a really
cool blade and a conversation starter
but I wouldn't want you to start too
many conversations with it especially
for the wrong reasons
so anyways check that out down in the
description you finally know now which
knife you've been seeing in a lot of my
unboxing videos down here the last thing
in my set up or the second last thing
you can see my favorite bag right now
this is a 10 bag which is what I carry
all my gear in it's actually a camera
bag but it has a laptop portion in it as
well so it's a really easy way to carry
some lenses maybe an SLR body like the
60d but still have room for a laptop and
everything is really padded it's
actually been through a lot travelled
with me a lot and still very tough
available in a few different colors the
last item I almost forgot maybe my pride
and joy this is the embody chair from
Herman Miller it's not cheap and I know
a lot of you guys are going to go crazy
when you click the link down below and
see the price on this thing
to tell you right now you got to go
check out the link to find out but it's
a little bit expensive but hey I sit in
it every day I spend a lot of time in it
and it is very comfortable very
adjustable and I really couldn't do
without it at this point in my life so
if you work on a computer if that's how
you make your money if that's your
profession and definitely check out the
Herman Miller embody chair down in the
description so beside my desk is our
production space this is where all of
the content gets created or at least
most of it all the unboxing videos take
place on this table right here a lot of
you guys ask me how I get that nice
white background well it's a white table
against the white wall you get a nice
little sort of white heavenly looking
box if you guys know what I'm talking
about
some people have commented that that's
what it looks like in the past we've
also got this cool contraption here that
allows for the camera to hang upside
down to get that overhead perspective of
course with the 60d you can take the
screen out flip it in such a manner that
you could still get really nice a really
nice visual in order to monitor what's
going on underneath the lens so this is
this is really something that makes our
videos special I think and something
that I think I pioneered at least this
exact set up this back backdrop or it's
not really a backdrop but it's meant to
hold a backdrop and the concept here is
that if you're you know trying to
green-screen
something you can you know pull up a
backdrop overtop of this but we're using
it of course in a different way in order
to get those overhead shots I'm not
going to go over to many specs on the
exact details on these different things
because it can get you know really
long-winded with the model names but
just trust that everything here will be
listed down in the description so that's
where you can find it all over here you
can see all our different tripods once
again I'm not going to give all the
models right here I don't want to bore
you guys if you're really interested in
knowing which ones I use then just look
down below there's the Philip bloom
pocket dolly down at the very bottom
there which is basically a slider that's
that's what gives you all those really
brilliant you know beautiful looking
sliding shots panning shots etc so
that's a quick look at the production
space a lot of you guys have been asking
about this in the past so now you know
this should give you a much bye
idea of how we create content especially
the actual unboxing portion of that
content hey guys my name is will
aka will de inter and let's check out my
desk here you have some designs here
that I got going on this is an Asus
27-inch monitor over here we have the XP
500 which I Rock pretty much every day
to listen to music I did yes I did here
this is my pride and joy of my 13-inch
MacBook and it also has an upgrade of a
samsung 830 128 gigabyte SSD and it's
also souped up with 16 gigabytes of RAM
and regular Mac keyboard here is the
Corsair Vengeance M 90 series and you
know it's pretty much off the top but I
like it because of the weight has a
really nice feel to it um this is where
I do a lot of sketching my sketchbook
here you can kind of take a look at what
I like to do so there you go and yeah
that's pretty much it
what's up guys it's Kirk I do the video
production and video editing for unbox

do we're here to take a look at my desk

graphics card in a bit we just got the

of SDS and storage and stuff we got a 50
mil 1/8 Canon that's pretty nice really
low light which is why I like it then we
have the zeiss lens cleaning kit because
