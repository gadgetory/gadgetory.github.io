brand new video and you're actually
watching me on a new camera as well this
is the gh4 I'm talking into on this
angle and of course I have the other 4k
camera on that angle so we now have dual
4k you can see me and 4k you can see the
product in 4k it's really a beautiful
thing all this technology and whatnot
but you already know that today is all
about these special headphones right
here you see that they are SMS audio
Star Wars first edition stormtrooper
headphones these are of course the
street 550 headphones but they've been
spruced up a little bit to include the
Star Wars branding and they are
available in a number of different
configurations and color combos
depending on what you're looking for I
know there's a rebel pair there's also a
Jedi pair I got to see these at CES this
year and I also had the chance to
interview 50 cent during CES so if you
haven't seen that video you should
definitely go and check it out but this
one is all about these headphones so
let's go ahead and take a closer look
first at the box and then inside the box
looking here at the front you'll notice
of course the stormtrooper on the side
the black and white color combo that I'm
a fan of of course you also have the
stars in the background to signify Star
Wars obviously on the side here another
image tells you what's included inside
the box on the back here we have some
more specifications in every single
language available and on this side we
have some really cool artwork featuring
three stormtroopers and one more time
Star Wars first edition Street by 50
there we go okay so the first sleeve
comes off and then it sort of looks like
your standard Street by 50 case these
boxes are really nice lots of attention
to detail they're very cool okay so on
the inside we can see the variations of
different Star Wars first edition
headphones we have the Rebel Alliance on
the far left the stormtrooper this this
is the one that we have right here
galactic empire and bobba fett we
some stickers as well as some other
paperwork I'm gonna open this up for you
guys so we have some SMS audio stickers
as well as a stormtrooper sticker and a
Star Wars sticker feel free to place
those wherever you like we've also got a
special card here that just identifies
the different styles that are available
in the Star Wars lineup and a
certificate of authenticity so that you
know this is a legitimate pair none of
that knockoff stuff and then we have the
poster and this is actually a really
nice quality soft paper over here but
anyways Star Wars first edition Street
buy 50 SMS audio very cool so like I
keep saying if you are a Star Wars fan
this is obviously the set of headphones
for you a cleaning cloth with the Star
Wars branding and Lucasfilm on there and
you even got Star Wars on the case the
carrying case I'm not sure if you guys
can see that very well but embedded here
in the carrying case the Star Wars
branding on both sides
that's very cool a little user manual
here even that's got the Star Wars vibe
on it on the front here okay so let's
take a closer look at the actual
headphones that's kind of an important
element in any unboxing video of
headphones so here they are I'll go
ahead and unwrap them so lots of padding
in here some protective cardboard as
well as the bubble wrap and there we go
cabling here as well I guess we should
look at the cable first Before we jump
into the actual headphones you'll notice
you've got a gold-plated connector on
each end and on this end here you have a
right angled connector which is very
convenient and generally a little bit
more robust for your portable media
player iPhone Android device etc there's
also a built-in microphone here and a
button for play pause Star Wars branding
on the other side so these are gonna
work with your smartphone obviously you
have the white headband with the black
padding on the inside black padding on
the inside of each ear cup as well and
then the very
cool stormtrooper logo on the side here
it's actually protruding a little bit so
there's some depth there and that exists
on both sides on each individual ear cup
you have the same nice supple padding
that you get on the standard street buy
50 headphones and the cable actually
goes into this little port down here so
it is removable that's also quite
convenient because if anything were to
happen with your cable if it were to
fail for any reason your headphones are
not messed up at that point you can just
replace the cable and you're good to go
so as I said they fold up really nice
really portable really small you have
the SMS Audio logo on the top something
I like about this stormtrooper white
look on the exterior here is that it's a
matte finish so you're not gonna see any
kind of fingerprints on there you
probably won't see any dust either I
might as well go ahead and try these on
right now I assume they feel like the
standard Street by 50 which I am very
familiar with but here we go so there
you have it guys they're not huge it's
an on the ear style so it sits on top of
the year instead of around of course SMS
does make around the ear style
headphones if that's more your style but
this one has portability in mind so if
you like to travel a lot flying
airplanes etc these are gonna be easy to
carry with you and you can of course
wrap your Star Wars fandom as I said
earlier in this case stormtrooper so
these headphones are gonna serve a
couple of different purposes they are of
course going to be a standard set of
street by 50 headphones from SMS audio
but at the same time they're gonna be a
collector's item for anybody who's into
the Star Wars world these are something
you need to have in your collection you
probably don't have Star Wars headphones
yet at least I've never seen them before
and in this case you're gonna get the
SMS audio brand backing up the
headphones as well so these ones once
again are these stormtrooper version
there are those other versions available
I will link them down in the description
of this video this one's my favorite I
like the simplicity of black and white
and I'm also just a fan of the darkside
what can I say
all right anyway guys that wraps up this
video if you enjoyed it make sure to
leave a thumbs up down below and tweet
this at 50 cent maybe we can get him to
share it on his Twitter or Facebook let
them know this videos up alright guys
thanks as always for watching I'll catch
you on the next episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
