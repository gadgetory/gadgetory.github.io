installment of unbox therapy today we're
taking a look at the magic wand from 12
south what this device claims to do is
to take your Apple wireless keyboard and
Magic Trackpad and turn them into one
large peripheral one large input device
you might be asking yourself why would I
want to do that well I personally see
this device in a couple of different use
cases first would be from the couch for
those individuals who've got a Mac Mini
hooked up to their home entertainment
system and are looking for an incredibly
simple input device to use from that
location second maybe for those who have
an iMac in the kitchen or any place
where space is limited and you're
looking for the absolute most simple
input scenario getting back to the
unboxing the first thing we're going to
see is this little spacer it's made from
the same aluminum as your keyboard Magic
Trackpad and the magic wand this is a
little rubber insert and this is to be
used at the top portion where the device
is curved I'll show you more of that
when we get to the actual installation
but first we take a look at the
construction of the magic wand and like
I said before it's nearly the exact same
finish as the keyboard and trackpad the
keyboard just snaps in here it feels
completely solid it's definitely not
going to fall out on its own accord next
we have our spacer device and it's got a
couple of grooves in it to accept the
edges from both the keyboard and the
trackpad and our little rubber piece
fits up top here we're going to go ahead
and snap in the trackpad now and I'm not
sure if this is the way you're supposed
to install it but it seems to have
worked for me just make sure that the
grooves line up and now you have it one
solid peripheral this is not going to be
for everybody but if you're checking out
this video it might be for you if you
can envision this in your workspace that
and hopefully you check it out anyway
give our channel a visit we've got a lot
of cool stuff to look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
