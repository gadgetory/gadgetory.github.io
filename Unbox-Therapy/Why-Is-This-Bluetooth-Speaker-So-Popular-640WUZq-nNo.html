right Ultimate Ears they've been doing
this boom speaker different versions of
it for a really long time in fact this
was one of the first Bluetooth speakers
I featured on the channel once upon a
time well not this version not the new
version of it the original and then some
of the variations that existed at that
point in time crazy popular bluetooth
speaker you've seen this brand all over
the place you're gonna catch it at Best
Buy you're of course gonna see it on
Amazon and they just were able to
produce a pretty nice amount of sound
given the form factor and from a design
perspective they're pretty nice-looking
in my opinion this is a new version from
them they're calling it my boom 3
they're still claiming 360-degree true
and balanced sound so they've got this
cylindrical design I'm sure you've seen
one of these things popping around a
barbecue in a back yard something along
those lines there's one button to kind
of control everything so anyone reaching
out for it can figure out what to do
with it if you need to pause it like to
have a conversation answer a phone call
or something there's this big button on
the top that's gonna behave that way
here's another cool feature party up you
compare two speakers for stereo sound so
you could just sort of amplify what
you're listening to if you have more
than one of these and you can do up to a
hundred and fifty plus what certainly
you could imagine three or four I don't
know you're in a college dorm and it's a
popular speaker you're having a party
for the whole floor and you're like mmm
bring those ones and now you got a
bigger stereo it's kind of cool 15 hours
of battery life they say it's got
durable fabric customizable drop proof I
don't know about proof they also say
waterproof ip67 I'd say resistant one
more time let's see what color we got
cuz typically these things come in
different colors they've always had this
cool artwork on the packaging as well
right oh we got a camo pattern Oh baby
that's cool gigantic buttons on here for
volume part of the success of this
product is the fact that it's so easy to
interact with got this loop on it so you
could attach it to something if you want
to it says unbox therapy on its customer
oh my goodness gracious
alright yours is not gonna say that this
is what they're calling the magic button
play pause and of course advanced tracks
and then there's also an LED light for
power as well so a hundred and fifty
bucks
or a selection of seven different colors
or you can pay 30 extra bucks and
customize the color to what whatever you
want thousands of colors to choose from
so personalization of your Bluetooth
speaker that's pretty cool now look at
the size of this thing it's like a you
know it's like a beverage can or
something now unfortunately it's a
microUSB it is not type C but there is
an LED indicator there now the cables
they include I always like them this is
the one upside even though I criticized
the microUSB connector the type of cable
they give you is foolproof so you know
this connector is somewhat flimsy like
on PlayStation controllers I hate this
connector on PlayStation controllers for
this particular device the way that it
fits in there since its recessed so it's
protected because it's recessed and
therefore if it gets yanked or something
it's not gonna put all the pressure on
the connector itself so if you're gonna
go microUSB you have a nice cable like
this it's flat too so it's not gonna get
all scrambled up it does and of course
you have trademark sound effects all of
the features of your speaker now there's
an app that goes with it which makes it
easier to pair this thing up with other
devices as a couple of other extra
features but you know in practice in
most cases people just connect to this
like any other Bluetooth device and get
to the party so that's the way I'm gonna
connect to it it's a funny thing with
these speakers it's always a benefit
drawback thing with portability versus
sound you try to figure out like what is
the optimal trade-off this I think for a
lot of people fits right in the groove
far as musics concerned this is where
Kirk tells me to shout out is boy
you see the volume controls working on
the slider into volume all the way they
say 360 sound of course is a little bit
less sound coming out the back if you
spin it around but like it's most of the
way 360 pretty similar volume in each
direction I almost forgot because I've
used these products in the past they do
sell accessories that utilize this on
the bottom here for little docking type
setups where it could charge on the dock
so you always have a charge of ready to
go I mean what's the worst thing you're
on your way out you need the Bluetooth
speaker it's not charged because you
didn't have plugged in what can I say
about this particular product I mean
look there's a reason that you see it
everywhere and it's not just the fact
that it shows up inside a Best Buy it
has to be a decent product and it keep
on sort of iterating without fully
changing the thing they're kind of
implementing that don't broke ain't
broke don't broke don't do it don't fix
it fix it don't strategy I can imagine
this being very popular I think it does
strike that balance for Portability and
sound it's loud enough for a party it's
not gonna knock your face off it ain't
no dvla $3,000 speaker if you haven't
seen that video go check it out but it's
not meant to be it's meant to be a
simple user interface that everybody can
understand and a speaker that you're
willing to take with you that's the key
if you don't have it with you it ain't
much of a party</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
