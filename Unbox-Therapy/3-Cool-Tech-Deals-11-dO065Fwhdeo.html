Angeles begin to party will you be one
of them what's up guys Lew here back
with a very special edition of three
cool tech deals as you can tell I'm
outside yes every so often I do leave
the studio especially if I'm in LA and
the weather is wonderful like it is
right now so before the Sun Goes Down I
wanted to hit you guys with some hot
tech deals these will be like pre Black
Friday
pre Cyber Monday everybody's getting
ready for all that mayhem maybe you want
to skip the mayhem maybe you want to
start shopping right now as in today as
in the moment that you're watching this
so that's what this video is for to kick
it off we've got a gigantic an enormous
super speed USB 3.0 hub with 13 ports
those people who want to compete for USB
ports this is your winner right here
quite affordable too it's $39 and two of
the 13 ports are high-powered meaning
they charge at 2 amps 2.4 amps and the
concept here is to expand either your
laptop or your desktop so you can keep
all your peripherals connected and then
remove one cable and go giant USB hub
for all your caches you can be as happy
as these people right here I have a
feeling this is one of those items
that's always fairly marked down but
39.99 seems to be a pretty good deal for
that and the reviews are also good so
there you have it next up we've got a
giant micro SD card 150 bucks from
SanDisk SanDisk Ultra 200 gigabyte
microSD up to 90 megabyte per second
transfer speeds maybe you're thinking I
don't need 200 gigabytes of micro SD
storage the reason I thought this one
was interesting is with the rollout of
youtube bread and the ability to take
videos offline which I've already been
doing all of a sudden micro SD cards
become a little bit more interesting as
well as phones that can support micro sd
because now you got this huge cool video
jukebox of your favorite YouTube videos
music videos off youtube cetera etc 200
gigs 100
50 bucks 40% off SanDisk well done next
this one's kind of interesting now don't
be turned off immediately by the
tropical pattern there you can get this
iPhone 6 case or success case in a
number of different standardized colors
like black red white and so on
Gold if you're about that bling so this
is kind of a standardized TPU bumper
case but it has a little secret
compartment on the back as you can see
here in the image for storing two cards
could be a credit card could be an ID
there are some cool designs as well like
that space one is not bad and it just
sort of slides up you get access to your
cards of course all your other ports and
whatnot give access to those two I just
thought it was a cool little feature
that you don't see on every case and
it's only 15 bucks $15.99 to be exact at
this point the deal is 4% claimed in the
past things I've shown on three cool
tech deals have completely sold out
don't let it be you who has to cry that
single tear when that thing you wanted
is all gone lastly not exactly a tech
deal the I pong topspin table tennis
this is an honorable mention just
because the thing looks cool as hell and
it shoots ping-pong ball if you're a
ping-pong player this is how you
practice you put a hundred and ten balls
in here they get fired at you real quick
and you're smacking them back maybe
you're not a table tennis player maybe
you just want to annoy somebody sit this
thing somewhere across from them and and
rapid fire no one's always going to be
too hurt maybe a little bit annoyed but
they're going to have ping-pong balls
flying at them at an adjustable
frequency of twelve to seventy balls per
minute I was a little concerned about
the cleanup but no one ever had any fun
in their lives being worried about the
cleanup there you have it three cool
tech deals outdoor edition la edition
