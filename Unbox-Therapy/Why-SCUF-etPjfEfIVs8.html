another video and today I've got
something gaming related for you to look
at you may recognize this package here
of course this is a scuf controller and
if you've been following my channel for
a while you know that I previously
featured the new scuff controllers for
Xbox one well of course it only makes
sense to share the new controllers for
the PlayStation 4 as well so I've got
two of them here this is one package the
other ones over here we're going to be
looking at both of them and I'll be
explaining a little bit more about what
a scuf controller is and we can also
just look at how beautiful these unusual
PlayStation 4 controllers look on the
box you can see elite engineering
powerful precision full hand control and
of course the most important aspect
victory so I opted for a couple of cool
different color combinations quite a bit
different from my choices for the Xbox
one controllers which were done in a red
kind of scheme one of them was red camo
and the other one was plain red damn
there is the first of the two
controllers very slick as I'm sure you
can tell this is the yellow and black
bumblebee style look and you have
elevated thumbsticks as well so the
first thing I'll touch on is the height
of the thumbsticks which is completely
configurable by you short medium or long
depending on what you like better and
what suits your style of gameplay you
can also choose to have a concave stick
or a domed stick again that comes down
to personal preference you can see here
we have the blacked out buttons just for
a slicker look as I flip it over you'll
see another aspect of what makes a scuf
controller special first you have these
specialized grips normally this would be
a relatively slick surface and then of
course your scuff buttons so the scuff
buttons located on the back are really
what's going to give you your advantage
in the game that you're playing
they are remaps of the front facing
button so your triangle X etc you won't
have to take your hand off of the right
thumbstick
in order to access those buttons instead
your mid
finger lines up perfectly well and just
a little bump a little tap and
regardless of which button it is that
you've remapped all of a sudden boom you
can hit that same thing goes for your
left hand which also falls onto the
other punch so you can keep your thumbs
locked down on the thumb sticks so you
don't have to give up any kind of
movement you can always be looking
around moving around and still accessing
those face buttons so obviously it's
also about the appearance since this is
your custom controller you're going to
want to suit it out exactly how you want
in this particular case it's yellow and
black I like it you know lots of
contrast there and one more thing that I
almost forgot is these ones are
programmable via a magnetic key so you
can actually remap these buttons without
the need to do any kind of extreme work
or open it up or anything like that ok
so next up we have a different look and
a slightly different layout this is a
black and green digital camo I'm a big
fan of these camo appearances I have the
black and red camo on the Xbox one
controller you'll notice that on this
controller the d-pad looks a little
different than usual that's because you
have this scuff disc on there instead
which should improve your precision a
little bit and help you to slide around
from the different locations on the
d-pad of course you have the scuff thumb
sticks in this case as well these are
concave like on the other controller and
the black belt buttons over on the side
here the blacked out face buttons on the
back once again you have these scuff
grips followed by once again the scuff
4ps buttons which will be remapped from
the front as I said before so I'll put
the two of them together here so you can
really check them both out in that frame
so the black and yellow version with the
standard d-pad and the blacked out face
buttons and then the digital camo on the
right hand side here which has this cool
disc install this is removable I'm told
so you can take that off if you want to
go back revert back to the standard
d-pad anyways very cool as I said the
whole point here is to customize it to
suit you so some of these choices are
subjective whether or not you like these
thumb sticks or different
thumbsticks but that's the beauty of
scuff my question is why aren't all
controllers mapped like this stock out
of the box I mean it seems to make sense
you don't have to remove your thumbs you
still have access to those buttons you
can still pull the triggers and the rest
of your hand generally isn't doing very
much in the game it's just gripping
around the edge so the idea of accessing
these buttons in a different way it's
kind of interesting to me and always has
been since I first heard about scuff so
anyways there you have it - fresh scuff
controllers for the PlayStation 4 very
pretty to look at and functional as well
you don't always get that you know
sometimes it's beauty sometimes it's
brains in this case it's both big thanks
to scuff for sending these out to me if
you guys want to find out more
information that will be down in the
description if you enjoyed this content
make sure to leave a thumbs up down
below thanks as always for watching and
i'll catch you on the next episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
