talk about this I had to talk about this
this is the blind smartphone camera test
video that you did a couple million
views on it a lot of people talking
about it I saw people talking about it
on Twitter and so on and I mean the
basic idea the premise here is a bunch
of photos you don't tell anyone which
smartphone camera they were shot on and
then you ask people hey which ones
look the best it's blind blind shrilly
blind that's that's why the word is in
the title yep
the blind smartphone camera test and you
tested a bunch of cameras how many total
16 something like that that a full-on
bracket play that's a ton of smartphone
cast here's the thing like when you have
16 they're not all gonna be great right
so we have everything from the highest
and iPhones to the pixels but then we
have we go down the list you go LG you
go read Samsung then you suddenly have
the oneplus and the BlackBerry and
you're just kind of filling in the
bracket mm-hmm so the hardest part about
that at the very beginning was making
the bracket right what do I blindly put
up against the iPhone can do I put
another great phone or just sacrifice a
BlackBerry against it when I watch the
video I actually didn't think about that
yeah but you're kind of right because in
a typical bracket fashion you would see
it would have one seed versus 16 seed so
the favorites will be more likely to
make it through what did you end up
doing we kind of had sort of a seating
you attempted you attempted one seed
versus 16z I think we essentially
thought we'd end up with an iPhone and a
pixel at the end or something like that
so we didn't want to put I phone versus
pixel on round one mm-hmm so we kind of
had a huawei phone against the palm
phone blackberry against an iPhone a lot
of matchups like that in the first round
but spoiler alert didn't quite go that
way and that's actually why I wanted to
bring it up yeah because what ends up
happening in this experiment here is
that the results are not what anyone
expected them to be you know now of
course there's reasons for that I mean I
immediately had my speculation on why
that might be the case in the video you
actually talked about it a little bit
but ultimately and we're gonna kind of
spoil the video a little bit here yeah
but some phones make it through this
bracket that have no big
this in most people's minds making it
through the bracket you would
traditionally think certain
characteristics would carry through and
make the photo obviously better but we
did the tests and the voting on
Instagram and Twitter so it ended up
kind of boiling down to putting them to
side by side people generally fell
towards voting for the brighter more
saturated more vivid one mm-hmm even
though the highest and best smartphone
cameras we traditionally know as you
know the iPhone of the pixel don't do
the brightest vivid most crazy photos
they do sort of more neutral more
adjustable gradable higher dynamic range
photos which didn't win an interesting
thing for me about about this about this
experiment this video was it brings into
question the idea of good in general who
gets to decide which is better is it
it's not strictly this is a higher
resolution photo it's which one do you
like better was the way it was
positioned and so when people went and
picked phones that that typically
wouldn't be you know like you let's say
the polka phone against iPhone 10 or the
blackberry beats the beefy the 10s like
on paper no one's supposed to pick that
but blindly they do right like who gets
to pick what's good and bad is it you
and I or is it the general public I mean
they had the same photos at their
disposal yeah right
you had these photos you published them
on social media after you saw them post
compression I blind tested myself a
little bit that was what I was wondering
so on my computer when I'm looking at
the full resolution because we basically
like crop the two and put the top in the
bottom next to each other so I'm looking
at the original files next to each other
original files I pick the higher end
expected winner every time
right but then I put them on Instagram
stories and I forgot about the letters
and I tested myself and I voted for the
crowd favorites the upsets more often
than not and most of this was because
when I'm looking at the original files
on my iMac they're high resolution I can
see the detail in one and the softness
and the other and
nealy I picked that one but yeah we lost
that particular characteristic of the
high-end phones and suddenly it's just
like well I like the fact that I can see
all the colors in one of them and the
other one looks a little muted so I'll
pick the brighter one so that so you
have the same effect that the audience
they've had the same effect on me yeah
and you ended up picking the cheaper
devices a couple times yeah sometimes
and I also like I put 16 phones in
because I wanted to eliminate the oh I
know this is the pixel Saul vote for it
so if it was a versus B and I told you
one's a pixel one's an iPhone at a
certain point you can kind of identify a
photograph dot on a pixel for sure out
of the side you want to pick one or the
other so when we had 16 options like
this it was like well every single time
one of these might be the pixel and I
was kind of like I don't want to
evaluate too hard I just kind of glanced
at it and picked one and moved on you
know when I'm just doing that which is
kind of like what most people do on
Twitter anyway I was picking the
BlackBerry in the book of unexpected but
interesting nonetheless
the crazy part here is that these
companies spend tremendous amounts of
time and energy to create these amazing
cameras that have completely replaced
these gigantic systems that people have
had in the past and and of course
point-and-shoot cameras and so on and
then people end up taking these photos
and and the only way we end up seeing
them is on the cell phone Instagram
Twitter and your phone and so people
aren't like really what the story is
about this particular video is that
people are not sharing their photos and
receiving their photos in such a manner
that constitutes spending the extra
money on the better camera in the first
place you've got to know what you want
out of it if all you want is to take a
photo that's good enough for Instagram
or Twitter literally any of those phones
that's what I learned because I wouldn't
have even any photos an Instagram photo
it's hard to find a really truly bad
phone nowadays but I think if you also
value that like well you know Apple is
running a shot on iphone contest where
you can share your original images to be
put on a billboard like if you care
about seeing them on as a wallpaper on
your
you want a little more detail or a
little extra finesse for things like
that then you're actually looking at the
top couple instead of just whatever
looks fine on Instagram however you take
a lot of selfies I don't know there's
all kinds of priorities but if you know
what you want out of a phone that'll
dictate what kind of weight you put into
this test right there's something to be
said for like the extra work that gets
put into pushing that bleeding edge of
phones that's why I love but I carried
the pixel as like a camera yeah like I
keep trying like all these other phones
and I keep falling back to the camera
that camera for me sidenote that camera
for me was the most like just point it
and shoot it yeah
out of any smartphone camera I've ever
tried Nightside - yeah absolutely
yeah no it's it's ridiculous I mean
again somehow in the blind test
but it lost - what a pickle oh it lost -
mate 20 Pro yeah which venom went on to
win the whole thing really crush the
whole thing yeah it did win the whole
thing right I think yeah it did okay so
let me ask you something then in closing
out of this entire bracket here
obviously the mate 20 Pro ended up
winning but some cheaper devices like
the Polka phone went all the way to the
final round yeah and now that smartphone
cameras are such a differentiating
factor for people and one of the main
reasons people will actually spend more
on a smartphone out of this group which
do you think represents the best value
for money hmm I think it'd be hard to
argue with if I'm just looking at this
test the Polka phone being one of the
less expensive phones going so far
mm-hmm the BlackBerry but it's still you
have to like a blackberry like there's a
whole lot more baggage that comes with
switching to a blackberry but I think a
lot of people who were like oh well I'm
on this older phone I'm thinking about
this polka phone but I don't know if the
cameras gonna be good enough I think
they can probably rest easy I think this
is a good enough camera mm-hmm if you
want the highest end the most detail the
most dynamic range the test results
won't really help you so much but I
found this really interesting the way it
played out which phone wins your bracket
of like cost doesn't matter
you had the you had full res files you
had your own taste buds made Tony Pro oh
really and in the reason is because like
it took the brightest photos and that's
why I kept winning but it was also very
detailed and had a good amount of
dynamic range so you can you can pull
down exposure if you don't like that
high exposure if you want that's just
kind of like how some bias Samsung
biases a little high exposure Apple
tends to go a little lower but I think
looking at the raw file is why blind
tested myself with the raw files and not
the compressed version I think I would
have ended up picking mate on 24 yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
