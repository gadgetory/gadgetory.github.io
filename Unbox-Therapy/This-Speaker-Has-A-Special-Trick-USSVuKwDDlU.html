Bluetooth speaker video but you love
them I love them so I'm back with
another one and this one's a little bit
different got a twist and that's why I
selected it it's called boom buttocks
there's a little special attached for me
it's got a dock a dock that not only
charges the speaker but also acts as a
subwoofer plus the unit itself is
waterproof and it can hold songs right
on it if you want to have a light I
don't know some backup tracks your
mixtape or something along those lines
this docking thing for me is kind of
genius because it acts as an enhancement
to the sound so you're more likely to
use it
I love docks I like to dock things
alright anywhere I can dog I'll dock
like a ship in the night what is that a
little bit of storage for music protune
dual ab stereo waterproof three feet you
can control it with Siri or Google Voice
or Bluetooth all-day battery well I
don't know I'm always a little bit
skeptical when companies are like all
day who's day my day your day I go to
bed late I never sleep cuz sleep is the
cousin of death Brian you heard that do
you know the reference you never sleep
maybe next time right the subwoofer adds
15 watts of extra rich bass I'll be the
judge of that I'm kind of excited by the
proposition of the way these guys are
looking at it alright there's the unit
more substantial than I expected and I
can understand now why it is waterproof
you still have a micro USB port on it
that a clip yeah like a super hefty clip
I guess you could clamp it onto
something if you want some dedicated
controls for volume play pause what is
it how many hex six is hex right teach
me something yeah and then this is the
magic right here on the bottom those
contact points there are going to act as
the interface for the subwoofer and also
to charge this thing up alright
the subwoofer part sits like that kind
of got like an Illuminati vibe to it
whoa
they got fancy with the micro USB cable
look at that white tips and purple cape
I like that make a statement
no silica gel for Jack looks like he's
gonna go hungry today oh hello there
first thing I noticed plugging it in
there's an LED along the front and on
the bottom side of the subwoofer you can
see the speaker unit and some sticky
feet that keeps it planted hello
darkness my old friend ooh that was like
a video game it's like a Mario sound
effect let's play a song first just with
the speaker
this speaker lets you adjust the volume
kind of like beyond where you should
speakers these days usually they're like
the limiter kicks in before that it's
like you've got to act as your own
limiter to know where to lay off brake
dust that's a bit of an amateur move
it's like that threshold should be built
into there so you can't really do that
wholly again reference point here
speaker by itself it's not the best blue
to speak I've heard here plus you can
blast the audio long to the point of
light completely crunching the speaker
into nothingness maybe if you want a ton
of bass in a small package that thing
was thumping if you're looking for like
ultimate audio representation this one's
not for you but if you just want to
thump hard this might be your thumper</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
