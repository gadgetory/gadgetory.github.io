phone for a while the me a1 Xiaomi
device part of the Android one program
around $200 that gives you a clean
Android experience and on this channel I
have featured so many budget phones that
don't do this budget phones that for me
I probably wouldn't consider using just
because I don't want to have to put up
with the skin there's a kind of
confidence a kind of Genesis a qua
inside of using a relatively stock phone
out of the box and quicker updates when
it comes to new software getting rolled
out dual camera setup pure Android fresh
OS upgrades pure as the driven snow do
they know it does from you do you do try
to Snapdragon six to five I think it's a
great chip at this price point and a
five point five inch full HD display
four gigs of ram 32 gigs of storage
hopefully I can recommend this thing
some of us people out there might be
upset with the appearance being so
similar to an iPhone 7 7 plus course one
difference here is the fingerprint
reader I like this location I'm happy
this location is by dual camera setup
flash in this location and the antenna
layout almost identical to the iPhone
does come in black gold and rose gold
dual SIM storage expansion there speaker
USB type-c and a headphone jack IR
blaster surprisingly enough I understand
the criticism on the front here with the
larger bezel and so on but I want you to
adjust your mindset here to the price
point there's a benefit to this type of
software setup that might exceed the
benefit of going with some newer brand
some less established brand and whatever
software they're gonna give you out of
the gate that close to stock experience
is very valuable to me all right I'm
just being honest earpiece front-facing
camera capacitive buttons down at the
bottom also in the box
a screen protector USB type-c cable and
a nice little power brick very portable
we are running on android 8 how clean
does that look one thing is kind of
bugging me a bit I gotta be honest here
having the back button on the
alongside on the Samsung side Google
Apps Google services obviously the six
to five snapdragon is not the highest
performing chip in the world but it's a
good cost to performance ratio and it's
great with battery let's boot up YouTube
on both of these obviously we're not
working with OLED here so the off-axis
is gonna suffer a little bit but
nonetheless fairly bright well maybe a
$4 or $5 smartphone is not right an
actual $5 phone go check out the video
we'll play the same video here I mean
you can't compare pretty decent volume
but it's not forward-facing think that
speaker is delivering on what it should
at this price range since we're on the
topic of audio this one actually beats
this one when it comes to versatility
with the headphone jack there's enough
manufacturers that have decided to keep
it around I have to mention it as an
actual feature now I know what you're
thinking you keep telling me this is a
replacement to my pixel to excel so I
don't need to spend 850 I just I'm gonna
spend 200 220 whatever it is for this
thing where you're giving up the most is
right there cameras in smartphones have
become these major differentiation
factors pay more you get more in the
camera department when you boot up the
camera app here pretty straightforward
quick little photo here now this is
actually kind of a good test for the
dynamic range because it's really hot up
on the top of the leaves here getting
blasted by the studio light and then you
have of course a very dark background
you know I got to be honest it's just
not gonna be pixel level but is it
usable I think you're in the territory
pixel town you want to go to pixel town
with the camera the pixel so dominant in
the camera department you already knew
that sort of mid-range camera
performance at an entry-level price
suppose it depends on where you are
globally if you consider this entry
level here in North America that's
definitely entry level that's that's a
budget device fingerprint scanner not
the fastest I've ever tried but it does
get the job done as well there's a lot
of get the job done these things as much
as they are entertainment devices so
Media devices designed for consumption
there are also tools you got to get
things done for me strip down super
clean OS right out-of-the-box and the
fresh updates I hold that as a very
important characteristic you guys know I
love the 1 + 5 t at 500 I think it's a
great phone but not everybody's even
gonna have that much you got to remember
this thing is half the price less than
half the price if I move over to the
pixel it's gonna be so familiar because
the lack of skin now some of you might
think of going overboard like Lou stock
Android Holy Smoke it's hard to describe
it in a tangible way it's a taste thing
being a tech enthusiast want to try new
Android features as close to when they
come out as possible so this device
satisfies that part of me and it does so
at a price point that's kind of
unprecedented if you're staring at
around 200 bucks and you got to make a
smart phone choice you just want to buy
the thing outright like a citizen of
Earth you want to take a look around
think you're gonna need to look real
hard at this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
