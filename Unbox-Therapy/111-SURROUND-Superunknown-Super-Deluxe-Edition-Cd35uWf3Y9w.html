another video and this one I'm really
excited for in front of me I have the
20th anniversary edition of
Soundgarden's super unknown a classic
record you probably have heard of it
they sold nine million copies so unless
you've been living under a rock or maybe
you're super young you may not have
bumped into this yet but if you haven't
you should definitely go and check it
out a classic record indeed now this is
in celebration of the 20th anniversary
so we have a very special set up in
front of me and if you're interested in
checking out pricing and availability on
this I will have links down in the
description so you can do that but
there's also a very high tech element
included in this release and that's a
companion application for iOS and
Android which will give you a mix of the
record in 11.1 surround sound
virtualization I have been told that
this is a brand-new listening experience
and we are gonna capture on camera right
now
my initial reaction to 11.1 surround
sound music
now this is achieved by placing extra
speakers on the vertical access and
you're gonna want to use a decent set of
headphones to really you know recognize
this 11.1 the larger the drivers sitting
on top of your ear obviously the larger
the seperation between sounds was in
your ear canal so I've got a decent set
of headphones over here it will work on
regular ear buds but having a nice set
of headphones is recommended anyways
before we check that out and try out
that 11.1 surround sound let's talk
about the main package here we have this
cool looking book actually it looks like
a book it doesn't look like music at all
that's because the music is housed in
the back of this book and on the front
you have this shifting image not sure if
you guys can make that out in the camera
but you can see it says Superunknown and
then as you flip it up even further you
can see it says sound that's really cool
it's like those old-school cards you
could collect in the old days you know
what I'm talking about also the image
here the Eclipse changes as well so
really cool cover and this is a
hardcover book and inside we've got all
kinds of different information visuals
we have artwork brand-new artwork in
fact and then we have a bit of the story
line on some of the inspiration behind
this record and sort of just what was
going on during this time period in
music very interesting stuff on the
front here I almost flipped past this we
have a special secret note and I'll go
ahead and peel this out just so we can
look at it and of course I'm gonna be
very gentle here because I want to put
it back to its factory fresh state
actually smells factory fresh right now
I love that it's like fresh baked goods
but from the factory
dearest everything is gone I hope you
find this photo the trees have fallen
the light has called us home are we
alive in this super unknown I don't know
anymore
we've traveled north please find us XO
woah mysterious if you guys are younger
than then people who would be into music
in the early 90s you need to go back and
check it out because this is the roots
of a lot of the music that we hear
day this was a huge cultural culturally
significant time period for music in my
opinion of course I was growing up
during this period of time so anyways as
you can see you have some cool
photography of the band as well as some
different artwork and a little bit more
information on the background so a
really cool hardcover book on its own
this would look great on your coffee
table or anywhere else you like to keep
collectibles you can see we have lyrics
so song lyrics are listed in here over
here we have track listings on all the
different discs so there are a large
number of discs included so we have disc
1 2 3 4 5 5 discs in this 20th
anniversary edition including a blu-ray
audio 5.1 surround mix so if you have a
really nice home theater setup why
listen in just stereo so the very back
is where the discs are gonna live and
over here this is this is an important
part what we have on this little note is
your code for your digital download for
that companion application I was talking
about and that high fidelity digital
version and here of course it's disc
number one in the five disc set now
we've also got some specialty discs for
b-sides
over here besides and more we have a
specialty disc for demos as well as
rehearsals and the artwork on the discs
is really beautiful as well obviously in
line with the book and the art style as
well and then this this last disc here
is the blu-ray audio 5.1 surround mix
alright so let's go ahead and do the
high-tech element in this particular
recording I have these headphones here
these are HD 8 DJ's from Sennheiser I've
talked about them before on the channel
you guys are probably familiar with them
but I would recommend using just a pair
of over the ear high quality headphones
if you have access to them otherwise use
what you've got for now but if you want
to get the ultimate in the 11.1
virtualization experience use decent
headphones so anyways I'm gonna go ahead
and put these on and then I'm gonna
launch the application I'm going to show
you guys how that works
so put the headphones in here the
application will work on iOS and Android
I believe I mentioned that already I
have iOS here in front of me so you can
see I have a specialty app there so
there is a DTS headphone demo which is
really cool so you select how you want
to listen if you are using in Iran here
or over ear headphones in my case over
here is what I have selected and I hope
I'm not gonna increase my volume too
much here but what it's doing right now
is it's verifying the 11.1 surround look
what I'm doing here I'm surrounding
myself and so there's like a woman's
voice which is moving around my head
representing each channel this is
entertaining on its own okay so as I
mentioned before we've got the high
taxes now so it's not just about this
access moving around for five point one
at each point in the in the surround
you've got this extra high taxes it
sounds confusing you just just think of
it this way music all around you and in
its own unique space so like a sound
could be up this is the best way I can I
can identify it like a sound could be up
here over here over here down here it's
etc you get the point that was probably
not the best explanation but that's how
this technology works I'm gonna play the
song now and see how I feel about it
you see this smile okay okay right away
there's a echoing vocal that's happening
somewhere over here exclusively so it
sounds like you know subdued over here
it gives you a really crazy sense of
space I keep doing this motion here
that's the best way I can describe it so
each sound has a lot of its own space
within the mix it's really really cool
alright I'm gonna go back now okay so if
I tap on the the artwork I can turn the
DTS on or off to compare alright let's
do an a/b test real quick
now obviously you can't really tell what
I'm hearing but it would be pointless
for me to send the recording through to
you because you're not gonna be using
the virtualization so you're not going
to hear any difference I will attempt to
react to the different changes as well
let's give you guys some feedback with
the DTS on and the DTS alright I'm gonna
I'm gonna hit play again okay
okay very easy this one's very easy to
identify the you know sometimes there's
like effects that certain headphones
might have or you might be able to
access an equalizer to change the
attributes of a particular recording
this is a significant change the non DTS
version appears to have a more hollow
sound classic sound might I add but the
DTS just sort of gives it a lot more
maybe it's just the ears ability to
differentiate based on the
virtualization of different locations of
sound I don't know is my mind blown yes
possibly that might be why I'm not
making sense right now anyway I prefer
the DTS I'm listening to Spoonman right
now by the way okay hands down best part
of the track drum solo in Spoonman
unbelievable moving around your head
very distinctive differences between the
location of different percussion
instruments unbelievable you need to
experience this you need to check this
out for yourself I can only give you so
much information through voice and
reaction you need to hear it right okay
so go check this out links will be down
in the description as I mentioned before
this is really really cool I could get
used to listening to music like this it
gives it a whole new attitude a whole
new character I've probably done a
terrible job explaining this experience
but it's not meant for words and for
ears meant for sound it's meant for
music thanks as always for watching guys
