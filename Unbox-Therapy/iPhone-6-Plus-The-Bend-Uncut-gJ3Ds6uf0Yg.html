Dundas Square in downtown Toronto that's
because I want to put all this
conspiracy to rest with the bendgate
controversy I have a brand new sealed
iPhone six-plus that is in completely
new order here working order and I've
got some witnesses as well to verify
that so that nobody can say I'm doing
anything crazy doctoring anything using
any special machinery in order to
produce the effects that others are
complaining about and I am personally a
little bit concerned that it's more than
the nine people that have been reported
so without further ado let me unwrap
this and give you the new out in the
open with witnesses been test video so
I'm gonna do it the same way that I did
before holding it in the same location
wait first fully working fully working
device as you can see without a SIM card
for obvious reasons so there you go so
should we do this
let's get a nice lock on it in three two
one
now am i the Incredible Hulk am i
bodybuilder guys am i regular dude not
that bill so it's fairly obvious that
was easy to do
people are saying crazy things like I
had to exert an incredible amount of
force I have another phone in my bag
actually which I can grab right now be
Moto X and this is the one I want you
guys to pay attention to this should be
part of this story is how durable the
new Moto X is by comparison so for all
you individuals saying all phones Bend
that's not true if you try and bend some
devices that's not what happens so here
is the new Moto X once again completely
in working order
I'll grab it on the back just like I did
for the iPhone I can press as hard as I
want can you guys see how hard I'm
pressing and this phone look look at
that it will flex a little bit make no
noise and nothing will change completely
working so it is possible to engineer a
device that can withstand that amount of
force this is the evidence right here
it's all the evidence you need is this a
problem for your average user maybe not
yet but we're expected to hold these
phones for years in some cases not just
an afternoon we will see the real
reports coming in shortly but that phone
is weaker than many of the competitors
let me see it one more time and see it
one more time real quick
I think that pretty much tells a story
it's completely opened up this one is
even worse than the other one it even
seemed like less force</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
