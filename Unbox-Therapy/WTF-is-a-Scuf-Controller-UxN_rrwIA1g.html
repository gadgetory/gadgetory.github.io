another video that makes three videos in
the last three days so thumbs up for
that intense level of productivity that
we haven't seen in a while here on unbox
therapy and thumbs up to you guys for
actually watching all of them I hope you
have go back watch more videos anyways
today we're talking about the scuff one
controller and you're gonna ask what the
hell is the scuff one controller loop
well as far as I know it is a
professional controller for the Xbox one
it can be used by casual gamers as well
but there are a couple of features and
functions that should improve your
gameplay over the stock Xbox one
controller and they have been cool
enough to send me to different scuff one
controllers to look at so I'm gonna set
one to the side for a moment you can see
on the box scuff gaming professional
controller elite engineering / powerful
precision full hand control victory
that's right you heard it here first
your key to victory actually I want to
show you this side of the box real quick
as well
easy concealed adjustable hair-trigger
and stop mechanism which is removable
that's on your triggers obviously two or
four paddles on the back I'll talk more
about that after we get inside the box
electromagnetic remapping scuff grip if
you want it a noose new scuff thumb
sticks weight reduction and customize
your controller so of course any of
these features and functions are
customizable by you if you are
interested in a scuff one controller or
a scuf controller for your Xbox 360 or
last generation console alright let's go
ahead and open up the first of the two
controllers I'm actually kind of excited
for these I've seen pictures online but
never handled a scuf controller itself
so you'll see that once you buy it
you're actually not completely done with
the configuration you can find the
perfect hair-trigger and stop mechanism
placement for your triggers and that
just means that you won't have to press
it down as far to activate a gun shot
which means you can fire off more in
rapid sequence whoa so there is the
first of two controllers a few things
down on the bottom I'll put the
controller down for a min
okay so this is your screwdriver for
making those adjustments as well as a
spudger that's what we used to call them
back in the day when I was in the
business of fixing iPods and stuff like
that and then a couple of batteries so
this is obviously a red scuff one the
first thing I notice is these different
thumb sticks here they have a curved or
domed design unlike the concave in the
stock thumb stick I know a lot of people
are a fan of this style right here it's
a little bit grippy but durable feeling
you guys know that I reported on a
problem with my playstation 4 thumb
sticks where they were wearing off these
feel a little bit more durable of course
time will tell but a nice sort of mix
between hard plastic and grippy
rubberized vibe going on there and you
have the scuff logo in the center of
both thumb sticks which provides even
more grip now what makes a scuf
controller special are these buttons
right here on the back and of course
this grip to this is obviously a
specialized grip and these buttons are
actually remaps of your standard X a Y B
buttons and the reason you might want
those remapped to the back as you can
see here I'm capable of pressing them
without moving my thumb from the
ever-important right thumbstick you see
I can all of a sudden hit those buttons
so if it's jump for example I can jump
around while maintaining my level of
control on the right thumbstick normally
I'd have to you know take my thumb off
in order to do that some individuals
prior to scuff controllers used a grip
called claw where they would actually
move their index finger to this location
so they could maintain their control of
the thumb stick I've never been a fan of
that style it's just never worked well
for me so this is a lot more functional
now you can order stuff controllers with
all four of the buttons remapped to the
back or just one two three whatever it
is that you want and you can add more in
the future if you want as well this
portion here actually slides off that's
where your batteries are gonna go and
you can see where those buttons have
been remapped so these little paddles
are actually acting
the ignition point for those little
buttons there on the inside we have this
military-style grip which feels fairly
durable and should probably provide
decent grip even if your hands are
getting a little bit sweaty and then on
the outside we actually have these
grooves where your fingers are gonna fit
in and this is a slightly stickier
rubber on the outside here so this one
has been outfitted with the full-on
stuff setup this is really comfy Oh
almost forgot the trigger so you'll see
here that the trigger has a very short
see that a very short activation point
so there's a stop in there which allows
for you to fire off rounds a lot quicker
than if you had to push it all the way
in like the traditional Xbox one trigger
as I said before these are adjustable
and that's why they give you the tools
and that's why they give you the little
paperwork there to help you get that set
up perfectly for you but this looks
perfect for first person shooters
whether you're playing Call of Duty
titanfall etc you've got that really
quick hair trigger there so there is
controller number one the red one and
let's get to the second one here which I
assume is going to be slightly different
we'll see which customizations exist on
this one so once again we are greeted
with the exact same paperwork to set
your scuff up and get the correct hair
trigger on there whoa
now that is badass folks it's kind of
like black and red camo going on big fan
of that now in this in this particular
instance we have a different kind of
thumb stick set up and these ones are
concave similar to your standard Xbox
one controller but they are a slightly
nicer texture similar to the texture on
the first controller here but again con
caved instead of the dome that you see
on the other controller are on a
Playstation controller from the ps3 for
example wow those are really comfy can't
tell which one I like better right now I
think I think I like this concave a
little bit better
we have blacked out buttons that's cool
so in this case you can see they're
blacked out from the stock ones and then
if we flip it over we are outfitted with
two scuffed buttons now this is a
popular setup for a lot of people as
well they don't want to get confused
back there and they don't really need to
have absolutely rapid access to some of
those buttons that would normally be
mapped here so in this case a little bit
less cluttered in the back you have two
buttons instead of four as I said before
you can even do one if you want we have
that same kind of grip from the previous
one the scuff grip you have the four
button option followed by the two button
option and as I said earlier completely
customizable that is up to you whichever
you prefer and however you see using it
all right so there you have it - very
cool controllers from scuff I'm probably
a little bit partial to the one on the
left just because of that killer paint
job the black and red look to it and I
also think I'm a bigger fan of the
slightly concave thumbsticks as I
mentioned before but both are really
cool controllers and definitely an
upgrade over your stock Xbox one
controller especially since like I said
for first-person shooter games it's so
important to keep your finger your thumb
on that right thumbstick and having
these extra buttons on the back allows
you to do that so this is a really great
setup and a lot of competitive gamers
are using these scuf controller so when
you're playing online you might be at a
disadvantage if other users in that
particular multiplayer game have scuff
controllers and you don't so that wraps
up this video thanks as always for
watching guys if you enjoyed this
content please remember to leave a
thumbs up down below as it does help out
a bunch if you're not a subscriber yet

for sending these out for me to play
with which is what I'm gonna go and do
right now and hopefully improve my
skills cuz trust me my skills need
improving all you youngsters been
kicking my ass online alright that wraps
this up later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
