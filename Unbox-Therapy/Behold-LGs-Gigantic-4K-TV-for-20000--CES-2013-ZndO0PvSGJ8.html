go further what's up guys Lew here and
one of the most exciting things I got to
check out last night at CES unveiled is
this right here this giant 84 inch
television but it's not your standard
everyday 1080p display of course this is
CES 2013
this one is packin 4k resolution which
is about 8 million pixels what that
means to you is as close as you want to
get to this display you will not be able
to discern individual pixels
so an incredibly beautiful image to look
at and they've gotten more affordable
this one retails for 20 grand now I know
most of you are saying that even
affordable ooh listen 20 grand for a TV
nobody's gonna buy that but this just
shows that the technology is becoming
more available than it was last year in
fact last year we got to look at some
crazy expensive displays that were 8k
resolution so even double the resolution
of this display right here so things are
happening in the TV space and most of it
seems to have to do with improving and
increasing resolution at this point now
this display is also 3d capable of
course you know the television
manufacturers are gonna throw that in so
in this case you get four pairs or I
believe six pairs actually but four are
on display here of LG's passive 3d
glasses so you won't need to charge
these babies up anyway guys that's a
quick look at an 84-inch 4k television
for 20 grand the first real video from
CES 2013 subscribe for more coverage
