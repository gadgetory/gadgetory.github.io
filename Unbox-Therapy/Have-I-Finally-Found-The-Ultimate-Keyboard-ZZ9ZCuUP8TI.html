can you obviously can tell that you
clicked on it you're wondering why does
this keyboard matter blue you've shown
us keyboards in the past a wide range in
fact I mean weird ones ones made out of
wood wood real wood a one that was made
out of glass and completely transparent
do a little unbox therapy I mean does
the trick it kind of feels like I'm
typing on a sheet of glass there I say
the wide world of keyboards has been
covered here on unbox therapy today's no
exception I'm actually hoping for this
one to go into my workflow and actually
sit on my desk I've been using various
keyboards over the years mechanical for
sure like I'm fully on board got Dan so
when it came to choosing this one part
of the process was just a consequence of
availability I use Apple products I'm
currently using the new MacBook Pro but
it's hooked up to a monitor and a bunch
of peripherals and there's a keyboard
hooked up to it right now too
but the problem is the vast majority of
mechanical keyboards out there are not
developed to work with Macs now this
doesn't mean they don't work they do
work but you might have to remap a
couple of T's not a big deal but given
the option to test out an actual
mechanical keyboard designed for Mac
with those keys and in this case that
also happens to be backlit for me was
something compelling enough to make the
purchase and buy this one from a company
called SEO who I've never heard of
before white LED backlight with
adjustable brightness aluminum faceplate
full mechanical Keys volume control so I
guess that's what this wheel on the side
over here is for I need a knife and as
usual don't have one thank you jack now
one thing I don't know is how classy
this is that is one aspect of mechanical
keyboards you might be unaware of if you
haven't tried one before they are
obviously far more noisy move here's the
keyboard itself and it has a braided
style cable which is good too
look at that that's odd happy troubled
me Jack if you're happy go on social
media and tell all your friends about it
if you're troubled give us a ring we'll
fix that up for you so this is a wrist
rest wrist rest that's tough to say see
if we like it ooh that's nice look at
that kind of an anodized look a little
bit shimmery click these up to give
yourself a nice little incline there
okay so they're not the super clacking
keys it's not like it's more of a
brightness expose controls dashboard
controls illumination control for the
backlight Multimedia controls volume
mute down up so that's all the
multimedia Keys you would expect to find
on a native Apple keyboard and then over
here there's a little wheel I guess
that's gonna work for volume as well
there we go
that is nice whoo party time if that
doesn't get your juices flowing I don't
know what will all right so as you can
tell we're now in the dark together it's
a very intimate experience this is how I
like to get work done okay maybe there's
a candle over here glass of champagne
listen don't tell me how to work all
right this is real nice contrast look at
that when the lights are dim this
flickering that you're seeing on the
video feed not happening in real life
it's just the refresh rate of the light
versus the frame rate of the video if
you haven't used an illuminated keyboard
before even you know when you're on
lamps or you're winding down in the
evening this makes it a lot easier to
see the keys that you're looking for
that is kind of a nice cool little quick
way get it up nice and quick and then of
course mute if you want to be a DJ one
of my criticisms with the with the Apple
keyboard and so on is like it's not
full-size if you work on these things on
a daily basis I'm telling you your
productivity it's about to skyrocket
then
and then it was at Animaniacs Looney
Tunes I don't know your productivity
that's what happens in your office when
you get one of these keyboards Tom you
don't talk about how dare you man
how old are you get out of here if you
know of any other mechanical keyboards
with this layout for Apple let me know
in the comments with the keys with the
multimedia keys command function and
illumination let me know in the comments
cuz I think I might have just found the
ultimate keyboard for Mac you could
thank me later or you could thank me
right now put a thumb in the right place</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
