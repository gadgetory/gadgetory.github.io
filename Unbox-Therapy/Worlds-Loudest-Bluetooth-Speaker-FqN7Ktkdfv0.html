a very big box here it's not even
completely in the frame it's got to be
one of the biggest boxes that's ever
been sitting here on the unbox therapy
table and definitely the biggest
bluetooth speaker that I have ever sat
here so my expectations for sound are
way up here at the edge of the box
generally speaking if you have a bigger
speaker cabinet you're going to get
bigger sounds so that's what I'm hoping
for here from a company called fluent so
it's got bluetooth and a couple of other
ways to interface with it and you could
connect it to a home theater you can
just use it as a fancy-looking Bluetooth
speaker it's completely up to you so
let's get it out of the box and then
take a listen you can get it I believe
in a wood finish black finish and think
it might come in white as well some
accessories you cable who user guys look
those look whoa more accessories
oh wow mine is like a it's like a dark
wood color that's massive look at that
with the wood finish you kidding me back
that's a good look oh this whole piece
comes off magnetically look at that so
you can remove the grill if you prefer
the look without so I guess pink in the
back is facing you I might as well talk
about the input a power input here on an
off switch
USB charging for a USB device see the
Bluetooth logo over there auxiliary in
optical digital in and then even a radio
if you want to listen to radio look at
the Canadian flag and I spin it around
here and look at this view you can have
the grill on like that if you like the
more understated appearance but then you
can peel this off and you just a look
like that that might be more my style
look at this
whoa I could be right through it do the
video for me in hand this thing has a
mount on the bottom and then a large
pedestal elevates it up off the ground
to a better listening height they
included the antenna for radio power
cable to get it juiced up an auxilary
cable for wired connection a remote
control to control it that's a nice
touch
independent settings for treble and bass
so you do at least have the ability to
make some adjustments that's a nice
little touch
this thing's about to blow your mind the
microphone this is you you're on this
little microphone right over here you
hear that scratchy that's you you're
about to get direct impact I think this
guy is going to be popular in home
entertainment units as well and that's
where the optical port comes in you can
send the optical out from your flat
panel TV and all of a sudden everything
you're watching on that display through
all those various HDMI inputs are going
to come through here on that television
optical audio out I assume these are
capacitive let's check it out let me try
one oh yeah there you go this will
change the input here's the Settings
button play pause forward back and then
volume up and volume down let's hear
this thing that's what you're here for
connected mmm
okay we get a little volume on you oh
that's the loudest one yet that's the
loudest one yet
football's the best Bluetooth speaker
I've ever heard period hands down new
champion you got Bluetooth speaker
because you get loose after a long day
work and then you got Bluetooth speaker
because you want to upset your neighbors
you got a Bluetooth speaker but you can
get a sound complaint and trust me
that's the type of Bluetooth speaker you
want cause if you don't have a cell
complaint chances are you don't know how
to party
not like Jack I like Ryan not like Tom
not like me and on 800 so they kept all
my staff meeting might be it
probably</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
