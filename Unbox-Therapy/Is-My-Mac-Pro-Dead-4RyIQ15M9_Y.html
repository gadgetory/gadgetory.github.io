it's here and not on my desk is because
it's broken as you can tell I'm very
pleased about that basically I started
having some video issues as you guys
know if you've seen my setup video or at
least episode one you know that I push a
lot of pixels out of this little beast
it's been video editing since its birth
since it got here I don't know if that
has to do with it specifically or if
it's just a defect but what I'm getting
now is a lot of video artifacting it's
basically a garbled mess somewhere
within your video feed that exists on
your display now generally that means
there's something wrong with your
graphics card well in this case possibly
both graphics cards because it has dual
D 700s this is a very expensive system
so that brings me to the next part it is
covered under Apple Care warranty this
system is close to ten thousand dollars
now before you write your comment about
how crazy that is and obscene just
remember that I use this for work on a
daily basis it's produced hundreds of
videos I'm looking at it right now like
I'm proud of it or something but yes
it's produced hundreds of videos and
saving time is money in this business
yes you could build a PC similar to this
one similar in functionality if you
wanted to nonetheless I need to get this
thing fixed so it can go back to my desk
and it can go back to editing videos
which is essentially what it loves to do
most I just kissed my computer
anyways it's covered under Apple care as
I said before and that's important
because Apple care and this is like 250
or 300 bucks and the system is worth a
lot more money than that if this wasn't
covered under Apple care it would cost
me quite a bit of money to be exact
they've ordered in a new logic board
which is four hundred and twenty three
dollars two new graphics cards obviously
since I said this has dual be 700 this
is just to be sure they've got it
covered
those are three hundred and ten dollars
each they ordered in a new dim of memory
16 gigabytes and lastly the labor charge
is on this order sheet as well the total
lump sum figure for this repairs about
fourteen hundred dollars if it weren't
covered under Apple Care ouch
yes I've used it hard now the next point
of this video since it is going in for
repairs it got me a little bit concerned
about privacy as you know I'm a fairly
public figure well you know Who I am and
I make videos about products sometimes I
talk about Apple sometimes I make videos
like this and of course this thing has a
lot of personal information on it that I
think should be protected so what I'm
going to do before I bring this in for
that physical repair is I'm going to
remove SSD and all of my personal
information that goes with it and it's
actually not too difficult to do that's
why I have this Torx t8 screwdriver
right here there is some good
documentation online as well from Apple
themselves about how to remove the SSD
but I'm going to show you here just for
the sake of it start by lifting this up
that's a beautiful sound and then over
here you can see where it's located this
is the SSD it's tiny as you can tell and
it's a single Torx t8 screw to remove it
remove this screw here and then simply
lift it out on the place where it's
secured and connected to the logic board
now some of you might be thinking how
will they fix your device if you've
taken out the SSD and they can't test it
to see if the repair work they can
actually boot these things off of
external drives and do all the testing
necessary they don't need this
this internal drive or my personal
formation in order to check if the
repair has worked and they're no longer
seeing video artifacting but for me it's
worthwhile for one screw and an easy
removal why not take the drive out and
not have to worry about them going
through my stuff God knows what's on
there so I felt like this was an
important thing to share with you guys
for various reasons obviously my main
editing machine is going to be out of
commission for a little while but also
since you come to me for product
information and whatnot I thought why
not report on something that's happened
to me as a regular product user over the
extended life cycle of a very expensive
computer product this is real reporting
right here and if anyone else runs into
this issue now they have a video at
least talking about it because I found
it kind of hard to track down videos
like this one I think that's probably
because there aren't that many Mac pros
out there comparative to more consumer
facing products anyway guys that wraps
up this video it is time to put this top
back on the Mac Pro bring it in to the
Apple store and say goodbye for a little
while I'll be thinking about you I hope
you guys are thinking about the Mac Pro
as well how many videos have come
through this thing videos that you guys
have enjoyed if you guys enjoyed this
content make sure to leave a thumbs up
down below thanks as always for watching
and I will catch you on the next episode
very soon
later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
