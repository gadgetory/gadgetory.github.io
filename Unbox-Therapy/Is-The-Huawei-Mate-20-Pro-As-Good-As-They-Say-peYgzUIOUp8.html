requested device recently it's been all
over my social media guys have been
hitting me up on Twitter as usual in the
comments Lu you're looking at so many
smartphones where is the mate 20 pro
this is like the grown-up like a
scaled-up version of the p20 Pro which I
used for a while had some really
interesting features including that
amazing night mode I can understand why
you're interested in this device and
that is why it is here today I have the
Twilight version Twilight color six gigs
of RAM and 128 gigs of storage according
to the crack team which is just well do
this thing's about 900 bucks so it's not
a cheap device but now this remember is
the Twilight color whoa
purple blue reddish colors it's all
represented in there does feature
wireless charging it even has a cool
feature where it can charge other
devices that have wireless charging so
could do reverse wireless charging you
may have seen this in huawei's
commercials for this device you've got
4200 milliamp hours in here you've got
juice to spare sometimes link up sync up
you can see the three cameras set up
this is going to give you the same kind
of crazy performance that you saw in the
p20 probe but it's also going to add a
wide-angle lens which I'm a big fan of
this show is shot on a wide-angle lens
it lets you get more in the frame that's
kind of a nice move if you're gonna put
a bunch of cameras give us a different
focal length this colorful power switch
kind of suits the theme with the
Twilight look now some of you might be
upset there's no headphone jack on a
device I don't even know for crying
about this thing anymore maybe maybe not
it also features expandable storage as I
mentioned earlier but it's a weird new
format called nano storage something
along those lines so those cards might
be a little hard to get at least for now
but it's it's expandable storage if you
need it I mean it picks up fingerprints
it's glass look at that already if you
want put the clearcase on okay I don't
know does it solve the problem not
really maybe this just gets
fingerprinted yeah then this just gets I
don't know glass backs
the supercharged power brick what 70% of
juice in half an hour is that what it is
will supercharged how fast is it that's
why I said without this guy over there I
mean let's just pack it in let's go do
something else they included a headset
type C headset with microphone also the
adapter since you lost the mini jack
whoo all right
that's a display yes it's got a notch
all right I noticed apparently this is
not just housing the front-facing camera
but also the face unlock tech the
contrast and detail on this particular
wallpaper my goodness that's pretty nice
3120 by 1440 is the resolution plenty of
pixels there it's a six point three nine
inch display with very little bezel I
mean there's a bit of a chin there it's
a lot of display and it's nice to look
at I got to be honest
now you're probably also noticed that
there is no fingerprint scanner anywhere
on the device we've seen this popping up
on other devices including the recent
oneplus device it's still an emerging
concept but it actually works in those
other cases surprisingly well in screen
fingerprint here we go let's enroll it
let's give this a shot real quick hmm
edges get the edges in there Wow they
take a ton of data on there hmm
wait a minute Jack wait a minute that's
one of the nicer ones for something I
don't mind that one the animation feels
satisfying for some reason it's not
gonna be as fast as a capacitive scanner
on the back of the device this is one of
the better in screen ones that I've used
and I could totally do that on a daily
basis now the feature you care about if
I go ahead and launch the camera app
here you'll see yeah wow that is pretty
wide so there's a slider here which
controls your zoom all the way from
point 6x on the wide end up to 10x not
fisheye nothing distorted but you just
get so much more into the frame this is
1x that's your standard focal range
for me this is incredibly useful to go
all the way to dare gives you so much
more versatility on the camera side you
have a portrait mode as well which is
going to give you the bokeh effect that
some people are super into wow that's a
that's pretty wild the night mode is the
magical part it's basically creating
light out of dark everybody's super
pumped about various night modes people
are just doing magical things on the
software side to take these multiple
shots and create light where there
wasn't any it's putting traditional
photography out of business
don't tell photographers that should we
hit some lights
there's the plant it's pitch black you
can see on the frames you're looking at
me it's pitch black you will have night
vision actual detailed night vision in
pitch black guys now yeah of course the
the plant is not as saturated it's not
the same quality as what you would get
without having to shoot in pitch black
but it's way better than what you would
have captured otherwise you will be
amazed at what you're able to produce in
environments you never would have
imagined taking photos before okay so we
have sound learn it all firing trim oh
wow so it's not a separate speaker
grille the sound is firing from the USBC
port yeah whoa I don't know if I've seen
that before
but not exclusively it's coming out of
the earpiece as well I don't know hmm I
know how it compares to the other stuff
we've tested recently
it's totally usable it's not the loudest
that we've tested I think you'll be okay
with it but it's not gonna be the
loudest performer on the block so anyhow
what can I say I don't know that people
have so many questions about huawei the
brand and of course their flagship
devices got the fancy colors it's got
the wireless charging they added the
wide-angle lens which to me is an
improvement over the p20 pro and of
course you have the bigger battery here
if you're a power user 4,200 milliamp
hours the one consideration to make is
if you are cross shopping this versus
the note series device over here you
don't have the s-pen now for me that's
not such a big deal I didn't really use
that pen so nonetheless I'm still on the
pixel right now I need to figure out
what I'm gonna switch to next we've
talked about it a lot it's become sort
of a meme you guys are down in the
comments like who look who's switching
again yeah I got a switch all the time
how else am I gonna give you the
feedback if it's a meme sure but it's a
necessary meme when I wrap up and switch
to my next device I'll give you all the
feelings this device or the oneplus 60
or some other phone leave it in the
comments down below I'm gonna take a
quick glance through and hopefully it'll
influence my next device and then the
eventual feedback that you'll get from
me from the extended usage through
slipping the sim into that new device go
ahead have fun with your memes I'll just
be out here doing my job for you because
it's what I do too much saliva
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
