my pocket and thought hey this would be
useful and helpful to other people if I
do a quick size comparison to show you
and give you a better idea of the new
form factor on the new s4 as you can
tell the s4 Dwarfs the iPhone 5 in
pretty much every measure from height to
width but there is one that's very
similar and that of course is thickness
I was very surprised at how thin the s4
is if you've ever held an iPhone 5 you
know it is miniature in terms of depth
and the s4 it really doesn't disappoint
in this particular department being very
very close to the iPhone 5 even though
it is a larger form factor in pretty
much every other way it kind of has to
be because it of course has a 5-inch
screen I also carry around a nexus 4 as
most of you know keep in mind that's not
on full brightness in this particular
clip but something that surprising here
is even though the Nexus 4 packs a much
smaller screen or slightly smaller
screen in every other sort of form
factor dimension they are almost
identical so we're talking height width
and of course thickness this means as I
told you in the last video that the s4
is giving you more screen real estate in
a smaller form factor then probably
we've ever seen before which is quite an
achievement in terms of design anyway
