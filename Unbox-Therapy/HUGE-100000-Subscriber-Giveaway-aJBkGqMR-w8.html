in my Jeep right now I went out got
myself a little iced coffee from
Starbucks and I wanted to give you guys
a quick update because I'm super pumped
up about something that is happening on
the channel we are about to hit a total
of 100,000 subscribers which is an
incredible feat and a milestone really
that I want to celebrate with you guys
old subscribers new subscribers
everybody who helps make this content
possible I want to do something special
and give something away to show some
appreciation for exactly what you guys
do and so as a result I've selected
three items at this point preliminary
selection of three items that I want to
give a way to celebrate that big
milestone but since we haven't quite hit
100,000 subscribers yet I can't let out
that information just yet but for those
of you that can't wait and you want to
participate and find out as soon as
possible about this giveaway you can get
a head start by joining me on my live
show tonight which happens at 9 p.m.
Eastern Time that's New York City time
and I'll put a link down in the
description bookmark that link and come
back at 9 p.m. not only will you find
out what I want to giveaway for my
hundred thousand subscribers celebration
but you can also have some input I'm
gonna be announcing what I want to give
away during that show but if you guys
want to see something else if you have
other suggestions you can come to the
live show participate in the chat and
give me those suggestions and hey you
might be able to influence exactly what
gets given away at the 100,000
subscriber milestone so very exciting
stuff I'm excited to give back to you
guys after all you do a lot of work
making this content possible watching my
videos hitting that like button
favoriting my videos you know everything
that you guys do sharing them to make
this kind of stuff a possibility so you
definitely deserve something back and
you guys know I'm always giving stuff
away during my live show just to show
some of that appreciation but this is
gonna be bigger and better this is gonna
be the biggest giveaway that I have ever
done on the channel and for those of you
that have been around for a while you
know I've given away some fairly
substantial things so anyways that's
enough about that remember during the
live show tonight
and participate in what we're going to
be talking about and participate in the
development of this huge giveaway and
find out what I want to give away and
other than that I do want to quickly
touch on the ultimate gaming PC project
which is moving along swiftly and
beautifully and I am just super pumped
up and amped up about getting started on
this build I've already started to
select components that I want to see in
this system I've been talking to you
guys we've had been having conversations
about you know what kind of motherboard
you guys want to see what kind of
processor should be in there
graphics chips so on and so forth I've
been having some amazing discussions
with you guys who are obviously very
sophisticated viewers and I totally
appreciate if you guys have suggestions
things that you want to see in the build
you can get at me on Twitter once again
that's twitter.com slash unbox therapy
on my Facebook page those links are down
below too or even in the comments
section of this video if you have things
that you need to see in that build let
me know down below now we've raised
almost $4,000 I think there's about
we've raised maybe 30 850 to this point
and that's an incredible accomplishment
to say the least but as you guys know
that the ultimate gaming PC is not going
to be cheap and I really think that
we're gonna get more entertainment and a
better result out of funding the entire
amount I think there's about 18 days
left on the campaign and so far there's
been just over a hundred contributors
total which seems like a lot but when
you think about it you know there are
tens of thousands of people that watch
these videos and yet only such a small
portion have gotten involved in the
project which i think is crazy only
because this project represents an
insane opportunity for those that are
involved as you guys remember I'm gonna
be giving this PC away at the end of the
build so it's going to be going back to
you guys so consider that when you can
get involved in this project for as
little as $5 that's really not much at
all there are obviously other perks
involved in the ultimate gaming PC
project things like the limited edition
t-shirts I think there's about 20 of
those left maybe and some other perks
that you really need to check out so if
you haven't visited that page yet if you
haven't contributed yet I think you
should reconsider
and I'm gonna drop a link down below
once again this this PC is not going to
me I'm giving it away when I'm finished
with it and so as a result I think I
think you guys should really be as
excited as I am to get this thing built
to follow the project along to
contribute and then to eventually be
eligible to actually win this thing so
anyways that's been kind of long-winded
I covered a couple of different things
remember if you want to talk more about
my hundred thousand subscriber giveaway
if you want to find out what I'm going
to be giving given away and you know if
you actually want to participate in the
selection process of some of those items
make sure to visit the live show tonight
9:00 p.m. Eastern as I said before links
in the description all the links I
talked about are in the description
thanks again for all your support all
your thumbs up all your favorites
hundred thousand subscribers coming
right up
