all kinds of cool things including ford
vehicles they've also got some really
cool features including sink sink is
about helping you keep connected while
you're on the go one of the most useful
features our sink is its ability to
control what you listen to sync applink
gives you the power to control apps like
pandora and slacker radio with your
voice sometimes you want to listen to
your own tunes safe makes it so easy it
gives you hands-free control of your
music digital music player USB Drive or
any other compatible storage device even
better if you ask it to play similar
music state will even use your tunes to
make a playlist thanks again to ford for
powering unbox therapy CES special</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
