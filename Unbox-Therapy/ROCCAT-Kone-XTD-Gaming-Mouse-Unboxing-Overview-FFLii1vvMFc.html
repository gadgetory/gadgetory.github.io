therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Roccat Kone xt d performance gaming
mouse as you can see on the table here
there are a number of different products
that were sent to me from row cap we're
gonna get started with the mouse in this
video and then we'll move on to the
other items in future videos so stay
tuned subscribe if you haven't yet and
you can check out this entire lineup but
this video as mentioned is all about the
Roccat Kone xt d now the first thing
that stood out to me taking a closer
look at the box is the two customizable
LEDs which are multicolored and they run
down both sides of the mouth so you can
pick you know something that's suitable
for you something that matches other
items in your gaming setup you've also
got precision aiming at 8200 dpi and
overall a really nice fit and finish I'm
sure you'll start to appreciate that as
we get inside the box something else to
mention is that this is a configurable
Mouse in terms of weight so you can
actually insert and remove weights
depending on the type of feel that you
like some gamers prefer a lighter Mouse
others like to have a little bit more
weight there so I do like having that
option so that you can pick and choose
whichever is suitable for you as always
guys if you're interested in pricing and
availability on the Roccat Kone Gaming
Mouse or any product for that matter
featured on unbox therapy you can always
check out the description I will have
relevant links down there to make your
life a little bit easier on the back of
the box you can see some of the features
on the device you have a braided cable
which is generally a good thing it means
it's less likely to get tangled and
should last a little bit longer be a
little bit more durable you also have a
tough four D wheel that just means it's
going to move in four different
directions so you've scrolled forward
back and of course side to side alright
let's go ahead and get into the unboxing
after all this is unbox therapy you guys
know the tagline this is where products
get naked so let's take a closer look at
the Roccat Kone I will grab my trusty
blade that so many of you guys always
ask about if you guys are interested in
the knife that I use I will link that
down in the description too might as
well because I still keep getting
questions about it even though I talked
about it in the official office tour
video so the first thing you're going to
notice inside the box is of course the
main attraction which is the mouse and
like any mouse on box
so you don't really expect to get too
much else in the box that's just because
there aren't really too many accessories
you can give with it now in this case
you do have one accessory which is the
little case with the weights in it which
will allow you as I said earlier in this
video to configure the weight of the
mouse depending on how you like it I'll
give you more information on that case
as well as the weights towards the end
of the video you also have a little bit
of paperwork this is standard stuff from
Roccat it just explains how to get the
device up and running actually that's
pretty easy just plug in the USB more
importantly it tells you how to
configure it you know in terms of the
customizable buttons depending on how
you want to use it whether it's
productivity for gaming you know a
specific game or something like that you
can obviously customize it so that it
suits you the best on the bottom there's
a little trapdoor at first I didn't know
what this was for but this is where
you're going to install those weights it
comes shipped with no weights in it and
then all the weights are in the
containers so you can sort of figure
that out as you go along find something
that works for you now here's a closer
look after all this is unbox therapy we
get you even closer than the initial
unboxing there's your USB connector
followed by a closer look at the mouse
from the top you can start to appreciate
the dual LEDs there one coming down each
side of the mouse following the curved
line which looks pretty damn cool these
are customisable with four different
colors so you can pick a color suitable
to your setup you know so it can match
the other items in your setup or you can
have it cycled through if that's the way
you like to get down the mouse is very
comfortable to use at least organ amelie
for me it fits my hand very well it's
actually very comparable to my
performance MX which I use pretty much
every day so here's a closer look at
that little carrying case for the
weights each one is 5 grams so you could
put in 1 2 3 or 4 and then you can put
them back in the case when you're not
using them or maybe you want to travel
with them I don't know depending on what
you do if you're a gamer maybe you have
different weight classes for each game I
don't know I'm not here to judge you do
what you need to do anyway guys if you
enjoyed this unboxing please remember to
leave a thumbs up down below and I'll
catch you on the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
