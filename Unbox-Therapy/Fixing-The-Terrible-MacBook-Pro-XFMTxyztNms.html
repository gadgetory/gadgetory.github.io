play at the highest level I'm saying it
for years Jax finally catching up you
may have noticed things are little
different than usual around here above
me is the cameras been it's hanging
there we rigged it up is it going to
fall down and destroy me it's quite
possible alright I hope not but I might
have to upgrade the insurance policy
there's a scene 500 this is like a
cinema camera it is at least 25 pounds
up there today I've got an important
video to make and it's especially
relevant with me moving into the new
space and potentially having a new set
up a new computer setup you guys
probably know I've been using the new
MacBook Pro this guy over here right
this one with the touch bar and just USB
type-c ports now man have I been
immersing myself in the world of USB see
it's not all created equal last night I
was trying to connect various
peripherals to realize how many of these
USB C cables that are out out there
aren't actually 3.1 compatibles and now
you're not getting video display out of
them and compatib and so on I've paid
how much money for that laptop and the
USB type-c cable that connects that
comes in the box that powers it up is
USB 2 going on here then ok I don't know
am i nitpicking I don't think so I'm
just saying they should have given a
better variety of cables because really
this is a cable issue I like having that
much throughput all right each one of
those is a Thunderbolt 3 capable port
but this whole cable situation requires
some kind of conversation so this video
right here I'm going to show you what
are your options when it comes to
diversifying the USB C port whether it's
on this MacBook Pro or other devices
other laptops that strictly have type-c
connectors now in front of me I have a
product this is a hub it's called who -
who - now if you had a judge of products
strictly by its name you might be a
little bit concerned at this point but
this thing it takes a single USB type-c
hopefully 3.1 cable and it gives you the
variety of outputs that you would have
had on the old MacBook Pro pretty much I
think I think it's identical now they're
not the only ones in the game
another one over here as well these are
called the chocolate hub it looks like a
piece of chocolate but this one goes a
step further because it actually adds qi
wireless charging to the top part of the
hub so i'm going to be comparing the two
of these right here this one here is
going to add an SD card reader it's
going to add an HDMI port traditional
USB s your old peripherals audio
interfaces things like that could take
advantage of those now let's crack this
one open and see what it offers up
comparative to the chocolate hub you
know what I like about this too is this
another type-c connector on here so I
like that this has an in and out so this
one it comes in a few different colors
silver grey gold graphite rose gold
they're hoping that you match it up to
finish you chose on your on your macbook
pro no qi wireless charging on this guy
but this one does have the cable three
USB traditional USB ports here you see
one of them is SuperSpeed for faster
charging you've got that SD card slot
listen a lot of people who shoot video
on SD cards this is very important to
them so that's their and then you've
also got HDMI port I mean next for video
output right you want to be on a TV
something like this your DC in in case
you need a little bit more juice I'm
assuming this guy plugs in over here oh
look it lights up Jack can you pick that
up puts that flash have you at this
point solved the biggest problem with
the new MacBook simply by adding this
dongle I guess so I mean I guess in some
ways it's more versatile than then
adding a bunch of different cables and
adapters and so on like an independent
dongle or each peripheral this is kind
of nice in that sense it's all in one
place but at the same time it's kind of
large like look at that I don't know you
got this super slim laptop is this
really what you want to carry around a
lot of people would probably be better
served by just picking up the adapter
cables I know a lot of people don't want
to go out and rebuy all these cables but
in the long run if think about it it
saves you from having to remember a
dongle and a cable you just go into the
cable universe so the most complained
about thing when it comes to these
laptops beyond the fact that they're
just incredibly expensive is the fact
that you're giving up some of the port's
you had on the previous version so
here's a couple of
Isis I'll link them down in the
description to bring back and
potentially fix what some would consider
to be the biggest problem with the new
MacBook if you want qi wireless charging
you got it here in the chocolate version
or maybe you're just maybe you just get
hungry you don't care about that you can
get something a little bit smaller with
the cable already built in from whoo -
and then who - like a tribe in Africa or
something probably not spelled like that
also can I complain about something else
is that okay Jack do I have the stage
here do I have the microphone let me
complain about one other thing is it
happening to me all the time recently
I'm like this
alright the hands are up on here and you
know you're typing away maybe you're in
an email maybe you're writing something
or you're about you're getting deep with
it whatever it is and I'll just be
thinking I'll lean back a little bit and
the finger will slip up onto the
touchpad and in the email client the
send button is right there you know how
many emails I sent it just like end at a
particular word and I'm not even done
yet that's happening to me lately so I
mean that's my issue I suppose I could
turn that off in particular apps and so
on but it's something to think about you
never know you might end up sending the
wrong email to the right person and who
knows where you'll go from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
