is a head massager you're like glue what
channel am i on right now cuz you're
blowing my mind you might have thought
you might been sitting there thinking I
didn't know that this thing existed
Thanks I don't even know what what is
the name of the company does it even say
it just says head massager on
intelligent air pressure high frequency
magnetic field infrared heating multi
frequency vibration and soothing music
holy smokes that's a lot of things in
one now if you're like me you spend a
lot of time you're on the computer you
gets trained a little bit like Jack for
example this is him half a day rub in
the eyes rub in the temples stressed out
get yourself something like this and you
keep it moving and you find that
relaxation you find that inner peace
because you deserve it
and the Japanese are here to help let's
jump inside this box because my life
been forever changed can you look at
that maybe it has been changed
there's headphones in here as well the
remote control over I don't know some
various things temperature method I
guess of the massage type and then music
then your headphones also plug into here
now it looks like this thing is
battery-operated this takes four
doublea's okay so some adjustments can
be made here for size you spin this get
it to the right size
oh very soft to tighten it back up oh
okay oh and get a real nice fit on there
one guys think about that look right
there can this whole massager really run
off of four batteries the future of all
human relaxation here
oh oh oh oh my god
it's even got a banger on it can you
guys whoa
where has this been my whole life all
the distress me anxiety it's all gone
three different songs different program
for the I am being squeezed with real
force off of these four double A
batteries it is it's like uh ah the neck
the temples
I've never my life experienced something
like this you could set a timer on it
five ten fifteen minutes and there's
also the temperature control oh man oh
oh I just switched up the pattern now
it's got a vibe to it
whoa you know even if you don't need the
Japanese bangers this is the music oh
I unplugged it as a speaker in it you
hear that now this is a daily routine
people are trying to talk to me about to
a fine dinner it's this I'm in the movie
theater it's this I'm editing videos
it's this this on the top here does the
vibration and this fills with air
powerful air that sort of squeezes you
yes I look like a crazy individual right
now but I don't care do I look like I
care do I look like I'm in heaven hun
