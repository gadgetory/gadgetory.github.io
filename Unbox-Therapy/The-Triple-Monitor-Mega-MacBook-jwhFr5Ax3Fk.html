contraptions they're called mount II and
what these guys do is allow you to clip
an iPad onto a laptop in this case a
matchbook the reason you might want to
do it is for multitasking to create a
multi monitor laptop scenario now
normally you'd only do it with one iPad
but I was like that's just not exciting
enough let's get to two iPads one
MacBook and create a triple monitor
freak show now once you get connected
like that you're probably wondering well
what do i how do i what's on the iPad
what's on the laptop well there's an app
it's called duet display and it allows
you to extend your desktop on to an iPad
in fact there's another one called air
display as well as a couple different
ones each with different features and
functions let's crack these babies open
how many people wish they had a
multi-monitor setup on the go but you
don't want to have a separate external
display they're big they're heavy they
require a power source because they
don't have a battery building well an
iPad sort of solves all of that little
adapters I'm guessing depending on which
MacBook and which iPad that's the thing
right there and its own so there's one
let's get the other baby cracked open
tiniest little instruction manual
MacBook and MacBook Pro use D or F okay
D is pre-installed they're like these
little spacers of course once you figure
out which ones you need you should be
all set so if I crack this open just a
little bit of this action here oh wow
that's a lot more secure than I expected
it to be and that just clips in Wow okay
so you can kind of leave it on there
take it off this up to you
now could you do it in portrait mode as
well I don't see why not
oh I'm not sure I might even like that
better doing some editing get yourself a
little bit of real estate back Oh Oh so
it kind of clamps down you get a core
slew get with the times bro right Wow oh
this one has a black skin on it from
dbrand
but look at this can you appreciate
what's happening here that's the laptop
I always wanted you know what really
gets interesting is when you go with
this duet app that I'm talking about
duet display it's called you plug in via
USB and lightning and the reason for
that is because you want to get close to
zero lag lag is a nightmare anytime
you're extending a display yes trust
oh it's launching whoa that is crazytown
that is so odd okay hang on a second
here I can do 60fps high-quality I'm
gonna try retina resolution this is like
my laptop but a stand it over onto the
iPad now obviously if you're using it
for video you're gonna want to be in and
look at that it automatically adjusts
the resolution let's say I've got
Twitter open on this one maybe I want to
use it portrait mode look at the
multitasking right now I've got a half
way between the two I can drag it over
here like at that final cut open look at
me right now who's better than you you
show up with this thing right here in
the Starbucks they're gonna be scared of
you look at this dude what's he's uh
he's hacking the Pentagon over there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
