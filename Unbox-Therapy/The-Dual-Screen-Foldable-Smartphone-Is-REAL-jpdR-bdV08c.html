any other phone that I have ever seen
which says a lot because I've seen a lot
of phones this device right here is a
real standout because it isn't just
another slab another rectangle no no no
no this is the very first dual screen
smartphone that I've ever seen and I
want to say thank you to ZTE for
allowing me to be one of the first
people in the world maybe maybe this is
even the first unboxing I'm not sure the
acts on em whoo TV mode is waiting for
you set up TV mode and launch DirecTV on
your favorite video app two screens on a
phone I have to say we're we're used to
seeing these similar devices there's
something refreshing about something so
unusual two screens one smartphone some
earbuds I believe are just gonna use the
mini jack connector because yes this
thing still has a headphone jack a power
brick which it looks to support quick
charge oh this is kind of cool
they've done the sim tool in a little
keychain kind of holder so you've always
got it on you spontaneous sim switches
and then also an adapter here from USB
type-c to micro USB Gorilla Glass 5 on
the front and back and I think that's
kind of important on a device like this
because you're gonna be constantly
placing it down on glass on the bottom
of the device we have our type-c
connector a power switch which is also a
combination fingerprint reader volume
rocker up and down SIM tray and then a
configurable Quick Launch button could
launch your camera TV mode or other I
like a configurable button it doesn't
just do one thing it does what you would
like it to do a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack that's gonna make a lot of people
happy look at that whoo that's a 20
megapixel camera and it's the only
camera on the device but that's okay you
essentially get this really high
resolution selfie camera which then
becomes your main camera as well and
then this represents the secondary
screen the construction here is
basically all-metal here we go oh my
goodness are you kidding me the gadget
Fanning me is rejoicing that something
this unusual can still be manufactured
by a major phone maker in this day and
age that's cool
cool hinge contraption in this cutout
here to keep everything sturdy
satisfying click when it finds the spot
listen okay so here's the setup screen
it's telling me that TV mode is waiting
for you alright let's go ahead and add a
fingerprint here on the power switch
over here my middle finger here on my
right hand there's a dedicated button
for changing screen display modes can
either mirror work in an extended mode a
dual screen mode or single screen with
the other one turned off oh wow
it's actually pretty quick and just like
that
we have YouTube open by default my phone
just operating as expected on the left
hand side so you can have some news
going on over here you're doing a little
reading and watch some unbox therapy at
the same time I can also turn it like
this and look what happens it almost
starts to feel like a portable game
console that's pretty wild in extended
mode just double up my display size for
one of the functions I can have the
video playing above and be scrolling
comments on the second display at the
same time whose kid new see how I'm both
sides of the hinge it's reinforced with
metal it's solid this one does a dual
whoa you're with somebody at lunch
enjoying the same thing and the other
person on the other side of the desk can
now watch what you're watching one side
two sides and same goes for portrait
mode this is essentially gonna stretch
your display regardless you're gonna
have a bezel in the center here so
that's something to keep in mind I get
it there are other options for
multitasking a window within the display
but nowhere near the amount of real
estate that two displays could provide
as a regular smartphone you just flip
this back you know hey how's it going
what's happening and so on
you know now I know you're gonna have
questions about the camera I did myself
and when you launch it it actually
prompts you to switch to the other
screen so okay so this is selfie mode
here wow I'm getting a 20 megapixel
selfie right now what would normally be
the rear camera can now be utilized on
the front camera so to flip it over I
can just hit the button that I would
normally hit here just like that I now
have a rear camera
our wonderful model here with the
vibrant green SIM tray microSD
capabilities as well so it's coming out
of two spots one speaker grille on the
bottom and then one forward facing from
the earpiece people can't spy on you
I've heard of this okay I'm glad it's
not just a single spot that it fires
from you potentially cover that up a
little bit or you're holding it like
this you might not be able to discern as
much as when you have audio firing at
you even if it's only to a certain
degree it's got four gigs of RAM 64
gigabytes of internal storage but as I
mentioned before that's expandable
through the SD card slot Android 7.1.2
but I have been told that ZT is already
working on rolling out the latest
version of Android for the device I
could just be responding back to Jack
with all the emojis in the world that
took you three minutes to text that back
the little monkey guy Jack apparently
only takes one emoji at a time see this
thing here is it's all about the
multitasking it's about the power users
you're lying there you're on the couch
it's a pop pop pop it's all going off
it's it's one app it's another rap it's
Instagram it's snapchat it's YouTube and
texting at the same time for it's a
really big display for one thing the
hinge acts as a kickstand I'm gonna be
really interested to see where this
thing goes
because it is so unusual you know I'm
gonna use it for a little while and see
how it goes and I want to ask you guys
something if you had two displays on
your phone at all times what would be on
each display</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
