At Unbox Therapy
Now, If you some sort of Unbox Therapy aficionado
You can go back through the Inventory and you can tell me if there is something I missed
But I don't think anything is gonna beat this
This, my friends is the $20,000 smartphone
*Flabbergasted and grabs his cap*
It is from a company called Sirin Labs
And the phone is called The Solarin
We are dealing with a very fine piece of machinery
There is gold involved
Maybe even diamonds and leather
And all the wonderful materials that exist on this planet are apparently inside this box
And a part of this phone so;
Green emblem on the front
Whoo-oo!
Thats $20,000 dollar green
Anticipation here, holy smokes
Okay
Whoohoho
Woah
 
Is that carbon fiber?
And the gold on the outside
Holy smokes
Conor Mcgregor
he needs one of these
Get the phone you get to go with the Bentley.
On the back here I can see the camera
I also see this little switch on the top
Apparently, you switch this over to security mode and immediately all of your communications are encrypted
Because remember
You are crazy wealthy
If you are walking around with a $20,000 phone
USB-C port. Looks like it
Speakers on the front?
It looks like forward facing, finally.
A headphone jack as well
Cause' this looks like a door
This; this must be it here
the little SIM tool goes on your keychain
Also carbon Fiber
Top secret. Secret Agent style.
So takes the Nano SIM. Install in there
Slide it up
Where the SIM card tray goes. This becomes your volume rocker as well.
Now also in here
Look at the way
Look at the way they did the unboxing experience.
USB-C to old school USB or
or you have USB-C to USB-C
Here is the power brick.
North American prongs, perfect for me
The international adapters as well
look at that
They were telling me that with this phone you have any kind of issue
They are actually flying a guy out from head office
If they can't fix immediately you are getting a loaner phone
It's incredible
ooh. Solarin Privacy guide
From the moment your phone is switched on
State of the art cyber security software is protecting your privacy of all your communications
While you are using your phone Solarin is Inspecting and analyzing the behavior of websites and applications
Continuously monitoring the operating system and communication networks
Suspicious activities are analyzed in real-time by a dedicated team of experts in an undisclosed control center
Holy smokes
When the security shield is on
All non-secure incoming phone calls and texts are blocked
Wow that is some next level, that's some CIA stuff right there
and you can invite family members and friends and business associate
So that person then receives a link and then can download an app on android or ios.
to participate in this incredibly secretive exchange
Special hardware on your phone authenticates the identity of the communication to 256 bits
AES End to End encryption
The encryption idea here is that imagine that your message or your phone call
Is inside of a container , on the other end when it gets to other individual
It is packed out of that container and in the meantime
as it is moving across if it were to be intercepted , the person trying to get in there
couldnt open that container
Ooo-oohh
An included Headset
Interchangeable Ear-tips
Those are actually pretty nice looking
It doesn't necessarily have to be for everyone , there are plenty of phones that are out there
For Everyone!
This is a special thing on the fancy end of the spectrum
 
Are you ready.
Oooh Okay! Lets setup the fingerprint.
Ooh!
We are in!
We've got a custon launcher on there
Let's test out the camera.
It says 17.8 Megapixels
Lets get that thumbs up Tom!
There it is.
Not bad!
You,
Looking at me
Looking at you.
Now the selfie camera, this is 8 Megapixels.
Look at that beard, I'm looking like Santa Claus these days
Now there's also some HDR settings and Video settings as well
Phone: Video clip test
Phone: Testing the video on the $20,000 Solarin phone
This fall! Cinema event you've been waiting for
What happens when when I switch this on?
&quot;You have just turned on Solarin security shield&quot;
It's got a whole different look to it.
Woah...
So you just... you go ahead... this is were you put in the people that are... approved
Its like a phone icon, and a text icon, and that seems like thats it
Like...
your the president or whatever, and, and you got to like... you gotta go down to the basic communication level
Your not playing angry birds
Independence day!
There's no time for angry birds!
You flip the switch, and its calls and texts
With the people who are approved to be there, to do so.
People probably try to call me right now
Guess what they're getting?
A message telling them they're second class citizens
We go back to a regular looking android phone, and...
all of a sudden,
Its code red
Boom!
Matrix mode
You heard about all the news, you know, the NSA, who's spying on who. Who's doing doing what. Who's leaking what
Jacks telling me right now he feels less secure just seeing this matrix mode right here.
Man's got an iphone in his pocket, those photos will put this man in jail
This is like the CIA type communication for a regular person, and do you have 20 Grand to spend on a phone? No, maybe you don't
This is the rolls royce right here.
With the picture on your wall, your a kid right now
and you know one day your going to say, alright, I need that
Its my time to shine
That's real gold, my friends
I don't know, could this thing take a bullet? Probably.
Did I officially clear that with the legal team
I did not
*Music*
Ooh...
*Music*
Ooh!
*Music*
Uh huh...
Yes, you were saying...
*Loud Music*
Who was the phone for?
I think you guys know, its for big wigs. You know...
Its for dudes who got a lot of cash, I mean, I just got to say it! That's who its for.
Exclusivity, you know. Exclusivity comes at a price. It always does.
Your going to have the margins associated with luxury, it costs you more to fly in a private jet, you know this stuff.
Let me tell you something...
The world of absolute luxury is completely crazy, and that's why its cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
