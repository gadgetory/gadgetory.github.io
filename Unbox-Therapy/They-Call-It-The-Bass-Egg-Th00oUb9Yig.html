mix like a strawberry daiquiri this here

torture eventually either way um if it's
sick beats right Willie do ladies and
gentlemen Willie do Jack right here
ladies and gentlemen Willie do here we
go even the table it's a lot of low-end
it's almost exclusively based but when
you put it on the acrylic thing you get
a lot more mid-range back is dependent
upon the surface you stick it to sounds
good
there's sound better than the table
itself Oh No
