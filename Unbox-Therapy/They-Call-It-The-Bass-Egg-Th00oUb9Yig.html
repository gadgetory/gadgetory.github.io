right into the mix like a blender in the
mix like a strawberry daiquiri this here
is called the base egg you know what
that does no idea I'm sort of speaker
some sort a speaker but unlike any
speaker you've ever seen before
look at that foot on it look at that
thing right there sticks to the surface
and the surface becomes the speaker it
becomes the amplifier look at that right
there read that one Willy do everything
is a speaker look look deeply into their
hearts and mind and tell them that it
once again no they look deeply at this
note here everything is a speaker

of dust that's very trippy these mean
anything you could stick this to how do
you feel with the with the wielding
actually you know what you want to do
that should I let him can he handle here

thing
Oh like a four out of ten maybe Oh
powerful vibration speaker that turns
any surface into rich booming sound then
find your sweet spot desks coolers
surfboards kayaks even this box

apparently he represents experimenting
okay they're telling us what each
surface is gonna give us wood deep bass
rich mids glass clear transparent sound
metal strong bass thumps Manship like if
we're wondering about it seems like a
question for Tom Tom ladies and
gentlemen what am I doing here ladies
and gentlemen Tom something you get
out of here
and what does it mean Tom has often told
me that he's quite the thumps man
himself they've also included this
protection to your face egg I think it's
like a rubber it's heavier than I
thought it would be how slick that
surface is there this little pad does
all the work I'm gonna stick it down
right here Oh baby

rattling you Kate
they can hear that Street button oh my
goodness
this might be nicer yeah Maci yeah let's
see if I put on the outside
maybe have a fish tank though so the
fish can get loose is it possible if
fish might enjoy it or is it just
torture eventually either way um if it's
sick beats right Willie do ladies and
gentlemen Willie do Jack right here
ladies and gentlemen Willie do here we
go even the table it's a lot of low-end
it's almost exclusively based but when
you put it on the acrylic thing you get
a lot more mid-range back is dependent
upon the surface you stick it to sounds
good
there's sound better than the table
itself Oh No
table shops investing
it's definitely gonna blow some minds
they're gonna be surprised I guarantee
go to I guarantee it
I don't think I've ever heard a sound
reproduced in something that size with
that much bass that's it enough said we
did it all
