right now is this is this is this
acceptable alright we're back got
another product here check out it's part
of awesome stuff week here we got the
bose soundtrue headphones and on my
channel my goodness I have probably
examined hundreds of headphones so this
is something I'm very familiar with the
first thing that stands out to me here
is just how small these little boxes
it's pretty impressive obviously
targeted at travel I can tell right away
on the back here you'll notice there's a
case that goes with it alright so let's
go ahead and jump inside the box to take
a closer look at easy Wow look at this
little case right here a little zipper
on the outside pops open there they are
just fit right in there you can get rid
of this this one also has a built-in
microphone at least it looks that way
and some control is so volume up/down
and also a play/pause button you're also
going to use this button here for
answering phone calls and ending them
but they are headphones after all and so
the important thing is how do they sound
oh wow
super duper lightweight
it certainly feels a little bit like a
little bit like the low-end is
accentuated here but I'm not hating on
that that's that's sort of where I'm at
anyways they have many different
accesses they move on you notice as I
sort of rotate them here I mean up like
this this way this way
really the emphasis is portability here
and still maintaining some level of
sound quality that you're happy with
I got a you know give them a little bit
more of a test couple different genres
you know how that goes so something to
keep in mind I'm blasting these
headphones right now so whatever you're
hearing as far as bleed is concerned
that's at maximum volume I thought you'd
appreciate that okay I have to say
honestly for such a lightweight pair of
headphones something this small and
portable is pretty impressive and the
fact that they fit in a little pouch
like this I can see myself traveling
with these just from that component
alone in fact that they're super tiny
and they're super lightweight go hot
water view hold up
know where I'm fit I'm filming right now
guys this is like we're in the video
it's about the headphones we're on the
road there's no sorry hey I'm gonna talk
about Saturday
I'm not trying to be Jax I'm just saying
that no no you're cool yeah cool you
know hey if you want yeah you're great
want it
if you guys want to see that any of that
pepper stuff those hot peppers go check
out hot pepper gaming on YouTube there
they're also participating in awesome
stuff week all right
time for me to put these back on just
fade out of here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
