little bit longer what's up guys Lew
here back with another video and today I
am checking out the Nvidia shield as
well as the various accessories that go
with it
so I've got the shield itself this is
the 16 gigabyte version there's also a
500 gigabyte version I've also got the
shield controller the most advanced game
controller that's quite the statement
the stand for the shield and then the
standard remote which has a microphone
built-in for voice commands a more
traditional remote for maybe people in
in your household that don't want to use
the game remote now the shield is a
competitor to various set-top box types
multimedia devices this one takes it to
another level though because it supports
4k that's right I said 4k that's what
you might be watching this video in
because we of course shoot in one more
time 4k yeah I hope so sometimes I
forget how hot these lights are so on
the back of the box you can see here we
have Android TVs so you can take
advantage of the wonderful world of
Google Play 4k movies and TV as well as
Dolby 7.1 surround pass-through so if
you got a surround sound system you're
golden and then lastly games you can
play a new class of Android games only
on shield they've got a pull tab on the
front but it looks like the seal that
needs to be broken on the back so let's
do that trusty blade wait I didn't even
need it there this is important stuff
guys there's a little tab here to you oh
that's how she's satisfying it's
actually quite safe no knife necessary
wow this is actually a pretty cool
design here I'm a fan it's futuristic
looking on the back of the device is
where you'll find all of your various
ports so here we have expansion for what
looks like microSD there's a USB port
two USB 3.0 ports so of course one of
them is the micro style and then the
other two are full-size we have an
Ethernet jack an HDMI port and I'm
assuming this is going to be Power on
the far end here so we have a controller
in here so this is an extra can
roller I guess or two-player games and
they didn't lie it is comfy it sort of
feels like and close my eyes here it
helps me to imagine it feels like an
Xbox can go a little different there's a
groove here that your middle finger sits
on that's really quite comfortable so
two analog thumb stakes of course a
d-pad Y X a B buttons and these look
like capacitive touch buttons probably
and then down here you have a quick
volume + up - down on the top a
headphone jack for a headset obviously
microUSB port for charging the
controller also they've included an HDMI
cable good job Nvidia they've also
included a micro USB cable this is cool
you can see the logo there Jack this is
not going in the video yes see because
I've said that now that it's not going
in the video it's definitely going in
the video ooh this is a capacitive touch
pad here for volume this feels very nice
in my hand cool to the touch possibly
metal a headphone jack one more time
have your headphones plugged into it get
your audio into your headphones so you
can have a private viewing session and
not disrupt everybody else Wow look at
this we're really building out now
lastly we have the stand so just fits in
there right like that pretty sturdy but
of course it all comes down to the
functionality so let's go ahead hook
this up and take a closer look at the
interface alright so now the shield is
completely booted up and as you can see
we have a very slick interface which is
populated with various content then you
have something called the shield hub
which gives you a few more options for
games as well as things like Netflix
here you can stream games from your PC
using the Nvidia grid system if you want
to play really resource intensive games
on the shield from your couch but they
exist on your PC you can also download
games and there's actually quite a large
variety of Google Play games that will
work and are optimized for the shield as
well as this controller layout so as
mentioned you've got Netflix in this
location here and Netflix does support
4k on certain content
for example house of cards and the newly
released daredevil will stream in 4k on
your shield which is pretty impressive
now moving down to the next line you
have your various absentee and install
on the shield you have access to the
Google Play Store so anything that's in
there you can potentially install onto
the shield for example NBA gametime I'm
a big fan of the various sports apps
that help me to remain cable
subscription free that's right as I move
across you've also got Plex here you
have YouTube as I mentioned before music
and then you have your own photos and
videos so anything that's on your device
you can stream you can shoot you can
cast to the shield and enjoy it on a
bigger display now within the settings
you can either have 1080p or 4k
depending on what your display supports
you can also go up to 60 frames per
second which is really smooth for video
games now speaking of video games it's
probably a good time to play one let's
go with the Talos principle all right so
here we go let's get this game started
check out these clouds here ok so we
have the game booted up and I'm on the
first level so you'd think that this
would be a fairly easy task and this guy
wants me dead and I don't want to allow
that now when I deploy this on one of
these robotic dudes he'll be jammed up
so you can't fire so when he comes by
watch this boom jammed but if you
encounter one yeah that happens
so you refer back to the beginning of
the puzzle the main story here is this
is sort of a console grade graphics
intensive game and you've got it running
on this tiny little shield device so
pretty impressive what this little thing
can do like I said earlier at 60fps I'm
going
a little bit more practice as you can
tell it's so easy to bring this thing
with you and a couple controllers they
can fit in a backpack no problem unlike
bringing a gigantic console and you're
gonna get a local multiplayer experience
on various games lots of classics and
stuff that's far better than what you
can do on a mobile device anyway that
wraps up this video big thanks to Nvidia
for sending this out for me to check it
out this point it looks pretty promising
and there's not much competition in the
4k on your TV space right xbox doesn't
do 4k right now PlayStation doesn't do
4k right now so if you want to take
advantage of that new panel and start to
see all the pixels that you're used to
seeing here on YouTube or on your
computer monitor or wherever it is that
you watch 4k or maybe you don't watch 4k
yet maybe you've been waiting for an
opportunity to upgrade to 4k and you
need the content to go with it this
could be that solution for both games
and media there you have it Nvidia
shield check it out link will be down in
