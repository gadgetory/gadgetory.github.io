going to experience my very first drone
very important moment in unbox therapy
history the solo smart drone with the
gimbal attachment this guy right here as
you can tell this is the setup it is a
smart drone rather than have a camera
built-in this lets you use your own
GoPro hero3 3 plus or 4 I have the 4
Black Edition charging right now so
we're gonna send this bird up in the sky
so a little brace there for your
smartphone run the app see what's up
this guy can do an orbit mode it can
actually follow somebody on a bicycle in
a car as you can see here it's mounted
up without the gimbal so it'll work like
that but it's a little bit you know what
I'm saying this works on iOS or Android
the future whoa Oh My look at the
kickball whoa so that's a Nexus 6p
this guy controls the camera angle looks
like look at that that's the important
part
holy here are the props that's where all
the magic happens charge brick
very important component here I think
it's good for close to 20 minutes okay
last up the gimbal your GoPro goes
inside of here power comes like this
constantly making adjustments for
stabilization I'm going to get this baby
charged up we're going to hit the street
then we're going to hit the sky
so once you get the whole unit set up
and you've got the gimbal mounted on
there as well as your GoPro attached
which you can see is in this location
over here you're pretty much ready to
roll you're gonna need to install the
application right iOS and Android and
then from there there's a couple of
updates to do but then your phone
becomes the monitor for this camera and
then broadcasting that via private Wi-Fi
network out to your display you're no
longer trying to spot the drone in the
sky instead you're doing your monitoring
on the phone and from the viewpoint of
the drone so the interface displays some
key information here you could see the
height of the drone there's a button to
initiate flight the battery level the
charging status of the GoPro is a selfie
mode cable cam where you can set up some
predetermined points and have the drone
follow those orbit and then follow which
will actually have it follow an
individual moving object and then of
course you've got the display readout on
the controller itself which is going to
give you some information as well
regarding battery reception and GPS
another cool thing is the whole
controller it like rumbles when the
drone is coming into land it's almost
like a pulse like a heartbeat like buh
buh buh buh buh boom so you know what's
up you know what you're doing so in the
back you've got controls here for the
angle of the camera on the gimbal and
you can set up some presets as well so
if you've got a couple of angles that
you like you can quickly toggle between
the two preset one and preset two so
there you have it my very first drone
what if I discovered droning is fun a
lot of fun if you haven't flown one of
these things you should definitely give
it a shot and hopefully this is the
start of many successful drone flights
and drone videos I want to cover some
other ones in the market place
let's do it together mean you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
