downstairs and this was in and I asked
you in that video if you wanted to see a
more comprehensive look at this
particular smartphone and you guys came
back with a bunch of thumbs the elephone
s8 probably never heard of it before
which is fun as my good pal ryan would
say but before I tell you the price I
want to show you the spec list mediatek
helio X 25 deca core processor 4
gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of storage
8 megapixel front camera 21 megapixel
rear a 6 inch 2k screen fingerprint
sensor and a 4 thousand milliamp hour
battery and one of the most impressive
screen to body ratios I've ever seen on
a smartphone alright so how much should
all that cost around - 39 to 49 in that
region so under two hundred and fifty
dollars you can get that spec list it's
quite shocking and as you can see there
is almost no bezel at the top or the
sides there's a bit of a chin but that
exists to house what is a fingerprint
reader and your forward facing camera
reflective blue mirrored finish this is
the 21 megapixel camera a single 21
megapixel shooter the speaker as well as
a USB type-c connector power switch has
a texture on it which is a thing I've
been talking about for a while put a
little color on it as well they were
able to fit a couple of sensors up in
this slim bezel at the top the
construction is glass as well as
aluminum so it feels high-quality you've
got a little sim tool they've included a
case just in case you've got a case
that's not such a bad look surprisingly
high quality cable metal tip there USB C
2 headphone adapter included no
headphone jack on this device bit
unfortunate especially considering its
scale it's like you could fit it in
there
dual SIM tray face to screen that's
that's nice so you don't put it in
backwards I have never seen that before
so I have the unit booted up now and you
can now appreciate how much of the front
of it is display now the displays 1440p
which is another thing you probably
wouldn't expect in a
device that's under $250 close to stock
Android and surprisingly snappy feeling
this is all stock stuff and you can see
here it's running Android seven-11
the home button also operates as your
back button so a single tap will take
you back and a push and hold will bring
up your multitasking I've looked at a
lot of displays in this environment and
because it's so bright in here some of
them get washed out but this one is
actually quite decent I mean you look at
the beard hairs Jack detail in the beard
is always a very good sign and that
looks good that's from a previous video
which is honestly I mean it was a
serious mind blow for me put your
headphones on go watch that video it'll
be worth your time this is kind of
incredible actually that this is only
250 speaker time although my
expectations are not super high
it kind of lets you turn up the volume
to the point where the audio is
crackling a little bit so I don't
recommend doing that you probably want
to be a couple notches down from max I
think you're probably gonna have some
headphones plugged into this or have
some Bluetooth ones or something like
that it's really too bad because the
display is incredible
there's no room up top for the
front-facing camera they've had to put
it down here it's lower than you would
normally have it not such a big deal
just hold it up a bit higher
not too shabby actually how the monitor
here shows the phone with my hand
holding it that's artistic jack we can
adjust exposure there's various
different scene modes everywhere from
auto night sunset party and so on
adjustments for white balance sharpness
hue saturation toggle it in for whatever
your taste is it can shoot raw
surprisingly this phone at this price
can shoot 4k video mmm kind of move in a
bit some color so that's a 21 megapixel
picture I have just eliminated the
shutter delay I turned off anti-shake
and face detection and left zero shutter
delay on so if you have the other
processing turned off you can get that
zero shutter also on top we have
panorama mode a picture-in-picture mode
that's kind of interesting
also in HDR mode this fingerprint
scanner here so it's pretty quick it's
not the fastest I've ever tried but it's
nice it gets the job done that's the
package right there find it for around
250 bucks you might pay a little bit
more you might pay a little bit less but
this is good news for customers phones
are getting better at lower price points
this might be my new favorite phone
under 300 bucks
I wish the speaker was a little bit
better I understand why they went with a
single lens system glass on the front
glass on the back this might be the
coolest smartphone that people have
never heard of and I bet if you carry
this thing around you're gonna have a
lot of people asking you hey man what is
that
where did you get it and you're telling
me you only paid 250 for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
