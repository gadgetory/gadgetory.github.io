therapy and today we're taking a look at
the HKS Racing controller for your
Playstation 3 as you'd imagine this
controller sets out to improve your race
performance if you're into racing games
and the way that it does this is by
replacing some of the controls that
you're used to on your regular
playstation controller with some race
specific ones the most obvious is on the
left hand side where your d-pad normally
is instead you've got this control
steering wheel and basically what it is
is it's a spring-loaded pressurized
wheel which is supposedly going to give
you a lot more precision in your turning
the other sort of customized aspect is
on the right hand side of the unit where
your square in X buttons reside instead
you've got full range pressure sensors
they're calling those ones and it just
gives you some more precision over how
much pressure you're applying to those
buttons I'll give you a closer look in a
second now the paperwork here makes it
look pretty damn complicated but believe
me it isn't
most of what it is is the regular
controller you're used to just done a
little differently and the warranty is
actually 30 days which isn't great but
as you'd imagine it's a controller you
know some of you guys ragequit throw
these things around the room so you
can't blame them in the middle of the
unit you've got a macro button and that
controls a little screen there it's got
an LED screen and what's cool about that
is it acts as a digital pressure gauge
to tell you how much pressure you're
applying to your accelerator if you want
to use it that way now on the back side
of the controller we have a joystick
switch that's going to give you dual
access to your left and right analog
stick and we've also got a switch for
your race mode depending on the kind of
game you're playing you can swap out the
square and X buttons for triangle etc
here's a better look at the sensitivity
there you see you can get a lot of
precision control over just how much
pressure you want to apply and that's
going to make a difference that's
probably going to help me out and I need
all the help I can get steering clear of
those walls and other vehicles for that
matter as you know on unbox therapy we
like to get you as close as possible to
the product
as you can see here's a better look at
the design and also a better look at the
switches on the back of the unit there's
that joystick right left switch as well
as the race mode switch and here's what
that little LED screen is going to look
like when it's illuminated and giving
you that pressure feedback anyway guys
if you enjoyed this video then I hope
you'll like and favorite it as you guys
know that helps me out a bunch and uh
you know stay tuned to the channel I got
more unboxings coming up I got products
sitting on the shelf that need to get
unboxed and as far as the giveaway goes
I still don't know anything still
haven't heard anything from YouTube so
you know hopefully it gets sorted out
and stick around the channel you can be
sure that as soon as I find anything out
I'm gonna let you guys know anyways
until next time and as always thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
