therapy and today we're taking a look at
ninja gaiden 3 the collector's edition
this game is PlayStation Move compatible
if that is your style your cup of tea
for me I'll likely play it with the
traditional controller layout I figure
that games like this probably work
better that way but hey feel free to
test it out with that move system and
see if it's something you like on the
back of the box you're going to get an
idea of what's included in this
collector's edition above and beyond the
game itself so let's take a look at the
unboxing that's the purpose of this
unboxing to show you those extras so
first things first there's a box inside
of a box and that's likely where the
figurine is housed it must be where the
figurine is housed because there's not
enough space in the rest of the box here
you've also got the unmask art book the
game a little bit of DLC for Dead or
Alive 5 I believe that's for the demo of
the game then you've got the official
soundtrack yes they are still shipping
music on compact discs I got to go find
a compact disc player to play this thing
in now anyways you get a tracklist on
the inside there a little bit of Dead or
Alive 5 premium edition downloadable
code for the Alpha demo and then the
Ninja Gaiden 3 game disc that I'll show
you here you can get an idea of the
artwork on front on the front of the
case and then on the back a little bit
more artwork as well as the game specs
including the fact that it is a one
player game it does only go up to 720p
though in terms of resolution
unfortunately the game disc is on the
right of the case as it normally is and
then on the left you've got the art book
no not the art book what am I talking
about you've got the instruction manual
which is a legitimate instruction manual
maybe that's why I called it the art
book because there's actually some nice
art in here as well unlike some other
games that ship with basically one-page
manuals this is a little bit more
pleasant so here is that art book I was
talking about the ninja gaiden 3
unmasked art book and I do appreciate
receiving these as probably my most
favorite item in any of these
collector's editions because you can
appreciate the inspiration for these
games after all they all start out as
our
work and then they become animated games
after the fact so the inspiration starts
here it's a great way to appreciate how
much work goes into the development of
these games so this is the last item
here this is the figurine the thing that
probably most people would be excited to
see and the very first thing we're
greeted with is a warning telling you
about sharp points and believe me there
are actually a lot of sharp points on
these things I don't always look at
those things and I wonder exactly what
they're talking about but then when I
actually got my hands on this I realized
there's points all over the place so
this has that old-school kind of
packaging you may remember this from
toys when you're a kid you got to twist
all this crap and get them out anyways
I'm not going to make you watch that you
line these guys up on this little
platform right here and you kind of got
to like fit them together it's not the
easiest thing in the world because their
swords are going through one another
which actually is pretty badass it's
pretty cool I'll give you a closer look
at that in a quick second here so there
you have it you can see it's kind of
like the dual stab situation going on or
one stab one slash yeah anyways pretty
cool blood everywhere
all the rest of it a pretty graphic
little statue or figurine or whatever it
is that you want to call it maybe the
most graphic that I've ever unboxed in
terms of a collector's edition you've
got the blood spatter all over the
different blades here and the sharp
point situation is true there are
definitely sharp points all over here as
I said before so be careful when
handling it but I mean obviously this is
the kind of thing you put up on a shelf
and you're done with it don't give it to
your kids to play with I know mine
always go for these things they always
want to play with them anyways but
anyways moving on from the figurine you
also get this little backdrop if you
want to sort of set the mood set the
scene if you will you can throw that in
behind the actual statue I'm not sure I
would ever keep that there it's just a
piece of cardboard anyway guys if you
