therapy and today we're taking a look at
halo for the limited edition Xbox 360
console which includes the game now I
also picked up a standalone copy of the
limited edition if you guys want me to
unbox that as well make sure to hit the
thumbs up button down below and I'll
film that video immediately after this
one that just covers the console so this
is the 320 gigabyte version as you can
tell very nice looking very different
looking and since it is a limited
edition you're gonna want to pick one up
soon before they run out they are still
available on Amazon
I dropped the link down in the
description a couple of links down in
the description depending on where
you're located in the world but you can
still buy this right now so definitely
go check out those links if you're
interested in pricing and availability
on this model so as you can tell there's
a number of items included inside the
box besides the console you've got a
couple of controllers a bunch of cables
of course your power brick I'm gonna get
to the console towards the end of the
video but first let's start out with all
of the extras you've got some paperwork
from Microsoft a Quick Start Guide some
warranty info of course the game disk
which is incredibly important in a
commemorative copy or commemorative
edition like this particular console as
you can see you have standard definition
video cables really wish they included
in HDMI I see that every time you're not
gonna want to use those standard
definition cables let's get an
old-school TV you've also got a power
cable and of course the legendary Xbox
360 power brick which is gigantic but
who cares it sits on the floor
anyways so I'll put that to the side you
of course plug your power cable into
that power brick pretty self-explanatory
the next item is the controller at least
one of the two controllers and I do like
the fact that Microsoft goes ahead and
includes some double-a batteries with
both controllers so that you can get up
and running right away you can also get
play in charge kits and of course
rechargeable batteries if you choose to
use those in the future here's a closer
look at the special controller of course
this is like no other xbox360 controller
out there the material is translucent so
you can actually see through the
controller to the interior components
and as you can tell you got some silver
lines on there some blue lines you of
course have the new rotatable d-pad as
well I think it's a pretty slick looking
controller for sure now on the front of
the device it's glossy so it's a
lawsy kind of clear see-through material
whereas on the back of the device you're
gonna get a more matte finish where your
actual fingertips arrest which is
probably a good thing and that's also
where you're going to install your
battery around back but as you can see
very cool you can actually see right
through the controller to the other side
in some cases where there's no
components in the way a very slick
design you can see the halo 4 logo
written down on the bottom of the
controller that's a very nice little
touch with out being too in-your-face a
subtle touch because you're gonna have
to use this console for a long time and
with other games as well so a better
look slick for the long term and I
believe that this one does the next
thing to talk about is the cheapo
headset that Microsoft includes but you
can't fault them for it because it's
better to have something than nothing
and if this is your first xbox360 you
can get up and running with Xbox Live
straight out of the box so here's a
closer look at the console and once
again it carries forward the same design
aesthetic that you're getting in the
controller you can see through the
material you've also got the halo 4 logo
a lot of silver accents following the
design lines of the actual console
itself here's a closer look at the halo
4 logo down in the bottom corner and
here's a closer look at some of the
accents closer to the front side of this
particular side of the Xbox 360 now on
the front you of course have the Xbox
360 logo your power button and you're
carrying forward some of the same design
cues some of the same coloring that you
got on the side of the console you're
also going to get two USB ports on the
front this is pretty standard stuff on
any Xbox 360 console they're hitting
once again by a translucent door so you
can see through it on the back you've
got your port for connecting your power
cable you've also got digital audio
followed by analog AV and HDMI port and
that's the one you're gonna want to use
in order to get full HD on this console
you've also got an Ethernet port as well
as a bunch of USBs now the top and the
bottom of the console are pretty much
the same you're gonna get a couple of
fan grills the bottom is gonna add two
feet two rubber feet for the Xbox to
rest on as you guys can tell a very
beautiful console if you guys enjoyed
