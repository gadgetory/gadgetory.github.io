therapy and today we're taking a look at
the sony ps3 wireless headset it won our
first episode of unboxed where you guys
choose what you want to see unbox next I
hope to continue that series let me know
if you guys are fans and this is what
you picked it barely beat out the 55
inch Samsung LED which is kind of funny
since this costs a lot less but I can
understand why a lot of people are
interested after all that you know Sony
Bluetooth headset that they previously
had was a kind of a terrible solution it
was just for chat and only went in one
year etc and these ones are going to be
7.1 surround sound through emulation so
it's going to be done digitally let's
talk about what we get in the box a
little bit of paperwork some fairly
standard packaging here but you can't
hate on them for that these are actually
a pretty good value in my opinion here's
the headphones decent weight to them
they actually kind of remind me of my
sony xba-4 and we've also got a little
USB dongle now everybody hates dongles
but I believe this one serves a purpose
it's probably going to improve your the
distance you can be away from the
console so don't hate the dongle next
we've got the headset and as I mentioned
it's substantial it's like a serious set
of headphones you know this is not a
little sort of disposable headset by any
means and the first thing I notice is
the little microphone there it's got
that retractable style microphone and as
you see it has a microphone on the
inside on the outside that's going to be
used for you know cancellation of the
exterior sound the sound is going on
outside it's got a leatherette kind of
finish on the inside of the ear cups and
also on a headband feels really soft I
actually just put these on my head and
they're real comfortable let me tell you
it I think a lot of it has to do with
that really wide headband it's also very
adjustable and that wide headband allows
for the weight to be distributed well
over your you know head alright so the
next thing we got is a little bit of
paperwork from Sony
and this explains some of the
functionality some of the different
controls on here the most important
button probably that Virtual Surround
button and you can turn that on and off
depending on if you're a fan of it or
not and that's located on the top side
on the Left headphone is where all the
controls take place this is where you
can adjust your sound to voice ratio and
it has a lock in the center to show you
where the center point is kind of nice
if you can't see the gauge so you know
sort of where it is we've got the power
slash mic muting button on here it's
kind of hidden the actual whole side of
the left headphone is where you can
click here's a closer look at that
microphone the retractable style
microphone and you can see how there is
a microphone on the outside as well as
one on the inside and here's a better
look at the materials in use on the
inside of the headset as I mentioned
before they they look and feel real
comfortable so you don't have to worry
about that they're going to feel like a
high-end set of headphones and I've had
enough of those too to know what that
feels like now the right side of the
unit the right headphone doesn't have
much on it here's a better look at the
headband which is also super padded so
as I mentioned you could take my word
for it or you can take these pictures
for it they're super comfortable the top
of the headband is done in this it looks
like brushed aluminum but when you touch
it it feels more like plastic so I don't
really know what material it is but it's
a good look nonetheless
and there's that Virtual Surround on and
off button so anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed this unboxing you know I'm gonna
hook these up and let you know how they
work I've unboxed a lot of headsets so
I'll compare them and let you know if
they're worthwhile if you guys liked
this content then please do me a favor
and hit that like and favorite button
that helped me out a bunch and big
surprise later tonight at midnight I'll
be at the midnight launch for a bunch of
gears 3 coverage and some some unboxings
that you guys can probably guess what
they're going to be so if you're up late
tonight stick around it's going to be
some real cool footage to look at anyway
guys until next time and as always
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
