therapy and we're finally getting a look
at the Kindle Fire this is a very
bare-bones unboxing from the looks of
this box I had to pick this up in the
States because I'm in the Toronto area
and this item is not released here yet
so I had it shipped to a warehouse right
off the border and I went ahead and
picked it up there so a little bit
different than some of the other
acquisition processes for other unboxers
here on YouTube I put a little bit more
effort in for you guys as you guys
noticed the unboxing is very bare-bones
we've got the little instruction card
not even a manual and the Kindle Fire
itself which feels a lot like a
BlackBerry PlayBook and then we've got
the power adapter again just wrapped in
a little bit of paper not even a twist
tie so anyways yeah I guess they're
really trying to be nice to the
environment here you get a micro USB
charger which is always a welcome style
of charger definitely no proprietary
bullcrap here so here is the Kindle Fire
the long-awaited Kindle Fire and as I
mentioned earlier it feels a lot like a
BlackBerry PlayBook if you've held one
of those the form factor is incredibly
similar and even the fit and finish like
the materials in use they're almost
identical so I don't know if they're
sharing the same components and supplier
or what but it's got a matte finish on
the backside and really very little
branding just this embedded Kindle logo
here on the back and not much else so
you can definitely be discreet carrying
this baby around you've got stereo
speakers along top I assume they're
meant to be used in in portrait mode
because of the way that they're arranged
but obviously you're still going to be
able to hear in landscape mode just
won't have that stereo effect and on the
bottom of the unit we got our power
button our micro USB charging port and
of course the headphone port the power
button gives you some feedback via an
LED that'll turn to orange when you're
charging the device as well so nice to
have as you get the device powered up
you'll get into this setup screen here
first thing you're gonna have to do is
hook up to your network just like any
tablet or laptop these days I'll spare
you guys the boring part and get right
into the initial setup here
and as you guys can see it basically
gives you some instructions on what does
what and it's pretty easy to operate
you've got a settings bar up along top
before accessing some of the different
settings it looks like your apps are
gonna live on these bookshelves down
here and your recent items live on the
top bookshelf so let's go ahead and
launch the web browser this is just the
unboxing not the review so I'm just
gonna give you guys a feel around the
device the keyboard is actually quite
snappy and responsive very easy to type
in portrait mode your hands can
obviously very easily reach to the
center of the screen to access the
keyboard and the web browser by default
for unbox therapy launches the mobile
version but the embedded videos on unbox
therapy com are actually functioning so
you can click the play button so the it
looks like YouTube embedded videos
around the web are gonna function just
fine on this device and after we launch
the standard view of unbox therapy calm
the full heavyweight site with the ads
and all the rest of it you'll notice
that the embedded videos function there
as well so that's a good sign it means
that you're gonna be able to watch
YouTube content there isn't a youtube
app natively installed so that's
important but you will get the mobile
version of the YouTube app or even the
desktop version if you choose to go
there you'll notice it looks like flash
ads are running on my web page as well
in the top right corner you'll notice
that ad is moving around so it looks
like it's supported although I'm not
sure I hadn't read much about that so
the only one of the only concerns is
that there's no hardware volume button
and said you've got a control that via
this slider right here in the software
so you can't quickly adjust volume as
easily as you could with Hardware
buttons that's one of the only issues I
see immediately now I actually like this
device so far me and obviously I haven't
had much time to play with it but I like
that the design is understated
everything is matte black and the form
factor is nice too I mean I think 7-inch
tablets are real nice sort of compromise
between you know your smartphone and a
gigantic tablet anyway guys if you
enjoyed this content hopefully you can

viewership that makes this content
possible I'll see you around the channel
