therapy and today we're taking a look at
an all-terrain solar-powered wireless
sound system from the folks at Eaton
this is called the rugged ruckus and it
gives you a splash proof Bluetooth
enabled speaker system for connecting
your wireless devices so you can stream
music to it in environments where you
wouldn't want to damage some other type
of boombox this also has a solar panel
built-in which is pretty unique and you
can recharge the device using just the
solar panel in fact it will charge in
less than five hours if it's in direct
sunlight and then you can use it also
sort of as a backup battery because you
can charge things like your smartphone
via a USB port right on the system so
it's a multifunction sort of Swiss Army
knife of Bluetooth speakers in terms of
specs it's capable of grabbing a full
charge in direct sunlight in five hours
using just the solar panel if you need
to speed up that process you can
recharge it over USB and cut that in
half to about two and a half hours with
a full charge it's capable of eight plus
hours of music play but since you're
probably using this outside in the Sun
it will likely be charging while you're
using it so you probably will never have
to worry about running out of battery
the rugged wreckage is only 1.2 pounds
so it's incredibly portable as a sound
system as a boombox but also as a heavy
duty battery backup and that's what this
USB cable is for to recharge the device
or to recharge your other USB devices
like mobile phones mp3 players etc does
anybody have mp3 players anymore you've
got a little bit of paperwork included
and that's about it in terms of what's
inside the box you have the giant solar
panel which dominates the top of the
rugged Rukus and the speakers are on the
front side I will give you a sound test
as the video moves forward so definitely
stick around for that as I mentioned
earlier it is water-resistant and
they've achieved that by covering up
most of the inputs and outputs or all of
them all the ports with a rubberized
sort of flap that you have to remove to
get access to them the rugged ruckus
does support analog audio devices
through the use of an
hillarie Jack which is essentially a
headphone jack so if your device doesn't
support bluetooth or you don't want to
use bluetooth streaming you still have
access to these speakers using a
standard audio cable there is a fairly
bright light as well which you can click
on the back here - I suppose identify
the fact that the port is active and
that you're using it maybe if you don't
want to drain battery or something you
can remember a little bit easier by
turning the lights off you've also got a
USB port here as I said before this is
going to be used to charge your devices
and once again there's a light there and
a switch in order to identify the fact
that you are charging so you don't waste
battery when you don't want to okay so
it's time for the grand finale I've got
the zoom h2n audio recorder set up in
front of the rugged Rukus and you guys
can get a sense for how it sounds
so there you have it some pretty
impressive performance out of such a
small unit especially one that can get
its power from the Sun it's pretty tough
to portray to you through a video like
this how it sounds in person because
you're using headphones or the speakers
on your iPad or laptop or something like
that but trust me it is impressive for
such a small unit and I definitely
recommend checking it out anyways if you
guys are interested in pricing and
availability on the rugged ruckus I will
put a link down in the description if
you enjoyed this content please remember
to leave a thumbs up down below thanks
as always for watching and I'll catch
you on the next episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
