information that really shouldn't be new
because we should have known about it
already
that is the battery capacity of the
brand new iPhones the 10s 10s max and
the 10 are unlike pretty much every
other manufacturer in the smartphone
space Apple does not expose the battery
capacity for their devices at their
keynote or even on their website you
can't find it anywhere they prefer to
quote improvements in talktime or video
watching time things like this without
actually telling you what the milliamp
hour rating is of the batteries that are
going into their devices now they do the
same thing with RAM as well and
ultimately this means as a customer you
just have less information at your
disposal when it comes to making a
decision about whether or not you want
to purchase one of these devices so come
on Apple just give us the number don't
make it hard to find anyhow in order to
sell their devices in China they
actually have to submit to China's
Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology in which they have to state
the battery capacity of the devices that
they'll be selling there locally in
China but of course the devices will
pack the same battery regardless of
where they're sold around the world now
there's a really interesting finding
when you look at this document here
which was originally posted by Mac
rumors you come to find that if the
iPhone 10 s actually has a slightly
smaller battery than the iPhone 10 had
around 2.2 percent less than the 27 16
milliamp hour battery in the iPhone 10
26:58 milliamp hours for the new 10 s
now you're probably already aware that
Apple hasn't been putting the biggest
batteries in the world in their devices
not even 3000 milliamp hours in
something that has the footprint of the
iPhone 10 but the surprising part here
is that in the keynote and on the
website Apple is stating that the new 10
s will actually outperform the 10 in
battery life even though the official
milliamp hour rating is smaller on the
new version now of course this can
happen through various software
optimizations and so
but to the regular customer watching the
keynote you would assume that if they're
stating an improvement you probably have
a larger capacity battery it looks like
that's not the case on the iPhone 10s
now the iPhone 10's max it's the largest
device that Apple has ever made and
because of that it also has the biggest
battery its clocking in at thirty one
seventy four milliamp hours which puts
it almost 17 percent larger than the
battery on the iPhone 10 and almost 20
percent larger than the battery on the
iPhone 10 s last up we have the iPhone
10 R and it has a capacity of two
thousand nine hundred and forty two
milliamp hours but it's apparently gonna
have the best battery life overall this
likely has to do with how it consumes
power with the different display
technology from the other versions it of
course has an LCD panel where the 10s
and 10's max are using OLED alright so
last up let's talk about RAM since it
was also disclosed within this document
the two flagship models the tennis and
the tennis max are gonna have four
gigabytes of RAM whereas the 10 R the
budget version of the next iPhone only
has three gigabytes so I felt I had to
bring this information to you guys I
think it's important I think it will
help you make a purchasing decision and
I think it's unfortunate as well the
apple doesn't just state it because it
makes it seem like a bigger deal than it
actually is I mean if you just come out
and say it then people can make a choice
and they're not gonna think there's
anything special about the details but
by not disclosing it you make it seem
like there's something nefarious at play
here like you've got something to hide
essentially so there you have it the
actual milliamp power ratings for the
new iPhones the thing you wanted to know
a long time ago well now you know and
you can make a choice with the actual
data and not these weird top time up to
25 hours improvement of 10% 15% all-day
battery life I hate the marketing
mumbo-jumbo and is not just Apple that's
responsible by the way seen it in
various keynotes all day battery life
whose day my day your day have a nice
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
