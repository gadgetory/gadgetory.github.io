Jack's working day and night what's up
guys Lou here back with another video
and today it is a fresh installment of
three cool tech deals today I'm bringing
you the latest and greatest in the world
of tech and deals combined like this
boom to kick it off we've got something
from our good friends at D brand skins
if you don't know what those are I'm not
sure where you been because they've been
here on the channel before today is a
very special day they are launching a
new pattern you see this in front of me
this is bamboo and because of that to
celebrate the entire site is 30% off for
the next 48 hours 30 off for the next 48
and that goes for all skins all patterns
all devices
so speaking of devices I've been using
the galaxy s7 from Samsung oh look so
pretty and I've got a matte black skin
on it you might want to pick up some of
this bamboo before it all sells out
because that's what happens talk about
it on unbox therapy and the world runs
out of it because the world's right here
on the other side of this lens you are
the world we have a cut okay now into
the Amazon deals speaking of the Galaxy
s7 or s7 edge you now have your micro SD
card slot back I know you guys were
clamoring for it so I'm bringing you
some micro sd heat to kick off this
episode 128 gigabytes Evo class 10 micro
SDXC from Samsung 39.99 original list
price 97 bucks there are other sizes
available depending on what you need and
depending on what you need to store guy
like Jack you can never have enough
storage you guys know why you guys know
why
samsung card for your samsung phone if
you picked up one of these new devices
or any device with a micro SD card slot
I wish more manufacturers had expandable
storage Apple I'm looking at you I know
it'll never happen
but I'm looking at you next up there's a
deal on the blue studio energy to $129
instead of 179 now if you don't know
anything about this phone it's got a
giant 5,000 milliamp hour battery in it
which could give you up to four days of
battery life can use this device also to
charge up other devices if you choose to
you want to be friendly like that I did
a video on this exact device so if you
want some more comprehensive information
go watch that video I'll link it in the
description but essentially you're
looking at a pretty substantial value
here at 129 bucks that's 50 bucks off an
already cheap price for a phone of this
caliber next up this one is a little bit
more I mean it's not for everybody but I
feel like if this is for you you
probably know it this little guy here
plugs into any USB port on your computer
could be a Mac could be a PC it sort of
extends the Wi-Fi capabilities of your
device so there are many ways to improve
Wi-Fi performance if you've got a weak
signal wherever you are but in many
cases you can't go in and really adjust
the network setup you can't replace the
router you can't put an extender on
there I don't know why I'm not here to
judge you but if you can modify the
reception the Wi-Fi reception of your
actual computer laptop or otherwise that
might be that might be just what you
need one of these little guys plugged
into a USB port can substantially
improve your Wi-Fi reception
maybe you're way up there and the
routers all the way in the basement
because your dad said so well I don't
know but this little guy for 16 bucks
should help to improve the performance
of your network I went through I read
some of the reviews there's one guy
talking about grab an internet
connection from across the street last
one of the day you have seen this
product the legendary iPhone lighter
case with multifunction god-knows-what
you've seen it here on unbox therapy if
you haven't seen this video you have you
have really missed out it's got a bottle
opener a lighter it's it's incredibly
rugged it's got a tripod mount on it
this is like I need every I need the
kitchen sink look at this thing you're
opening a beer and then you're like I
need to light a cigarette I don't smoke
for the record but I thought it was cool
for like survivalist type dudes outdoor
type guys anyway if you want to see it
in action go watch the video this thing
is on sale right now anywhere from 1799
to 1999 for the iPhone 6 and 6 plus 6s
and 6s plus wow you want to show up a
little bit or maybe you just want to get
a gift for somebody this is a cool
little gag gift or whatever it's like
look I got you the iPhone case with
everything in it because that's how much
I care about you don't smoke but open a
bottle here in there rear-facing selfie
game look how quickly look how quickly
it gets focus on me maybe I'm too
excited about this I certainly don't
look excited in this frame right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
