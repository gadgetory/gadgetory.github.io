another video and today i am bringing
you what Mel B claims our tangle free
earbuds excuse me
everybody's been using your buds for
many many years and tangling has just
become part of the business so let's
just say you're still looking for an
inexpensive pair of headphones skip out
on the whole tangling part of things Mel
B she used to be a spice girl I guess
she's still a star you always a spice
girl once a spice girl always she's a
spice girl
Scary Spice you got this company she's
got these ear buds my question is to you
mrs. Mel B are your headphones any good
or do they suck I'm probably somewhere
in between it's a weird kind of design
there's like this sleeve that goes
across the headphones she's happy about
it now these ones apparently have
adjustable base as well oh my goodness
if you've got like I don't know ear pods
lying around keeping a purse purse how
many females are what if you're a female
watching this I appreciate you because
you are part of five percent of the
overall viewership five percent of a big
numbers a big number but I'm just going
to shout out to the ladies right now
why not purse bag whatever you call it
headphones get tangled in there
nightmare rat's nest hate it anyhow
there's some extra ear tips in here as
well and here are the actual headphones
firmly pinch the tube at this point
pinching tubes oh here we go
crunch correctly why are they so
concerned what happens if you don't
crunch correctly I'm pinched in this
point and I'm pinching at this point
okay
then these go left right up in here and
down to there okay that makes sense
now how do you put them away firmly
pinch then pinch the tube here and
stretch it oh my god this is gonna be
magic okay here we go oh
success you'd get more used to this
overtime left boom
max earbud miss then you're done grab
here no more tangles good crunch bad
crunch is pushing it too far this way
okay I didn't do that
no bad crunch here no bend don't bend on
the crunch straight crunch ha ha ha ha
no slingshot jack you see that there but
the idea of just a simple pair of
earbuds in your bag that never become
tangled all right so earpods so here's
what happens ok like rat's nest these
are not even that bad right now let's
say I want to use these right now
ah ha you get the point it happens
everybody's experienced it before right
like cool we get the point
thanks Mel B what do they sound like
their headphones after all it's kind of
important there's an N and a B and a
little arrow now when I spin it
I go to B I go to bass mode they're
describing N as soft pure and are as
strong dynamic
oh yeah way more bass obviously that's
the idea so I guess that's kind of cool
you can tune your sound a little bit I
don't know how much better they sound in
ear pods to be honest I think I feel
like I need to do this right now because
and I'm tangled to finally do a quick
comparison here I've got to go back one
more time
these fit deeper in your ear canal
obviously with these types of tips here
now these don't sound like some of the
insane Oh million-dollar headphones that
I test here obviously if they're
considering these because tangling
headphones has been as your life been
altered by the tragedy that is tangled
headphone
yeah and they're a little better than
this people are there sit you're sitting
around like what's up with your
headphones man they look a little I
don't know it looks a little weird
you're like what sorry I didn't hear you
I was just asking about those
phones of yours uh sorry what is that
just turning my bass knob buddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
