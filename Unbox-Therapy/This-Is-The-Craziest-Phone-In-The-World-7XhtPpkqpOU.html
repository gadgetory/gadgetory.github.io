I've done a couple videos about really
weird phones all right the world of
phones is kind of crazy in a way that
was unexpected you know I took a trip to
China I was looking at the weird stuff
trying to uncover the weird for you but
today I've got to go back and reevaluate
the whole thing because in front of me I
have what I know not what I think what I
know is the weirdest phone period the
weirdest phone on planet earth it's in
this nondescript white box in here and
the special part it's like 27 bucks it's
affordable
now we'll do had nothing to do with this
okay this was actually a tip from one of
you guys it was like glue you have to
check this out I need to know if this
thing is even real first things first
you know something's a little off you're
like that's a bit chunky that's a chunky
looking phone there don't click off okay
you don't know what it is and no one
says BLT there's no bacon no lettuce no
tomato pay attention more now than ever
Oh giveaway you see this Jack huh huh
explain yeah it ain't for cleaning your
parts I want to see you in the comments
guessing like I know what it is now
right but don't lie and watch the whole
video then go back and guess it's no fun
this is not a game I haven't thrown
anything at Jack in a while so I caught
him off guard there this is the phone
I'm gonna call it the BLT cuz it says it
on there though I'd rather have a bacon
lettuce tomato right now army green very
rugged apparently this thing is
waterproof 3,800 milliamp hour battery
you see that Jack you didn't expected it
says shaver on it because this
smartphone this smartphone has a shaver
on it I don't even what is what even
what what's even what anymore
what are we doing simulation theory
inception dream within a dream unbox
therapy within unbox therapy inside of a
shaver inside of another version of
unbox therapy on a typewriter forever
with a monkey this is crazy
I think somebody had to make this they
had to come buying these things there
had to be a factory and there had to be
drawings before that there had to be
meetings what kind of werewolf dude
needs to have the speed dial and the
speed shave all in one probably one like
me actually you see what's going on here
the Marlboro Man is the guy who needs it
he's always clean-shaven even though
he's on the horseback he's in the Wild
West no one in the Wild West would have
been clean-shaven what day I had to buy
this you guys don't understand this was
an insta buy for me like I saw this I
got the tip clicked the link and I
bought it you need to know that there is
no end to human ingenuity does have a
very bright flashlight in it because why
wouldn't you let's just throw that in
there USB in and out you can charge up
another phone
nanananana darling darling shave your
face you're disgusting lalala actually
you know what for a $30 phone I actually
kind of like the UI compared to some of
the other weird phones
what is charger baby well well dual SIM
gotta have it there's a camera whoo here
we go oh man darling darling darling go
and shave your face today that is the
one audio file on the phone once again
I'm longing for your hungry touch full
body shaver watt voice let's try to hand
region over here actually
you seen that difference that's smooth
as a baby's bottom right look at that
will you're not impressed that's a
smooth end I don't know it shapes what
are we doing are we evaluating the
quality as a shaver it's 20 bucks and
it's also phone.i this is on the fringe
this is a fringe product one of the
major accomplishments in human history
now if you want to challenge the weird
phone champion status of this phone
right here then let me know down in the
comments send me your links I want to
see them there's weird phones but I
don't think you could beat this one so
step your game up kids the weird phone
Olympics starts now try to dethrone this
monster good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
