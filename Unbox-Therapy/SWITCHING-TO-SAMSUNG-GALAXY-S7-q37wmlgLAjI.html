another video today it's gonna be a
little something different that's cuz I
was thinking talking to Jack trying to
figure out something interesting a new
kind of series recently you may have
seen a video in which I switched in
which I switched to the blackberry print
as my personal daily device essentially
what happened was I took my same card
out of my Galaxy s6 active put it into
the BlackBerry print and then went on to
use that for I guess what is now almost
three weeks getting all these phones
coming into the unbox therapy
headquarters all the time it was like
men how do I decide which one to use and
for how long and so on and so on and so
on so I decided that the best way to
deal with this influx of phones is to
use them as my personal device remove
the SIM card insert it into the next
device and actually fully transition my
lifestyle the purpose of this video is
to continue that transition from the
BlackBerry Prive and now into the hot
fresh galaxy s7 sitting in front of me
right here as you can tell it's also
wearing a very slick D brand tuxedo
there Sam is gonna tell you a little bit
about my experience with the BlackBerry
some of the differences benefits
drawbacks and what I'm looking forward
to with the s7 so the Prem I was
concerned about switching to this device
how well was BlackBerry gonna be able to
integrate a real Android OS on to some
of their hardware of course this also
features the full keyboard which I mean
how would that all work it hasn't been
as much of a transition as I expected
compared to my galaxy s6 as much as I
like the texture of the material on the
back it's just a big phone you know
angular corners and whatnot moving from
that to the s7 my goodness the s7 is one
of them comfiest phones i've ever held
it's got curves in all the right places
sometimes you forget just how nice it is
to have that real single-handed fun
shonali associated with a manageable
screen this super slim edge on the edge
just makes it a tiny bit less
comfortable to hold in my opinion
nonetheless this is the one that I'm
going to be using for the next little
while now just to wrap up a little bit
on the BlackBerry I would say it's a
fairly easy transition for somebody
coming from Android afterall it's
running Android and everything you would
expect to find on Android I got a lot
less use out of the keyboard then I
expect it to get unless it was for
scrolling this touchpad that exists on
here is kind of nice maybe if my mobile
lifestyle was more text eccentric tech
centric text centric the keyboard and
some of its functionality is cool for
that as far as like moving around your
cursor without having to try and find it
with your finger the speaker at first I
was a little worried about it I was like
and it seems like it should sound louder
I tried it out with a bunch of different
sources and I determined after some time
that the speaker is actually pretty good
and it's forward-facing I think
ultimately the thing that I'm going to
be happiest to get away from is the
camera it is just not on the level of
the cameras in the s7 and s7 edge things
I'm most excited for about the s7 this
very manageable form factor incredibly
comfy to hold just having my lock switch
back on the on the right hand side
instead of the left getting the really
quick fingerprint sensor back is also a
plus I have swapped out the theme
there's a theme called Android 6.0 in
the theme store which gives you a far
more Nexus like look to your s7
I highly recommend it because you have
the plain black background in conclusion
I would say that what we're finding here
is a lot more parody as far as
manufacturers are concerned once upon a
time there was this vast gap between the
market leaders and everybody else and
that thing is shrinking now sure the s7
is still sort of at the cusp it's at the
bleeding edge from a performance
standpoint these new devices are now
water-resistant up to
one hour I believe in a foot of water
who doesn't want that also expandable
storage both of these devices feature it
they drop the expandable storage on the
last generation now they've added it
back how can you hate on that so it's
the big moment now it is time switch SIM
cards I have the tool of choice we're
gonna move from the BlackBerry Prive to
the s7 I'm excited it's like a like a
religious experience here it's a combo
tray how cool is that how dare you it's
like it's like it's freaking out without
its SIM card it's screaming for life
ready set
boom stay tuned to my social media
Twitter Instagram and so on to see all
the pictures I'm shooting on this device
from this point forward two weeks we
shall start our relationship and then I
will swap you out for something new keep
it locked it starts now you and I and
sometimes Jack</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
