therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Kobo Vox
ereader and this is a lot more than an
e-reader it's a budget Android tablet at
$1.99 it's a real competitor going up
against the likes of the Kindle Fire for
sure and what you're gonna get is a
Android device so it's not locked down
to any sort of ereader characteristics
it has ereader functionality but it's
also got Android 2.3 so you can do all
kinds of stuff with it obviously browse
the web email well anything you can do
with Android right and there's and as
you guys notice right away 7-inch device
is kind of a really convenient size it's
about the size of a paperback novel
really easy to use with one hand and I
sort of think a nice stopgap from you
know in between your phone and your
standard 10-inch tablet
they pulled a little bit of an apple
ESCA move here you're getting three or
maybe a little better you're getting
three Kobo stickers telling you to read
more often you can throw those around
the house to try and motivate yourself
and a little bit more paperwork as well
we've got our power brick which has
micro USB on one side which is nice
because you don't have some proprietary
connector which can be annoying and then
you get your little power adapter
portion that fits on the front and this
will obviously vary by region so you
know that you know you'll probably be
able to pick up some other tips if need
be if you're gonna be travelling I kind
of don't mind those power adapters or
you just take it off - to help it fit in
certain bags or whatever and you're also
gonna get a micro USB cable obviously
that's for hooking up to your computer
if you choose to do that
so what else is in here we get a few
books to get us started that's included
we've also got a chance at a trip to
Europe I believe so yeah I mean that's
cool I don't mind going to Europe how
about you and then we've got a super
straightforward user manual which you're
not even gonna have to look at because
it's basically pull it out turn it on
you know I mean there's really not much
else to it and after you peel away the
protective screen you can notice these
capacitive touch buttons down along the
bottom that control your menu back
home and you've also got your volume
rocker on the left hand side there's a
better look at those capacitive touch
touch buttons the back of the unit is a
real nice matte finish so it ain't a
fingerprint magnet is it a nice grip you
got a microSD expansion port so eight
gigabytes internally and then microSD
the volume rocker micro USB on the
bottom as I mentioned earlier on the
power button and an LED on top the
speaker in the top right corner and it's
better look at that power button so
anyways that's a look around the device
and let's go ahead and get it set up
this is a very straightforward process
but Kobo has skinned it and I'm not
saying I mind the skin in this case
sometimes Android skins come off as you
know hokey-pokey if you know what I'm
saying this one actually has kind of a
cool vibe to it a nice simplicity to it
but what that means is that when you get
in the OS when you finally get it all
booted up everything is very reader
centric so the way it's set up to begin
with is as a reading device from a
software assembler because you can
change that experience if you if you
want to so as you guys notice I love
typing on devices this size it's a real
nice stopgap so I'm typing in portrait
mode holding the device in portrait mode
since it's only about the length of your
hand means that you there's very little
fatigue in using a device like this for
a long long period of time definitely
less fatigue than a 10-inch device which
you know is where the market place has
really been going for the longest time
now as you guys noticed there's a lot of
Facebook editions here already oh comes
pre-installed I'm not gonna hate on that
if you guys know I love to use audio and
but you might argue that there's a
little bit too much bloatware
pre-installed here there's a lot of
extras but you know I guess we've all
gotten used to that over the years and
another thing to mention is that there's
no YouTube app pre-installed instead
when you search here for YouTube it
brings you to the mobile web page and I
don't know why that is maybe there's a
YouTube available in the app store I'll
take a look before the review but that's
okay because you know the mobile page
works just like an app more or less
we'll go ahead and launch the most
recent episode of the Beast feed what's
the V speed oh that's my other channel
here's a little shameless promotion if
you guys haven't checked out my news
channel it's called the beast feed that
youtube.com slash PHP go and check that
stuff out I think you might like it as
well anyways back to what we're talking
about here this is not the quickest
device it's about eight hundred
megahertz but but hey you're paying
$1.99 for it so I think it's a real good
value I've placed a couple of devices
out here on the table the Galaxy Tab 10
one the Kobo Vox and my Nexus S I mean
the Nexus S form factor we all know it
we all know phones form factor it's in
your pocket all the time you know really
easy to operate an obvious to operate
and then on the far end of the spectrum
we've got where tablets have basically
gone more than more or less and in
portrait mode this thing is a really
unwieldy I mean it sort of it's
top-heavy it feels strange using it that
way you don't have that issue in
landscape mode but it's still a heavy
device and you don't really want to
operate it you know with one hand that's
just the way it is it's the size you can
get a nice split keyboard and you know
get away with it but there is going to
be some fatigue just because of you know
the physical layout now it's a very very
thin it's much thinner than the Kobo box
you can see here and there's a look at
the form factor from the top side so
let's go ahead and take a look at the
Vox and as I mentioned earlier nice
matte finish on the back feels really
good in your hand in one hand much like
a paperback novel of course and you know
you've had paperback novels at this form
factor for a long long time and that's
not by accident it's really the perfect
size for one-handed reading one-handed
usage so you know it really lends itself
to usability it's not the lightest
device in fact I think that the tab 10:1
might actually be a little bit lighter
it's hard to tell because of the weight
distribution but like I said you've got
to kind of curb your expectations you
know because of the price of the device
it's a really good entry level tablet
can do everything an Android tablet can
do which I really appreciate and it can
do it for them $1.99 now we're going to
wait and see the Amazon Kindle Fire
because that's probably going to be its
closest competitor again it's
eReader centric and the exact same form
factor I do have one of those coming in
you know
mid-month so we'll throw those ones up
against each other there's a better look
at the thickness I think I mean it might
actually be twice as thick but that
doesn't seem much because the Galaxy Tab
10 1 is ridiculously thin I mean you
could you could slice fruit with that
baby I might be exaggerating so some
other specs to mention this thing has
got you know a 7-inch 1024 by 600 screen
I believe I said 8 gigabytes of internal
storage earlier I'll say it again
expandable microSD memory which is
always welcome and it supposedly got 6
hours of battery life I'll figure it out
out if that's the case and let you know
in the review anyway guys if you found
this content to be helpful exciting in
any way then hopefully you can like and
favorite this content as it does help me
out a bunch I've mentioned it before
other than that hopefully you can check
out my new channel at once again that's
