Peterborough so recently you saw a video
in which I discussed the upcoming iPhone
the iPhone 7 and everybody's all upset
because there might not be a headphone
jack in fact it's pretty obvious at this
point now there's a lot of people that
are not too happy about this so I
decided to bring you a video here to
talk all about headphones and Jack's and
Jack's this my friends is a retractable
headphone case from turtle cell this is
a case with the headphones in the case
I know it's crazy I don't know who this
is for that's what it looks like now
they claim that these headphones are
good as well Kevlar fibers for increased
cables Adam I don't know about all that
let's find out if they're any good
or maybe they suck little tips here all
right
stairs the case oh man it's kind of big
to be quite honest all right it's just
oh my gosh okay so that part comes off
here's an iPhone 6s nice is made for the
six but as you know at the bottom over
here there is a mini jack connector
which goes into the audio jack here now
obviously iPhone 7 this ain't gonna work
that's it
when I was a kid we had a vacuum cleaner
that did did you have one of those this
part clicks in and you know what it's
not crazy now you want to get those
headphones out you just kind of grab
them like that and then hit the button
whoa you have a cutout for your camera
still all your buttons sort of move to
these locations on the side and yeah
there pull that out now the headphone
plug will not be in the phone so the
speaker should be functioning and then
back in and then you're golden
now the kickstand situation I mean
that's straightforward kickstand you're
eating lunch oh look at that
those are magnetic all right music how
do they sound
I think they sound pretty good I'm
amazed at how many decent headphones
exist now it feels like human beings
have figured out the headphone because
these things sound pretty decent does
that really change the fact that it's a
it's just bizarre oh that's fun I mean I
could do that startles me every time
yeah Wow
maybe you're the type of person who
always forgets to bring your headphones
there's nothing worse than wishing you
had headphones when you don't like
you're in a waiting room somewhere you
know what I'm talking about you're
waiting for something to happen and
you're like all want to watch this
YouTube video right now but at the same
time the person next to me I don't
really want them to be involved do like
emergency headphone and a kickstand and
a crazy looking case called turtle cell
and you know I like turtles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
