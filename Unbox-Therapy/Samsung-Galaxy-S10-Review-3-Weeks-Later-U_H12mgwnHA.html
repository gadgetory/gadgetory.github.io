it's actually been three weeks now that
I've been using this device right here
that is of course the Galaxy S ten I
mean I've just been living with this
phone this has been my phone has the SIM
card in it I took photos
I lived live I sent tweets whatsapp
slack email whatever other app this was
my smart phone of choice for the last
three weeks I have some feelings about
it that I think you need to know about
there's some things I like there's some
things I don't like any smartphone out
there I chose to use the standard Galaxy
S 10 not the S 10 plus I just feel like
this is a nice form factor I kind of
like the circular cutout as opposed to
the larger one I mean look it's your
choice you want a bigger display you go
for the plus otherwise they're basically
the same first things first what are you
looking at what greets you when you
unlock this phone it's a display I mean
that's gonna satisfy anyone in a
smartphone universe anyone in the
segment any fan that's out there you
your nephew your aunt your uncle if you
want maybe the best display in the
smartphone game then you go with this
phone I mean that's pretty standard
stuff you already knew it I have a case
on this phone so it kind of diminishes
the edge a little bit after all samsung
has been curving these edges for a while
now some people love it some people less
so actually I really like this case I
forget the name of it got enough Amazon
genuine leather yeehaw ladies and
gentlemen that's rawhide will he do
another big change for this particular
model year we now have more cameras than
ever that's correct that's three lenses
on the back of course you're getting a
wider angle view with these I used it I
used that feature I love that feature in
fact the front-facing camera on this
device is wider than I expected as well
so it's versatile you can get a lot of
shots of course the camera itself
incredible in a number of different
circumstances with or without the wide
it's one of the best performers out
there that I've used recently I want to
put white at pixel level just
the software the the isolation the
portrait effect and so on not that I use
that very much I mean for me this camera
it's an easy pick kind of like the
display again not much of a surprise
here in Samsung's flagship device you
recall that this one features wireless
charging also wireless charge sharing
I'm a big fan of that that's a cool
feature to have now normally I'd say
that's just a novelty you're not gonna
use it very often but in conjunction
with the galaxy buds this could be a
feature that you use on a frequent basis
if you choose those ear buds to go with
this phone while we're on the outside
surroundings of the device here I should
also talk about this button over here
that's the big speed button not a fan of
big speed myself I'm never gonna use it
it has recently become remappable so you
can switch it to something else other
than a Bixby launcher that said it will
still launch Bixby on a long press you
can't you just can't completely get rid
of Bixby there's always some sort of
hook some sort of compromise so Bixby is
still there but the button is a little
easier to live with considering the fact
that you can at least remap the single
press for whatever app launch you want
to have happen the headphone jack that's
right the s10 maintains the headphone
jack
talks about it in the unboxing video
this thing is useful and it's tiny it's
a tiny little piece to add to the
motherboard
of the device and so do it if you have a
big phone anyway I like it I like having
it there okay now what about the speaker
on par sort of with many of the other
flagships that are out there I'll give
you a quick demo here we boost this up
yeah I mean what can I say like I don't
know if it's the best that I've tested
there have been some loud ones come
through here but this is clear you're
gonna be satisfied with it as far as I'm
concerned now another thing a lot of
questions about this that the the
circular cutout the pinhole hole punch a
lot of people asking me Lee how much is
that affecting you are you fan of it how
does it compare to the knotch
I prefer it to be honest if you're gonna
give me this or a notch
I'll take this now grant it I do feel
the need to say like when it comes to
face unlock for example there's way less
tech in here than in the iPhone notch on
the iPhone 10 10 s you can't really
compare them one to one this is less
secure for face unlock but again I'm not
using face unlock anymore so you decide
how big of a deal that is to you but
this is just taking up so much less
space than the average not and then on
top of that by pushing it over in the
corner for whatever reason it just feels
less abrasive to your day-to-day
functionality like I mean you see it
there it's it's big but your eyes are
kind of used to seeing stuff up in this
corner anyways with the battery
indicator and the Wi-Fi connection and
so on and whatever other notification
indicators you have up there so you're
kind of pre-programmed to expect to
stuff up in the corner and maybe that
has something to do with why this is
less offensive not just for me but a lot
of other people have said the same thing
I'm taking this over the knotch
any day of the week I guess I'm a
hole-punch fan didn't expect it but I
guess so you saw my video previously on
the face unlock being really easy to
crack I'm fully on the fingerprint train
now everybody has an opinion about this
fingerprint you see all the comic people
you're holding it too long look we
shouldn't have to have a conversation
about how to use a fingerprint people
gonna pick it up and go to put their
finger on it that's regular human beings
behavior going on depending on
conditions it just it doesn't work a
hundred percent of the time still not as
rock-solid as a phone with a rear
capacitive fingerprint scanner this is
the future this is what we're living
with it's a screen unlocked I mean it's
cool it's magical
that said was the fingerprint scanner in
the back really that offensive you know
if there was something sitting right
over here I don't know you tell me
okay battery life on this device has
been amazing there's never been a day
where I had to recharge before the
evening and be really impressed by that
performance is the same thing it's super
snappy as expected
everything is moving beautifully it
means the latest flagship specs I turned
off bixby from the left swipe so now I
guess I got nothing going on I'm a
1-page kind of guy at least with this
current set up right here I got the dark
mode turned on I adapted quite nicely to
the 1u i Samsung's latest skin which is
like not even offensive anymore so I'm a
fan of that of course I had to change
the buttons the nav buttons on the
bottom to be the right way
Samsung give it out of the box please
it's about time all right let's get it
together there it is I mean solid it's a
good time it charges Wireless or charges
quick over USB type-c one of the best
displays in the game one of the best
cameras in the game with the versatility
of the wide-angle it's kind of exactly
what you expect it to be it's as good as
you expect it to be so of course at this
point the conversation just comes down
to cause the idea of the flagship price
tag is just not that I'm not excited
about not that I won't use it but like I
just feel the need I feel the
responsibility to let you know that when
you're going premium right now it's not
like an equivalent exchange of value
like you're not paying two or three
hundred more and necessarily getting two
or three hundred back in terms of value
I just came off the oneplus 60 for
example and didn't really change my
daily life with the exception probably
of wireless charging and maybe being
bothered a bit less by the location of
the cutout if you feel like you want
this phone just understand why you're
buying it you're kind of in the same
territory as an iPhone buyer just on the
Android side that's really what this is
it's like an iPhone for Android users
because if I'm in the oneplus department
I can get two of those almost for the
price of this and get a new one
for two years or every year and a half
or something like that instead of having
this product right here budget is a big
factor in whether or not this is a good
decision for you if you've got a lot of
budget I say go for it you will love
this phone I'm enjoying using this phone
now there is a question about whether or
not this s10 is vs tend to get some
people have made the case that the s10
II is actually the value point he might
be right I mean it definitely gets
closer to some of those competitive
products at the five $600 price point
it's in a weird space it's not a really
premium it's not really budget it's not
really mid-range maybe I'll switch to
that one next from this I think this
experience straight into the s10 II
experience will give me a nice one-two
punch of like did I notice the
difference was I impacted in a big way
do I feel like I'm missing something
maybe that's the next phone for me
nonetheless you will be happy with this
if you can pay the price if you can foot
the bill that's the galaxy s 10 it's
been like three weeks and I don't think
you'll be disappointed if you buy it but
your wallet definitely will this episode
