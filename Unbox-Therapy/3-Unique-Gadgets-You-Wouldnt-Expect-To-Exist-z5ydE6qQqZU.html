especially this one I've said it before
I'll say it again I'm here to uncover
what's happening in the entire realm of
gadgets and today is no different
something here called the Symphonica a
modular system called vibes something
called the mighty you're gonna get to
learn about all of them a very formal
intro hmm first I want to kick it off
with this vibes system think of it kind
of like moto mods where you can swap out
an attachment on the back of your device
put on this case here then click in the
sound engine this thing looks pretty
substantial or the battery bank 150
times your battery charger so it's kind
of like a bumper so here's an s8
just slam it in there this is your fold
getting chunkier benefit is a lot of
protection wow that is a substantial
speaker so this is the charge doc so
that the speaker is ready to go when you
want to take it with you this also has a
kickstand on it and then you have a
speaker you have a Bluetooth speaker
which is stationary wherever you happen
to be you press this release take this
with you this remains plugged in an EQ
button volume up and down play pause
answer phone call okay so clipping it in
is easy my phone is huge now we're gonna
listen to that in a second but this is
the volt rocks even though it's a type-c
connector to go into the phone it's a
micro USB connector to charge this up
you see we have a full charge there 3000
milliamp hours and then all that happens
is this little piece pops out and you
have a type-c connector on the iPhone
version that's gonna be lightning same
idea it clips in there into there
and we're charging up hopefully this
thing has some battery as well whoa I
was sensual that is why is that making
me uncomfortable well so we'll pair it
up some volume here
let's do a quick comparison here provide
audio honestly I expected to do outer if
I was gonna go through the hassle of
carrying all this around I think I want
a little more juice I think it's a cool
concept but as it sits right now at
least the speaker unit it leaves me
wanting a little bit more next up the
mighty obviously it reminds me of mp3
players before we had smartphones the
cool thing to have was an mp3 player of
some kind it's kind of a throwback iPod
works with Spotify Premium take all your
music with you and the ability to leave
your smartphone at home works with
Bluetooth headphones and wired
headphones thousand-plus song storage
drop resistant water-resistant
disconnect from your digital
distractions and be one with your music
for a present and more joyful light
comes in a couple different colors turn
on tune in drop out let's move USB 2
mini Jack charge port and the headphone
jack a cliff look at this you could clip
it right here this is really bringing me
back to my ipod shuffle days all right
let's see if this thing has any juice on
it probably not any of course there's a
flap and update how dare you all right
so I let this thing charge overnight not
that I had to I mean
and there's my mighty shows up right
away success and now the player connects
to Spotify zero percent of the storage
is being used you see have 96 percent
battery there guess I'll just add a few
things to it there it is and they just
go ahead and sing such a nice simple
little player it's a throwback getting
retro vibes here that's kind of cool
alright so think about it last but not
least it's called the Symphonica passive
acoustic speaker this is some old-school
stuff the amplification is strictly
coming through the design the shape of
it and the original speaker on the
smartphone oh wow whole smells delicious
it just looks cool this is so that you
can at least charge up your device when
it's in here it's also gonna be the
thing that holds the device there come
up through the bottom I guess this
little thumb screw I'll screw it in
these little bands are four different
iPhones five six six plus we're gonna
use an iPhone 10 so and I guess it just
creates a better seal let's try to eat I
mean it's simply not gonna compete with
proper amplification it does make the
sound a little more direct I don't think
that's really what this is about I mean
it just looks really cool but I think
for most people they're gonna be better
off with a Bluetooth speaker but it will
not smell this guy
not even close</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
