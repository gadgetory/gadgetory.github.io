tell I'm outside and I've got an iPhone
5c in my hand that's because we're going
to do a bit of a science experiment find
out how durable this new plastic
enclosure on the iPhone 5c is but we're
going to do a little twist in this drop
test we're actually going to film the
slow-motion 120 FPS footage of the drop
of the destruction using the newly
released iPhone 5s so an interesting
little twist we're going to do three
drops from this height right here my
shoulder height I'm six feet tall in
case you are curious I'm going to first
drop it on its back then its side maybe
like this and then its front so the
three classic drops from this height
right here let's find out how this thing
fares all right drop number one on the
back three two one
so that didn't damage the phone too much
at all it's completely functional all
that you have in terms of problems are
some tiny little scratches on the back
of the device on this corner right here
and a couple more on the other corner
down there you probably can't even make
them out in this video because they are
not substantial in any way but you
wouldn't expect to have major damage to
a phone when it falls on its back the
more problematic drop is of course on
the side or on the front so let's go
ahead and jump into the side drop now so
I'm going to again from the same height
maybe I guess around this height right
here I'm going to go ahead and drop it
down this one I'm a little bit more
worried about so here we go three two
one
all right so as you guys can tell that
actually turned into a front-facing drop
it twisted a little bit in midair but
holy smokes every inch of this screen is
shattered I don't know if it's the
perfect hit or what but here you have it
the front of the device is pretty much
useless now but I know you're all
cringing at home but don't cringe
because I'm actually going to replace
this digitizer and and use this thing
it's not completely dead I'm going to
revive it I'm not just going to toss it
away and waste it so there you have it
we'll go back to the studio now and take
some closer images of this shattered
phone as expected under better lighting
in the studio conditions here you can
really appreciate just how gruesome the
damage is every single inch every single
centimeter of the glass on the front of
the device is shattered although it does
work underneath and this should be a
fairly easy repair because of that on
the back just a couple of little scuffs
from that backdrop so the back does look
pretty durable but I'm going to
recommend that you wear a case on this
device if you're any bit clumsy actually
haven't dropped a phone before myself
but if you're the kind of person that
might drop your brand new iPhone I'll
say go ahead and put a case on might as
well be safe about it as mentioned
earlier this wasn't just for the sake of
destruction I will be fixing this device
and then doing something interesting
with it maybe even giving it back to you
guys
so if you're not a subscriber now would
be a great time to go ahead and
subscribe so you don't miss my next
videos and I hope you guys appreciate a
little bit of carnage for the sake of
science for the sake of learning a
little something about the durability of
the brand-new iPhone 5c alright so that
wraps up this video if you enjoyed it
make sure to leave a thumbs up down
below and as I said earlier also
subscribe if you have it yet okay catch
you on the next episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
