guys know that we do gaming setups here
on the channel
some of them incredibly outlandish like
this one I mean if you didn't see this
video you are you even on the internet
we definitely wanted to do something to
follow up the more practical gaming
setup based on one of the most part the
most popular the most popular gamer on
planet earth right now of course I'm
talking about ninja we have an official
ninja gaming setup for fortnight at the
optimal settings for the optimal
performance and it's courtesy of NZXT
now they reached out and they told me
they have a new site it's called build
you could configure your own custom PC
based on the game that you want to play
plugging the game to the system along
with the desired FPS and it will make
suggestions based on what kind of
configuration is best for that purpose
of course today we took it a little
further with the official ninja NZXT
collaboration so this spec is his spec
you have the ninja color the ninja logo
ninja spelled out through the glass with
his components of choice including that
beautiful GTX 1080p I if you're hoping
to replicate his performance this is the
place to start obviously full disclaimer
here you will not immediately become
ninja if you buy the ninja PC but who
knows maybe you'll be a step closer well
who knows what's next little practice
little ABC yeah little one two three
yeah
little you know me little can't you see
little doremi
okay we take the window off so for this
particular build we are looking at the
NZXT h 700 i case it's got an Intel Core
i7 8700 K at 3.7 gigahertz the NZXT
kraken X 62 CPU cooler of course it has
that GTX 1080
kiai with 11 GBS of ram oh my goodness
32 gigs a very fancy glowing memory look
at that stuff beautiful it's also got a
1 terabyte samsung 960 Evo m2 SSDs got
two of those some quick storage oh yeah
2 4 terabyte Seagate Barracuda drives
now that spec list results in 125 FPS at
his favorite settings some may say
that's a little beyond the scope of
what's necessary but you know with any
type of competitive gamer they want to
have a little overkill on the framerate
right well you only game at 4000 fps
very minimal he only games at a million
fps and you don't want to know what else
he does at a thousand fps so I said to
will I say figure out what the other
components are be covert look around the
web because the man is he went through
the old streams the old he looked and he
found he uncovered the other components
including ninjas most recent keyboard of
choice Mouse of choice Mouse mat of
choice and gaming monitor of choice so
that's the Logitech G 610 okay Luther
red cherry MX super soft touch okay
moving on to the mouse I saw that this
has those weights in it where you can
change the weight of the mouse look at
that logitech g502 it seems to be a
logitech family of peripherals when it
comes to the keyboard and mouse an
incredible number of buttons that you
can configure to get the kills that
you're looking for
mouse mat it has like a really cool name
right hyper x pro it's called the HyperX
fury pro and don't forget to monitor you
would think you would assume your
initial reaction would be like let's get
a big monitor in here a lot of
competitive gamers streamers and saw
choose a smaller monitor for their
gameplay yeah it kind of gives them a
tunnel vision and not really
experiencing the peripherals this is a
25 inch Alienware gaming monitor 240
Hertz
it's got game
written all over it it really fits in
with a setup like this now there are
other elements other things you will see
on the desk but this is the core of how
ninja is getting these victory Royales
pretty much right here yeah this is
almost a victory royale in and of itself
exactly yeah
what we're looking at here is the game
settings for fortnight on this system
and you have set this up in the same
fashion that ninja would have it
basically everything is epic except for
a few settings here 240 FPS for shadows
obviously like to turn them off because
if you're in game you don't want any
distractions that's sort of like the
main world if you want to play like
ninja so shadows off anti-aliasing off
and post-processing low by lowering or
turning off those different features the
figure that you're trying to shoot
individually without a shadow might
might be superior to having it with ya
especially if they're crouched you don't
want to shoot at the shadow you want to
shoot at the person you make this
sacrifice between how good it looks and
how well it performs I also notice he
has vsync turned off motion blur turned
off and of course show fps turned on so
you can watch the FPS in-game so booted
up let's see what kind of frame rate we
get I mean this is just a load screen
but you're hovering around 200 FPS right
up here you're actually hitting your cap
mid game now you you're slamming this
wall your it's a lot of bits and bytes
moving around and you're still well
above 200 FPS so this is and you're dead
that illustrate kind of the beauty of
this build website that's the whole
point of it you set the frame rate first
and the components come after okay so
this is really cool shout-out to NZXT
for sending over this PC and sponsoring
this episode I think it's a really cool
one far as I know this is the closest
anyone has ever come to showcasing the
secretive ninja setup we did it me and
Willy do I mean I couldn't have done it
without him he did the research he's
like a detective this guy it's really
insane what would yours look like pretty
much just like this it's pretty cool and
they expect them to say that who's my
colors you can't buy your way to the top
but you can improve your setup and that
might help you get there is that true it
might help you get there okay
there it is ninjas set up on YouTube
unbox therapy that's where it's
happening
