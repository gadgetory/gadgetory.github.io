another video and today I've got
something unusual for you but I think
I'm thinking it might be incredibly
useful I still don't really believe it
though cuz when I saw this online and I
saw the demonstration I was like come on
show me where David Copperfield is this
doesn't look right what I've got in
front of me is something called the
mighty mug this is the mug that cannot
be tipped over will not fall over it is
the mug that is unspell above what are
you talking about Lou everybody needs
this why if this is something have mugs
been able to tip for so long now I think
this might be the ultimate kind of mug
for your gadget head because as you know
and I know buddy's kind of guys want a
laptop right cruisin cruisin for a
bruisin looking for the next best thing
on the web and generally speaking we
have a drink nearby you tip that drink
right into that keyboard you fry that
logic board that motherboard you're not
a happy camper anymore are you all
because of what you're trying to save
your pennies Lou's cheapo mug instead of
the un-- spill abou one kind of person
are you
I have a coca-cola classic the classics
in the house coca-cola hit me up I'm
still waiting for your phone call this
one is kind of a more traditional coffee
style this one looks like it's for a
cold beverage it includes a straw it
lifts straight up but it grips to the
surface you know that game you play at
those motivational things where it's
like do you trust the guy behind you
just fall back he'll catch you you know
the game I'm talking about that's the
moment we're gonna have it's the moment
we're about to have here jump inside
it's interesting so the bottom part of
it is the fact that it like pivots a
little bit I'm gonna put the mug to the
side for one but like I said they
essentially function is same I just
picked it up and there was no problem so
oh man this is nerve-wracking I got all
this camera equipment over here and I'm
gonna try and tip this thing over
remember what I said coca-cola I'm
waiting for your phone call anytime
phone lines are open
you lift straight up and it comes up but
wha-oh towards the camera hi ah it's
stressful every time it looks like it's
gonna go you feel like it's gonna fight
ain't gonna go what a fight whoa got me
feeling a little mealy Willie that's a
lot of do I slap it
do I slap it Wow
what how do I not have this already how
does everyone not have this I mean if
you could forget about the splash coming
out the top which you could I'm
schooling
whoa man my life has changed
what about picking it up so let's say I
want to take a drink what this is like
two genius
this should be the only cup allowed on
desks across America this one it makes a
simple claim but it's a hell of a claim
and I was skeptical come on</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
