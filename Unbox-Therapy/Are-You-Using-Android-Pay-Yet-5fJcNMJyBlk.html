Android phone now he started to pay with
Android tap your phone it's all you need
to do buy those things you know they're
good for you better next time
sponsored by Google
alright so Android pay you go I made a
few videos about it you watch them they
were exciting they were fun I went down
in New York City I got into all kinds of
mischief trying to get nuts let's get
nuts I was purchasing Doritos I had a
couple of meals I survived 24 hours
using nothing but Android pay but in
that video I might not have given you
the whole picture on Android pay paying
for things with your phone in general a
lot of people are nervous a lot of
people walk up to the cash they start
shaking a little bit something getting
all jittery they're like that's not the
look you want to do you want to have
confidence that's step one you can see
that I have a credit card attached now
the simplest way to add a credit card to
your Android pay is by using the picture
function so right here you can see you
can add a credit card debit card a store
gift card or even a loyalty program card
you would simply place the card down
Jack can probably see that right there
see that check line it up with in there
and then it will be added alternatively
here's the add manually button this will
allow you to put any card number in one
of the benefits here is security believe
it or not your entire credit card number
is not fully transferred to the store
that you're buying something from in the
same way that it would be if you were
just swiping a card so there's an added
layer of security there this phone
features NFC and that's the technology
the Android pay is going to take
advantage of and when you're out there
in the world you're going to run into a
variance in
the pay terminals that exist out there
some of them will be marked as Android
pay others maybe not you might see a
terminal like this with a tap portion
which could have the logo on it it'll
often be supported something that looks
like this where you can then just tap on
a screen so there's something at play
here when it comes to the security
that's referred to as tokenization when
you tap it on one of these devices it's
actually sending a token pin order to
verify that that's legit instead of
transferring your complete number over
to that store and then then having it on
file lilium that's up that's that's a
magnet but it's strong so you can't
really tell today another misconception
that people have is that they need to go
into their phone unlock their phone and
then launch the app and select something
but in reality especially on a phone
like this with the fingerprint scanner
right on the back you pull this out of
your pocket unlock the device and even
though you're not in the app or anything
you would then just hold this up to the
pay terminal it would launch Android pay
and then complete the transaction so
it's really one tap two terabytes I
gotta have two terabytes I got a lot of
stuff to carry around man so you're
obviously going to need an Android
device in order to use Android pay
you're gonna have to have KitKat or
newer from an operating system
perspective and the Android pay app
installed which is readily available and
in many cases like the pixel it's
pre-installed so as you saw in my
previous videos the number of places
retailers and so on that are starting to
accept Android pay those are expanding
in the 25 s in new york video I was at
Foot Locker Game Stop McDonald's I mean
we dip the lift ride oh and of course be
an H we did the entire video at pH P and
H also accepts Android pay get the app
add a card check it out tried it a few
your favorite retailers and see where
you're at it's actually not that
complicated it doesn't need to be that
intimidating all right push the tech
forward that's what we do here unbox
therapy style tap your phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
