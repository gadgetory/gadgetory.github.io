bit of a different note than usual in
front of me here I have a device from a
video a long time ago this is a product
called the Eve V and this was an
IndieGoGo project it raised like 1.5
million dollars it was very popular and
the most popular video that was made on
this device happened on unbox therapy on
this channel I know for a fact that some
people went out and bought this thing
because of the video that I made in fact
I have an email here from an individual
who purchased one of these and he sent
me this message yesterday the subject
disappointed ish that's not a great
subject line I know this is not the
right form to contact you but I have an
issue I don't have a viable contact form
my disappointment is huge enough to
spend my time and heart I trusted your
work on YouTube so much that I spent
$1300 on Eve text surface clone that's
this guy one year later they still did
not ship the device nor refund my money
I'm quite devastated on the one hand I
should have done the research and it
might be my fault either way all right
if he's calling me out or not the point
is I feel like it's something that has
to be talked about because of course I
introduced so many people two and a half
million people to this product in the
first place
now 1.5 million dollars it sounds like a
lot of money it is a lot of money but in
terms of computers like this one that
are about a thousand bucks and up it's
really not that many computers that Eve
had to fulfill so I dug a little deeper
I wanted to know if this was a
widespread thing if it was just
affecting this one individual user
because I immediately felt somewhat
responsible for that video and at least
his particular interest in this product
he probably had the thirteen hundred
bucks in his pocket right now if it
wasn't for my video now I understand
that I'm not responsible for his company
I never told anyone to go out and buy it
to go take a risk on IndieGoGo or
Kickstarter for that matter to be honest
there's there's actually more risk
involved in those platforms than
probably gets talked about and we should
probably cover it a little bit more if
we're featuring a product that is
exclusively
available by those means I should
probably stress it a little bit more
that there are risks involved in
purchasing products in that manner
nonetheless I went into it I just did a
bunch of research I was checking out the
customer forums the forms on Eve's own
website and I noticed that this problem
was not exclusive to this user Eve came
out themselves the CEO and said look we
shipped less than 65% of the sales and
that was awhile ago and the problem
supposedly allegedly the issue was that
a lot of the funds from the original
IndieGoGo got caught up in PayPal
processing and were never released to
the company so because of that they
couldn't get the cash to make the
products or to refund the orders that's
the story it's been covered on a couple
of websites it's been covered on reddit
there's all kinds of threads that you
can see for yourself about various
issues that people have had with this
particular brand know the particularly
bad part about this is that this device
I actually liked it I thought it was a
pretty good deal at the time but if it
was a good deal back then is it still a
good deal a year later if that's how
long you've been waiting for it probably
not and definitely less so now have some
sympathy for any startup making products
is hard especially when you're competing
against the big players like Microsoft
on a product like this it's hard to make
things have a lot of respect for people
out there with new hardware based
companies but this has affected people
people have spent their money on a
product that I introduced them to and I
can't help but feel somewhat responsible
and really the only answer the only
thing I can do at this point is bring
some attention to it hopefully to apply
some pressure to the company which
appears to still exist see the weird
thing about this and the part that would
be particularly offensive to me as a
customer if I ordered one of these in
advance is that you can head to their
website right now put in your credit
card and they claim they'll ship you one
this month
it says December and what are we we're
midway through December right now so
it's got me wondering they're still
accepting new money fulfilling those
orders
somewhat rapidly what's going on with
the older orders like this individual
who's waited a year there are
significant risks involved in shopping
on Kickstarter and IndieGoGo and I'm
gonna try to do a better job to address
that if I ever cover another product
which is available exclusively through
those platforms I apologize if you're
one of the people who purchase one of
these because you watched our video here
on unbox therapy Eve if you're watching
this make make a statement and hopefully
you have a plan hopefully there's more
info here put out a tweet when was the
last time they tweeted it's been a long
time what were you saying
the last tweet was like a year ago so
people are concerned they're wondering
where you're at so I hope you guys
appreciate that I apologize to this
particular user I'm not going to name
his name because he didn't state that he
wanted that to happen but to anyone
affected by this I apologize and
hopefully this situation can get
rectified sooner rather than later
whether that's a refund or an actual
physical product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
