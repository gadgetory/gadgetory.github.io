therapy and today we're taking a look at
a mobile power pack from new Trent if
you guys are unfamiliar with these kinds
of power packs the way that they work is
you plug them into the wall charge them
up and then you've got all this extra
juice for your different gadgets when
you're on the go without the need to
find a power outlet now this one is huge
it's 12,000 milliamp hours in terms of
capacity making it capable of charging
up big devices like an iPad or another
tablet say for example the Nexus 7 and
you can also have at the same time a
smartphone or other smaller device
plugged into it each port is rated a
little bit differently in terms of power
and the device does have two USB ports
so in terms of the unboxing it's pretty
simple you've got a little bit of
paperwork followed by your power adapter
this of course will be used to initially
charge up the unit and then to
continually recharge it next there is a
female USB to USB extension as well as a
micro USB cable obviously this will be
useful for things like Android phones
and whatever it is that uses micro USB
next you've got a carrying case making
travel with the device a little bit
easier and lastly you've got the device
itself the model name here is IMPD 120 d
which is the most powerful unit that new
trent sells if you're interested in
pricing and availability I'm gonna drop
a link down in the description of this
video so you can actually check out this
product page but anyways in terms of the
device you have a DC in as well as two
USBs each one capable of different power
output one is capable of 5 volt 2100
milliamps whereas the other one is 5
volt 1000 milliamps so like I said
earlier in the video one perfect for
tablets the other perfect for smaller
mobile devices they've also gone ahead
and included an LED indicator to warn
you if you're really low on battery and
you have to actually recharge the device
that's sort of how you can tell how much
battery is on there so getting it
connected is very straightforward in
this case it's a microUSB cable since
I'm using a Nexus 7 tablet and you just
go ahead connect both ends power up the
new Trent device in this case my Nexus 7
is completely dead and as you'll notice
it powers it up straight away you can
actually use a device and have it
charging at the same time but you can
charge faster
if you've of course got the device
turned off now this is going to be
useful when you've got these things in
your bag and you want to just have them
recharging while you're actually walking
around same goes for adding a second
device here is my Galaxy Nexus phone and
I'll add that to the second port and as
you'll notice both are now charging here
you can see I've got 79% and I'm
actively charging my phone now something
I was thinking about that would be a
cool use case scenario is to add
something like my camera this of course
is my sony hx5v which uses a proprietary
connector but it doesn't matter because
on the other end it's USB so in this
case I could have these two things in my
backpack charging as I walk around and
this all comes in a very very portable
little package here you can see me
installing it into the carrying case
you're getting a massive 12,000 milliamp
hours in terms of power that's gonna
allow for you to recharge devices that
are huge like tablets as I said earlier
in this video you guys are interested in
more information pricing and
availability as I said earlier there's a
link down in the description I want to
thank you as always for checking out my
content if you guys enjoy it make sure
to leave a like and favorite down below
as it does help out a bunch and in case
you guys forgot I've got a livestream
happening really soon in a couple of
hours I'll put a link in the description
to that I'm giving away some stuff so
come over and join it if you didn't know
about it alright guys I'll catch you on
the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
