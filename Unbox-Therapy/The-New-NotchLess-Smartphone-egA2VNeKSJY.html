smartphone who's just announced it looks
a lot like a smartphone which gathered a
boatload of attention last year that was
of course the vivo NEX the phone in
front of me takes a lot of its
inspiration from that next device of
course it's a vivo device this is the V
15 Pro and what you're looking at is a
more approachable more affordable
version of the next I can go based on
some rumors that are out there that seem
to imply that the price point for this
device is going to be somewhere around
$400 u.s. so really compelling
competitive price ultra full view
display it has a triple camera setup on
the back including a wide-angle a 32
megapixel elevating front camera so if
you remember that from the next video
it's very entertaining it's got a 37
hundred million power battery as well in
display fingerprint first things first
a little case better than what I'm used
to seeing as far as free cases are
concerned and here's the device this is
topaz blue not only does this device
have dual nano SIM slots it's also got
micro SD so expandable storage ooh
wow that is a very nice blue the triple
camera setup oh my goodness there is
also a headphone jack nice to see it
hanging around on certain devices now
unfortunately it's a micro USB connector
but somehow still capable of fast
charging you actually have a dedicated
button for launching Google assistant
also include a headset so wired headset
with a microphone pretty standard stuff
oh all right so gets my face did you get
that Jack
that was that was wow that was so fast
it just scanned me instantly okay now
we're gonna do the fingerprint so now
that it's registered let's go ahead and
attempt to unlock it
first I'll try the fingerprint here hmm
okay I feel like that's quicker than my
one plus 60 and hold on a second here
let me just see something
it's quicker right okay and this guy huh
maybe it's just the animation but it
feels like maybe a split second faster
if you want to use the face unlock you
just what do you do hmm
it's a swipe up so it's just this comes
up I can't imagine doing that every time
just because then you're really using
this motorized unit a lot but it is
quick so let's try and not point at my
face nothing then unlock nothing boom
huh now of course if you launch the
camera app the front-facing camera will
trigger the unit as well now if I switch
back to the other camera on the back it
goes away so let's take a selfie I'm
looking way too beautiful where is the
beauty mode on this they're softening me
out anyway I'll crank that down maybe
we'll put HDR on wow that might be the
best selfie I've ever taken look at the
detail on here and look at the pores in
my skin here you seeing this pores hair
follicles well you want to take a look
at this am I crazy or is that a really
nice looking selfie yeah it is it's very
sharp it is a ton of detail really nice
he was going on yeah that's wild this is
one of my favorite selfies I've ever
taken in this environment we're talking
about 32 megapixels
okay let's flip over to the rear camera
now HDR mode popped on now there's also
a wide lens it is a triple camera setup
tons more in the frame I believe this is
a hundred and twenty degree field of
view now as you can see there's a slider
in the middle there for simulated
aperture as you can tell kind of does a
job with that I like blurring out the
background I'm not such a fan of these
modes I've told you about that in the
past
it's funny the rear camera I might be
less impressed by than the front-facing
one that's a pretty vibrant image this
is an AMOLED display that's pretty wild
at this price point also
but the front-facing one not that's a
crazy unit I never saw such a realistic
selfie that actually looks like me you
know I was critical of some of the magic
that Apple was doing even some of the
magic that the pixel does sometimes and
I don't like that much now this unit
also has a night mode built into it so
we should probably hit some lights and
see what we can come up with whoo look
at that it's dark in here but not on the
camera oh my goodness guys it's dark in
here but not on the night mode Willie do
is satisfied right now
okay that's will on the camera with the
exposure set here's will on the night
mode look at that you wouldn't believe
it it's important to know that this
doesn't have the flagship Snapdragon in
it this one is the 675 but there could
be a good thing from a power consumption
standpoint 3700 milliamp hour battery I
think you can see some pretty decent
battery numbers on here and that
processor should be enough for most
individuals especially price point
considered okay I definitely want to
test the sound on this it's a lot of
high-end but it's loud Wow it's piercing
it's a bit of a no-no say no not City is
that enough
the speaker is possible nowhere near the
best I've seen you have to adjust your
expectations to the suggested price
point now I should also mention that you
do have a skin on this device out of the
box as you can tell here it's fairly
snappy but a couple of things you got to
get used to like you're swiping down
here you see your notifications up is
gonna bring up your brightness volume
and various other quick toggles
something to note at least out of the
box as I said before it's an AMOLED
display all screen this is kind of an
amazing package in fact when you
consider the price point this is the
blue colour the glitz the glamour you're
gonna turn some heads with that guy
right there I'm pretty excited about it
it's the V 15 pro from vivo a new more
affordable incarnation of the NEX origin
I think it's interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
