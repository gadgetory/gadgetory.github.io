therapy and as mentioned in my last
video the UPS man brought something very
interesting to my door today the
PlayStation Vita or PS Vita depending on
which you prefer and this came from all
the way around the world halfway around
the world whatever you want to say from
Japan the Land of the Rising Sun where
this launched early everywhere else in
the world basically it's launching in
February I said you know what I'm gonna
bite the bullet pay a little bit extra
and get this thing unboxed on the
channel so that we could share in this
consumption
you could get some vicarious thrills and
I could do this unboxing properly cuz
I'm sick of those other ones that are
out there on the mark and I'm gonna get
you up close and personal so on the back
of the box the first thing you're gonna
notice is Japanese language which of
course you'd expect to being that it
came from there as well as some
accessories that will likely be
available here as well once this
officially drops in North America and
elsewhere in the world but that's not
what you care about you care about the
device you want to get closer you want
to get a proper unboxing video and
that's what we're working on right now
of course we're gonna have to go through
a couple of more boring items like this
paperwork here that is also in Japanese
and also useless but something I want to
mention to all of you is that if you are
thinking of importing the u.s. manual
has been released online by Sony which
will help you get this thing up and
running so you don't need to count on
this Japanese literature right here so
you can basically chuck this stuff over
to the side and forget it ever existed
the next thing you've got is the
charging cable which appears to be a
proprietary charging cable that's
unfortunate but you've got to expect it
from Sony with a USB on the other end
and then you've got a pretty
straightforward power cable two prong
adapter you know in Japan we use they
use sorry the same standards that we do
here so you'd expect it to work no
problem and then here is the power brick
PlayStation branded USB on one side and
that two prong adapter on the other as I
mentioned earlier now I'm gonna put the
Vita to the
for a second because there is one more
piece of paperwork in here I'm gonna go
ahead and guess that this is probably a
warranty card or something along those
lines but once again it's done up in
Japanese and my Japanese is weak so if
yours is any better you let me know if I
was right as far as my speculation is
concerned so here it is this is the
bread and butter the important item this
is what you all came to see the main
attraction if you will a PlayStation
Vita and I'm gonna tell you guys
straight away the weight of this thing
is perfect it feels really good in my
hands I have probably averaged to
large-size hands and it doesn't feel
small at all in fact it feels a lot more
comfortable than the Nintendo 3ds at
least for me you've got some really
smooth joysticks
and again my fingers can easily reach
without feeling cramped every button
there is to reach the back has some nice
soft touch finishes as well as some
glossy components which will probably
get a few fingerprints on them but
that's that's pretty standard these days
when you're dealing with gloss here's a
closer look you can see one of the
stereo speakers as well as the d-pad and
you can also get a better look at that
joystick and the PlayStation button
below that that's obviously gonna be
used for most of your navigation within
the operating system and you've got the
Sony branding up along the top side of
the left-hand side of the device as we
pan over across that nice 5-inch screen
you'll see we've got our regular
PlayStation buttons as well as our other
stereo speaker the start select button
and of course another smooth joystick
you'll also notice a forward facing
camera up there there is also a rear
facing camera on this device although I
do hear they are not fantastic quality
they're kind of on par with the 3ds as
far as camera quality is concerned so
here's a better look from the top down
on the device and you'll get a better
look here at the overall size of it
here's a better look again at that left
hand side that PS button and as I
mentioned earlier guys the main
objective here is to make you feel as
though you've got it yourself in your
hands and you know you would really be
inspecting every element of the device
not like a quick unboxing
video where you kind of just you know
glance through it now you'd be holding
it you'd be looking around you'd be
interested in everything this device had
to offer the back has a cool pattern on
it you know you've got the triangle
square circle button etc and there's
that rear facing camera that I mentioned
earlier it's a little bit better than
the forward-facing one but neither of
them are really gonna replace your
camera if you know what I'm saying so
you've got your shoulder buttons on top
as well as your power button nice
metallic power button this is where
you're going to insert your games it's
labeled PS Vita and then the next one is
actually an expansion port which may be
used for video out nobody knows yet or
it may just be used for other
accessories I believe they're calling it
an accessory port in the official
documentation and then beside there
you've got your volume up and down these
volume buttons are incredibly
reminiscent of the iPhone buttons as the
verge pointed out actually when I read
their review on the bottom you've got
your charging port and then beside that
you've got your headphone / headset port
which you're probably gonna want to use
because the speakers are not fantastic
on here as you might imagine and beside
that is where you're going to insert
memory cards now memory cards are pretty
important in this situation that's where
you're going to download some game
content too as well as game saves some
games for example like Uncharted
absolutely require a memory card and you
got to use obviously Sony's proprietary
options so once you get it booted up the
very first thing you're gonna do is
select a language and the first thing I
notice is just how responsive the
capacitive touch screen is one thing I
want to mention if you intend on using
the PlayStation Store
assuming you imported this device make
sure to select Japan as your location so
select English as your language but then
Japan is your location that will give
you access to the Japanese PlayStation
Store for the Vita which currently is
the only one that's operating if you
select any other country it's gonna tell
you there's nothing available for your
region so if you want to get you know
Ridge Racer or Hot Shots go for any of
the stuff that's in the store you're
gonna want to make sure to select Japan
as your location even though English is
your language it won't affect the
language anywhere else in the operating
system so here's a quick look at the web
browser you've got this cool sort of
jello effect when you get to the end of
a page
now I was surprised the web browser is
actually somewhat responsive the the
whole device actually feels pretty quick
overall now granted it's not loading up
any of the ads on my web page so it is
skipping out a little bit on some of the
content especially some of the heavy
flash based content which I don't
believe it can load because in a few
minutes here I'll actually go ahead and
load up YouTube and I don't really get
very much you can actually have multiple
windows open
you can search right from here or from
anywhere and you can also view your
history within that web browser from
this same location the PS button will
bring you back out to your main menu of
I'll go ahead and show you guys what the
settings look like within the settings
you can set up things like your
PlayStation Network account as well as
your Wi-Fi network which is obviously
really important the very first thing
that happened when I went to sign into
PSN is it asks me to do an update and in
order to do that obviously you need
Wi-Fi so pretty important stuff and
here's another look at one of the
interfaces this shows you everything
you've got open at one time
now Remote Play is a cool feature that
everyone's talking about I'm gonna go
ahead and try this as soon as I'm done
editing this video here but basically it
allows you to continue your games on
your Playstation 3 right on your Vita so
that's a killer feature assuming it
works the way it's advertised and again
there's a number of other things on the
main screen here I'm not gonna cover
absolutely everything this is a little
startup sort of guide tutorial if you
will going over some of the features and
functions that the PS Vita has built in
it actually does have an accelerometer
gyroscope type thing where it can it can
sense your movements and this little
tutorial here is actually kind of fun as
its it's a game as well as a tutorial so
it teaches you how to use those
different functions I'm assuming that
that full release games are gonna take
advantage of some of these features at
some point so it's cool to just sort of
get up to speed on what the device is
capable of I'm not very good at this
particular tutorial the other thing I
really like is the keyboard the keyboard
is really responsive and it's a good
size as you'd imagine with a five-inch
screen but one of the downsides I'm
noticing right now is the fact that you
doesn't function at least not the full
on youtube.com maybe that will change
once this device is fully released you
know in North America and the other
major markets in the world we'll have to
wait and see or maybe there'll be an app
released at some point who knows but
this is where we're at right now
obviously you know there are gonna be
some kinks that you're gonna have to
work through if you choose to import
this yourself but I wanted to get you
guys up close and personal with the
device because it is out it's out there
in the wild in the world and you deserve
to get a better look at it anyway guys
if you enjoyed this content hopefully
you can like and favorite this video as
it does help me out a bunch if you're
thinking about getting a Vita or
importing it then make sure to add this
video to your favorites so you can go
over some of those tips and things that
I covered otherwise if you haven't
subscribed yet please go ahead and do so
I've got a lot more content planned cool
products coming in as well as some other
PlayStation Vita videos on their way so
anyway guys until next time and as
always I want to thank you for watching
thank you for supporting my channel
without you guys I couldn't do this and
until then I'll see you around until my
next video all right later guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
