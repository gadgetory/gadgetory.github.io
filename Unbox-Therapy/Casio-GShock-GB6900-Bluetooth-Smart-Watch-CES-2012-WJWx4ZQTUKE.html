therapy and one of the cooler items I
got to take a first look at down at CES
2012 is this g-shock watch in front of
me yes it looks like a regular casio
g-shock but believe me it is not it's
still rugged and tough but it's also
very smart it is bluetooth enabled with
the latest Bluetooth 4.0 criteria and
what that means is you're going to get
some real smart functionality out of
this watch now first and foremost the
model number is GB or model named GB -
6900 and that Bluetooth functionality is
going to allow it to interface with your
phone your smart phone and that's going
to give you all kinds of extra features
you never would have expected to get out
of your watch now there are other smart
watches on the market but most of them
are pretty battery hungry and they
require you to you know charge them up
all the time this one is going to have
incoming call alert just like some of
those other ones but it has a slightly
different approach to call alert so
first things first if it's in your
briefcase your phone that is or backpack
or something along those lines or on
silent not only are you going to see
that you're getting a call coming
through but you're also going to see the
name of the individual so you can sort
of edit you know your your callers and
decide if you want to answer it or not
depending on what you're doing and then
all you have to do is tap the watch so
say for example it's on silent buzzing
away in your pocket or something along
those lines you just have to watch and
that will then silence the phone it's
also got the same idea for text messages
etc on top of that you can use this
functionality called phone finder and so
if you misplace your phone or you know
you even if you just want to speed up
the process of finding where it is in
your house you can actually use the
watch to ring the phone and even if I
believe even if the phone is on silent
or something along those lines it'll
make an independent tone unlike the one
that you would get for a phone call or
something along those lines much higher
pitch so you can track down your phone
and get on with your day it's also got
something this is one of the coolest
features the out of range warning so if
you put your phone down somewhere
somebody interrupts you you move in a
specific direction away from your phone
the g-shock will tell you that you're
moving too far from it and remind you
that you've forgotten it so you
turn around go grab it and you don't
lose your phone or leave it somewhere
I've had a couple buddies of mine not
going to name any names who have left
their bone in certain places bars and
stuff like that now here's the coolest
part it uses a single lithium battery
and with the Bluetooth 4 Oh incredibly
low energy consumption you're going to
get two years of usage at 12 hours of
use per day that's crazy talk in
comparison to other smartwatches that
are currently on the market that need to
be charged almost daily or even weekly
for that matter it's a little bit
inconvenient to have to remember to keep
your watch charged along with your
smartphone blah blah blah this has also
cut something built-in called emergency
alert this is if you are filling up a
glass of water and you just collapsed
for no apparent reason I'm just kidding
obviously this is for senior citizens
and stuff like that or anybody who's
super paranoid you just press a single
button on your watch it'll link back up
to your phone no matter where that is in
the house and call out to the emergency
services it's also got Auto login and
logout and I don't know how useful this
one is because obviously if somebody had
your watch or your watch was nearby your
computer and you didn't remember that it
was anybody would have access but in an
office environment it's pretty cool
because you're watching coming off your
wrist and how that works is if you walk
away from your computer to automatically
lock you out and then lock you back in
when you arrive back to it so that might
be useful for certain people anyway guys
I'm really impressed with this
particular g-shock here I can't wait
till it becomes readily available on the
market I'm definitely going to buy one
show you guys what it's all about and it
was very cool to take a first look at it
get a quick glimpse at it at CES 2012
