smartphone this smartphone in front of
me is for gamers it's made specifically
for intense mobile gamers and the thing
that I'm interested in with this product
specifically is the fact that this is
the first smartphone I've looked at that
has a built-in fan like a gaming laptop
it has an intake and a fan and it spits
out hot air so it's called the red magic
three that's right it's kind of amazing
there on the third version of this phone
already I think we looked at number one
right well Qualcomm Snapdragon a 55 high
efficiency cooling fan six point six
five inch ninety Hertz FHD display so
we're starting to see that pop up a
little more frequently now that's the
same refresh as the oneplus 7 pro it's
also got a five thousand milliamp hour
battery forty eight megapixel rear
camera touch sensitive shoulder triggers
we've seen different contraptions that
hook on to smartphones to give you a
more ergonomic gaming experience more
similar to a typical controller so what
they've done here is they just put these
little touch sensitive regions in the
shoulder locations where typical
controller might have them dual stereo
front speakers 4d haptic vibration and
game space so there is you hit a button
on the side and it puts the thing into
like a game mode it turns off your
notifications you can't be disturbed
because it's very serious your gaming
medieval combat shape look to it it
looks like a shield it's cool to the
touch right away so it's a metal
construction it feels very rugged
actually this is actually the intake for
the fan so it sucks in cool air there
and shoots out hot air over here on the
side so on the same side of the device
you have your power switch volume up and
down and these are those shoulder
buttons that I referenced you can see
they're strategically located so if
you're playing a game other side of the
device there's a pin connector this is
probably for some type of accessory and
then this switch I've topped this puts
the phone into its gaming specific mode
this device is for 79 USD it doesn't
look like a
gonna win any awards for screen to body
ratio if that is a major consideration
of yours there is still a forehead there
is still a chin as well
quick charge power brick simple little
brick you also have your USB cable
type-c connector this is like a couple
days old the announcement just happened
for this thing very recently it's booted
up now red magic on the background it's
all it's all very gamer friendly the
sound effects listen you see what I mean
Jack it's like a cyborg type of sound
now this switch is what I'm interested
in you hit this switch over on the side
here hold baby so I guess you add games
in here
that you want to so you can have
separate settings for each game so you
can toggle your alerts for each specific
title okay fin faster phone cooling when
turned on there we go intelligent
adjustment or rapid cooling I'm gonna
put rapid cooling for maximum fan speed
that's some real fan activity that's
really interesting this is that that
makes this the very first smartphone
I've ever tried with an actual physical
fan in it you can change the LED so it
can flash you can select your LED
effects which takes you into another
section of the menu here we can have
long bright or breathe settings for the
LEDs
here's another convenient feature if you
launch into game mode you can have it
switch over to constant brightness
protect here by launching into the game
mode it will also toggle off the auto
brightness you may have been using
throughout the day without the need to
go in and adjust those settings
independently now if I click on this
little controller button presumably this
is an accessory maybe it's not available
yet they did not send us this this
mounts on to the actual device and gives
you an analogue control so if I swipe in
from the right-hand side it brings up a
bunch of settings here
it will also tell you your cpu
temperature 31.5 Celsius GPU clock speed
your network connection for D shock well
download pop G because that seems to be
what these these types of devices are
tuned up for so let me just turn on game
boost
so I'm boosted up it's in auto mode I'm
gonna turn on for D shock see that
supported you can customize LRT buttons
according to the game interface so with
the touch button on you drag the R and L
to map accordingly so they map up to the
trigger locations nicknamed Willy dude
okay so as you can see the automatic
specs setting hi based on my device
that's a great feeling for any gamer you
get like a new gaming PC or something
you loaded I was like we recommend high
setting and you're just like yeah that's
right that's right
gaming is serious okay
my brain there we go
touch button saved oh great I'm gonna be
dead here come on my instinct that first
one I'm punching that guy I mean I was
an entirely ridiculous exchange but my
instinct was to tap over here and that
was it wait I can just tap up there and
it it does feel more natural or
comfortable I guess oh it is on
it's relatively insignificant in
relationship to the audio from the game
oh I'm getting shot at
dead now let me see if I scroll over
here I can turn it off if I want of
course you'll see the temperature right
there will elevate over time it's 36
right now what about as in actual
smartphone obviously we knew it was
gonna game check it out jack aggressive
wallpapers it's a more traditional kind
of screen to body ratio the curve kind
of almost cuts off the top corners here
it's really not a bad package for the
price so let's see how it performs doing
other things well if I just want to
watch a video on YouTube
displays nice
it's a lot closer to an actual stereo
experience when compared to other phones
the feeling of stereo separation does
take place but in the volume Department
it's like I feel like this could be
louder
uh it's weird these are tough speakers
to evaluate because I like the way they
sounded just not as much volume as I
would like the camera I have pretty low
expectations here I gotta be honest like
well HDR by default pretty quick little
shutter there it's not the worst I've
seen less you know what the camera is
not bad it's not that bad
it is a single camera setup right it'll
get the job done again it's not the main
focus fair amount of detail I can live
with it honestly I've seen worse photos
here will kill the lights real quick so
you can see full gaming mode whoa
see now people know what you're up to
they see you from across the room
alright so I think it's kind of
interesting I like the idea of having
these different choices exist like for
different purposes that every single
phone doesn't need to just be a slab I
get it
this is not gonna be for everyone the
styling the LEDs and whatnot is a very
specific target here where I think this
one shines though is on the styling it's
it's it gives you something a bit
different
Willie do we should get your quick
comment on this you come in and it's the
brass tacks yeah it's also when everyone
leaves at the end of the video anyways
they want to know what you think what do
you have to say about this I think it's
really good value mmm more than the type
of specs that you get it's basically
like you said it's kind of like a 1 plus
7 bro yeah I think it's a pretty solid
phone okay I mean does it feel solid in
your opinion it feels very solid I
didn't even mention it has a headphone
jack as well oh yeah I feel like a gamer
might care about that you don't get that
on a oneplus yeah so in other words will
you're telling everybody to buy it right
now yes please do so basically so
basically you work for you work for this
company ZTE Nubia and red and red magic
okay you're getting three paychecks all
right well done this episode is brought
to you by drop now you may have known
them as master off they design and
collaborate with other brands to bring
the best products at affordable prices
now they came up with these headphones
called the HD 58 X and their recreation
of the Sennheiser 650s
there's big ear cuffs with a comfy
design to go over your ears now they're
also open back which allows more air to
pass through more air less sweat longer
listening now I've been using these
headphones to listen to new retro waves
on YouTube now these headphones have a
lot of bass and they're really clear I
think the fact that they're really light
I can actually wear them all day
so far they've sold over 27,000 units
and they have a five-star rating with
over a thousand reviews now if you're
interested check out the links below oh
