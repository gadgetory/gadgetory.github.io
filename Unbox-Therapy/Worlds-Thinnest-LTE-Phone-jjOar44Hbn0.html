another video and today I'm taking a
look at what I'm told is the world's
thinnest LTE smartphone at 5.1
millimeters it is the blue vivo air LTE
and it actually has some pretty decent
specifications as well for a device that
is this thin and it's also relatively
inexpensive at 199 dollars unlocked on
Amazon so let's go ahead and check out
the specs as you'll see on the back here
it's got a four-point eight inch HD
Super AMOLED display kind of surprising
to see Super AMOLED in a device at this
price point got a Snapdragon 410 quad
core eight megapixel rear facing camera
5-megapixel selfie cam two gigs of ram
Gorilla Glass 3 4G LTE as I mentioned
earlier and pro and and and it's running
Android lollipop so let's go ahead and
jump inside the box and take a closer
look at the vivo air LTE now I have
featured a product from Blu previously
on the channel I don't remember which
model it was it was an inexpensive
device around 60 bucks on Amazon and I
was actually kind of impressed with what
you can get in a phone these days for a
particular price point at $1.99 this is
gonna be a lot more accessible oh my
goodness this is wow that is really thin
holy smokes and light to not just then
whoa this device actually has a bigger
battery than an iPhone even though it's
substantially thinner go ahead and pull
off this protective covering here you
can see the camera on the back here
flash as well which of volume buttons
over here on the side power switches
here
SIM card tray then on the bottom
headphone jack as well as micro USB to
charge it up and a microphone there as
well it's hard to believe there's even a
battery installed in there
it's super lightweight really a
surprising build for a device that's a
hundred and ninety-nine bucks unlocked
what we have here what to power bricks
get out of here
get out of here to power bricks
everybody needs more than one of these
same tool as well a little bit of
paperwork on screen buttons I didn't
even notice that okay so no physical
button at all on the front it's just
gonna be on screen that's okay I'm fine
with that
also a case it's kind of cool it's got
like a smoke look to it it's still
stupid thin even with the case on there
what else a screen protector nice thing
about this is like it's up to you right
if you want to apply the screen
protector you've got it there when
you're not like when you're not running
over your phone with a Ford f-150 that's
Jack's fault by the way that was all
Jack's idea let's shake your head jack
you know the truth we have what looked
like fairly premium set of headphones in
ear style that's important different ear
tips to suit the size of your ear canal
a flat cable so it's not gonna get
tangled too easily and a built in
microphone as well okay so let's go
ahead and boot up the device hopefully
it has a little bit of a charge here we
go blue bold like us as I mentioned this
is a Super AMOLED display yet rich
colors
lots of contrast the device is now
booted up and it's actually a fairly
stock experience here I told you before
it's running lollipop and there's not
too much that's been altered so if
you're one of those people that's into
relatively stock android experiences
you'll probably be happy with the layout
here that it hasn't been sort of messed
with too much there's no heavy skin or
anything applied here so let's go ahead
and launch YouTube see what video looks
like on here obviously you're looking at
some YouTube compression here
now obviously the speaker is on the back
of the device display looks good though
beard looks good in the video now this
isn't the most high-resolution display
in the world it's on a four point eight
inch display so it's not such a huge
deal also having a slightly lower res
display actually gives you a little bit
better battery life here we have an
iPhone 6s you can see the footprint it's
fairly similar this one's a little bit
taller but when it comes to thinness
it's really no contest here you guys can
see that it's crazy to say it feels
chunky compared to the vivo air LPE vivo
air has a 20% larger battery so it's
just over two thousand milliamp hours
close to 20 percent larger than the
iPhone 6s it's pretty impressive
now I know the other big consideration
with a smart phone purchase is almost
always camera in fact I think camera
might be the biggest differentiator when
people are considering devices here we
go it's also relatively quick there's
nothing nothing worse than a camera that
takes forever to take a shot this is not
one of those cameras it's also got HDR
Wow and lots of options too if you want
to access them exposure compensation
white balance everything really
everything you'd want it even has a
beauty mode to enhance I don't need any
help in at the
it's for Jack now this wouldn't be the
usual unboxing and then camera test
without its selfie that's how I smile
smile my eyes you know what decent
definition here though in the beard
region now that's always my number one
concern I ain't no model quality not too
shabby though anyways there you have it
a super thin device from blue
smartphones considering the form factor
it's a pretty surprising package at a
pretty surprising price so that's about
it there you have it
thin light relatively stock Android
experience selfie camera for beards
