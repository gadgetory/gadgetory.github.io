another video and it's another episode
of does it suck one of my favorite
things to do here on unbox therapy look
at relatively inexpensive items that you
might not expect to be very good and
hopefully uncover some gems the photo pH
bTW h3 bluetooth headphones now I've had
my eyes on these for a long time they're
$39 bluetooth headphones big fan of
bluetooth headphones when I'm traveling
the convenience of Bluetooth not having
that cable and believe it or not
nowadays you can actually get some
pretty decent sound out of bluetooth
headphones I've been using various pairs
of Sony Bluetooth headphones for a while
now but they're expensive so maybe just
maybe we have found something that will
fit right into your lifestyle and right
into the limitations of your bank
account could be a gem could be a needle
in the haystack the haystack being
Amazon and the millions of headphones
that are there the needle being these
bluetooth headphones let's get inside
and find out the whole point of this
damn show slim compact form factor
equipped with Bluetooth 240 millimeter
drivers those are pretty big speakers on
the side of your head 15 hours of
playtime with just three hours of
charging let's go ahead and crack into
these babies come on I think I'm having
a $39 unboxing experience here nope
there we go a case a protective case
little silca pouch activated carbon do
not eat jus eat lunch yet Jack here you
go
nice protective case says photovoltaic
over here little pouch over here as well
for your cables and whatnot it'll charge
over microUSB yes microUSB cable is
included now there is also a traditional
audio cable mini jack 3.5 millimeter
maybe you're on an airplane let's say
and you want to listen to the in-flight
entertainment then unfortunately that is
not bluetooth capable so you've got the
cable we'll see if these headphones have
any charge my initial reaction you know
what these feel pretty substantial a lot
like my Sony's actually so the ear cups
swivel you've got buttons dedicated
volume buttons here power switch this is
where you're going to charge them
there's a little flap or for your
dedicated headphone cable if you're not
using bluetooth this looks like your
microphone for answering phone calls
play pause forward back to skip tracks
when you're listening to music let me
try these on hmm I don't know a medium a
medium sized I guess I'd say comfy the
lightweight big fan of lightweight
headphones so the headband is metal now
let's see if these have any power Oh
feel like I heard a beep there oh yeah
look check it so it's flashing blue and
red which I assume means it's ready to
be paired there we are
beat eh three headphones paired for call
and media audio how easy is that time
for a little music
volume four days probably into like
danger zone territory Wow
$39 Bluetooth these are legit these are
these now I know why they are reviewed
so well on Amazon I don't know man
they're really comparable to my Sony
should I get my Sony's Jack alright give
me one second they are super comparable
to these ones these are like like 150
ish the layout is almost identical
actually let me go ahead let's check it
out the sony sound a little bit better a
little bit crispier and i'd also say
they're marginally more comfortable a
little bit lighter but these are the
real story of this video because they're
not even in the same price range like
it's tough to get a good pair of wired
headphones at $39 and these are
bluetooth and they sound great for 39
bucks they sound great they sound better
than I expected and also the build is
just better than I expected
alright another episode it does it suck
and another surprised version of Lou in
front of you for yourself for a family
member for the girl you've got a crush
on bluetooth headphones bluetooth
headphones for everyone thanks very much

below if you appreciated this content
and I will catch you very shortly
as usual on the next episode later guys
