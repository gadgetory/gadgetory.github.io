another video and it's another episode
of does it suck one of my favorite
things to do here on unbox therapy look
at relatively inexpensive items that you
might not expect to be very good and
hopefully uncover some gems the photo pH
BT h3 bluetooth headphones now I've had
my eyes on these for a long time
they're $39 bluetooth headphones big fan
of bluetooth headphones when I'm
traveling the convenience of Bluetooth
not having that cable and believe it or
not nowadays you can actually get some
pretty decent sound out of bluetooth
headphones I've been using various pairs
of Sony Bluetooth headphones for a while
now but they're expensive so maybe just
maybe we have found something that will
fit right into your lifestyle and right
into the limitations of your bank
account could be a gem could be a needle
in the haystack the haystack being
Amazon and the millions of headphones
that are there the needle being these
bluetooth headphones let's get inside
and find out it's the whole point of
this damn show slim compact form factor
equipped with Bluetooth 240 millimeter
drivers those are pretty big speakers on
the side of your head 15 hours of
playtime with just three hours of
charging let's go ahead and crack into
these babies come on I think I'm having
a $39 unboxing experience here no there
we go a case a protective case little
silca pouch activated carbon do not eat
jus eat lunch yet Jack here you go
nice protective case says photovoltaic
over here little pouch over here as well
for your cables and whatnot it'll charge
over microUSB yes microUSB cable is
included now there is also a traditional
audio cable mini jack 3.5 millimeter
maybe you're on an airplane let's say
and you want to listen to the in-flight
entertainment then unfortunately that is
not bluetooth capable so you've got the
cable we'll see if these headphones have
any charge my initial reaction you know
what these feel pretty substantial a lot
like my Sony's actually so the ear cups
swivel you've got buttons dedicated
volume buttons here power switch this is
where you're gonna charge them there's a
little flap or for your dedicated
headphone cable if you're not using
bluetooth this looks like your
microphone for answering phone calls
play pause forward back to skip tracks
when you're listening to music
let me try these on hmm I don't know a
medium a medium sized I guess I'd say
comfy the lightweight big fan of
lightweight headphones so the headband
is metal now let's see if these have any
power Oh feel like I heard a beep there
oh yeah look check it so it's flashing
blue and red which I assume means it's
ready to be paired there we are
bth three headphones paired for call and
media audio how easy is that time for a
little music
volume four days probably into like
danger zone territory Wow
$39 Bluetooth these are legit these are
these now I know why they are reviewed
so well on Amazon I don't know man
they're really comparable to my Sony
should I get my Sony's Jack alright give
me one second they are super comparable
to these ones these are like like 150
ish the layout is almost identical
actually let me go ahead say some let's
check it out
the sony sound a little bit better a
little bit crispier and I'd also say
they're marginally more comfortable a
little bit lighter but these are the
real story of this video because they're
not even in the same price range like
it's tough to get a good pair of wired
headphones at $39 and these are
bluetooth and they sound great for 39
bucks they sound great they sound better
than I expected and also the build is
just better than I expected
alright another episode of does it suck
and another surprise the version of Lou
in front of you for yourself
for a family member for the girl you've
got a crush on bluetooth headphones
bluetooth headphones for everyone thanks
very much for watching leave a thumbs up
down below if you appreciated this
content and I will catch you very
shortly as usual on the next episode
later guys bluetooth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
