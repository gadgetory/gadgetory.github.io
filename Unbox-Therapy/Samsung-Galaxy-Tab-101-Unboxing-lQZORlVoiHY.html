therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 now if you
guys follow the channel which you should
if you don't already then you know that
I owned a bunch of different tablets
from all the different manufacturers and
I can't wait to see how this one stacks
up against those in particular the
touchpad and the iPad 2 which happen to
be in my possession right now I'm going
to hopefully get a little showdown video
up in the next week and that's going to
help you decide which one is right for
you and believe me there's no simple
answer to that anyway let's talk about
this one that's what you're here for
you're here to look at the Samsung
Galaxy Tab let me tell you this baby is
thin and light so first let's look at
the documentation we got a little
accessory guide a couple of docs for it
one with a keyboard and HDMI adapter a
cover of course next we've got our USB
cable with a proprietary samsung
connector on the other end it is
incredibly similar to the 30-pin
connector we're used to on all Apple
products pretty much iPods iPhones iPads
you know how it goes next we've got our
power adapter from Samsung and something
cool here is it's got interchangeable
tips so if you travel a lot I'd assume
you can probably pick up the ones for
different countries in different areas
of the world all those crazy-looking
adapters without having to get a whole
new power brick next we've got our
headphones and these ones look identical
to the ones that came with my Nexus S
that would make sense because the
Samsung product of course anyhow we've
got any ear style headphones that come
with a bunch of tips so that you can get
the right ones that fit your ear canals
next we've got an inline remote along
with a microphone in it now something to
note here is that not all manufacturers
of
tablets are including headphones so
that's a bonus
there's those tips I was talking about
now let's talk about the tablet that's
what it's all about after all and like I
said before this thing is thin and light
its striking in fact and something I
actually like as well
is that the back of it is white because
as we all know glossy black tends to
attract finger prints like nobody's
business this one hopefully won't do
that on the bottom of the unit we have
our proprietary connector along with a
microphone up top we have our headphone
connector along with our camera and LED
flash that's a 3 megapixel shooter we've
also got our power button and our volume
rocker now this is a 16 by 9 tablet so
the intention is that you're going to
use it in landscape mode more or less
we've also got a speaker on the left
hand side and another speaker on the
right hand side yes that's correct
stereo speakers Apple better be
listening up to this let's take a quick
look at the interface of course you've
probably seen honeycomb before and this
baby looks stock vanilla beautiful the
YouTube app is probably the best on any
tablet so I'm excited about that I spent
a lot of time on YouTube you guys
probably know that this is what the
little Home Navigator looks like you
have this cool little animation as you
scroll around like you're in the middle
of a cylinder or something and next
let's go ahead and launch the browser
we'll quickly launch a website I don't
know which website should we launch how
about on box therapy.com and how about
you go check it out if you haven't been
there before anyway it's not a super
heavy site it's got some ads on it and
well it's got a lot of embedded video as
you might imagine oh look at this it's
going to load up the mobile version ok
let's go get the standard version
because that's the real benchmark and
let's see how that loads up not bad so
far taking a little while and we're
loaded not too bad faster than in
touchpad I'd say anyway guys this is not
a review it was just an unboxing so
stick around stay tuned to the channel
subscribe if you don't mind and I'm
going to have this showdown video
hopefully up before the end of the week
and I'll give you a lot more information
on this tablet and the other ones I
mentioned earlier thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
