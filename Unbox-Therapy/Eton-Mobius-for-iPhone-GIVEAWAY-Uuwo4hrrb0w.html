having another giveaway I know it's been
awhile since I've had any that was that
issue back in back a few weeks ago or
wasn't even a month ago where you know
YouTube kind of changed their approach
to how they were gonna treat giveaways
and I had one of mine taking down so
I've been like going easy with it but I
actually came up with a new method for
doing giveaways off-site right on
unboxtherapy com on the website so that
there won't be any future problems and
what am I giving away that's that's the
important part I'll explain how to enter
in a quick second you may remember i
unboxed this eatin Mobius case on the
channel if you haven't seen that video
I'll put a link in the annotations as
well as down in the description a very
cool battery case for your iPhone 4 and
4s that has a solar panel built-in for
emergencies where can actually grab some
juice from the Sun very cool very unique
and what they did they send me to they
send me two of these cases very cool
people and the reason for that is
because one is for you guys and you can
have it in time for the holiday season
that's just kidding anyways yes we are
going to have a very quick giveaway over
on the website and it's very simple to
enter we're gonna leave it open for a
week first and foremost not too long
we'll pick a winner real soon and I know
you don't have to like and favorite this
video you can if you want it's not a
requirement all you're going to have to
do is jump over to this link down in the
description there which takes you to my
website and from there you'll see the
post the giveaway post for the Mobius
case and beneath it there is a tweet
button all you're gonna have to do is
tweet out that post very simple click
the tweet button then submit you're
gonna obviously have to have a Twitter
account or you can't tweet anything and
then click Submit and I can track it
like that because the default message
that comes up when you click that tweet
button has all the information I need so
it's literally two clicks for you to
enter that's the amazing part and it's
going to be completely safe from some of
the issues regarding YouTube based
giveaways plus you get to visit my
website and if you want to leave a
comment on the post over on the website
you can do that to you can let me know
you've entered put your youtube username
in the comment section if that makes
feel more comfortable but trust me I can
track it via the tweet now you might
want to follow me on twitter as well in
order to find out who the winner is you
don't have to do that again I can I can
send a tweet out trying to get in touch
with you but the easiest way is just to
go ahead and follow me on twitter as
well because like i said i'll announce
the winner that way if you want to
follow me that's at unbox therapy or
twitter.com / unbox therapy very simple
stuff we're going to have more giveaways
coming up before Christmas hits and I
got a lot of other products and I'm
going to be giving away this way so if
you don't have a twitter account it
takes a few seconds to set up and it's
gonna be great i mean i'm going to be
able to give back to you guys all over
again because i've really been missing
out on doing that and I really do
appreciate your guys viewership and so I
want to do this more often so that's the
way it's gonna be done anyway guys I
believe that's all that I have to say
there are no other requirements this is
too easy isn't it alright guys until
next time until my next giveaway or
unboxing thank you for watching thanks
for taking part in this kind of stuff
you know I love doing what I do and you
guys make it possible all right I'll see
