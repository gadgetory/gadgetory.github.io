another video and today it is the second
of this sort this is cool
survival tech inside this box but each
time the box is a mystery or at least
what's inside is a mystery the box
itself is pretty familiar we find out
together what's included in this
survival tactical mystery box let's do
it now this knife that I'm using this
Kershaw here actually came in the last
box I don't know if we're gonna get
another knife in this one or not
okay alright
Bush survival mission 5 insta fire wait
a second what is this each pouch lights
up to four fires and it works in harsh
conditions with no harsh chemicals this
is cool survival tech guys it lights wet
wood burns at nearly a thousand degrees
burns on snow water and ice save a life
playing oh there's like a rope in there
is it a tent this has got to be a
shelter
hold up oh wow this my friends is a
hammock now that I can get with that
we're putting a hammock in the office
boys we're putting a hammock in the
office naptime here I come you haven't
tried a hammock before you need to
reevaluate your life you know jack is
gonna use that you know it Jack's hardly
ever awake he's sleeping right now okay
what do we have here a fire piston
little screw in there and they look like
washers and then this cap on this guy
let's learn what is this one oh cool
that's actually a pretty nice leather
wallet oh nice
I'm definitely gonna use this what is
this right here Oh phone call of course
hello not too much what's going on man
I'll send somebody down oh yeah that's
what Steve brought sup man alright then
just got more exciting and probably more
dangerous okay so this box here I think
it says and perk on it things just got
quite strange that looks like a knife
holster right there this looks like
another piston but like an old-school
style oh no that's that's a knife that
is a cool knife man Wow crazy cool
pattern here on the blade and this looks
this looks like a legit sort of polished
wood handle Steve gun check that out
okay so this is obviously this is a
sharpener I was thinking that this pack
was gonna be all fire stuff when when
everything seemed to be fire related but
it obviously has some other survival
stuff in it as well and this knife is
gonna be really cool goes in the little
sheath what do we have here this is a
bushcraft leather firestarter necklace
okay so this is like a piece of Flint
here that goes on this leather necklace
you've got your little pile of tinder
this is around your neck emergency
situation you're gonna die zombies are
everywhere they don't like fire right oh
look at this beeswax jus tinder spool
essentially what we have here is this
beeswax fibrous stuff here you're still
gonna need a spark but this is going to
help to catch fire and actually
build the legitimate flame survival
matches okay check this out real quick
so we need to put some some lighter
fluid in this in this container here
fold it in hand strike firmly on the
magnesium and then it'll light the end
of it okay
Thompson snares Oh
am I dealing with like a trap right now
am I gonna trap an animal directions
enclosed for snaring muskrat mink
rabbits skunk and similar sized animals
so there is the snare catching a a
rabbit had a snare rodents and fur
bearers so there's a couple options here
for how to set it up the last thing in
the Box is a burnable gift card and this
is like a magnifying situation fifteen
dollars on a forty five dollar minimum
purchase whoever registers that first at
wazoo survival gear calm you just got
fifteen three dollars and this is wood
look I can crack a piece off stick it in
the wallet another firestarter so what
we've discovered here today is that this
is the perfect gift for the pyro in your
family a pyro maniac promised you a
flame you're gonna get a flame could I
burn down the entire set yes could I
burn down the entire studio yes
maniac
okay wish me luck guys oh is this the
most dangerous unbox therapy video ever
it is right watch our clock is going
that's real smoke hold on we have fire
alarms in here that's a flame my friend
