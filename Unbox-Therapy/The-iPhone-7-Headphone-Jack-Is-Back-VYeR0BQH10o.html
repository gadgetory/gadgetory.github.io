plus you're feeling a little bit
nostalgic you're you're missing
something that existed on the previous
edition of iPhone and every single
iPhone before that and you know what I'm
talking about I'm talking about that 3.5
millimeter headphone jack goodness
but you haven't stopped thinking about
that every night you go to bed you put
your head down on your pillow and you
think about those better days the golden
years legitimately like golden this guy
hit me up he said I don't know I think
he's got a kickstart going on I'll have
a link to what he's doing down in the
description but he was like I got this
little thing for you Lou to solve the
world's problems once and for all let's
get into this rather rudimentary
packaging here oh that's time that's
much smaller than I expected it to be
that's tiny the il doc ill dock eel dock
like is that done in some language the
dock I don't know look at this little
thing now a lot of you were thinking but
Lou inside the box
Apple they included an adapter for once
in the box well you're right they did
there's a problem with that adapter that
adapter takes your lightning port and
gives you a headphone jack back but what
it doesn't do it doesn't give you this
it doesn't give you a lightning pour
pass through let me set the stage let me
give you a scenario say you're a kid
you're lying in bed all right you got
your favorite headphones on you've been
using these for years and you don't want
to switch now you got your phone all
right
this new iPhone 7 you love it's got a
great camera you go to do this and
that's not happening so maybe you reach
for the Apple adapter but then you plug
that baby in and then you like that
battery is getting low because -
watching Netflix and anyone who's ever
watched video on a phone before Ryan
again so the battery is the next thing
to worry about now you got both with
this little guy right here
you're now charging and using your
favorite headphones look at that who's
better than you now now you're like this
hours days go by months you might grow a
beard like this you start to see a gray
hair pop up in there it could be you let
me do a little test let's make sure this
actually work
the moment of truth boom we are now in
the magical land of charging and
listening at the same time another thing
that came to my mind when I saw this
straightaway was people who sample
sounds off their phones DJ's things like
this where you're constantly using this
mini jet connector but at the same time
your phone might need to be powered up
if you're pulling files from it on a
regular basis now granted I do want to
put a disclaimer in here this little dot
doesn't really do anything that the
Apple doc doesn't do yes it has a
lightning pass-through yes it has a mini
Jack connector for audio but only while
the phone is docked and up right now
what if you want to use the phone while
it is connected you see what I'm saying
can't do that with the official duck let
me just make sure the audio functions
the way I wanted to as well oh there's a
great suggestion wouldn't want to miss
this one there's a lot of people who use
a traditional stereo with their iPhone
maybe you got one of these guys
enough people were talking about it
enough people wanted a problem solved it
here it is probably the best solution
I've seen charge
listen same time could always switch to
Android to</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
