see I finally completed the ultimate
gaming PC I thank you for your patience
on this project I know it went longer
than expected part of it had to do with
me moving and getting into a bigger
space which you're looking at right here
this is my new office and it means that
I had room to get this thing sprawled
out it is imposing it is a large system
and we've got three 27-inch monitors
which are really at the heart of it
these are from a soos and they're called
the VG - 7 8 H e they feature 144 Hertz
in terms of refresh rate which is
awesome for gaming they also feature 3d
capabilities if you're into it and when
you put them together like this they
create a pretty immersive experience if
you guys are interested in pricing and
availability on these gaming monitors
definitely check out the description in
fact if you're interested on any of the
components that are featured in the
ultimate gaming PC check out the
description that stuff will be down
there as well
so moving across you'll also see the
Corsair k9t gaming keyboard it's a
mechanical keyboard that's really a must
for gaming PC especially a high-end
gaming PC like this you want to have a
mechanical keyboard you've also got the
m90 Mouse which is a good match and
moving across a little bit further you
can see the gaming headset here this one
is from a soos it's in there Republic of
gamers lineup it's called the Vulcan ANC
and the ANC stands for active noise
cancellation which is a rarity in the
gaming headset world so these do feature
active noise cancellation which is going
to be a good thing especially if there
are other people creating noise in your
house and you want to be immersed fully
in your gaming experience they have a
detachable boom so you can also use them
just as a high quality set of headphones
if you choose to on the far side here
this is where the Beast lives itself
this is what's powering the entire setup
we've got two gtx 680 s in here and
they're probably well they're one of the
most important or two of the most
important components they're not regular
gtx 680 s these are from a susan they're
the direct cu2 top Edition and the
reason that that matters is because the
Zeus uses a bidding process to find only
the highest performing GPUs and then
overclocking those ones every single gtx
680 is not capable of the same amount of
overclocking so all you really need to
know is you
two really powerful gtx 680 s in here at
the top range and incredibly
overclockable there's also a 3770k in
here I'm not going to go into too much
detail on the components because I've
covered it in previous videos as far as
what's going on internally something
else to mention remember somebody is
going to win this system I know it seems
crazy
it's the biggest giveaway I've ever done
somebody's going to win this system so
definitely subscribe and stay tuned to
figure out who it is and it should be
one hell of an exciting experience now
let's go ahead and actually get into
some performance let's run a few
benchmarks and as I said earlier in this
video I'm not sure I think I mentioned
it please right now go down in the
comment section and let me know which
games you want to see featured on this
particular system and so I can give you
guys a rundown of how it actually works
in a gaming setup in a gaming
environment that's what it's for after
all all right let's jump into it
so the first benchmark software that we
ran on the system is called Geekbench
and was heavily requested by you guys on
both Twitter and on Facebook and the
score that I got was thirteen thousand
six hundred and sixty-three this is
coming from the free version of
Geekbench which only supports 32-bit
tests we'd see a higher score if we
could run it at the full 64 bit the next
benchmark software is called Cinebench
and you're looking at it right here this
tests a couple of things including CPU
performance once again but it also tests
graphics performance which is important
for us considering the fact that this is
a gaming machine and it has two giant
graphics cards in it you can see the
opengl figure is 67 point zero three
frames per second that sort of gives you
an idea of the potential gaming
performance of this system and it scored
quite a bit higher than some of the
other examples in the list there's also
a CPU component to Cinebench and that
gave us a score of nine point one three
anyways benchmarks are boring the whole
purpose of this system is to game so I
jumped into my buddy's Steam account
right here and he booted up
counter-strike and as you can see I'm
not very good at it but I did manage one
kill in this little clip right here and
then I jumped to my own death he does a
little bit better when he's playing
himself but the main thing here is the
incredibly immersive experience that you
get by having a three monitor setup
especially a 327 inch monitor setup
which surrounds you including your
periphery
vision it sort of makes you feel like
you're actually in the world where
you're playing as I said earlier in this
video guys I need you to let me know in
the comments which games you want to see
demoed on this particular system I will
download them install them I will I will
play them for you in the following ug PC
videos but as you guys can see the
system is fully functioning and it is
time to play a few games and then give
this thing away so definitely leave a
thumbs up down below if you haven't
already yet which I'm sure most you have
and I can't wait to give this to one
lucky viewer so if you haven't
subscribed yet do that now too and I'll
catch you guys on the next video
remember in the comments section let me
know which games you want to see and
also be sure to share this video with
your friends if they're into this kind
of stuff I think this system is a beast
and it's performing really beautifully
so far alright guys catch on the next
video later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
