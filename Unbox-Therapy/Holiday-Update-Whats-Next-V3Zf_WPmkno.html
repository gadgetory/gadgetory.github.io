got a chance to sit down and get back to
work it's been a long holidays four or
five days where I went off the grid no
new videos no tweets no anything I
decided to completely take myself out of
the game in order to focus on friends
family and food as you guys know you
probably did the same but now it's time
to get back to work and I wanted to give
you guys a quick preview of what to
expect but first I want to say Happy
Holidays to all of you since I haven't
yet and I also want to ask you guys what
you get for Christmas hopefully you got
what you were hoping for let me know
down in the comments what you got and if
it was what you were hoping for or not
so without further ado what's coming up
on the channel first and foremost the PS
Vita PlayStation Vita you guys know I
recently unboxed it got it upside down
there but I'm gonna do a remote play
video I had a lot of requests asking me
to show the quality of the remote play
feature and also what I think of it etc
also I received a lot of requests on
this avermedia Game Capture HD box I'm
gonna do some sample gameplay as well as
my full review on this device including
how to hook it up and how to get the
best quality as well as how to encode
the video after you've got it on your
computer so definitely stay tuned for
that video a couple of other things that
I've got these are gonna be for
giveaways I've got I phone 4 or 4s Gela
skin this is that that cool War of the
monsters artwork you may have seen on my
iPad 2 I got an extra one of those I've
got some control freak items the speed
freak and FPS freak those are
attachments for your controller it's
pretty cool stuff there as well and then
I also got some new stuff from OtterBox
the iPhone 4 or 4s Defender case I've
got two of them they sent me two here so
I've got two of these cases and one of
those is probably going to get given
away to you guys as well so as you can
see there's a couple of things that are
going to be coming up on the channel and
of course the much requested room tour
I'm working on it I do want to make it
as epic as possible so I'm not gonna you
know just throw something together or
just have me walking around with the
camera and that's
no I'm gonna put together something epic
so I'm gonna put time into it so don't
expect it immediately but definitely
know that it's on the way because you
guys came out like crazy and like that
video and left comments saying you
wanted to see it so I'm definitely gonna
get to work on it anyways guys I believe
that's all I got to cover in this update
stay tuned to the channel tonight
because there will be new content coming
I will get to work as we speak I've got
a big coffee sitting over there waiting
for me so hopefully you guys stick
around and check out some of this new
content as always guys want to thank you

everything you've done for the channel
in the short time that we've been
working on this and here's to uh here's
