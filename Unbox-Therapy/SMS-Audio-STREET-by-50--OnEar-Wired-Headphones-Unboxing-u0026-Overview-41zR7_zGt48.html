therapy and today we're taking a look at
two new products from the folks over at
SMS audio these are the street by 50 on
ear headphones they are different from
the standard street by 50 headphones
because they feature that on the ear
design and some people prefer that kind
of design because it means you're
getting a much more compact package and
that means they're gonna be more
portable in this case they also fold up
so the overall package that you have to
carry with you when traveling is very
very small and that being said they
still pack in 40 millimeter drivers and
that means they're gonna be able to
reproduce your low end pretty well so
for those of you that are into you know
enhanced a bass those wonderful low
frequencies you can bet that the 40
millimeter drivers shouldn't have any
problems reproducing that aspect of your
music so as you can see here they come
in both black and white and I'm gonna do
my best here in this unboxing video to
show you both actually there you go it's
a double unboxing it is not a single
unboxing you're gonna see both of them
unboxed here on unbox therapy after all
that's what goes on here from time to
time so we'll get started with the black
version and I've come to expect a
premium unboxing experience with SMS
products having you know shown and
featured a few of them here on the
channel in the past you know you're
gonna get a really high quality
experience and I like that after all I
have seen a number of different products
and you can't always say that for all
products out there some have terrible
unboxing experiences in this case you
have a little bit of paperwork over on
the right hand side you have you know
some warranty info as well as general
specifications on the product you've
also got this little pamphlet outlining
the different products within the SMS
lineup all the way from the sink to the
standard street and of course they now
have the street by 50 DJ version which
has a rotating ear cup that's the last
set of headphones that I featured on the
channel so if you haven't seen that
video you might want to check it out so
here's a closer look at the headphones
folded up and in there carrying case as
you can see it is a small package
overall here is the cable which is blue
and you have a right angle connector on
one end which I'm always a fan of you've
also got an inline microphone for
answering your phone calls
and muting you know your audio if you're
listening to a song it's also a fairly
thick cable which is a good thing it
means that it's less likely to get
tangled and probably more durable in
general I'm always a fan of a higher
quality cable and I know you guys think
it's weird for me to get excited about
cables but after looking at so many
headphones I really do like to see a
high quality cable especially when
you're paying you know a significant
amount of money for a set of headphones
so let's go ahead and jump inside take a
closer look at the white version now so
that we can compare the two you can see
the white ones and the black ones
side-by-side I won't waste too much time
in this case because you have seen the
other components in the unboxing this is
a good time to mention if you guys are
interested in purchasing a pair of these
headphones for yourself I will put links
down in the description I'll put the
Amazon page for those of you in the US
and I will put the SMS official page as
well for those of you elsewhere so I
guess this is a good time to ask you
guys which ones you prefer if you were
purchasing these headphones right now
would you select the white ones or the
black ones which one is better for you
white black white black white black
hahaha don't have a seizure just make a
decision and let me know down in the
comments which ones you prefer taking a
closer look at the construction
materials you'll notice the memory foam
ear cups as well as a nice leather
covering the leather padded headband
with some accent stitching done up in
blue and very importantly you also got
this port here for inserting and
removing your 3.5 millimeter audio cable
it is nice to have a detachable cable
because of course if you ever have a
problem with that cable your headphones
are not messed up completely you can
always replace that there you can get a
closer look at the hinges and also you
can all the beautiful leather here in
incredible detail we like to bring you
as close as possible to the products
here on unbox therapy most you know that
on the top you have some SMS Audio
branding which is a little bit more
visible on the white model than the
black one and here is a closer look at
the carrying case you have a high
quality zipper as well as I said before
there is an almost neoprene like
material there so you're gonna get you
know some protection from the elements
if you store your headphones in that
particular case anyway guys that's being
a first hand
and unboxing of course at the new street
buy 50 headphones these are the on the
ear style they are new and they are not
the same as the previous version Street
