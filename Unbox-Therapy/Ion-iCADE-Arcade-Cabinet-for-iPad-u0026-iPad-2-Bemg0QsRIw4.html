therapy and today we're taking a look at
the iCade arcade cabinet for your iPad
and if you buy one of these you will be
as happy as this couple in the picture
actually I cannot guarantee happiness
but stick around for the unboxing and I
can let you know if it made me happy so
anyways let's use the trusty golden
blade to get inside this box and as I
hear there is some assembly required
which is not something I like but in
this case I have no choice
here's some silica gel and the last time
I mentioned that in the video you guys
said that you would not die if you ate
it goes to show you how crazy you mofos
are but as you guys can see there's a
number of different components in this
unboxing none of which are incredibly
exciting we've got these wood panels
some instructions this looks like the
back of the unit we've also got the
controller portion itself this is the
part that you use to control the games
once you've got it all put together and
then we've got some side panels with
some old-school graphics on them now I'm
not going to make you guys watch me
assemble this thing because it might be
a disaster but I'm going to show you
some of the paperwork here and you've
also got some control schemes for some
of the popular games you're going to
want to use with this arcade cabinet so
look at that through the power of
YouTube and video in general you do not
have to wait for me to assemble it
instead you just get to see the
beautiful wonderful finished product so
here it is the iCade and no you do not
have to pay 25 cents to use it it is
free so long as you buy the iCade and
the app now one thing to note it does
not charge your iPad your iPad just sits
there and you're going to need an allen
key to put this thing together
they do include one but it is pretty
crappy as far as island keys go so
anyway to get it up and running all
you've got to do is insert your iPad
and then go to settings from there
select bluetooth then the device will
come up and you just pair it like you
would any other Bluetooth device it is
battery powered so you don't have to
have this unit plugged into the wall now
you're going to want to pick up this
atari classics app from the app store
it's got a bunch of old arcade games as
well as old atari games and all of these
are going to map properly to the iCade
unit and as you guys can see there's a
bunch of classics in here bunch of crazy
old school stuff that's mostly before my
time I actually believe it or not and
probably before yours too but anyway
it's good to play a little throwback
here and there you can select the
controls and you can set your
sensitivity for any of these games which
is nice considering some of them map
differently than others and then once
you get inside you get that old-school
goodness that crazy
music and them crazy seizure licious
graphics anyway the control scheme feels
good you got some nice tactile buttons
and of course that tactile joystick and
if you get a game that goes in landscape
mode only this can accommodate you
actually put it on this little Ridge on
the outside of the unit anyway guys this
was just an unboxing this thing has been
fun so far if you don't have some sort
of nostalgia for these old games you
might not be that interested in this but
it's cool nonetheless a little thing to
keep around for parties for a little
laugh for a little joke anyway guys
until next time thanks for watching</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
