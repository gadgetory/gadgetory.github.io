therapy comm and we're just gonna keep
these unboxings rolling today I just got
this Motorola Xoom it's the Wi-Fi only
version I really wasn't interested in
the 3G model that existed before this
being up here in Toronto I had
absolutely no need for a verizon
contract if I could even get one my
smartphone can tether anyways or act as
a Wi-Fi hotspot I should say so I had no
need for a data contract even if it was
available anyways I'm super excited to
get my hands on this I've had a Galaxy S
smartphone for a while I've had iPads
I've had I phones I've had it all and so
I really want to see how this tablet
stacks up to what's already out there
most importantly how it stacks up
against the iPad 2 getting back to the
unboxing we've got some paperwork from
Motorola a little QuickStart guide by
the looks of it as you know the Motorola
Xoom has support for Adobe Flash but
it's kind of weird because that pamphlet
states that it doesn't come that way out
of the box but flash support is coming
soon that's a strange thing I'm not sure
why they did that that way here's our
USB cable sure everybody has seen one of
these
I believe it's micro USB on the other
side and next we've got the power
adapter it looks like a travel style
with the fold up to power prongs and
what looks like the world's smallest
connector on the other side
straightforward stuff you've seen it all
before nothing else in this box let's
get to the unit itself and I'm having an
incredible amount of difficulty getting
this plastic off of here so I'm gonna go
off camera and come back once it's all
off there we go finally we got the naked
tablet itself now this is not going to
be a full review after all the title
says unboxing
I'm gonna go back to the drawing board
and do a proper review on this device
and come back hopefully real soon I'm
gonna put this tablet up against the
iPad to see the pros and cons because as
we all know that's where the competition
is right now it seems to be between this
Motorola in the iPad 2 anyway
as you see it's got a quick web browser
really straightforward stuff obviously
you can notice the different aspect
ratio this one has a proper 16 by 9
ratio perfect for HD video content you
see there's a brand new email app if
you're familiar with Android you got a
brand new marketplace scrollable widgets
but like I said before I'm not going to
go too deep into this right now
because the review is going to be
extensive and cover everything as well
as compare the device to other stuff
that's on the market anyway let's get a
closer look at the different buttons
around the device obviously volume up
and down on the left hand side the right
hand side has nothing on it the bottom
of the device has your sync cable port
power as well as a mini HDMI and the top
side has your headphone jack as well as
your expansion port you can see the 5
megapixel camera on the back a flash
your speaker as well as your power
button come to the channel and subscribe
for the full review coming up</div></body></html>
