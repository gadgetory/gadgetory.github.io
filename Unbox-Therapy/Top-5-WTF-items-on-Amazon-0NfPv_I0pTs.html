but fun video covering the top five most
WTF products on amazon.com I talked to
you guys on Twitter and on Facebook
earlier today and asked for you to send
in your links of the items you thought
we're the most WTF and I have them here
on this iPad right now so without
wasting any more time let's get into the
top five most WTF items on Amazon are
you dumb number one the chrysalis buy
valid ein I a - I WS 1 dual 6.5 inch in
wall subwoofer sounds like an everyday
product well guess what it isn't because
this item is going for 900 plus nine
hundred plus billion dollars yes you
didn't hear me incorrectly this is one
of those crazy listings on Amazon that
I'm sure no one ever expects to sell but
the comments section is pretty funny the
review so definitely check that out
actually on all of these
WTF items you have to read the reviews
because they're just as funny as the
items listed item tune the I'm rich app
for Android some of you guys might have
heard of this one this is 999 dot 99
cents for an app called I'm rich but it
doesn't actually do anything except tell
other people who pick up your phone that
you're rich if they know about this app
pretty ridiculous once again head down
to the reviews because they're hilarious
uranium or if you're unfamiliar with
uranium it's the stuff you need to
create nuclear weapons and you can buy a
tiny little amount of it apparently on
Amazon for 39.95 I'm not an expert I
don't know if this stuff is legit but
this one got pointed out to us a lot so
I thought it was worth mentioning
once again reviews are hilarious item
number four but we have the Wenger 16
nein nein nein Swiss Army knife giant
this is possibly the world's largest
Swiss Army knife I'm not 100% sure it
looks practically unusable and it's just
under $1400
but if you're looking to have an entire
kitchen cabinet or drawer in your pocket
will this fit in your pot I mean anyways
this thing is huge
it's got saws and knives and scissors
and it's ridiculous
so that's your next item by the wheel
mate laptop steering wheel desk now I
saw this picture and immediately thought
this thing was was ridiculous for a
number of reasons why would you have a
desk strapped to your steering wheel how
would this all work then I thought about
it a little more I thought oh I don't
know maybe it's for when you're stopped
and you're eating or I don't know I was
trying to justify a ridiculous item the
reviews once again are hilarious on this
one people talking about driving while
texting and you need to check that one
out last this is an honorable mention
obviously because I've already done five
items this is canned unicorn meat which
is a gag gift but so many people sent it
in to me that it had to make it into
this top five so anyways the honorable
mention is canned unicorn meat this is a
gag though you're not getting actual
meat inside of there but of course you
have to purchase it to find that out so
anyways that wraps up this inaugural top
105 video in which we're covering Amazon
WTF items stay tuned though because we
are planning to do a super WTF version
because we got some really outlandish
things sent in that could make it into
this video so if you want to see the
super WTF video make sure to leave a
thumbs up down below thanks as always
for watching guys and I'll catch you on
the next episode later
you</div></body></html>
