brand new video and today I've got
something quite unusual as you can
probably already tell in front of me
four bags of chips but they are not your
everyday average flavors these are
limited time only flavors that will blow
your mind at least mine when I heard
about them and I worked hard to track
these down you'll be seeing my live
reaction no editing of some editing
anyways on the left hand side we have
the cinnamon bun flavor
oMG followed by bacon poutine jalapeno
mac and cheese and tzatziki on the far
right so some very unusual chip flavors
in front of us today and these will be
different depending on what geographic
region you are in and you can actually
find some crazy flavors on Amazon as
well so I will link that down in the
description but enough with the preamble
let's get into the actual taste test
hmm I almost don't want to start with
the cinnamon bun because that to me is
the most exciting as far as an unusual
flavor so maybe we'll start right to
left let's get started with me tzatziki
what's special about these ones is it
says that they are kettle cooked so
they're gonna be a slightly different
texture I assume they kind of smell like
um they kind of smell like sour cream
and onion
okay those are good thumbs up for the
tzatziki they kind of taste like sour
cream and onion on that kettle chip real
nice
jalapeno jalapeno doesn't really matter
woody smell a little bit more funky a
little bit more funky not gonna lie so
this is a wavy chip whoa that's
different
not quite a bit different hmm kind of
interesting not too spicy not getting
enough jalapeno in my opinion doesn't
bake and make everything better I don't
know
right here we go standard chip no kettle
cook and no ripple on there whoa strong
bacon flavor coming through right now
getting a little bit of gravy coming in
there not a ton probably just good is
the first one
tzatziki probably not all right guys the
moment that I've been waiting for and
you've been waiting for the Lay's
cinnamon bun potato chips
unbelievable combination never would
have thought of it question is do they
taste like cinnamon bun whoa they smell
exactly like a cinnamon bun
Wow that is mind-blowing that is the
most unusual combination of chip and
flavor damn I taste the icing I taste
the cinnamon and I taste the bun
what kind of crazy chemistry is going on
in here that's wild
guys I don't know how else to break it
to you this tastes like a cinnamon bun
it does not taste like a chip I mean the
crunch is chip everything else is
cinnamon bun so there you have it the
cinnamon bun potato chip from Lay's it's
not my favorite in the group I'd
probably stick to the tzatziki myself
but this is one hell of an
accomplishment to encapsulate the flavor
of a cinnamon bun inside of a potato
chip
well done Lay's I didn't know it was
possible that wraps up this video this
taste test hopefully you guys enjoyed it
it's a little bit different a little bit
more fun and tell me in the comments
which flavor do you want to try most
would it be cinnamon bun bacon poutine
jalapeno mac and cheese or tzatziki
leave a comment if you enjoyed this
