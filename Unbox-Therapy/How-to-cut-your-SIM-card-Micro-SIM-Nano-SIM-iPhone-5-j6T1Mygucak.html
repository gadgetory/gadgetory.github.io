going to be showing you how to cut a sim
card I've done this a couple of times in
the past and you guys have requested
this kind of a video to show you exactly
how it's done in this case I'll be
taking a standard sim and cutting it
down to nano SIM form factor for the
iPhone 5 but the process would be the
same if you want to go down to a micro
sim size for previous iPhones or other
phones that are on the market like for
example my Nexus 4 which uses micro SIM
so you need a couple of things to
actually complete this procedure you're
going to need a template this template
here I'll link down in the description
so you don't have to go looking for one
but if you google micro sim or nano sim
template you'll find it as well but like
I said before there is a link in the
description you're also going to need a
little bit of sandpaper because a nano
SIM is actually thinner than a micro or
mini sim so you're going to need some of
this to actually adjust the thickness
you're also going to need a little bit
of tape which i've got over here that's
just so you can tape down the sim card
to the template draw your lines prior to
making your cut you want to have lines
on the card in order to guide your cuts
so that you don't mess it up you need to
get the exact fit for it to work in the
SIM card tray on the latest generation
iPhone I've also got a card just as
standard what is this gift card in order
to draw my lines even straighter and
you'll need a pen and the last thing
you're going to need is a fairly sharp
pair of scissors usually kitchen
scissors work the best because they're
generally a little bit stronger and
sharper than your regular arts and
crafts scissors so anyways let's go
ahead tape down the sim card and then go
ahead and draw our lines I'll probably
do that off camera right now and then
I'll come back and show you what the
finished product looks like so as you
can see here I've gone ahead and drawn
my lines onto the full-size or what they
call mini sim card and these lines here
once I cut across them that will result
in a nano sim as you can see right here
it will require cutting very close or
even in this case a little bit over top
of the metal contacts you do need to be
pretty careful to get a nice straight
cut across those areas in order as I
said before to get that precise fit so
I've taped down this
card I'm going to remove it from the
tape now and then I'll go ahead and make
my precision cuts
so when you're cutting all the way down
to a nano-sim like this you're basically
just cutting around the contact point
the metallic portion of the card there's
really no plastic left when you're
finished and when you're looking at your
diagram the innermost square this little
tiny portion in here is what you
actually need to end up with and as you
can see here with my cut it fits in
there perfectly or maybe you can't see
that but anyway it fits in there
perfectly so as far as the lateral cuts
go you want to go right along the edge
of the metallic portion removing the
plastic sides I've got a bunch of scraps
over there which wouldn't tell you much
at this point but basically you want to
follow the inner square on the diagram
from the mini sim to nano-sim portion in
order to get down to this nano sim right
here now the next step actually requires
a little bit of sanding because the last
thing that needs to happen is you need
to decrease the thickness of the actual
card a mini sim is slightly thicker than
a nano sim so you need to go onto the
backside where the poor the plastic is
and grind up some of the plastic not
very much you just want to rub it you
know just a gently and then go into the
tray after you have that there yet here
here's the tray and you want to put the
SIM card into the tray and you know
trial and error see if it fits and then
keep taking off a little bit more until
you've got a nice snug fit you don't
want to over sand you definitely don't
want to be seeing the contact points
from the back and so as I said the best
way to do it is to take off a little bit
of plastic using the sandpaper put it in
the tray and then keep trying till
you've got a snug fit I'm going to go do
some sanding right now and then we'll
check out the fit afterwards so as you
can see now I've got an iPhone 5 on the
Left it hasn't been activated yet it's
brand new unlocked and to my right is
where my SIM card and the tray is and
I'm going to try and show this to you
I've sanded down the back to the point
where you can sort of barely start to
see the shadow of the metallic portion
of the SIM card underneath that means
you're close enough you don't want to go
any further than that and you want to
also make sure that you've got a flush
fit on the top side of the tray that
means it's good to so at that point
you're ready to insert the card and then
go ahead and use your phone
this
card is not activated yet it needs to be
activated via phone call or the web so
you're not going to see your service
jump up right away in this particular
case but if you're coming from a sim
card that is activated at this point you
will see your service jump in so anyway
as you can see a good fit perfect fit
here on the iPhone 5 so that's a little
tutorial I just want to mention real
quick guys that you do this at your own
risk you don't want to be messing around
if you're scared of ruining your sim
generally there are about 20 bucks or
less so if you don't mind if you're not
too paranoid then you can go ahead and
attempt this yourself
so anyways you can see now that rather
than saying no sim instead it says no
service let's wait for the camera to
focus there hopefully again it says no
service now because the sim is not
activated but it is reading the sim as
being there so we've got a good cut in
this case so if you guys go ahead and do
this good luck and if you enjoyed this
content if you found it helpful or maybe
you'll be helpful in the future make
sure to leave a thumbs up down below it
does help out a bunch and thanks as
always for your viewership I'll catch
you guys on the next one later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
