Haley who can go out on a limb send a
few emails he sees a product that he
likes on the internet and then it shows
up here and he goes oh yeah that thing
yeah I thought might be cool maybe it
should be in the show today I have
something very bizarre it's called the
light phone it ships in this book look
at this designed to be used as little as
possible ooh such a strange statement
for any product you can probably guess
at this point what the intention is of
this device it is a phone meant to be as
simple as possible removing you from the
tight grip that social media has over
you now I'm not suggesting that that's
the case I'm just I'm talking about the
concept here this is the first device
that this company is made but apparently
there's an IndieGoGo happening they're
working on the next version let's check
out the first version and see where
we're at this idea has actually been
gathering a little bit of steam this
idea of digital detox where you would
put your smartphone away and I don't
know maybe you don't have the willpower
to do it without completely changing the
device that's in your pocket so let's
crack this thing open and see if it has
a reason to exist or if it's just
completely bizarre one of the things I
should mention it's not exactly cheap
either this one is about a hundred bucks
I can't think of one functional element
here that would probably extend beyond
even what your smart phone is capable of
inand that's probably in the battery
life range three days of battery life
right now you're probably screaming at
your camera lens you saying I'd why
would I want a phone with a keypad can't
watch YouTube maybe this is in your
future somewhere maybe things get so bad
you're not taking carrier your daily
activities could this be the antidote
okay so they're calling it a second
phone I want to be you know complete
transparency here they're not saying
it's gonna replace your smart phone
guessing here that all these experiences
I would be more likely to engage with
because I'm not staring at my smart
phone where is the actual phone I don't
there we go okay cool cutout in the book
it is nice it's kind of nice it's kind
of cute it's very slim you will not
notice that in your pocket all right I'm
coming up with some other circumstances
in which this might be cool it
still 100 bucks it's still not a
smartphone I get all that but what about
when you go for a jog or something you
don't want your full phone with you you
just want something slim for an
emergency situation there's something
cool about the design yes it's a dumb
phone they could have made it look
however I just like how simple it is all
right you get that you get a cable wow
that is so weird that that is bone can
you see that Wow
it is tiny I immediately see the the
earpiece up on the top there hold switch
lock switch over here SIM card trays
over here microphone and micro USB let's
see if we can power it up we got a
haptic a little vibration a buzz and the
keypad has lit up there's also a display
hidden here if I use the lock switch it
says lock and unlock it also vibrates
very strongly so you know you've done
that going through 2g connection hey hey
very loud so 2g clear voice hears clear
- he's clear
I mean we're calling we're making phone
calls x2 hang-up that's it tells you how
long it was and then the time pops back
up honestly guys there's not much I can
say about it you kind of at this point
you understand its intention like the
design of it it's a nice simple object -
miniscule you could hide it somewhere
but of course for many of you and
various other tech enthusiasts you're
sitting there thinking like that's the
last thing that I would want in my life
but the company year light they're
hoping not to replace your smart phone
but to be a back-up plan you could
criticize the hundred dollar price point
I guess you can actually get a smart
phone for like 100 bucks in the next
version they took the functionality up a
notch
maybe a couple of notches you're gonna
have messaging on the new one you're
gonna have an alarm Direction's
ride-sharing I mean you can watch the
video on IndieGoGo they're being more
ambitious with the next one you know
they're kind of going in between they're
like alright some things on smartphones
are actually kind of cool like how can
directions be bad for navigation you
don't really get addicted to that
imagine being addicted to Google Maps
I do like Google Maps but imagine every
day you're just like Matt freak that's
just like you know they updated the one
Street with they finally fixed it on the
corner of but anyway they brought a
little bit of functionality back into it
nonetheless I do want to know what you
guys think are you too addicted to
your smartphone lifestyle would you ever
consider making a change do you have the
discipline to just put it down
smartphone addiction it is real is this
the solution I'm not sure maybe a little
personal discipline all right get your
act together hopefully you can hopefully
I can we'll see
today's episode of unbox the P is
brought to you by the sengh lead element
smart bulb lighting system this is the
classic starter kit in front of me and
gets you up and running with two bulbs
and a hub which you can then add up to
50 bulbs to at only 10 bucks apiece
budget alternatives to some of the other
smart bulb systems you've seen on the
market on top of that this setup is
gonna work with Amazon Alexa Google
assistant or smart things so that brings
in the voice control as well hub is
pretty straightforward Ethernet port on
the back and an interesting thing you
can actually remove it from the wired
connection after the initial setup put
it anywhere you want so that's what the
bulb looks like right there now sangla
does make alternative bulbs in different
form factors depending on your light
fixtures all right so I'm gonna screw
this in got the hub plugged in right now
and you can see I can set up different
scenes for each bulb but can call it
bedroom living room bathroom I can
control brightness from a hundred
percent all the way down four percent
right there can set up schedules they
can go off automatically let's say for
example I know I'm gonna be sleeping at
a particular point two a.m. or something
all the lights go off on their own
another feature I like just a simple one
you can turn all your lights off and all
your lights on one tap from within the
app so there you have it the sengh LED
starter kit thanks to them for
sponsoring this episode if you've been
holding back your like Lou I don't know
when it's the right time I'm tech savvy
everywhere else why are my light bulbs
not now's the time yeah no excuses link
down in the description this set up this
starter kit about fifty bucks and then
you can add more bulbs for ten what are
you doing get it together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
