business in the first place you never
want to be caught off guard without your
tools here you have tools whoa you

holding a bunch of tools in it you still
have access to all your ports on the
bottom let's check out some of these
tools well is there a technique here

out usually maybe it's a thumb yeah it's
a thumb I didn't realize how much
stronger the thumb scenario what is this
