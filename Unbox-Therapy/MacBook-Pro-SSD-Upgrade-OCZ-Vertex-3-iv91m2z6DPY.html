therapy today I'm going to show you how
to put an SSD inside of your MacBook Pro
I'm using the vertex 3 and I'm also
going to move my traditional hard drive
over to the optical drive bay using this
adapter you'll need a Phillips number
double zero screw driver as well as a
Torx t6 use some decent ones because
these screws are really easy to strip
you got to pull all the screws off the
bottom plate and like I said I've used
some cheaper Chinese screwdrivers before
and these aluminum screws on the
MacBooks
are just not happy with those kinds of
screwdrivers they get stripped real easy
so let's go ahead and remove the
backplate and reveal the interior of the
MacBook Pro and as you can see we've got
the optical drive at the top side and
traditional hard drive down at the
bottom we're going to pull this 750
gigabyte hard drive out from this
location and put it into our adapter now
the hard drive is super easy to remove
it's just two little screws along the
top side here that Philips double-0
screws and they're attached to this
bracket piece you can lift the entire
thing out after you've got it unscrewed
of course we put it to the side and then
you can just lift the hard drive up and
out this is a lot easier than it used to
be on older generation MacBook Pros
you've got to remove the SATA connector
on the back be careful with that don't
want to tear the ribbon now on the side
of the traditional drive you've got some
screws that hold it in place when it's
installed you got to remove these these
are Torx t6 screws you're going to put
those into your SSD once it's ready and
pull off that little pull tab and
install that on your SSD as well it's
just held there by a little bit of
sticky glue no big deal just helps you
get it out so here are those little
screws the little feet we got to go
ahead and install those into the SSD
because it's going to be going into the
traditional drive bay location
again these are Torx t6 screws so once
you get that all zipped up put it to the
side because we're not going to put it
in straightaway we're going to wait till
we've got the optical drive out so
here's that adapter and this just
basically allows you to put a two and a
half inch laptop drive or SSD into your
optical drive bay now the reason that
I'm putting the hard drive into the
optical drive bay and not the SSD is
because on this particular MacBook Pro
the optical drive bay is only three
gigabits per second whereas the
traditional hard drive bay is six
gigabits per second and of course my SSD
being a vertex three can utilize the
extra speed of the of the other bay so
here's what we got to remove from the
optical drive there's these three
connectors and these two screws along
the top will help you to lift up this
bracket that holds some of the antenna
wiring and then there are three screws
around the outside of the optical drive
these are Torx t6 as well so after
you've got those out you can just lift
this little bracket up and that will
enable you to sort of get at this last
Torx t6 down on the bottom side here and
then you can just pry the optical drive
up and out just be careful with it it's
fragile
so put that to the side
now the optical drive has a couple of
connectors on it these are going to be
important this is how we interface with
the adapter so you've got to pull this
little piece out here and you've also
got to unscrew the little backside
bracket here there's two screws there
you can see them you got to pull that
off and put that onto your adapter as
well so once you've got that all hooked
up all you got to do is slide the
adapter along with your hard drive back
into that location line it up properly
now you don't have as many screw points
on the adapter so
it might feel a little bit more loose
than the original but don't panic it's
definitely safe in there so here's the
vertex 3 and this is the last part to
get this installed here simply go ahead
and connect the SATA connector push that
in and then align the little feet that
you installed push those in as well and
then it should just drop down nicely on
the other portion there you have it now
all you have to do is pick up that
little bracket I mentioned earlier with
the two Phillips screws on it zip that
baby back in and the vertex is going to
be secure as well now since I don't have
an optical drive installed anymore I'm
going to have to go ahead and install my
OS over USB now that's ok because I've
got a USB hard drive dedicated to OS
installs I'll show you how to set one of
those up in a future video
until then we'll boot up to the
traditional hard drive the original 750
launch Disk Utility then we'll select
the OCZ vertex click on partition in my
case one partition is fine you may need
more I'm going to call mine SSD then
we've got to select the format type now
some have suggested that journaled slows
down in SSD but it's going to give you a
little bit of extra security so I prefer
it over a none journaled partition so
once we've got that set up we're ready
for our USB install and like I said I'll
show you guys how to do that in a future
video stay tuned for benchmarks and more
of this vertex 3 drive so far feels real
fast</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
