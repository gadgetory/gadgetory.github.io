therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Nikon Coolpix P 7700 or Nikon
Coolpix depending on where you are in
the world and how you choose to
pronounce it that's completely up to you
this is a high-grade top tier
point-and-shoot camera normally that
doesn't go hand-in-hand
you know normally point-and-shoot
cameras are not for enthusiasts but this
one has an incredible number of features
that aren't usually available on
point-and-shoot cameras the lens is the
first thing the second thing is the
articulating LCD screen so it has a
3-inch spinning articulating LCD screen
which gives you the ability to frame
shots while looking at yourself or from
unusual angles and it's one of the major
things that attracted me to this
particular camera for those of you guys
that follow my gear list actually you
can check out my entire gear list at our
website I'll link the gear list down
below so you can see all the stuff we
use on the show for the channel and in
our personal lives but those of you that
follow me you know I use a Canon 60d
digital SLR well there are times and
events where an SLR is not ideal and you
want something more portable and I
really hope that this camera can fill in
in those circumstances moving on to the
unboxing the first thing you're going to
notice is this camera strap and the
reason they included I'm sure is because
this camera even though it's
point-and-shoot is not the smallest one
I've ever seen it's in fact quite a bit
larger than my hx9 V from Sony so it
fits size Y somewhere between your
average point-and-shoot and a digital
SLR you'll see more of that as the video
progresses you get a dedicated battery
charger which is a good thing this means
if you get an extra battery you have a
way of charging that one up while the
other one is in use and has the
flip-down prongs I like that it makes it
a little easier to travel with you're
also going to get a USB cable this is
pretty self-explanatory this is how
you're going to connect the device to
your computer if you choose to do that
you can obviously offload data this way
or you can just extract the SD card and
offload data that way you're also going
to get a composite video / audio cable
with a proprietary connector AV
connector on the other end that's for
outputting video content or picture
content onto a larger display let's go
ahead and take a closer look at the
actual camera the first thing you're
going to notice here
it looks a lot like Nikon's progear in
the sense that the materials in use are
very very similar you have this sort of
rubberized black appearance which makes
it look like a pro device even though it
doesn't come in at a pearl price point
actually if you're interested in pricing
and availability on this camera I will
drop a link down in the description so
you can check that out but at the time
of filming this I believe the camera was
around 380 bucks depending on where you
get it from the link down below will
likely be the cheapest link there is it
uses an en-dash il-14 battery which is a
fairly large battery for a camera of
this size I'm happy to see that it means
it's probably going to last a fair while
for either video coverage or still
images as you guys might imagine I shoot
a lot more video than I do pictures so
having that bigger battery should
definitely pay dividends this camera
also has some other features that are
unique in this space including a
microphone input which is really crazy
for a camera of this size you even have
digital SLRs out on the market that
don't have microphone inputs so that
gives you the ability to get some better
audio into the camera than what the
on-board mics are capable of that's
actually a look at them right there
although that being said the on-board
mics are pretty decent quality I've used
them in a couple of different
environments and I got really great
results so far so that's a really good
sign I might not need an external audio
solution for some of the stuff that I'm
doing the back of the device shows off
an incredible number of switches buttons
and wheels and this is important it
means you're going to get manual control
on the fly of many important camera
features that a pro user would love to
have access to including shutter speed
f-stop got exposure compensation wheel
there you can see the other wheel
controls your shooting mode the shutter
is on the top where you'd normally find
it you've also got an on and off switch
there and a very cool wheel on the other
side of the device which allows you to
quickly adjust things like white balance
ISO and a number of other functions
within the camera the hinge that
controls the articulating screen is
fairly robust it doesn't feel at any
point like it's weak in any way
definitely impressed by it as you can
see the lens extends when you power the
camera on it is a zoom lens so you're
going to get some extra rain
and extra reach anyway guys this wraps
up the unboxing of the coolpix P 7700
from Nikon as you guys know I'm a big
fan of powerful pointing shoots it's
been said in the past that the best
camera is the one you have with you and
I completely agree if your camera's too
big or bulky and you choose not to take
it to a specific event then it's doing
you no good so having a camera with this
kind of manual control that can also fit
in your pocket it's very very cool and I
can't wait to use it and film some more
vlogs for you guys anyways if you
enjoyed this video please remember to
leave a thumbs up down below thanks as
always for watching and I'll catch you
on the next video later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
