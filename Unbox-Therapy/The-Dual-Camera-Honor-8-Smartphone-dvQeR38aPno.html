are all the different colors of the
newly announced honor 8 smartphone what
do I have midnight black pearl white
sapphire blue and gold which one is
right for you well hey that's up to you
let's jump inside and take a closer peek
here ooh how about how about the
unboxing experience round you don't see
that often the upright style there oh
whoa
it's like a I might even see yourself in
a reflection there Jack and you can see
that it changes colors in the different
lighting does have a dual lens system
which you can see up here two-tone flash
as well the fingerprint sensor is in
this location and it's clickable bottom
you'll find a single USBC connector
speaker a headphone jack ding-ding-ding
super-slim a little bit of a chamfered
edge there as well elegantly displayed
SIM card tool power brick as well as a
USBC cable blue whoa
look at that blue oh the pure kind of
look there whoo-hoo that's what the
black one looks like look at that right
there two SIM cards if you choose to or
a SIM card as well as a micro SD card
nice and vibrant providing you not just
with two lenses but also with two
different sensors so you've got one
color sensor here and then you've got
one monochrome sensor this allows you to
take essentially black and white
monochromatic images they're super high
contrast so if you launch into the
camera app here the mono option is in
the top left corner but there are some
other filters that you can use as well
this allows you to create again a
monochromatic image okay so I'm going to
show you here there is this mode which
allows you to create this shallow depth
of field by essentially taking two
images and that's what gives you this
really cool shallow depth of field
effect isolate an object from an
artistic perspective but after you've
snapped the photo then
can you do are you stuck with it no in
this particular case you can shrink that
aperture down and grab back some of the
outer elements and bring them into focus
as well options for exposure
compensation auto focus white balance
ISO a photo of the video that you're
watching while you're watching that
video make sure to get the various edges
so let's say I'd lock the device and I
come back Oh
hit it with the finger boom so here we
go with the speaker this is a weird one
yes it has a 3000 milliamp hour battery
in it it also has quick charge so you
could get like 50 percent battery life
in about 30 minutes of charging it there
there's a mode called perfect selfie
check me out it's not a pretty dude
right there who knows what you're
looking at right now this could all be
beauty mode you meet me in real life
you're like oh god
hello-o are they closed
thank you right successful phone call
believe it or not smart phones still
make phone calls it's almost like the
smartphone market place's got a little
bit stagnant for a minute there and then
people are like wait these are cameras
there's all this software on there can
we do anything cool what if we chuck a
second lens on there I mean I like these
kind of ambitious unusual looks at what
this tech can do for us and where you
can make those changes and where you can
experiment with what you're going to
include so this device the honor rate
here you're looking at a device that's
399 bucks retail available in a few
different colors and it's it's pretty
hard to distinguish it from stuff that's
twice that price so go check it out for
yourself I don't need to tell you you
