what is up folks we are back with
another video you guys voted on this one
I posted a picture on Instagram Facebook
and Twitter and I asked you guys what
you wanted to see unbox next I put a few
things on the table spread out and you
requested these items right here that
are in front of me if you want to
participate in these kinds of votes in
the future make sure to be following me
on Instagram Facebook and Twitter
I'll put the links down in the
description of this video so what are we
looking at today we're looking at some
products from a new company at least new
to me called Phoenix and they make
high-end computer peripherals we have a
mouse from them this is called the
necesita as you can see here on the side
of the packaging and everything it's
very simplistic in terms of how this is
delivered and how it is presented but
the main attraction is of course the
device itself they have apparently put a
lot of attention to detail into the
design as well as the materials so I'll
pull the mouse out first underneath is a
keyboard which I think I'm a little bit
more excited for only because I peeked
at it and it has a really cool finish to
it it also is mechanical and it has
Cherry MX brown switches which I don't
have a keyboard with those switches in
them currently so those will be cool to
try out it's also a fairly large Mouse
which I like I'm not a big fan of tiny
little mice where you have to claw your
hand up I mean if you did want to do
that with this particular Mouse you
could but if you want to lay your entire
palm on there that's very easy to do
there's a little bit of protective
covering here I'll remove as well as a
logo there that says meseta and then a
screen all of the controls are right on
the unit there's no special software
that you need to install no extra below
the materials are also very very smooth
and look like they should be resistant
to fingerprints I mean obviously I don't
know at this point but I'm putting my
fingers on there and I can't seem to
bring up any fingerprints so that's a
good thing you obviously have some
different buttons here for different
functionality there's a scroll wheel
it's
two buttons on the side over here I
believe these are shoulder buttons thumb
buttons I don't know whatever you want
to call them convenient for everything
you do on your computer web browsing etc
and they're really nice and clicky as
well there's Teflon covering on the
bottom so it slides very smoothly
there's also replacement pads over here
by the looks of it so you're going to be
good to go in the future let's take out
the paperwork and just read a little bit
more detailed information on the Necedah
the passion never dies it is reborn some
intense copy on this little piece of
paper you could begin gaming with your
Phoenix Necedah
right out of the box in addition to
hardware improvements the 2014 Necedah
has been re-engineered to be completely
driverless with all functions able to be
performed directly from the mouse so
that's like I said earlier no need for
separate software I'm a huge fan of that
please refer to your personal support
managers contact information on this
card for any support you may require
lastly be sure to register your mouse
that's something that's also unique to
the Phoenix brand with a purchase of one
of their peripherals you actually get an
account manager somebody that you can
call directly if you have any issues
with your device that's really nice on
the bottom here you have the Phoenix
logo which is cut out obviously it's
gonna light up as well this thing feels
very comfortable to hold you really just
want to use it and as I said it's it's
big which is good something interesting
too but you don't see all the time over
here the extension for your middle
finger is actually a little bit longer
than the extension for the index finger
and it kind of makes sense even though I
haven't seen it before and it doesn't
exist on my current Mouse if you take a
look at your hand which is your longest
finger your middle finger so in this
particular case it's going to extend a
little bit more naturally into that
location anyways at this point looking
very promising I will be testing it out
against my performance MX from Logitech
you guys know I'm a big fan of that and
seeing how it stacks up now let's move
on to the keyboard here a uto ar e so
they
I've really gone fancy with the naming
conventions here you can maybe see the
name I don't know if they can pick up
the light there you can see it a little
bit at or I will open this baby up here
once again very simple packaging so on
top here we have a card once again
inside we have the keyboard and then
underneath there's a couple of different
items here another braided cable which
is common for a mouse but not so common
for a keyboard this does have a
detachable cable which is cool so if you
need a long cable you've got it if you
need a short cable you've got it you can
use any standard mini USB which is good
if you have say a usb on your screen
that you want to connect to and it's
really close and you don't have to have
this huge cable hanging out and trying
to manage it etcetera instead just go
get a smaller mini USB which everybody
has or a lot of people have they have
also included a ps2 adapter not too many
people using these anymore watch and say
that I mean there's still people using
these for various reasons but in my
particular case I won't be using this
but you've got it as I said earlier in
this video
this is featuring the Cherry MX brown
switches I have never tried these
switches before at least in everyday use
like I've never owned a keyboard with
these switches and this keyboard is
pretty damn cool looking this this I'm
pumped up about look how stealth that
looks right there guys so it's got this
like sheen to it
it's silver kind of coloring and Sheen
Wow and it feels really nice as well you
have some LEDs over here the whole thing
feels insanely solid very very solid
very pretty to look at and a change from
all of the standard black or
crazy-looking gaming keyboards that are
out there that are shiny and glossy this
one is understated it could exist in a
gaming environment but just as easily it
could exist in a studio environment a
content creation environment a video
editing environment it's
cetera without looking out of place your
mini USB port in that location which
makes sense as I said before that's
removable on the bottom we have our
serial number designed by Phoenix in
California assembled in Taiwan you have
some feet on here to make sure
everything stays dirty and not too many
screw points that is just a very
simplistic and beautiful keyboard it
sounds strange to see me get so excited
to hear me get so excited about a
keyboard but I just like understated and
simple design and that's what this one
has go with legitimate mechanical keys
which is very popular Cherry MX brown so
there you have it guys the at or
mechanical keyboard from Phoenix big fan
of this haven't even used it yet but I
can tell right away that I'm going to
enjoy having this in my setup now the
mouse is probably going to be a tougher
switch for me because I am so into the
performance MX and I've been using it
for so long but I can tell right away
that the form factor of this one is very
similar so if any Mouse had a chance at
changing my mind this one might very
well be it also my performance MX is
getting a little bit old and the battery
isn't holding up as well so it
essentially is a wired mouse at this
point so who knows maybe this will
become my mouse to match this wonderful
new keyboard over here very impressive
stuff from a new company and I'm happy
to share these new products with you
guys here on unbox therapy so if you
enjoyed this content please remember to
leave a thumbs up down below I'm gonna
go and test this thing out right now
check it out and see how much I like it
if you have any questions you want to
talk to me one of the best places to
find me is on Twitter so all my social
links I think I mentioned this earlier
in the video but all of my social links
are down in the description I hope to
communicate with you guys there ask me
some questions about this new stuff that
I'm unboxing all the time I have a huge
stack of products over there and I need
to get through them so expect more votes
coming up for what product will be next
going on a rampage alright thanks as
always for watching catch you guys on
the next episode later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
