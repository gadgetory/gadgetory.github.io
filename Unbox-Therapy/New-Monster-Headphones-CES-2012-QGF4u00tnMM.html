they're unveiling a bunch of new
headphones over here we got the energy
brand over here and there's a couple of
different models looks like there's some
in years as well as some on the Year
style semi portable looking headphones
and then there's also this diesel
partnership here these are called the
vector a very unique design you can get
closer than there aj get a better look
and the retailer i believe on these is
going to be 199 there's also the
inspiration which has an interchangeable
headband along the top so you can play
low key or go for something slightly
more inspirational and you can see get a
look at the different headbands down on
the bottom there I believe the retail
price except for these was to 249 no was
a 249 say at 249 and then the last one
we got is the diamond tears and these
ones have the appearance of a
diamond-shaped tier you can see a real
cool design we also heard about some
black ones of the same model so monsters
got some even even more crazy headbands
for that same series of headphone you
can get a better look at some of them
here and then some prototypes along the
top four especially courageous
individuals and then you can see over
here you got them done up in white as
well that's the inspiration real good
look and then there's a studded finish
as well on the black inspiration over
here so we're now on the other side of
the monster booth and this is where the
in-ear headphones are being kept there's
the turbines the turbine pro that you
may have seen before they've got a
couple of different colors to look at
their gold bronze there's a gunmetal
look and then a silver you've also got
the miles davis brand headphone and once
again that's out as well this is a new
one this is called the gratitude it's
got a very interesting design more like
a square kind of shape you can get a
better look at the box right there once
again that one's called the gratitude
and they've also got some new sport
style headphones including the yellow
Lance Armstrong inspired LIVESTRONG
headphones we have some really crazy
harajuku lovers head headphones in here
they got diamonds accurate and whatnot
