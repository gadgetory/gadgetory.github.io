showing up around here a studio this one
unexpected kind of a master &amp;amp; dynamic
never looked at their headphones before
studio 35 X Kevin Durant this is his
approach to headphones it's not like
plastering your name on it you find a
company that's already doing headphones
in the first place and then it's like a
collab of some sort Kevin Durant that's
right the basketball player NBA star
could be out for most of next season but
still a star signed a big deal he's got
a collab with master and dynamic now
what I know about this company these are
premium headphones expensive headphones
brilliant performance Jack brilliant you
understand okay brilliant
up to 24 hour battery life let's go
ahead crack into it and see if these are
any good will can you give me a cost on
this how much of these things cost $500
okay so no joke well they got a retro
vibe going on that's a leather headband
ladies and gentlemen I like the fact
that it's kind of atomic era early
headphone days sitting by the turntable
inspired I like these red buttons on the
side for volume as well similar on the
inside of the ear cuffs with this orange
fabric any other colors will so silver
leather black leather and metallic
silver according to will do it looks
like you have a USB type-c connector for
charging them up this is a must in my
opinion I have a lot of wireless
headphone sitting around and if I pick
one up and it's still micro USB I'm just
like you know it feels antiquated at
this point I hate that connector it's a
flimsy connector so type C of course
they charge up quicker as well in most
cases there is a traditional mini jack
connector over here because you might
need to use them wired that this tension
slide situation going on no clicks no
click clap look at that that's a nice
little canvas type of bag there with a
magnetic connector on the top is here we
go like this oh they just fit in like
this okay so this is just an extra pouch
down on the bottom has a zipper pocket
and I would assume you you're gonna put
your accessories in that right extra
cables it's a nice carry bag you got to
have it this is your mini jack cable
it's braided they carried through the
same concept for the type-c cable as
well
the airline adapter these are these are
popping up a lot less
we recently but if you're on an older
aircraft you you still may see this type
of connector so you throw it in the
zipper pocket you have it if you need it
they've even included that's pretty cool
that's a type c2 typical USB connector
okay has a bit of a charge you can see
this light flashing over here I think it
goes into pairing mode immediately oh
it's like a it's like a alien okay there
we go
MW 65 I got the prompt here to set up
Google assistance so obviously these
headphones support Google assistant as
well let's play some tunes
we'll say something loud oh wait wait
wait again again
hello again hello again well I should
tell you our beuliss I'm listening to
music okay they sound good they gotta
sound good
that's what five hundred come on they
sound good get that out of the way these
have removable ear pads
I have noise canceling turnover out it's
not enough to have noise canceling
anymore you got to have different
versions of it that's what I was just
talking through what Jack was yelling to
scream mode one high high noise
cancellation that's what I mom right now
airplanes city streets and so forth low
lower noise or win the environment if
you don't want such an offense noise
cancellation I've switched to that right
now okay and then there's also an
offsetting now I can hear my own voice
you know certain times noise canceling
depending on what I'm listening to not
so much with music but maybe for like a
podcast or something can feel like
you're in a fish tank that you're
squeezing you're not the most pleasant
in certain circumstances the ability to
turn it off is a must that said I got to
get the edge to the Sony headphone that
allows me to have the microphone
pass-through so I could actually hear
the surroundings that's one step better
for environments in which you need to
remain aware of your surroundings and
you can't have the noise canceling
function because you have to remember
with any of these headphones there's
passive noise isolation as well just
having this on your ear is blocking you
from your surroundings what can I say
about these headphones I like them first
up I like headphones that are a lighter
color like this the materials feel
really high-quality you can kind of
understand why you're paying the money
that you're paying sound wise forty
millimeter beryllium high performance
drivers yeah they sound good like I just
said but it's not it's not like I'm
noticing $500 worth of sound I would say
compared to the cheaper stuff that I've
tried including the Sony headphones I
have downstairs with you you see
typically around 350 something like that
sometimes even less than that so I put
it in the same territory why are you
buying this instead of that headphone
which has been received so well well I
think you can argue that's a more
premium looking headphone there's a more
premium
feeling handphone like it looks and
feels special I think people are gonna
pick this because they're expecting good
sound because good sound is a must but
then also they like the retro styling
and they want something different they
want something that stands out
what's the collab I don't know did they
just stamp a badge on it if it's the
blue button that ain't gonna mean much
because he would Golden State anymore
you see that Jack NBA free agency what a
mess everybody's moving around all over
the place you came doing door
Smithfield's anymore anyhow it's a fancy
headphone if you get the Kevin Durant if
you get the standard version you know
what you're getting it's a really cool
look it does sound good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
