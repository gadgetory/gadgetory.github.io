tell today I am wearing a collared shirt
that is because it is time to get down
to some serious business here on unbox
therapy besides me I've got the
PlayStation 4 it on the other side the
Xbox one this is the launch of a brand
new series in which I will be pitting
each of these systems against one
another in order to find out which one I
prefer and which one I think might be a
better purchase for you we might not get
a definitive answer but along the way I
will be going over all of the
characteristics of each of the two
consoles the benefits the drawbacks etc
comparing things like gameplay the
launch titles that are currently
available the hardware the software and
in this video the initial comparison
video I'll be looking at the controllers
the PlayStation 4 controller vs the Xbox
one controller finding out which one I
prefer and why but as I said before this
is just the initial video in a series of
videos I wanted to spread it out over a
period of time because as I use the
system's more I will likely uncover more
things I like and more things I don't
like so if you're not a subscriber yet
go ahead and click the subscribe button
up above or down below or wherever it
happens to be in order to be updated
with all of these videos as they become
available
if you're a fan of this concept and
excited to continue watching this series
make sure to leave a thumbs up down
below but now without any more
hesitation let's get into our initial
comparison in this series the
controllers
controller preference has a lot to do
with comfort after all you'll be
spending hundreds of hours holding on to
either of these in this department I've
got great news both of the new
controllers are more comfortable to hold
at least in my hands than their
predecessors the single largest physical
difference lies in the layout of the
analog thumb sticks but this is nothing
new just like on the last gen
controllers the Xbox features an offset
design while the PlayStation offering
sticks to its guns with symmetrical
analogues depending on the game you are
playing in the size of your hands this
placement could determine which
controller is best for you in my opinion
the offset thumb sticks on the Xbox one
controller lend themselves well to
first-person games offering up an
increased range of motion for the left
thumb on an average-sized hand and in my
experience slightly more accuracy for
other games driving for example these
symmetrical thumb sticks on the
DualShock 4 begin to shine their texture
gives an enormous amount of grip even
after long gaming sessions great for
minut movements the triggers on the ps4
controller are a huge improvement over
the ps3 equivalent they've got the
perfect amount of spring giving you
plenty of pull without requiring too
much effort the triggers on the Xbox one
controller feel marginally heavier
requiring a slight amount more effort to
pull completely the triggers are a bit
larger on the Xbox one controller making
it somewhat more comfortable when
resting your index fingers microsoft
claims to have improved the audio
quality for headsets plugged into the
one controller problem is this comes at
a cost
as they've opted for proprietary
connector in comparison sony has gone
with a standard mini jack audio
connector capable of passing audio
through to the headset of your choice
the Dual Shock 4 features some tech
obviously targeted at the future you've
got the high res touchpad mono speaker
and the light bar on the back for motion
gaming these features are yet to be
fully leveraged by developers and
therefore they are very hard
to evaluate at this point in time both
controllers can charge and operate over
microUSB the Xbox controller ships with
double-a batteries while the ps4
controller is natively rechargeable a
rechargeable battery pack can be added
to the xbox controller for an extra cost
I like the fact that the Xbox controller
can operate using both power sources but
I wish a rechargeable pack was included
in the Box instead of expanding the
overall cost you seriously can't go
wrong with either of these two
controllers I'd be happy to use either
exclusively it's almost impossible to
give one of the two an outright victory
in this round as there are benefits and
drawbacks to each one I think Sony has
really closed the gap in the controller
Department though by upsizing the Dual
Shock 4 and heavily improving the
triggers from the PlayStation 3
controller as hard as it is to pick
that's the whole damn purpose of a
showdown so here's how I'll break it
down if you play primarily first-person
game shooters etc it's tough to beat the
offset thumbsticks
go for the Xbox one controller for all
other games sports driving etc go for
the Dual Shock 4 it's a fantastic mix
with a larger set of overall features
and the possibility of future
enhancements through its unique touchpad
and motion elements BAM
there you have it but seriously these
are both great controllers I'm impressed
with what Microsoft and Sony were able
to accomplish even though it took them
close to a decade and according to
Microsoft over 100 million dollars in
the next episode of this epic showdown
series between the PlayStation 4 and the
Xbox one we're going to be taking a
closer look at the multimedia
capabilities of both of the platforms a
quick teaser though they both do a
really great job and both include one of
my favorite streaming services on the
planet which is Hulu Plus it's like Hulu
comm except amped up to the next level
with Hulu Plus you can catch up on
current television shows or you can
binge watch a bunch of old favorites my
family and I have been catching up on
old SNL episodes over the holidays and
getting a bunch of laughs while doing so
but you can catch current stuff too like
Jimmy Kimmel Live shark tank and a bunch
more
they've even got movies so it's
definitely worth
checking out and Hulu Plus has been cool
