you guys these things these arrived at
the studio mock-up but fully functional
versions of like a potential a guess at
the next iPhone in it they typically
come out before the next iPhone comes
out for whatever reason these things get
manufactured fabricated in China and it
gets sold and usually they're pretty
close to what the eventual model will
look like based on the rumors and the
schematics that are available to case
manufacturers in China and so on it can
kind of go out and make these things
close to the authentic spec but in this
year's case I've got some word from some
insiders that this is not actually that
close shortly after filming this video I
received a CNC model of what I'm told is
a more accurate representation of the
potential next iPhone the iPhone 11 so
just a quick refresh before I get to
that this is an iPhone Tenace Max and
that's what the current camera module
looks like you can see here with these
knockoff clone versions of the potential
next iPhone that they just sort of
scaled up this camera module that exists
on the 10s max from a design perspective
with this metallic Ridge cutout and also
this black glossy backdrop for the
camera modules but I'm being told that
that's the part that's wrong and this
one right here wrapped in a microfiber
cloth this is the CNC model of what that
camera implementation is said to
actually look like now it's still a
square and I have to say for my personal
preference it's a it's slightly more
appealing so a slightly better looking
but maybe most importantly just more
iPhone esque this seems more in line
with kind of current Apple aesthetic you
can see it doesn't pop off of the phone
nearly as much either it doesn't have as
much movement like as opposed to this
here or even the current model but the
key factor here is that
it relies on these much larger circles
it's just less abrasive it's less
popping out it looks less like an
appendage and more like a part of the
design I think this is still gonna be
polarizing I think people are still
gonna call it some sort of arachnid
they're gonna be scared of it as they do
with the new iPhone releases regardless
now that I see them side by side I can't
really tell which one I like better it's
tough to say this is not a clone this is
not a fully functioning model this is a
one-off custom-made CNC I can't turn
this on right now but what I've been
told is that this is way closer if not
exactly how the next version the iPhone
11 is going to look and not like those
fully functioning clones that you've
seen floating around the internet and in
the previous video it's a more matte
anodized looking finish the vibrate
switch over here changed from this
elongated format that it's been for a
long time to this more iPad esque
circular switch so this is the other
rumor the other change that doesn't show
up on these clone models but instead
does show up on this CNC version which
is said to be closer to an accurate
representation of the next iPhone the
sim tray is a bit lower and actually the
the power switch seems a bit lower - now
when it comes to accuracy and those
departments I am a little skeptical
myself but I think the main takeaway
here is that this camera implementation
is the one you should probably prepare
yourself or based on the information
that I have access to right now the
other thing I noticed though is on the
front of the device the way these
sensors are mapped face sensors here
including the front-facing camera you
compare that to the current version here
those holes are slightly larger and more
defined now part of that might just be
the fact that it's a model part of that
might be a change in some of the tech
there might be a change in a
front-facing camera we don't really know
anyhow I think I hope I think I've been
told that this is the closest you're
gonna get right now to looking at the
iPhone 11 the actual iPhone 11 it's not
those clones but instead it's this thing
here I'm glad to be honest that Apple is
implementing another camera module
whether
you like the look of it or not I think
it's an important transition because
it's become an indispensable feature on
other smartphones so I think it's an
area that Apple has to evolve and it's a
hard thing to do you look at the triple
camera implementations that exist on
other devices and like you have
something like this I mean this is the
one plus seven Pro over here you can go
the long way with it but the reason it
seems Apple is always handicapped in
that department is they're they're stuck
never wanting to move this giant Apple
logo but it's like that has to be there
and because of that you end up with some
limitations from a design perspective
and it might just be those very
limitations that drove Johnny ive far
far away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
