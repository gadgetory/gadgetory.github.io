video starts Jack has told me he has
said 50,000 thumbs up on this video and
he will come to your home town to visit
the mayor and you and your family
naked what's up guys Lew here back with
another video and today we are going to
be looking at something that's
completely outlandish you're in the
comments section right now saying Lew
this makes no sense I feel uncomfortable
why are you showing me something so
strange and some of you might even say
useless these are 24 karat gold
headphones for the true boss players
that are out there you know who you are
okay really proud I'm gonna be I mean
who really 24 karat they're made by
monster these of course are the geniuses
behind the beats by dre Apple Bob beats
wears monster left monsters left out in
the cold like an ex-girlfriend whoa in
the absence of Dre you do what anyone
would do you cover it in gold this is
for those DJ's you're at the club and
everybody's having a good time and
they're like there is the god of the
music over there which one who are you
pointing at the man in the gold live
life out loud with crystal clear audio
perfection you're not afraid of showing
who you are with the brilliant look of
24k are they implying that the gold
plating effects the sound of course it
does
look I mean you've got a note from the
head monster the head monster hi I've
got a meeting at the office today Oh
who's it with the head monster you got a
cleaning cloth a user manual telling me
how the ear works accessories are that's
actually a kind of nice little case
they're silky inside I feel an adapter
two options for cables so you have the
straight cable with the microphone you
have the v-j cable here's the gold this
is what y'all came here for the build
feels pretty sturdy here
very solid 24 karat legit gold 24 karat
gold adjustable 24 karat gold-plated
headphones what a world we live in guys
can I be a DJ yet am i DJ ready now if
you want to catch some looks if you want
to get some attention you can pretty
much guarantee this is the way to do it
how do they sound you say the moment of
truth what have we here like you would
completely expect the emphasis here is
on bass to be quite honest in this
particular case I can pretty confidently
say that what you're paying for here is
an aesthetic a style so I'm not out here
to say they're like to somebody this
doesn't sound good I'm just saying for
like the 8 million dollars that they
cost that's accurate right Jack you're
probably paying for some gold there the
man with the golden headphones could be
you and everybody else will be sitting
over here bitching about sound quality
meanwhile you're doing donuts in a
McLaren f1 on your way to a hot tub full
of women when you're on the couch and
you have to input text ah drives you
crazy la tete a tete a tete a tete a
tete a tete a tete a tete a tete
