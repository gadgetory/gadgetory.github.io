about the Galaxy s8 now I know I put
that video together alright Galaxy s8
does it suck a lot of people got all
fired up
how dare he even put that combination of
words together in the title in the
headline Galaxy s8 and the word suck
well they kind of see they miss the does
it part and then they also miss the end
part in which I say that he doesn't suck
at all in fact it does the opposite
funny how that works
human hearing and comprehension remember
that when you're in school the report
card Jack got a very good no he didn't
failing grade I kind of open that video
talking about a few of the things that
were bugging me about the phone towards
the end I got to some of the things that
I liked you know people were getting
fired up rightfully so I don't mind to
be honest one thing that came across to
me from the audience is that the
audience wanted more you wanted
something comprehensive you know
sometimes I forget that I'm in this
position here where you're kind of
relying on me
maybe you want to sit down with a bowl
of cereal for half an hour and listen to
me dive deeply into this device so what
did I do I put on is this blue I put on
a blue sweatshirt I love this device
that's what I was trying to get across
to you guys just maybe I didn't cover
all those little nuances so today's the
day may be the start of something new in
which you and me we spend even more time
together in a video becomes an
experience we get intimate all because
of the galaxy essay so take another bite
of cereal sit back relax here is the
good the bad and the ugly when it comes
to the Samsung Galaxy S II
number one in the good category in the
good column we're talking about this
display you don't need me to tell you
how beautiful this display is you've
heard it everywhere and if you've ever
used a Samsung display before certainly
in the last few generations and you know
these guys are setting the standard you
have an AMOLED panel here from a
contrast perspective whether it's in a
phone or in that TV over there the ratio
between dark sections of the screen and
light sections of screen let me I just
want to bring up so you can truly
appreciate what's going on but generally
to the average person a pleasing image
has a ton of range between the dark
portions on the display and the bright
one when it comes to color you're
looking for this kind of vibrance this
saturation and so on now I've mentioned
before this is an unusual aspect ratio
and it's an unusual curvature to the
glass of course they're calling it the
infinity display this is going to give
you a sense of immersion into the
content that goes beyond the bezel and
it's not just the fact that it's AMOLED
but it's super-high resolution by
default coming out of the box it's not
going to be in maximum resolution but
that's going to provide you with some
extended battery life nonetheless if you
want it 29 60 by 1440 in a 6.2 inch
display here or on the regular sa 5.8
inch but it doesn't really stop there
because there are a lot of options here
for configuration now in the first video
I think a lot of you guys look at the
way I was talking about it in a really
negative light assuming that what I was
saying was the dish was somehow
disingenuous and maybe there's an
element there where I think Samsung
probably could have delivered the max
capacity out the box but it wasn't it
wasn't all negative for certain users
myself included having the option to go
in there and make those tweaks and
configuration for a power user like
myself possibly a lot of you in the
audience you like this ability to dive
into the settings and create your own
viewing experience so it doesn't
stop with brightness and resolution it
also dives into this blue light filter
which I think it's one of the best
implementations I've seen so you've
probably heard about this in the past
where you can kind of shift the color
temperature to something that's pleasing
to you or you can you have it shift
throughout the day to help you go to bed
at night what you can do here is you
could turn it on manually and get this
warmer color tone or you can schedule it
so it comes on at a certain time of
night where you're trying to relax and
you're trying to see these warm tones so
that your brain doesn't think you're
looking at sunlight and it refuses to
shut up now there's this goes a lot
deeper into the investigation into human
circadian rhythms and all this other
stuff but essentially a warmer tone
should help you relax should help you
fall asleep at night this is especially
important on a samsung Display because
it's got this kind of cool tone to it
and I'm going to max up the brightness
as well but I've also got this video
enhancer enabled as well which is
supposed to enhance the image quality of
various apps that playback video I mean
I did a little bit of research here and
it's hard to know exactly what it's
doing essentially you're seeing a bump
in the appearance of contrast and a
slight bump in saturation as well
it exists in YouTube it'll also function
in Netflix Google Play movies things
like that now what you'll notice I'm
just going to put this side-by-side with
the exact same window on my pixel XL
which I will also have a full brightness
it's a very well lit environment so it
might be hard to tell but you can see
over here this is a more warm tone it's
got a kind of yellowish maybe even
greenish to it whereas the Samsung
display on the SA and this can be said
for previous AMOLED displays as well
they kind of trend more into the cool
tones which that is my personal
preference I actually prefer this kind
of look so like screen to screen this
year is no contest to me send them with
them both on a couch max brightness this
thing was like blowing me away but
without this whole setup and all this
lighting this si extends this lead in
terms of brightness beyond what the
pixel can deliver now keep in mind some
of these features I just mentioned are
software based so you could go to an s7
for example I've got one over here with
the latest software on it you can adjust
the opacity as well as when to
turn it on some of this stuff I'm going
to talk about as pros in the essay you
also exist in s7 let's just if you have
an s7 you're going to want to know this
now the next thing the curvature here
okay what this curvature enables is
these kind of unusual experience when
you're scrolling back and forth like
this it's really easy to hit to
understand where to begin
that motion versus a device which has a
sharper bezel where it's a little bit
harder to know exactly where to start
pulling in front part of that I think
it's just a consequence of not knowing
looking down where the bezel ends where
the cutoff is of the actual touch of
properties this device almost encourages
you subconsciously to reach for that
very edge I don't know how much this is
going to apply to every single user but
I get a weird kind of sense of
satisfaction gripping from over there
that brings me to something else this
little side panel I told you guys in the
last week I'm not a huge fan of this
side panel one feature that I don't mind
using the side panel toggle device
maintenance and the reason I don't mind
it for this purpose is because this
stuff is generally buried a little
deeper in the menu system versus like
apps edge having your apps over there in
which case it's like why like they're
already right there
same goes for contacts I'm not calling
that many people I'm much more likely to
go into messages for example and have
everybody there after one click anyway
having this here you can you can
actually do some things quicker so this
one here is probably the simplest point
and probably the one that you are most
aware of the screen is the best there is
the best there was and the best there
ever will be probably not no screens
will always get better but anyway today
is it's an epic adventure we're going to
talk about general hardware the positive
stuff to do with the hardware you're
going to have this infinity display it's
going to change the format of the device
how it feels in the hand especially when
you compare it to the old edge version
ok the s7 edge which was kind of sharp
not very fulfilling you've got a
narrower body so even though there's a
six point two inch screen packed in here
it's easy to hold here's one that's been
important to me for a long time and I
didn't mention in the last video so
hence the comprehensive version wireless
charging you see a nice little B brand
skin there as well as a little bonus
for you but underneath that be brand
skin is wireless charging and one of the
few people that seems to care about this
but they're the last of a dying breed so
I want to send boatloads of
encouragement to Samsung to keep doing
this okay you put one on your desk to
put one on your nightstand you pull it
in your car and you're never thinking
about jamming cables in ever again
there's a lot of rumors out there that
the next version of iPhone the iPhone 8
or whatever they call it might have that
feature as well so all of a sudden all
the accessories start coming up and then
everybody wants but let's say for some
crazy reason you don't want to use
wireless charging guess what you've got
the next best thing on here as well
which is USB type-c nothing proprietary
nothing weird
it's an incredible connector lots of
capabilities quick charging as well you
can see it right there and most
importantly Universal alright this is
the connector of the future everyone
should have it everyone deserves it down
by that connector is a headphone jack a
headphone jack is a positive thing all
right I've got it what do I have an
iPhone 7 over here yeah fine you can use
wireless headphones but we're not there
yet
all right now listen I didn't lose sleep
over the lack of a headphone jack on the
iPhone I'm you know I can figure it out
plus they gave you the adapter but you
can't tell me it's a negative thing
having it there put a headphone jack on
there maybe you get a nice pair of
headphones that brings me to another
thing now I don't have this in front of
me because this is not a retail s8 these
are going to ship with a set of AKG
earbuds these guys legends in the game
you're kidding me in the box they might
be now I'm tried done but it might be
the highest ends pair of earbuds
included in a smart phone box well let's
go over some of the other things that
Samsung is famous for on their carrying
forward in this device here expandable
storage don't have that on iphone how
you can argue expanding your storage
later is not a good thing
also boatloads of RAM to bring in the a
spec hardware for you if you're an ace
spec kind of guy it's in here also water
and dust resistance this one is becoming
a little more difficult as a
differentiator for brands to use in the
marketing lingo local got some water
here we're going to mix it up
you're sitting there looking for
something comprehensive so we might as
well dunk it all right so here we go I'm
going to turn the screen on and we are
going to dunk it and it activated
something but it should be okay here we
go
anyway you get the point no need for so
much of drama here but water ain't going
to hurt it
dust ain't gonna hurt it and listen if
you're talking about a flagship you
better be talking about durability at
this point you better be talking about
it all right next up Bluetooth now it's
weird to identify Bluetooth as like a
point in the positive category because
you're like what do you mean Lou like
everything everything has bluetooth but
this one has new bluetooth getting real
excited about new bluetooth here's the
thing I just want to give you a quick
breakdown on why you might care about
new bluetooth it's Bluetooth 5 oh it's
the first device that has it all right
it ain't in your iPhone the way
bluetooth 5.0 works it can go up to 240
meters now now again obstructions and so
on will obviously diminish that number
but maybe the promise of like whole-home
bluetooth is an actual thing now you
know we've got a speaker over here
sometimes jack he goes even goes
downstairs and the concrete floor it
cuts them off maybe a 5.0 not so much
you've also got more broadcast capacity
in fact it's about 8 times the previous
version bluetooth bluetooth 4.0 4.2 4.1
ever and what that means is there's the
potential here to send higher fidelity
audio over bluetooth so maybe we don't
need as much compression maybe we just
get better recordings it doesn't have to
be one headset either you may remember a
video I published recently where's
myself and Tom sitting right over here
allowed you to pair multiple headphones
to one single audio source by talking to
one another 5.0 supports that natively
two different Bluetooth headsets two
different Bluetooth speakers one
Bluetooth headset one Bluetooth speaker
whatever scenario you want to present
you can now support that with 500 so
that's that's that is a positive thing I
apologize for not making a point of it
in the previous video and saving it for
the comprehensive version but you needed
something to do while you were eating
that bowl of cereal anyway so that's why
we're back next up this one climbing
near and dear to my heart we can talk
about software a couple different videos
I've been talking a lot about the Google
so alright because the Excel has been by
my side hasn't done me wrong in the past
there was a wide gap between Samsung's
interpretation of what Android should
look and feel like and what was
happening on the stock side through
Google developers for like kind of the
flagship software so to speak some very
pleasant things have happened here
because they have trimmed down TouchWiz
in a big way I didn't think it I don't
even think they use that term anymore
they probably they treat it like the
place TouchWiz bit of a nightmare for a
while coming from a guy who's like I
said in the past I've tried out all
these different Samsung devices and what
they've done here is gone with a far
more streamlined vision and when
compared to stock Android you've got
something that is incredibly similar I
could choose to put apps on the display
elsewhere by the way on this Samsung
device that's not the way it looks right
now but anyway things in general are a
lot cleaner in my opinion and some of
the tweaks and enhancements in the
software are actually useful software
has gotten a lot closer to the stock
version and it should make for me the
transition over to the essay as the
daily device a lot easier than previous
version okay what about the camera loo
everyone loves to talk about cameras
cameras are so important on smartphones
now they're the main camera for many
people no one has cameras anymore so
everyone wants to know like I said
before the camera has not changed that
much with the exception of the
front-facing one the software has
changed substantially and believe it or
not it applies to the old version to the
s7 with the exception of the Bigsby
button and those snapchat like filters
if I scroll over here
selphie wide selfie which is a cool
feature I'll show you in a second
virtual shot selective focus oh and I
just noticed something the old one has
live broadcast still on it I remember
that feature when it launched the new
one doesn't have that anymore the back
camera which isn't seeing too much right
now you'll see the same thing applies
auto mode promo panorama hyperlapse
slow-mo a video collage they got rid of
as well maybe the retail version will
have it so long as you've got the most
updated software it looks like it
applies across the board the specs for
the re
camera is still a 12 megapixel camera
iphone on Galaxy s8 honestly you're not
going to see too much of a difference
here on the rear camera that's not
really a big deal though because this
thing the s7 s7 edge it has a great
camera to begin with now on the
front-facing camera side it has gotten a
bit better it's now an 8 megapixel
camera wide-angle selfie I'll show you
how this works okay so I snap and then I
kind of tilt it and then I go to the
other side like this
and then I end up with something way
wider than what I shot this is useful if
you have multiple people in the frame
here we go virtual shot and in this one
you move all the way around I'll hit
this and then I'll kind of do a little
bit of this action a little bit more a
little bit more as I twist the action
takes place also something I noticed the
autofocus on the front-facing lens super
snappy I come right in it grips me it
grips me right away tugs on my
heartstrings look at it
I don't know these these make me feel a
little bit strange I don't know what
you're going to do with that Internet
I really don't look at old man loo what
are you you like that one jack hey you
like that guy right there another thing
about the front-facing camera you can
actually record video beyond 1080p now
so if you're looking for like super high
res this stuff vlogging and so on q HD
2560 by 1440 and I am now recording
front-facing camera galaxy si
also you can probably hear the audio
from this right now and you should see
fairly decent resolution as well you can
tell I'm a professional vlogger right
now just got to go find my boosted board
right so cool now the rear camera goes
up to 4k so it goes a step further and
we'll do a similar test here we are it's
the front-facing camera it's obviously
very dark back here not so dark up here
I don't know on this screen it looks
pretty amazing to me awesome camera look
at this it's a lovefest samsung you're
going to be on the phone soon be like
Lou we love the video man here's the
thing I said at the beginning it's going
to be the good the bad and ugly because
that's what you need it's what you
signed up for and you're all move
done that bowl of cereal right now so
it's time to move on the stuff Nick not
everybody's going to tell you all right
the screen wait Lou excuse me you said
all these amazing things about the
screen true is my favorite screen ever
it's the best screen does that mean I
can't say that I don't like some aspects
of it
No so this screen right here it's got
this this unusual aspect ratio okay now
these are the stuff right now I'm about
to talk about it that just sets the sets
the Samsung fans off into the
stratosphere steam coming out of their
ears but with this aspect ratio there
are some drawbacks it's not all good
it's not all roses and you get these
black bars okay bottom line so you're
left with this this punch in button crop
to fit
there you go crop to fit but then then
all of a sudden the head I'm getting cut
off a little bit that tries me crazy
even more crazy than the crop so I just
end up watching it this way not losing
sleep over it I'm not dreaming about I'm
not seeing infinity edges love looking
at this thing but it's a bit weird the
fact that it's so tall yeah I mean I
don't have I don't have small hands
they're not you jeez I mean they're
average I kind of want to hold it there
but you can imagine with one hand
getting up there it's a bit of a thing
now if I grab an s7 look at this Oh
iPhone 7 plus who is getting up there so
everyone that's saying feels so good in
the hand it's like it's true it does but
there are again some things to think
about when it comes to this now granted
most six-point-two device is a
two-handed device all right so get with
it get with the times pull down from the
top menu with your other hand this
infinity edge as immersive as it is can
create some weird reflections the
reflection on the top edge there and
that you can probably see this best on
the overhead it creeps into the actual
frame especially against the dark scene
now if this was flat that wouldn't be
the case because it would have to dip a
lot further to pick up the reflection
and this is the reason why the regular
s7 was the one in my pocket and not the
edge something to think about
oh yes the fingerprint sensor location
everybody's talking about it so my it's
impossible to ignore it it's impossible
to avoid not doing retina scan
glass is on it's the whole thing it's a
whole issue I'm not doing a facial scan
people already hacked it pixel okay nice
round perfect location not going to be
confused with anything else their camera
layout is obviously much different are
you telling me the phone would be worse
if the camera layout was here in the
fingerprint sensor was there or maybe
the fingerprint sensor was around as
opposed to rectangular easily confusable
or maybe the fingerprint sensor was was
down a little bit for I don't know not a
major drawback will not in my opinion
change the amount by which you love this
device if you if you want this device
you completely understand this trade-off
and that there are better
implementations out there it's just part
of it it's something to accept I mean
you can look at various Samsung devices
from the past and you'll see that camera
almost always lives in the exact same
location there must be some design
advantage giving the type of sensor they
want to use who knows if it were
somewhere else or slightly different it
might be enhanced it's something to put
out there kind of get used to landing
your finger right there it's tougher for
lefties you touch this lens you're
smudging it up so much so that when you
launch the software it actually
recommends you clean your lens
left-handed users that's a lot less
comfortable obviously you wanted a
comprehensive video you're getting it
the speaker yeah right let's play it
let's go let's do it again one made of
charge time can provide two minutes a
cell phone talk time which in an
emergency could be the difference that's
the maximum volume on here it's easy to
cover it up listen it's Audrey gone from
evaporation right this ain't science
class here but you already knew that
iPhone which as you know right
speakers also in a bottle possible to
cover them up let's do a quick
comparison we might as well since we're
here I'll play the same video in fact
here and we can do an a/b same distance
from the microphone air ethylene glycol
and diethylene glycol stove / charge
portion a cell phone talktime which in
an emergency would be the difference I
don't know how well it's going to come
through zombie apocalypse this is a much
more full sound you can't block it
coming out of the earpiece up here as
well this one
a tough one because speakers on phones
in general are not really great there's
been so few phones that have like really
amazing speakers on them but this one is
below the caliber of some stuff that
I've got sitting beside me here if there
is a consolation prize here on this
negative that the speaker isn't great is
the fact that you've got your headphone
jack which you don't have on iphone 7
and there including really nice AKG
headphones you wanted a doughnut you got
a cook
let's talk battery this is something
that I covered in a previous video it's
being talked about a lot the fact that
it doesn't ship operating in its maximum
performance mode and again this is a
decision that Samsung made in order to
enhance battery performance for the
average person me I'm a bit weird I like
maximum brightness all the time I don't
use any kind of automatic brightness
settings I just have it completely
jammed out when you get to that last bit
of brightness it's in orange kinda seems
like a warning and then if you turn on
performance mode it basically tells you
hey you're going to take a battery life
hit here if you increase the screen
resolution to the maximum and increase
the brightness all the way so it's
almost like it doesn't really recommend
it if I go a step deeper and click on
the battery settings you can kind of
modify it even more and this is kind of
a weird one because I'm stuck here in
the negative aspect so I actually like
this here which is you can turn on
various power savings mode even even
look I mean I can't go with the max mode
here which is not only going to decrease
brightness change the screen read the
CPU change in a way that apps are using
the network in the background and it can
I mean they're saying it's going to give
me 19 hours and 25 minutes options are
good in this environment so you could
take this for a plus/minus depending on
which side of it you sit on but one
thing that you can't deny though is that
the battery on this guy isn't physically
bigger it doesn't have more capacity
than the previous version so the edge
has 3600 milliamp hours this one has 30
500 milliamp hours and what happened
here is you've increased the screen
resolution at least the potential screen
resolution you've increased brightness
this this one gets brighter than this
one it's pretty easy to tell here you
got a way bigger display
you've got more modern specs
theoretically a faster phone should be
more power-hungry assuming you want to
use it at max performance right problem
there is you didn't get a bigger battery
to go with it this is tough because I
mean it's really not a phone that exists
it has as much battery life as I would
like right now so it's more wishful
thinking here that maybe they went a
slightly different direction but it's
got 3,500 milliamp hours it could have
been better
would you have mind it if it was a
little bit thicker I don't think I would
have listened you walk through
supermarket you're in the produce
section
you got the Red Delicious that's the
least delicious Apple everyone knows
that looks brilliant though
they got it all waxed up shined up it's
kind of weird for me texture it's not
too sweet it but it looks great so you
pick it up and you're like I need to buy
that I'm going to you buy with your eyes
you know what I think if you see this
thing in a store like damn look at it I
got to have it it was a little bit
chunkier you might not say that so
they're trying to sell you on that first
impression but day-to-day life long-term
you're looking for all reliable you're
looking for that battery life so this is
something to consider
you guys are power users would you take
4,000 milliamps and a slightly fatter
phone you know you what you know you
would software I talked about it earlier
I talked about it in the positive camp
on the negative side it's not completely
stock Android nothing it ever will be
and this is a small one because this
really applies to me pixel users
old-school Nexus users but not being
full stock Android means you can't be
like a hundred percent guarantee that
you're going to see new features first
now you're going to see the latest OS
getting rolled out now granted the old
models right s7 s7 edge they've gotten
updates pretty quickly I'm pretty happy
about that going forward you're not
necessarily sure how your stuff is going
to be treated are you are you going to
get the latest right away can you be
guaranteed for example s7 edge Batman
Edition and also the Olympic edition no
update rollout yet I was sitting there
trying to manually I felt like where is
it where's my nougat at but because of
the skins and various things going on
you didn't roll out so you can't really
guarantee it's still not stock it's a
lot better than it was but it's still
not 100% there at some point someone
Sandra may have some advantage over this
software right now it's a mix up price
is always it's a thing it governs
everything the price of something it's
different for everyone
alright somebody wants to walk out and
walk into a store and spend $6,000 on a
fancy purse it's not me but somebody
wants to do it into them that's valuable
but if we're comparing apples to apples
no pun intended smart phones - smart
phones then it's true there's some stuff
out there that delivers on a lot of what
this delivers for a fraction of cost and
the issue that Samsung has the Apple
doesn't so much is that those that are
scratching it their yields are running
the same OS for the most part Android at
300 Android at 400 and right at 500 700
you name it $1000 in the iPhone world
it's Apple all the way they don't care
what you buy buy this version by the old
one keep paying us because there is no
other iPhone version from some third
party manufacturer that's a tough one
you always pay more for the premium
right you want the best of the best you
pay more then you're probably getting
back as far as the return on your
investment from a performance
perspective it's more of an intangible
sentimental thing like I've got the best
maybe you feel good about that maybe
that gives you some level of confidence
you wouldn't have had otherwise that
said I'm putting it in the negative
category for price because of what else
is out there and a cheaper price and how
good that stuff has gotten so you heard
about the good you heard about the
not-so-good otherwise known as the bad
but we haven't heard about yet is the
ugly and I think a lot of you guys see
what you guys can probably guess what
I'm going to identify here a little
something called spic speed the name
itself was not that ugly I don't know it
sounds kind of friendly actually it's
kind of a weird name hey Jack can you
take Bixby for a walk please please ah a
bowl of water some sixty ah that ain't
what Big B is is not a cute little dog
in fact it's very ugly it's a weird
thing that Samsung's doing and I don't
know am i piling on is everybody being
critical of this probably definitely
it's like when Google now got launched
which is now called Google
I mean they're trying to out Google
Google are you crazy you want to out
Google Google I want you ask Yahoo how
that went
also this that go ask them nobody else
Google's Google anyhow yes there are
some features that don't exist in Google
assistant like the camera you take it
you take a picture of we have a clip
from the last video you take you take a
picture of an object it shows you other
objects that are like that kind of weird
like I don't know how is that useful to
me I don't know I see an old car in the
street and like what model is that maybe
that's that's a maybe that's a big-time
Navy you're kind of entrusting Samsung
to figure out how to build this really
sophisticated piece of software this
intelligent assistant kind of software
which is not really their cup of tea
it's ugly for a couple of reasons not
just because it's software that I don't
want to use but because it's software
that lives kind of lived there
permanently like I haven't found a way
yet to really get rid of it you can do
more with it if you want but when it
comes to less it's not really it's not
really obvious did I miss something is
there away where you at big speak and
I'm searching for bixie we're going to
see here if there nothing nothing in the
settings felt big good now maybe
eventually through a software update
this could change but for now it lives
over there where you would probably want
Google assistant you can still launch
Google assistant by holding down here
boom look how comfy you feel you start
seeing those Google colors and the
little little logos and you're like
please take all my information I can't
give you enough they couldn't possibly
harm me they're not gonna sell my
information to the Russians to give me
Gmail and YouTube but here's why it's
really ugly because it's got a dedicated
button a dedicated button for something
I don't even want oh yeah you kidding me
it's right over here and even worse you
can't really feel the difference between
the two this is something that came to
me earlier I'm like why am i pixels so
comfy for me
check this out jack right there there's
texture on the buttons it's something
that I've seen in various smartphones
this one included pixel XL but also
Motorola phones
you put a slightly different texture on
the different buttons and man the
confidence I'm like come on
this seems nitpicky but got to remember
this is a button I don't even want I
need to be able to feel the texture so I
could stay away from it so there you
have it the good the bad and the ugly
when it comes to the Samsung Galaxy s8
s8 plus I hope you found this useful
it's this comprehensive breakdown if
this is something that you want to see
in the future for high-profile products
you know let me know leave a thumb we
can sit down you can eat your cereal you
enter pizza whatever it is that you like
and we can we can go over every little
nuance every little detail also
important for me to say before I take
off because I think some people really
thrive on absolute clarity the s8 and s8
plus are probably the nicest smartphones
on the planet right now as they should
be they are the latest there are
features that exist here that exists
nowhere else bluetooth 5.0 for example
this infinity display this really
interesting aspect ratio which lets you
hold a 6.2 inch device in one hand more
pixels then probably should ever be in a
smartphone they exist right here whether
or not it's worth it to you probably
depends on the phone if you're using
right now if you've got an s7 s7 edge
and you're happy with it it's a tough
sale because these things do a lot of
what this new one does that decision
almost exclusively breaks down to the
display at this point now if you're
coming from an iPhone and thinking about
switching camp all together well that
that's a much more ambitious move I
don't want to steer you away from it
though iPhones as we know are set to
refresh very shortly will it be an
iPhone 8 will there be a home button I
mean who really knows buying an
expensive phone it's a commitment for
people I don't know what kind of upgrade
cycle you're on but I can recommend this
device you you will be happy with this
device the galaxy s 8 probably the best
Android phone right now let's see what
the next pixel can do though alright
goodbye what I mean have a nice life
so I shoot them because it was the good
Devaney ugly do I squint at them I need
a piece of straw like I'm Clint Eastwood
here tumbleweed
we need more props in here or something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
