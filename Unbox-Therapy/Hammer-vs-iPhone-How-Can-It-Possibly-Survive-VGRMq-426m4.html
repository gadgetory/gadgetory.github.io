special type of shield this company in
one case they sent this out to me and
they said Lou this screen protector can
take a hammer and I was like well listen
I don't really want to be there like do
it
how did that happen am i accusing them
of something that they said you could
use a hammer they sent me the clips I
was like I don't know if I buy it but
apparently it's got some kind of impact
protection technology supramolecular
look at those words I mean they sound
exciting there's like a normal screen
protector and here is their specialty
impact 1 I don't know science now I'm
sure each one of you knows a human being
who's walking around with a smashed
phone you know they're answering phone
calls shards of glass blood dripping
down their face don't be that guy get
yourself some supramolecular protection
look at this look what they sent me they
sent me like the kitchen sink over here
they make them for not the kitchen sink
it's everything but the kitchen sink so
they sent the kitchen sink as well
pattern 6s 6s plus se galaxy s7 their
paperwork screen protector basic simple
wipes nano shield it's slightly thicker
there's what it is this one is for the
6s 6 or success wipe or down first
right-click hunt that pesky dirt on your
phone screen it's about time you tackled
it dirty phone screen got you down

there focus patience Karate Kid do the
best oh man

apparently I can whack this thing with a
hammer all of a sudden I don't I don't I
got one
but first I'll start kind of soft at
first what up ah it doesn't feel right
no matter how many times you do it
there's no marks even from the hammer
and you seeing what's happening - why is
this tech not like in the screen to
begin with digitizer still working when
I'm using it Mike

excuse to have a smash screen now I
