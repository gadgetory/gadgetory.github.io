guys may not have heard of depending on
which market you're in this is the a 70
from Samsung is interesting for a couple
of different reasons
now the reason I'm looking at it right
now is because it recently became
available in Canada along with other a
series devices I have never seen in a
series device prior to this this one the
7b is interesting to me in particular
because it has some features that
actually go beyond are actually a little
bit better than the flagship Galaxy S 10
plus at a much lower price point this
thing is around 500 bucks though some
people have found it for less you're
getting a 600 series Snapdragon
processor 6 gigs of ram expandable
storage it's got a triple camera set up
on the rear it has a tiny little
teardrop style notch a 4500 milliamp
hour battery and 25 watt charging fast
charging which is actually better than
the s10 s10 plus it's the same charging
speed as the 5 G version of the device
which is of course way more expensive so
let's crack into the box and take a look
at what we're working with that's the
device it's got a kind of cool huge
thing happening on the back ooh look at
that it's got this cool gradient
situation it's that color shift you see
this on sports car sometimes it's green
it's blue it's purple it's everything
it's every color in the rainbow course
it's got the ultra wide on it which for
me is a must
apparently the construction is some sort
of metal plastic hybrid considering the
weight considering how slim it is it's
very surprising they fit a 4500 milliamp
hour battery in here alongside the
snapdragon 675 you got to believe it's
gonna be one of the best battery
performers out there and it's gonna
charge really fast with the 25 watt
charging you still have a headphone jack
as well down on the bottom USB type-c
dual SIM card expandable storage so you
could slap a 512 gigabyte SD card and I
know a lot of people like that it's
versatility in the phone so this
mid-range part of the market is
obviously heating up and Samsung they're
not gonna leave it alone right they're
not gonna just leave it up to Oppo and
VEVO and oneplus they're gonna have
their own play at that
to the marketplace you have to type C
cable and the 25 watt charge brick
alright so we got the device set up now
you can see the the beautiful display
now this might surprise you you may not
have noticed this display is actually
bigger than the s10 plus this is six
point seven inches
no no hole punch instead you're left
with the teardrop style notch
sort of it's a small notch I will
probably still prefer the hole punch
well like when you consider the package
deal the price the display size the fact
that you still have AMOLED here two
bigger battery and now you're like huh
this is confusing I don't know do I want
an s10 or maybe all I need is an a 70
I'll pocket a few extra dollars of
course it doesn't have the top-tier
Snapdragon so you need to take that into
consideration but how many people are
really maxing out their processor how
many people are doing multimedia stuff
like beyond the typical game this thing
can run whatever game you're gonna throw
it I mean you could play pop G on here
no problem so I get it some people just
want to have to talk to your performance
but there are some advantages to the
lower tier chip as well you may see some
improvements in battery life and so
forth so it's worth thinking about so
it's got the in display fingerprint
scanner which I assume is using
identical technology to the s10 s10 plus
you can see how it operates there these
things they're imperfect right in
display fingerprint scanners in general
it's cool technology but it's not as
fast this is sufficient this is fine
I've been using fingerprint unlock but
you can tell it's a second of lag there
it's just it just takes a second longer
it's worth noting let's go ahead and
check out the speakers I'm a bit curious
like where did they save the money on
this alright we'll load up a little
later video first Toronto Raptors world
champion this grind is long in the
playoffs you know I feel like I've been
in AI feel like I've been in the
playoffs for a while now watching this
that's a lot of this place six point
seven inches I mean these things they
keep on growing people are obviously
gravitating towards bigger screens and
as the bezels shrink down in scale you
can get these big displays without much
trade-off the sound I don't know a
pretty average in 50 states and Puerto
Rico from 2000
it's pretty it's pretty clear that's
maxed out well you think my oneplus is
brighter this is a comparison 1 + 7 pro
vs. the a 70 price-wise
I guess we're kinda close in the case of
the Samsung a seventy four seventy nine
somewhere in that territory converted to
USD 1 + device more expensive 669 this
one has the curved glass pop-up camera
and 800 series snapdragon so obviously
it's a kind of a tough comparison but
maybe you want Samsung maybe you want
one UI maybe you want the big battery in
here who knows it's up to you but you
can see screen wise is kind of
comparable we should do a speaker
comparison to replies and just be like
ugly hate it not buying it stuff like
this well that makes sense when you're
doing a really secretive product okay so
mono sound just coming out of the bottom
part of the device it's okay it's not as
good as the oneplus device in my opinion
screen wise though I put them in the
same territory this one of course has
the notch on it so you got to remember
that if you find that to be offensive no
pop up camera here we did have a pop up
camera device in here that wasn't that
expensive the red-meat k20 Pro that
thing kind of blew my mind the spec list
for money the value for money I think I
maybe I call it the value champ alright
what about those cameras are they as
advanced as s10 who knows you kind of
have a hard time believing that they
would be boom alright ultra-wide that's
quite wide and zoom so one of these
cameras must be just for depth because
we've only got the two options here
there's no zoom here Samsung does a good
job with the cameras but look at my hand
makes it into the white is quite wide
and then the the zoom you can see more
typical focal range 32 megapixel selfie
camera okay so let's do the beard hair
test was what we do uh a wide and I
guess a standard it boots into standard
by default I'm gonna use the wide all it
was tried they were trying to beauty me
Jack you know that's a no-go you can't
do it
it's a no-go try to beauty me okay beard
hair particles on the shirt remember the
particle is shirt particle test little
fibers ODIs hairs you know not the best
I've seen it's good it's good I wish you
had a little more contrast in it you
know what can I say about this phone I
think it's a cool package to be honest I
wish it was available to more people in
different markets here in the u.s.
probably not seeing this device now that
everybody's buying their phones outright
I know this sounds strange to other
parts of the world for a long time it
was on subsidy you would get a tab
people want to own their devices go to
whichever carrier bring your own device
that's what people are doing more
frequently now so what does that mean is
that cost shopping value for money
comparisons are happening more
frequently in North America and now
there's a place for devices like this I
consider this to be a value device what
are you giving up is it that much I
guess the construction it feels a bit
cheaper with this hybrid materials you
could say to yourself hey those cameras
are not quite as good not quite as
versatile you could say to yourself hey
I want you to talk to your snapdragon
also valid so I think it's a compelling
package I think it's an interesting
choice I think it's a galaxy device
worth knowing about in relationship to
the flagship the rest of the world
they've been spoiled so many Series A
Series India's got the M series from
Samsung it's more Samsung love it's more
Samsung choices it's the a seventy part
of the a series definitely worth looking
at for Samsung fans and pretty much
everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
