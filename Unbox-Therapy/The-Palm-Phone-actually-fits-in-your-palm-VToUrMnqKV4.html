height I reached out I was like I gotta
check this thing out for myself because
it's not what companies are releasing
and it's from a brand that you haven't
heard from in a while every other
smartphone maker is scaling up and here
you have palm one of the original
players in the smartphone game saying
something completely different in the
form of this tiny little device they're
implying that you should have this as a
companion to your actual smartphone
pre-installed 4G SIM so this is how this
thing is gonna work on Verizon
specifically you're able to map your
current sim to this device as well so
you could hypothetically leave the house
and say today is a low-tech a low-impact
day I'm gonna take the palm device
instead of my main device the whole
proposition here is that there are
circumstances situations in your life
where you shouldn't be so distracted I
guess by your phone or maybe you just
want to carry a big phone the whole
thing seems a bit crazy but that's
precisely why I'm making a video and
checking it out that is tiny oh my
goodness gracious
look at that Jack you see that that's a
palm phone palm made a palm phone I
can't be the first one to have said this
everyone must be this is so light it's
like a tiny little iPhone look at it
what I kind of like it it's cute oh my
why do I like it I don't know should I
like it I'm not sure
peel off very low key palm logo in the
center gold around the camera and gold
around the ridge it's not gonna win any
awards for screen to body ratio I don't
know if you guys can see even without
the screen turned on you can see it's
got a pretty big forehead and chin you
got to remember I've been around since
priests Mart phone day since regular
cell phone days and back then the
smaller your phone was the cooler you
were from the giant Zack Morris Saved by
the Bell
Fresh Prince I think Will Smith had one
of those big the big boys but then of
course phones became computers and
everything got all messy you're still
gonna have another phone this is the I'm
taking a vacation phone or this is the
I'm gonna actually pay attention at my
kids soccer game phone
I see you parents out there I get it
together type C charge cable tiny little
power brick not in comparison to the
device we'll explain this to me so the
phone is gonna cost you 350 and then
you're gonna attach it to your
pre-existing plan which will share your
phone number your data and so on non
removable SIM that's really interesting
so it's a single button and the number
of times that you tap it will dictate
the action that takes place it is
Android but it is a unique kind of
miniaturized skin that's going on here
Steph Curry is endorsing the phone okay
so it has to be good three-point shots
look what happened to the team recently
since he's been injured you've been
following Jack the Raptors beat the
Warriors without Steph Cruz Duran almost
see almost change that fact Oh would he
have 50 points or whatever okay I was
there it wasn't there but I watched it
but with this guy it would have been a
different story if you want to know
about phones that's your that's your guy
right there Steph Curry okay life mode
turns airplane mode on every time the
screen is turned off unless you're on a
call streaming music or using GPS when
the screen is back on then the device
becomes connected with life mode you're
in control of what gets your attention
so you will never miss out on life's
most important moments I'm looking at
used soccer parents spreadsheets email
email yeah
oh go yeah yeah no I'm just at the game
no I don't know no they're just kids but
yeah go on
boy yeah all right so that's what it
looks like booted up and you can see it
is a custom UI custom interface here and
it's kind of been tuned for this tiny
little display so you have your apps in
the center here from the top you get
your quick settings including this
little palm tree here life mode you can
set certain apps to bypass life mode on
box so you can tight I mean it works
when you're trying to type with thumbs I
mean ain't gonna happen I don't think
you're gonna be texting a whole ton on
this and I don't think that's really the
point oh man that is so small whole
volume is strictly digital oh I'd say
it's louder than I expected it to be I
should try out the camera okay we
haven't seen our favorite special guest
in a while we keep getting stuck with
Willie do her name was Betty from way
back in old school unbox therapy days
she used to try headphones on for us
actually and I think she's looking okay
not so bad
it has Auto HDR as well so it's doing
some smart stuff it's not terrible okay
you can still snap photos on it well get
over here come here for a second will ah
what do I think I think it's cool
I wouldn't use it though because I
already have a small phone well not
compared to this no no do a little
typing on there Oh God yeah okay
there's voice tho unbox therapy box
therapy UFC 231 you know what I would
use voice all the time on a phone like
this right so you hate this I I didn't
say that I said that I wouldn't use it
but I can see a use case how much did
Apple pay you to say that as a tech fan
you're kinda like okay cool no not exact
I would think what's the use yelling
what was yelling look if this is what
they're saying okay live in the moment
palm celebrates the freedom and choice
to be both connected and present they're
telling you you're not present well
library life live your life will would
you use this I mean
like I would do a challenge for example
I'd be like let me try and use that for
a week or something like that the
customer just the average person out
there it would be a hard pitch
what is this sell for three hundred and
fifty dollars I can't recommend that
maybe this is like a nicotine patch yeah
it's like a subpar solution it's like
temporarily we're gonna make the
experience a little less comfy mm-hmm
and slowly train you to look less often
towards your device yeah yeah
- like satisfy or fill every moment I
was at the doctor's office earlier today
I'm looking around everybody everybody
you know they can't see they're right
here and they're tapping away I'm there
I'm doing the same like it's I mentor
but then I'll catch myself I'll put it
away so it's at least addressing that
people are texting and driving they're
crashing into each other you know you
get a gift and you don't really need it
and you're like you know what it's the
thought that counts this product is the
thought that counts yeah yeah but it's
gonna be hard you're trying to sell
you're trying to sell a nicotine patch
to a bunch of smokers and it ain't no
cigarette
that's a cigarette that's what they want
buy or don't buy I wouldn't buy I don't
think it's a good idea to buy it I'm
gonna say don't buy it I'm gonna say get
better at disciplining yourself and your
actions and your behavior or get an
Apple watch same thing right see what do
you just did again this guy's
unbelievable
we're gonna start wondering in the
comments well who do you really work for
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
