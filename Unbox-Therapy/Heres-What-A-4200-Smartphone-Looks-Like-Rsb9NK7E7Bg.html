probably don't know about unless you're
dealing with a particular issue in your
life that you have boatloads literal
boats full of cash is that you if it is
then you may have heard of this this is
the world's most expensive Galaxy S nine
plus this thing in front of me is almost
five grand USD five thousand three zeros
USD what the company is called hador Oh
Paris supremo luxury status I have a
letter here
dear mr. Hilson Tegra proudly presenting
with our latest development the
custom-made Samsung S 9 plus for a long
time we've been creating bespoke iPhone
finally something for Android fans using
our own develop material carbon fiber
with the pattern of Damascus steel we
designed a collection which includes s9
s9 + in Damascus carbon fiber and
genuine alligator leather back panel
each phone we create undergoes several
production stages all done manually by
our team skilled engineers and craftsmen
I think that signature is actual real I
think it's pen Yosef he'll he'll take
the time you'll put the signature and
pen is it actually pen see that bleed
there that's a real pen you spend 5 G's
Yosef takes a second to thank you for it
I like the touch let's see what this
thing is all about let's see what close
the 5 grand gets you here so first it's
got this like glass looking finish
and somehow the unbox therapy logo looks
illuminated I don't know how is this a
powered box if so how long does it last
it's really incredible I'm gonna put
this to the side for a moment and look
at the accessories they've rearranged
the accessories in here you have your
USB cable of course the AKG headphones
nice little upgrade included a couple of
USB adapters and then fast charge power
break but of course the main attraction
lives in this very special package here
mm okay
our first glance at the alligator back
now apparently this alligator starts off
in the United States goes to Italy to
get died and then ends up in France I
mean that's pretty amazing an alligator
has a it's a hell of a travel schedule
mm that is crazy soft I do need to say
let's pull this phone out of here now I
noticed something right away I hope that
Kirk can pick this up look at this right
on the side in the frame unbox therapy
edition subtle engraved that is a nice
little touch I didn't know that would be
on there this is available died in a
number of colors black blue green but
they also make a Damascus carbon
exclusive one where the whole back plate
is going to be done in this really
unique looking carbon it's not just the
s9 s nine plus that they customized they
started out with iPhones they still do
iPhones and they do really luxurious
cases for iPhone as well and I think
they even do air pods at first glance
like when you have the black one here it
just looks kind it looks kind of like a
regular s9 but then you get up to it
you're like that
there's something going on there that's
a bit different and it's not a case this
is the entire back plate replaced so the
sleekness the thinness of the device is
maintained here that's what you're
paying the big bucks for okay you got
the yacht you got the sports car you got
the Financial Planner golf clubs ultra
boost Cuban cigars
the Italian wine or French caviar yes
cargo the stock portfolio tickets to the
Grand Prix in Monte Carlo dinner with
prince albert ii you're on the yacht
you're in the South of France you're on
the beach in a tuxedo
you think you've tasted sushi I
you think you know sushi you don't know
on the phone side like it's still just
an s9 plus the real attention to detail
here it's pretty much all on the
backside here that's where you're paying
your dollars for the extra fine touch
that you're getting from Maduro Paris
it's not gonna be for everyone but if
it's for you you get to belong to an
exclusive club I see multiple purposes
for unbox therapy content like hey this
is what you need in your life how does
this compare to this and then there's
the the fringes there's the crazy stuff
that exists somewhere on planet Earth
that you need to know about this is one
of those products that's the most
expensive galaxy s 9 Plus that I've ever
seen or ever heard of the conversion
rate on it puts it around four thousand
two hundred dollars u.s. but I guess if
you need to flex on another level if you
need to flex on a yacht level if you
need to flex on a South of France level
on the beach in the tuxedo escargot
cashmere alligator then this is where
you're at and you already knew it all
right thank you very much unbox therapy
that's another episode where'd you find
out about it now you know it exists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
