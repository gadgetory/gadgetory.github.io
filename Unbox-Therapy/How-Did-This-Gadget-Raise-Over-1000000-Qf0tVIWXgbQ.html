right here this thing got funded it
raised a bunch of money a million
dollars I think that deserves our
attention this is something called solar
paper which claims to be the world's
thinnest and lightest solar charger
they've got to here they're showing it
off like fold it up into a book that's
how thin it is Solar is good but the Sun
it's there every day as long as it's
there you're there this is their
unlimited power now I mean let's be
honest here solar charging is gonna take
a while bit slow generally speaking and
typically not portable so it's kind of
cool that they've made the thinnest and
lightest solar charger all the time
about Sun to electricity that's pretty
boy these two of the same things it
looks like doesn't it actual dish let's
go this guy's better
huh you can fully charge your iPhone 7
in about 2.5 hours this is real the suck
that bad 2.5 hours if you're this guy
you're this guy you're out in the woods
you're out in the wilderness you're half
dead you're starving you gotta call
somebody give me 2.5 hours it's better
than death than death cuz he can't he's
starving you used to call uber eats in
the woods and you know Hoover eats is
gonna get there it's gonna be some dude
he's sweating he's on a bike and the
food is jumbled around you know it is
whoo whoa plug into the Sun yes yes
there's magnets mmm and then ahh
kablammo how that's too easy that's good
these are thin I love magnets you
already know that BAM
and then BAM I'm traveling it's really
not much bigger than a smartphone itself
looking around you see a couple of USB
ports on the top there Apple devices
connect to port a non apple devices to
port na I wonder why I'm not really
certain but here is the LCD panel on the
front this will tell you how much power
is going to your device based on how
much Sun that you have we have some
shoelaces hmm like a cool color to the
fact that I see these holes on the side
here you tie this to something you want
to tie it to a backpack you're a real
trails 'men I mean you're gonna look
like you belong on the trail I'm now
reconsidering my entire shoelace game
based on that shoelace
they've also include a nice little nice
little pouch so I guess what happens
here do the old slide in and that's a
nice little package I guess we really
want to try it it sort of
direct sunlight alright let's head out
into the sunshine to find out what the
world's thinnest Solar Charger can do
for me and my smartphone just like that
that one cloud are you rolling that one
cloud just changed the readout by like
an entire Volt obviously your mileage
would this thing depends on your
environment just like I said earlier
when that cloud clears away this is
gonna go back up it's already starting
to climb 6 point something bolts then
you plug the smartphone in and it's able
to deliver a full sunshine here it's
able to charge this phone at like point
3 7 amps that said this is no
replacement for quick charge alright
it's gonna take a while still so even in
perfect sunlight you're looking at a
couple hours to charge your phone I mean
I understand now why this thing raised
so much money because it's modular it's
crazy portable and I could see having it
in your kit you gotta admit as a tech
enthusiast turning the Sun into
smartphone juice come on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
