me right here the gray you don't even
see anymore this is the gray that most
electronics used to have this is you got
a new like computer tower that's the
color that it was it shifted a little
bit over here this Super Nintendo in
fact is so fresh that it has the
original tone which is much darker right
now you're wondering what is it I'm
talking about today I have a special a
special presentation a product you
probably never expected to see because I
know I didn't it's a product inspired by
these two iconic devices the NES and the
Super Nintendo Nintendo Entertainment
System dragon to the revenge system
best action game ever from our Queen
Super Nintendo Entertainment System
how about that this is confusing I know
those look like game covers but those
boxes are huge
well that's because inside of each of
these boxes is a pair of sneakers
inspired by those original consoles
these are custom sneakers there's only
10 pairs of each and I have one of each
right here the NES version Super Mario
Bros duck hunt look at that look at this
Jordan NES Nintendo red gray black so
they got the sticker and look right here
one of 10 we have number one this one on
the other hand it just says sample
Nintendo purple lilac and graves the US
Super Nintendo NBA Jam edition holy
smokes if you're a sneaker head if
you're a gadget head if you're an
old-school gamer like yours truly this
has gotta mean something to you whoa
we have the original back of the game
from NBA Jam little side note here check
this one out
excuse me what is happening here we'll
talk more about that later and on the
bottom of the other one Super Mario Bros
duck hunt let me give you a little quick
fact on the gun here the original
version was grey the one that launched
in Japan and everybody was cool with it
as Japan would be when this came to
North America the mothers freaked out
they said my son's not having it and so
from that point forward the gun had to
be red or orange whatever that eventual
color was whatever that color is down
there all right we're going with the
original Freaker sneaks custom Oh
oh yes we have the Jordans here but
looking like something special the
little tag that looks like an original
cartridge with a flight on it Mario Bros
select and start on the laces you got
the a B buttons on the back how does he
make these does this start out as a
regular pair and then he goes bananas on
him so when you wear them like this you
get the mario bros the duck hunt
representing both oh you can press the
buttons
you can press this to the little d-pad
that is some serious attention to detail
there you got the Jordans from the era
the NES represented it's never a bad
time to see duck hunt and Mario and it's
all coming together so you can remember
what it was like pair number one there
it is the console we're talking pretty
close there right the gray tone matching
up the red around the sole inspired by
the Nintendo logo itself a little bit of
black are those official abs they sure
feel like it and the d-pad as well the
ultimate package of nostalgia this is it
all in one how about the NBA Jam
Super Nintendo sneakers that you never
knew existed a little more blueish
purple-ish look at that they took that
into consideration the purple elements
also some screen grabs it looks like in
which Cleveland beats Golden State well
that obviously didn't happen this past
the playoff probably never again to be
honest I mean you got urban Dave anyway
I'm not gonna complain and look at this
you have defeated all 27 NBA teams on
the tongue year and then when you flip
them around to the back a d-pad that's
clickable and this time we've upgraded
we now have the four button system
indicative of the Super Nintendo upgrade
was a big move four buttons now think of
the possibilities and one thing I always
liked about this controller for the XY
with the concave on it and then the BA
with the convex is that what is called
convex concave so you know without
looking what you're clicking right if
you look at the bottom of these you see
kind of the North Carolina blue going on
there so this is obviously some sort of
conversion project and man that's
impressive when I first saw these online
I was like man we need to immortalize
these things in proper unboxing terms as
we do here on unbox therapy so there you
have it check these guys out freak er
sneaks I'll link them down below which
one would you go for Super Nintendo or
Nintendo let me know down below
