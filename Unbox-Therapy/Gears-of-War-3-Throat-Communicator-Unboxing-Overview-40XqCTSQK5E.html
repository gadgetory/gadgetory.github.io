therapy and we're gonna keep these Gears
of War 3
theme going we got to get all the
products out of the way because this is
the hot title right now and today we're
looking at the throat communicator for
Gears of War 3 and what this claims to
do is to you know circumvent the need
for a traditional headset instead it's
gonna transmit audio via your throat so
you have no boom mic in front of your
mouth pretty crazy stuff I've never used
one of these so I'm a little bit
skeptical I'm gonna put it through its
paces and if you guys got any questions
throw my way because hopefully I can
ease some of your skepticism assuming it
works the way it should so we got a
little bit of paperwork with even
littler font on it please don't strain
yourself reading that and here's the
device it's a little bit adjustable but
let me tell you something I put on the
largest size and around my neck and I
don't have a huge neck and that was
pretty tight so it's probably designed
for pencil necks
no but seriously if you got a huge neck
this probably ain't gonna work you've
got in in-ear style headphone and it's
also got some other tips available if
you know that Prien style tip doesn't
work for you this is the portion here
that goes into your xbox 360 controller
of course why not put it into the Gears
of War 3 limited controller it just
makes sense that way and here's the
inline remote which gives you some
volume controls via this wheel here as
well as the mic on and off switch so you
can mute yourself if some unsavory
is going on around you and you don't
want to transmit that audio to the rest
of the world although I don't know what
its gonna pick up because it's around
your throat so I don't know like I don't
know there's a pickup audio from around
you that's the thing I don't really I
haven't tried something like this before
I have to let you guys know here's a
better look at the artwork on there as
well as that year piece that I mentioned
and you can see it's angled so it's
probably gonna get deep inside your ear
canal and isolate the outside sound
pretty nicely especially when you get
that custom fit and here is where the
audio was picked up I mean that's just
that's just weird so here's a closer
look at the different tip sizes that's
large and small as I mentioned I believe
medium is pre-installed and
included in the box is this little foam
piece this is if you are a super a super
pencil-neck I believe that you install
this on the backside of the unit to get
an even tighter fit so I don't know who
the hell asked for them small children I
guess
anyway guys if you enjoyed this content
and all these Gears of War coverage and
please remember to Like and favorite the
video as it does help me continue to do
what I'm doing and also about the
giveaway a lot of people are waiting on
the $500 pick your prize giveaway via
the channel and via Twitter and guess
what I'm gonna try and get around to
announcing that tonight you heard me
correctly so if you got nothing to do
tonight stick around the channel
hopefully that video will go live and we
can finally end this thing and send some
beautiful prize to some beautiful
subscriber anyway guys until next time
and as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
