I haven't looked at a smartphone from
Sony in a very long time I couldn't even
remember when will asked me and it's
kind of unfortunate because they've been
in a game for a long time not just a
smartphone game but the technology game
the gaming games PlayStation TV
everybody wanted once upon a time was
the Trinitron I had the mini disc player
the Walkman changed the game for me and
others it's like I love to see Sony's
still doing it and especially when
they've got a product like this one
which has been requested a lot by you
guys I'm excited for it because it's a
different take unlike the other
manufacturers that are just going you
know all-in on this idea of screen to
body ratio they're like let's go with a
different aspect ratio let's try to put
as many pixels as possible into a six
and a half inch screen that anyone's
ever done before let's just have a
different approach so that's why I'm
excited for this and oh I'm also excited
because they're doing a promo these are
my favorite headphones in the world
right now the WH 1000 xm3 they're doing
a deal where you get these for free when
you order this that's an important thing
to know about because this is not a
cheap smartphone this is gonna retail
for 950 USD so put it in that premium
priced here but if you want to lower the
sting of that MSRP those are three
hundred and fifty dollar noise
cancelling headphones and in my opinion
they're worth it I've used them for a
while and I love them so if you were in
the market for both of these things you
could imagine your price point on the
smartphone having a significant
subtraction from a value perspective
instead of having to spend 950 and
another 350 you could look at the
effective price at a phone going all the
way down to 600 bucks I'll link Amazon
down in the description if you want to
check it out but it should work at a
number of different retailers on the
pre-order currently okay some specs on
the back 12 + 12 + 12 megapixel triple
camera setup you gotta have it this day
and age 2019 specialty 1 900 bucks for a
smartphone 8 megapixel selfie camera 4k
HDR OLED display 6.5 inches that's got
to be the highest pixel density I've
ever looked at in a smart phone I would
say 30 330 milliamp hours course we've
seen devices 4,000 plus so I'm not too
excited about that now after I get a 55
IP 65 / 68 okay this
be the next smartphone and I switched to
this could be my next experiment might
very well which one did I get oh I got
the purple one
he said Toronto Raptors purple one you
see I Jack flip it over to the front
twenty one by nine cinema wide so this
brings us to the next hot topic may be
the hottest topic with this particular
smartphone you do not see 21 by 9
smartphones that said if you look at a
service like Netflix for example they
claim a significant portion of their
content is in that aspect ratio it for
the time being it's mostly cinema
content in which you'll be able to watch
the way it was originally intended now
why would you want to go with this
aspect ratio well what allows you to do
is have a 6.5 inch display but in a form
factor that you can hold super-easy as
you can see it's not a reach for me it's
just a confident grip it's a really
interesting aspect ratio could it be the
future quite possibly but for now it's
one of the rare devices available as far
as a smartphone is concerned we've seen
it in monitors and things like that in
the past they also claim there's some
Dolby Atmos going on in here I'll test
the sound that's what I do
USB type-c connector on the bottom
capable of fast charge that's a must you
have the speaker unit also in that
location right there over on this side
of the device gets a bit fancy actually
there's a few buttons here this is the
interesting one it is a side mounted
fingerprint scanner so nothing in
display it's gonna be your more typical
touch based scanner you would be used to
seeing this on the rear of the device on
on other smartphones a few of them have
tried it on the side Sony's doing the
same we'll see how that operates see how
that works in a moment volume rocker
above that power switch below they're
kind of weird that they're not both
integrated into one but I'm sure there's
a good reason for it and then another
switch down here on the bottom what is
that is that a dedicated camera switch
that would be a nice location for it I'm
not sure we're gonna have to wait a
moment to find out on that one as well
look at that you remove the SIM card / a
microSD expansion tray without a tool
what a bonus that is all right before I
boot up the device let's take a look at
the rest of the contents of the package
we have a little bit of paperwork a
headset with interchangeable ear tips a
microphone here is your power brick what
is this baby capable of 18 watts of
quick charge power that should be
sufficient for mo
individual okay little vibration it's so
slim it's so comfy it's the ergonomics
of a small size fall with the screen of
a big size phone this feels like a pixel
three that just keeps going the screen
looks incredible it's way more pixels
than my eyes could ever possibly discern
well can we get the pixel density on
this 643 PPI according to will do all
right here we go we're gonna test the
fingerprint it's on the side it's kind
of a weird it's a different location so
how's it gonna do how's it gonna fare so
fingerprint unlocked on the side is
definitely not the fastest it feels a
bit faster when you first press the
power switch if you don't press the
power switch it takes a second I don't
mind having it on the side I just wish
it was a bit snappier maybe I can turn
off the animation go into the settings I
mean it's so it's very stock ish they
didn't get out of hand they didn't get
wild they're like all right Android it's
pretty good we don't want to do too much
so it's it's almost pixel esque they
just didn't they just didn't mess with
it that much I mean I see a couple
things that seem extra cinema Pro Wow
it is an advanced 21 by 9 video capture
which is one of the most ridiculous
things I've ever seen on a smartphone I
mean it's got a real pro vibe to it
audio levels you have HDR options codec
you're shooting in h.265 battery level
it's a focal length ISO shutter speed
white balance daylight selection manual
focus I mean it's not unwanted it's cool
it's exclusive it's in line with their
DNA I can live with that you can launch
the camera quickly swiftly lift your
device in landscape mode aim the camera
and it'll be launched automatically okay
that's cool side sense you can take a
photo or video by simply double tapping
the sensor on the side of the screen I
guess they mean the fingerprint sensor
okay cool got it oh this is a shutter
button that's way cooler this holding it
like this they thought about the
ergonomics you hold it as a human would
hold a camera and it has the half
shutter press for focus half down get
the green boom pop the shutter so simple
it's a bit ridiculous like you could
just tap this green loop relax or you
could use some other button a lot of a
lot of phones use the volume down but I
don't want a double function button you
know you see everybody ah like this the
cause no no no
humans boom so here we go wide zoom
standard zoom wide it means pretty much
what you want let's watch a little video
sixteen by nine content you're gonna get
black bars its YouTube so you can zoom
in actually not so bad the crop works
completely fine and let's get a sense
for the audio performance here real
quick now there's another weird icon
over there
dynamic vibration it's like a boost of
some kind but now if I click on the
dolby atmos there's a few modes in there
by default dynamic attempts identify the
type of content and then make the
adjustment but you also have movie music
custom I'll leave it on dynamic I think
that's how most people will use it well
that is so weird it was like a harmonies
I think that might be better for music
to be honest it's a it's an odd
experience it's harmonized so it's like
a slightly the enhancement is slightly
off you can you can pick it up now as
far as the speaker is concerned it's
your typical implementation most of the
sound comes out of the bottom unit the
main speaker growing a little bit of
high end out of the earpiece generation
flexible all that which requires a very
specific Samsung goes and creates other
brands smartphones probably none more so
than Apple's smartphones Apple using a
hundred million old iPhone screens I
would say volume is kind of comparable
between to you this is the oneplus 7 pro
by the way but I feel like there's a
little bit more low-end presence on the
oneplus when it comes to dialog let's do
a quick music test do you want to see
that compares real quick look at this so
that's the oneplus and look at how much
skinnier I mean maybe it doesn't seem
substantial to you looking at that but
this like this is the extra this is the
tough part to reach with your hand when
you're trying to reach the far into the
screen
I'd say the oneplus has the most bass
the iPhone is the most clarity this one
is the most high I will put these two
closer together this one is a little bit
this ones below that I don't find it to
be particularly if offensive the thing
is it does change quite a bit when you
go in there and tweak the Dolby settings
I mean this is what Dolby off now but
out of the box
I'd say it's not quite as pleasing as
these two other models let's see if we
can find a Forte 21 by nine video whoa I
don't know if it's gonna come through on
camera I feel like I have to bring it
closer to you jack for you to really get
the right amount of detail this is gonna
be one of the best video watching
experiences on a phone for a lot of
people that are on the go you end up
consuming a lot of content on your smart
phone natively it's just hard to imagine
a better experience than this so there
it is Xperia one from Sony finally a
Sony device in the studio and let alone
like the most requested good on Sony for
creating the device that's captured the
attention of you guys there's some
things that for me are promising right
out of the box I mean the display is
obviously beautiful OLED all those
pixels unusual aspect ratio I like the
dedicated switch for the cameras which
I'm gonna try out more I'm a little
skeptical at a battery life though I
will look into that also I like the
purple color somehow I didn't expect
that I'm gonna pop my sim card in here
very shortly get to the bottom of it but
good on Sony for sticking around and at
least capturing your guys attention up
until now we'll see how it pans out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
