another video and today I'm bringing you
something
pity petit dejeuner God can I today I'm
bringing you something small something
small that's not usually small it's a
projector it's one of the smallest I
could find fits in the palm of your hand
it's about the size of a phone surround
a hundred bucks it's not super highly
spec doubt when you're talking about
lumens and resolution and all that jazz
but it's more of kind of a little
pocketable
theater if you will you're gonna want to
use this in a dark environment I think
it's like 25 lumens 960 by 540 maybe
even in your backyard on the fence you
want to have a little drive-in movie
type vibe anyway
pocket projector from a company called
AXA technologies you can see on the side
here you can use it with a number of
different devices you could even hook a
game console up to it for a real party
it even has a speaker in it which is
cool or a headphone jack if you want to
take it to the next level there's a
couple ways to interface with this guy
I believe it features mini HDMI look how
small that is or you can stick an SD
card in here with all your media files
on it so here is the little guy wow
that's I've seen some small projectors
but that is that's about as small as
they go there's the lens on the front
there Jack you can probably pick that up
also a wheel probably to focus that lens
I'm guessing this looks like the speaker
some controls here on the top over here
we have DC 5 volt in I suppose that's to
charge this up it'll do like a movies
worth of battery light there's also a
USB out on it I suppose that's for
hooking up maybe an external drive or
something on the bottom a tripod mount
over here we have our SD card slot
that's a micro SD but those are huge now
you can get like 200 gigabyte you have
an AV out headphone jack and of course
your mini HDMI so USB to charge it up it
makes sense and then they gave you the
standard AV of course and look they did
include a mini little tripod that's
sweet so you can catch the right angle
it's even a little clip on it and look
at that you can
can you catch an angle yeah you can it's
time to test this thing out hopefully we
have a charge will fan in there oh that
baby came on okay cool yeah the
interface it's pretty basic but then
again you got a curve your expectation
this thing is around a hundred bucks and
you're getting a built-in media player
they didn't even have to give you that
it could have just been an HDMI IN so if
you don't want to use the media
functionality just get yourself an HDMI
cable hook up your console Apple TV Roku
chromecast or whatever and feed media to
it that way so if if what you need is a
little movie theater every once in a
while or maybe a more dramatic way to
watch unbox therapy
this guy's guile figure it out it'll
hook you up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
