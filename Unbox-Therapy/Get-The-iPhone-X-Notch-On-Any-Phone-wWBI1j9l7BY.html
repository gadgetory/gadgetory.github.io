Shakespeare so all the talk is about the
new iPhone 10 don't say iPhone X cuz
it's not it's 10 there is no 9 it's no
big deal we'll just sweep that under the
rug we're going straight to 10 apples
very excited many of you are very
excited they had a keynote they told you
this phone was the future the screen to
body ratio and it's incredible amazing
great all the words that they defined in
the English language magical don't
forget magical and of course the
wondrous new facial unlock feature with
the projection of many thousands of
points on your face what in the meantime
there's something interesting that I
think needs to be addressed and that is
the conversation around the not
dun-dun-dun the not ch not the guy who
created Minecraft not that not ch
no the not CH at the top of the iPhone
10 this little cutout near the top of
the screen which has now been integrated
into the display it's it's become a
component of the user interface now I
mean you're pulling down your
notifications as well as your search bar
and everything's happening up in this
area the facial recognition lives in
this knotch this black bar across the
top of the display now some people they
think it looks cool they think it's very
exciting
much like the essential phone you have
different elements going up around of
course on the Galaxy S II which is next
to the essential phone they chose a more
traditional approach getting super slim
on the sides but keeping a bit of a
forehead and a bit of a chin so that the
screen could maintain its more
traditional layout now Apple has been
even more aggressive by implementing
this cutout implementing this notch
which will take up a bigger portion than
the essential phone but of course not so
much as the full forehead the full bezel
that exists on the s8 it's kind of
in-between the two now a lot of people
are wondering hey how is this gonna
affect my daily life what our apps gonna
look like with a notch in the way is it
going to be effect
then it all is is it gonna be bothersome
now if you spent any amount of time
playing with these two devices you know
that because of their aspect ratios
different things happen in different
apps for example on the SAT when you
launch a YouTube video you have black
bars on both sides because it's a tall
screen but you can zoom in you can punch
in in order to allow yourself to see a
full-screen image which will crop the
top and bottom a little bit so as you
can see here a black bar comes across at
the top and this is no longer usable
realistic I guess it is in the sense
that you can see your specifics along
top your clock and your notifications
and so on you can pull down from
anywhere on that display but it's not
completely dynamic like not every app
can take advantage of that layout yet
now if I go ahead and flip this
horizontal you'll see the same thing
happens I get a black bar on the top and
the bottom now over time it's possible
that app developers will find better
implementations of how to take advantage
of the unusual real-estate presented by
devices like the essential phone or the
iPhone 10 but in the meantime you might
end up with some suboptimal experiences
or smaller real estate than you thought
you were getting in other words when
you're in the operating system of the
device you get all this space but then
you launch into certain apps and you get
black bars the same will be true of the
iPhone 10 at least at launch nonetheless
if you're anything like me with the
curious mind relating to tech you're
probably wondering exactly what this
knotch
would look like if you had it in your
hand if you had it on your phone and so
here is the special announcement of the
day thank goodness there is now an app
so that you can experience in the iPhone
10 not on your very own device right now
call X out of 10 and I've installed it
on both of these devices so you can get
a better idea of how it will look on
each one now on the s8 it looks kind of
weird because there's already a forehead
and then you end up with the notch below
that since this layout is not designed
for the knotch you end up with a little
bit of overlap on things like the clock
but roughly that's kind of what you're
looking at with the iPhone 10 especially
with the iPhones 5.8 inch screen I'm
gonna launch into YouTube here and I'm
an attempt to play a full screen video
this is the default kind of playback for
the s8 and much like the essential phone
it creates a black bar at the top for
different reasons that's because this is
a tall phone but the s8 does have an
option to zoom in to fill the screen and
now you get a sense for what video
consumption would be like with that not
so there you can see it alright that
that's kind of how you would live with
it so anyways this gives you an idea of
what the effect would be if you have
this notch cut out in your video now
this is a weird one for me because I'm
kind of conflicted the same way I am
with the zoom in function on the s8 and
the SI plus it's like do you want more
video on your screen even if it means
chopping a little bit of it out or would
you rather have the native aspect ratio
and the black bars on the side I'm not
really sure I think it's kind of cool to
have the extra screen real estate but
then at the same time it may be you find
this distracting now as I said the si is
probably not the best representation of
how this notch is going to look day to
day because it already has a bit of a
forehead the essential phone not so much
so this one spans all the way to the top
and has this cutout already for the
front-facing camera so if I turn the app
on with this device you'll see that's
starting to look a lot like the iPhone
10 that's kind of what the layout would
be like and when you compare it
head-to-head with the essential it's
kind of a little bit upsetting in the
sense that the essential kind of does a
better job of protecting more of your
display now granted it doesn't have the
hardware and then the mechanics for the
advanced facial recognition so there's
not so much that has to go on up there
but nonetheless when you compare the two
ahead I'll go ahead and turn it off one
more time like that for some reason is
just a more elegant look at least to my
eyeballs knotch no not now of course
over time we're going to see various
implementations of this maybe eventually
Apple will be able to embed those
components underneath the display so we
can have a truly completely bezel-less
design look at this I just got a hot
tweet in from Willy do and he's quoting
someone on Twitter named Thomas and he
says that the iPhone 10 will render web
pages with literal white bars on the
sides and you can tell that people are
not very happy about that because it's
got over a thousand retweets and 1500
likes this is the total opposite of
immersive okay so he's not happy about
it but you can see we're at a kind of
base level implementation here where
we've got to get used to the idea of
this notch living there and software
developers designers and so on are gonna
have to try to find out dealing with its
existence it's obviously not ideal but
it's there now by comparison when the
essential phone renders a web page it
blacks out this area which causes it to
kind of blend in right it looks more
like a traditional bezel instead of kind
of bringing attention to the cut out
like apples rendering suggested here by
Thomas might do so either way there are
many questions surrounding this
interface and how it will be affected
long term by this knotch
I don't know what do you guys think is
this notch thing a big deal would you
prefer it not to be there or are you
willing to live with it would you have
preferred Apple to just put a standard
little bezel around the entire top I
have to say when you first hold and look
at an essential phone with the screen
extending beyond the camera there is
something cool about it it's not
something that you've seen before and I
think the effect might be similar for
the iPhone go download this knotch app
and try it for yourself and let me know
how you interpret the effect it's kind
of a cool little experiment to determine
just how much you might like the iPhone
10 it's obviously not an iPhone 10 and
it isn't a substitute but anybody could
try it at home and that's kind of cool
not or no knotch you decide okay today's
first question from you
all me KB future of iPhone question mark
absolute Wireless is what we need I
assume he's talking about fully wireless
charging yes that's actually a thing
I've read an article yesterday morning
about some advancements in fully
wireless charging this is kind of crazy
to look at there's this module that sits
on a countertop let's say and then any
device capable that goes near it can
suck a charge from it without being on a
physical pad it seems to me that it's a
little ways off like this isn't
happening
in any new generation of iPhone any time
soon at least that's my prediction I
don't know it's pretty wild stuff but
I'm not so sure it's ready for primetime
here's one from Youssef he asks what do
you think of a 17 inch laptop for
college I think it's a little bit big
most 17 inch laptops that are out there
are like 6 pounds and up something like
that and yes back in my day that was
pretty normal but now there's so many
options that are far more portable my
recommendation would be to go with a
slimmer laptop and then have a monitor
set up back in your dorm room or at your
apartment so you get the best of both
worlds portability when you need it and
then for multi media consumption gaming
or whatever you have a bigger display
which is stationary and you don't have
to carry with you all the time and
here's one from Daniel Lovewell will you
be giving away any iPhone tens can I has
one please I don't know you're gonna
have to stick around for that I know I'm
gonna have some here at the studio and
if it's anything like the past sometimes
a few extras show up and they need to
find themselves a good home and that
home might be yours thanks very much for
watching if you guys want to participate
in these types of q and A's in the
future make sure to leave your questions
