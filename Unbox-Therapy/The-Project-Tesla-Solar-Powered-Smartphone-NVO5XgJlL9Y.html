the most outlandish unboxing videos that
has ever happened here on unbox therapy
this is a very expensive smartphone in
front of me is from a company called
caviar Royal gift and it's not just
about luxury it's also about tech inside
of this box it's a smartphone at iPhone
which has been retrofitted it's been
modified with a solar panel on the back
of it so it can charge via the Sun in
honor of Elon Musk and the company Tesla
this thing can run you up to like six
thousand bucks
look at this unboxing experience I mean
it is pure luxury with the leather this
drops down and that's the device Tesla
limited edition iPhone 10s whoa it's got
carbon fiber on it so these are
extremely limited on a side here made on
earth by humans oh there's a little
power button power indicator there which
you can click you can see how much juice
is stored inside of the solar battery
oh it's juice and when it's blue fancy
looking paperwork there we go
whoa certificate of authenticity you
gotta have that caviar iPhone 10 Tesla
256 256 storage you got the stamp you
got the sticker you got the signature
you gotta have it when you're dropping
this kind of money we're charging
smartphones from the Sun it's the future
the maximum effectiveness of the solar
panel may be reached upon the condition
of placing it in a direction normal to
the Sun raise the efficiency coefficient
of a sunray through the glass is for 30%
less thus the phone will be charged
slower so the accumulator battery
underneath this solar panel is 2200
milliamp hours the accumulator battery
can charge from the Sun in about 30
hours to fill it up completely so this
indicator the way it works if you see
the blue it's actively charging the
device and you can see how much battery
life is on there if you hold the power
switch it should go back to
reen I believe yeah green and that's the
off position the charging position
Ovechkin's got one this is very
executive stuff there's a Merkel there's
a Trump listen one we need next they
also appear to do some s nine and s9
plus and even Apple watches and what do
we have we have the headphone adapter
from lightning to mini jack as well as
the included earbuds you would get with
any iPhone your standard charge cable
nowhere near as exciting as charging
from the Sun obviously and this cable
here this is the magnetic cable which
will charge the main power bank in its
night time I guess so you don't have a
bright light or you don't have access to
the Sun at that moment this guy just
goes on there like that and that'll
charge this up the 2200 milliamp hours
inside of this portion alright so the
device is booted up you can see that
it's charging even though I'm not
plugged in so the battery inside of the
iPhone is charging via the battery
underneath otherwise this thing is
basically gonna operate like any other
iPhone 10 I just noticed
on the side here it's got an indicator
saying 24 karat gold is it plated I'm
not sure now as you can tell the device
has gotten bigger it's gotten heavier
but you can't deny it is a unique look
holy smokes you are gonna get asked some
questions you are going to be on the
cutting edge it had to hack into the
back of this device the backplate and
interface with the power somehow via
this battery bank wouldn't be an easy
task to be honest I don't know about you
but a smartphone where you never need to
think about battery life that's kind of
a cool thing this is not that yet but
for someone who wants to be on the cusp
on the cutting edge maybe it's a step
closer
it's an incredibly high-end luxury item
it's very expensive starts around 5,000
bucks u.s. it's the Tesla limited
edition iPhone 10 look at that it's wild
and it's for the person who has
absolutely everything and still has
money to spare so it's for you jack
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
