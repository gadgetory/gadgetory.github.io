iPad pro I did a video on it recently I
was like is this thing worth the money
laptop money jeez these are expensive
obviously this thing is very powerful
performance comparable to an actual
laptop in something incredibly slim and
like I'm kind of using it what I didn't
expect to be using this thing I have so
many laptops all the laptops in my house
right now plugged in and charged it's
every MacBook there's the Google pixel
book there's the old iPad there's this
iPad it's too many choices it's kind of
crazy is this potential future reality
in which people are just using iPads
instead of last house is that thing is
that a real possibility see I've been
been traveling around YouTube taking a
look around taking a little peek
checking out the other channels and so
on and a lot of people who covered this
product who did videos on this product
they had it directly in reference to
laptops myself included because it's
just in that price category now it
seemed evident to me that that was a
question that a lot of you guys had this
question of look I'm gonna walk into the
store here I'm gonna walk into an Apple
store or the website I got $1,000 to
spend am I really getting an iPad is
that's what is that what's happening is
this the future I feel you I feel you on
that Apple's marketing of course they
went all out there like this is it this
is what you want
it's crazy fast they're right about that
it is very fast you have a pen you have
this case you can prop it up you know
I've been doing it guys I'm living I
started living this life okay look look
I put it in there look at me I started
to live this life way it hasn't been
very long maybe like a 24-hour 48-hour
period that I've been doing this this
morning I'm doing email okay I'm inside
here I'm doing email two-handed I'm
swiping over here I'm tapping over here
I'm like Who am I what is this there is
something I like about this I was
sitting there it's a tiny little
footprint I was having a moment all
right with the pen and everything else
and I was like maybe just maybe Apple
has a point here I know I don't say that
very frequently but it's possible that
they might maybe it is the future maybe
there's some sort of indication maybe
this is the start and I still believe at
this point right now that for most
people a laptop is generally going to be
a better bet
but that said I feel like I'm the right
person with all of the various devices
available to me to do a bit of an
experiment to see if this unit right
here can replace a laptop for me over an
extended period of time so I'm gonna
start that experiment right now I am
going to go laptop lists computer lists
with the exception of this right here if
you want to call it a computer I don't
know if it is yet I'm going to only use
the iPad probe the pen and the keyboard
case as my main only computing device
I'll still carry smartphone as my main
computing device for how long how long
should I do it guys no stop at a year a
dairy two weeks now I'm not gonna cheat
I will do it I want to see what happens
to me as a human do I become Tim Cook is
that what happens
I just transform into Tim Cook I'll do
two weeks so we're gonna do two weeks
starting now I am switching over to
nothing but an iPad pro and a smartphone
no laptop no computer you got to realize
this is this is a bigger deal than it
sounds I had so many setups downstairs
here in this building I had the with the
lazy boy recliner and the giant monitors
no can't use it all the laptops laying
around the house can't use them there's
something so appealing about this
display that it kind of makes you want
to try this experiment because you do
love looking at it and interacting with
it that said I do have my hesitations I
am going to find out so far so good but
it's a short period it's been like 24
hours immediate advantages form-factor
look at that thing
what are you you're a student are you in
college you carry this where's your
backpack don't need it I mean you just
seem like you got your stuff together
it's a refined little package it's all
happening right here I will be touching
this the screen with the touch input cuz
that's the only way you can input with
the keyboard as well but I will be
touching this a lot it's the iPad pro 11
inch and it's my new computing device
for two weeks I do this for you I told
you before the experiment starts now is
Tim Cook right is this the future of
computing can it replace a laptop what
better way to find out I'm quitting
laptops two weeks let's do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
