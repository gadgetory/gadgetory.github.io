and today we're looking at the AV 360
mini DisplayPort converter from Belkin
and what this little box claims to do is
to take your PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360
or any other HDMI device and convert its
video format into something that the
27-inch iMac can understand in this case
it means going from HDMI to mini
DisplayPort so as we get inside the box
we can see there are just a few items
included and that's good it means it's
probably simple to set up
we have the box itself and a couple of
cables and we've also got a little bit
of documentation from Belkin as you see
we've got the Falcon quick install guide
and that's a manufacturer's short form
for too cheap to include a full user
guide no but in all seriousness this
should be super straightforward to hook
up and hopefully we won't have to look
at any documentation at all so first
things first a USB a 2b cable and
hopefully this is gonna power the device
meaning we're not gonna need to plug it
into the wall which is always a good
thing considering wall outlets prime
real estate and in most houses tough to
come by
next we've got the mini DisplayPort
cable itself those are becoming more
common by the day and lastly we've got
the converter box and let me tell you if
you get this puppy in your hands the
first thing you're gonna notice is how
light it is it's so light it feels
almost like it's hollow inside I mean
I'm not saying that's a bad thing you're
just definitely going to notice it let's
get a closer look at the ports first
HDMI next we've got the mini display
port along with the USB and here is that
mini DisplayPort cable in case you
haven't seen one before it's a fairly
unique connector and the USB cable
anyway hope you'll check out our channel
we
a lot more stuff coming up</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
