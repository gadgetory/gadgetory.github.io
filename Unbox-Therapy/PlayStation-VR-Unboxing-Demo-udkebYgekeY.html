heard about it
oculus rift HTC vive and now the
PlayStation VR with this situation
people already have Playstations or at
least a lot of them are out there beyond
that you've got this launch bundle which
gives you all of the components
necessary in the VR world the friction
associated with getting started is one
of the things that's holding it back I
know about friction it's how you make a
fire right like with the what's inside
the box so you've got the headset of
course you've got these controllers the
camera and the game included is kind of
like a variety type of disc you can see
there's some accessories the headset is
available now you will need to do
something for audio and then some
accessories here for like a gun unit
that'll be out in the spring ooh
there's a couple of different options
here here is the camera unit you can see
it has two lenses that's going to be
used for motion tracking it sort of
tracks the lights these little globes on
the top there's also lighting on the
headset so it knows where your head is
another controller so two controllers
got the hot tub
I have to cut that that that cutta cutta
excuse me
notice where I'm aiming hey first-class
Jack look at that action whoop Wow they
went all out look at the size of this
Quick Start Guide look at all that empty
space on there look at this the way they
a headset so they do give you a headset
this box is how you're going to
interface with the VR headset while
remaining connected HDMI to the ps4
micro USB to connected whoa-ohh
so those ports become more accessible on
the front this looks like the important
headset cable I'm guessing it's that
special AV looking Kinect it actually
looks kind of like HDMI and there it is
the cables already installed on this
thing with an inline remote that's kind
of cool this breaks out into the same
thing that will go into there and a
headphone jack so any headset it's going
to be capable of working spring-loaded I
gotta say first impressions here are
positive
very soft and cushiony look at that
let's enter virtual reality together
