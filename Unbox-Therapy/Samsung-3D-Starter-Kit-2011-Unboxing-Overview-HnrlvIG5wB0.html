therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Samsung 3d starter kit for 2011 as
you guys know I picked up a new Samsung
LED television and this was included as
part of the bundle I got this starter
kit along with the skype HD camera for
Samsung Smart TVs and the television for
$16.99 so I'm really excited about that
deal everything way below MSRP but you
can buy this starter kit independently
if you did not get it included with your
television and what you're going to get
is two pairs of Samsung's powered 3d
glasses they are not rechargeable
instead they use a watch style battery I
have not tested them yet so I'm not sure
exactly how long that battery is gonna
last but hopefully it's you know a while
because these batteries are not fun to
go pick up but I don't really intend to
do that much 3d viewing so it should be
fine you're also gonna get the Shrek 3d
the complete collection that's four
discs and a couple of cleaning cloths
for each set of glasses there's also a
little bit of paperwork as there always
is the actual glasses are called the S
SG - 3100 GB in case you're wondering
and once we get all the plastic and
whatnot off of them they're actually
really light a lot lighter than I
expected I've actually never owned any
3d equipment before so I was expecting
them to be a little bit heavier and they
do fit over top of my glasses which I
was surprised to find out although I
might just wear contact lenses
underneath of these who knows so there's
that watch style battery that I talked
about earlier it just slides in here and
then this little door clamps down and
you're all finished now I hope I have to
change those too often cuz these
batteries are kind of a bitch to pick up
you know what I mean they can only get
them in certain places so you're also
gonna get to cleaning class as I said
before which is nice I always like to
have those included and the battery the
model of the battery is actually the
cr2025 so yeah here in canada i guess
you're gonna go to shoppers Drug Mart
for those but as I mentioned hopefully
they last a little while so here's that
trek 3d complete collection blu-ray and
3d of course or blu-rays I should say
and not having seen often
a particularly huge Shrek fan but from
what I hear the 3d is actually pretty
high-quality and is a good way to get
the 3d experience or get started with it
so I'll probably throw a couple of these
in and get back to you guys just let you
know how the TV performs how the
blu-rays look how the glasses perform so
on and so forth and if this whole 3d
deal is really worth the money involved
I mean I was gonna get this TV with or
without 3d so but anyways you've got the
glasses are really basic I mean all
you've got is this power button up on
the right hand side and these tinted
lenses as you can see here they're
really straightforward and I guess
that's what you're looking for anyway
guys if you enjoyed this content then
hopefully you can like and favorite it
as it does help me out a bunch and I
will get back to you on just how these
things perform after I get a chance to
test them out extensively anyway guys
until next time and as always thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
