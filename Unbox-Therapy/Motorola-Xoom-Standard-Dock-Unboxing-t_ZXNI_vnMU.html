therapy comm and today we're taking a
look at the Motorola standard doc it's a
docking solution for your Motorola Xoom
tablet in case you guys haven't seen my
Motorola Xoom unboxing I'm gonna put a
link in the annotations up at the top of
this video anyway the reason I purchased
this is because I thought it would offer
a convenient way to access the tablet
while it sits on my desktop beside my
computer and also just as a syncing
solution rather than plugging and
unplugging cables you can just simply
drop the tablet onto this dock so
looking inside the box we've got the
dock itself as well as the power adapter
let's take a look at the power adapter
first so as you'll see it's pretty
standard stuff exactly what you're used
to except on this end it's got a super
tiny little plug and flip-down prongs
this is probably gonna stay in one place
I'm not gonna move the dock around too
much so here's the dock itself and it's
got some good weight to it which is what
you would hope for unlike on the iPad
dock this dock holds your tablet in
landscape mode rather than portrait
which is actually pretty useful it's got
a glossy finish up top but I won't be
touching it too much so fingerprints
shouldn't be an issue on the back we've
got power we've got an auxiliary plug
for hooking it up to a stereo system or
hooking up your headphones there's also
an adapter plate here this plate is
gonna allow you to use the dock along
with a case so long as it's the Motorola
official case anyway here's what the
zoom looks like docked up hope you check

subscribe later</div></body></html>
