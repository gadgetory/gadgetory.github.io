you guys in the audience are gonna look
at this and be like I can't understand
why I need something like this but I'm
gonna ask you to imagine a scenario in
which this could save your day but maybe
it could I got you you got me who's got
you now you're looking at this right now
anything you lose that's a very strange
thing you've got dead inside this box
it'll explain a little bit more but
essentially what I'm gonna show you
today is as far as I know the only way
to have a removable battery with an
iPhone it's called the call battery so
here it is install the case install the
battery plug it all in and you're good
to go once upon a time back in those
blackberry days it was common to carry
around extra charged batteries for your
device that you can just swap in and out
this is a little bit of a throwback here
two times gone by this one is for iPhone
6
this one is for iPhone 7 the batteries
themselves are the same now also a
microUSB cable in the box this cool
little charging dock microUSB on one
side and then a battery slot on the top
this is what the batteries look like
look at that fancy with their different
colors and stuff who doesn't like that
we do have an iPhone 7 over here which
is convenient it fits on like a case
slider in there this little adapter that
they designed for the Lightning port
slide that in there and it's pretty
solid it's gonna stay in there now you
have a removable battery iphone yes I
know there are backup batteries there
are external batteries there are so many
ways there's battery cases I've done
videos on those you just hold that baby
for three seconds and it begins charging
it's my responsibility to show you all
the options that are available this
being one of them you take your cool
little battery here and you just slide
it in and down like that and look at
that the indicator that you are now
charging it's a bit of an unusual look
with the battery surface on the outside
of your phone you're getting low on
juice and you've depleted this extra
battery as well well you've got a bag
full of these guys rather than insert
the whole phone into a case I guess the
battery case could be depleted to maybe
just some sort of incredibly power
hungry user you're just watching videos
I don't need to explain to you how to
use battery it's kind of like highways
if we build more highways there will be
more cars the point is if you've got it
you can use it you now have the option
so let's go ahead and do this swap here
is where the coal battery here's where
the magic happens I pull this guy out
like that and I take the blue one and I
slide that it's actually pretty quick
and once again we have the indicator
there this doc is the key to keeping
these things charged so you'll just
slide this guy in here like this and
actually slots in there kind of nice
you're gonna pull it out swap the old
one into there and keep it moving Oh
would you listen to this protect your
phone's internal battery lithium ion
batteries degrade as you use them after
300 charge cycles your iPhone battery
will be at only about 80% capacity so
one of the pitches they're making here
is don't bother with it don't deplete
the internal battery at all but instead
wasted on these guys okay play twenty
hours straight of Angry Birds twenty
hours Jack this phone theoretically
would never be plugged in ever it would
be like this right that would be the
thing charging now these two batteries
are 4,000 milliamp hours which they
claim can take the overall usage up to
about 33 hours of time so 4,000 milliamp
hours is big it's hard to even find a
phone that has 4,000 milliamp hours in
it adding it on after the fact it's kind
of a nice little bonus
you're never tethered to the wall ever
so even when you're lying in bed and you
get the short cable you're trying to
charge up while you're using it no
worries for a lot of people you're gonna
think it's just a little bit crazy but I
think for the exact right user this
could fill a void for the right person
might be able to find some some cool use
in you
never be tethered
