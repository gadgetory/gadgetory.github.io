floating around these are busy those
kind of knockoff clone versions of the
upcoming iPhone they always seem to hit
the market prior to an iPhone launch
there's something weird in this
particular case though because I have
some information that these particular
clones of what we'll probably call be
called the iPhone 11 or XII or something
like that might not be the eventual
design in fact it could be a fairly
substantial difference between this
clone representation of the next iPhone
which yes it's here it's working it's in
boxes like it even showed up with fake
Apple store I don't know actually maybe
the bags are not fake maybe they went to
a real Apple store a snag but I don't
really why don't we just look at it you
decide and then we'll talk about the
design changes here they look a lot like
the previous generation boxes obviously
you have a iPhone on the side the
artwork is the same from the previous
generation if you're skeptical and
you're looking at this you you maybe
your spidey sense may go off a little
bit like like something like if you look
at the top edge here is this completely
straight this line here is this a bit
closer over here I don't know designed
by Apple in California okay are you
buying it well there's no plastic on the
actual phone fake paperwork fake Apple
stickers man it's unbelievable and they
get these things out before the actual
device launches wild this is the device
and like I said you may have seen this
floating around now the implementation
here of the rear camera setup this is
something that's been rumored we've seen
a lot of it but it's actually the way
it's implemented that is up for dispute
so on this particular device you see
this Ridge around it you see this very
boxy look it doesn't blend all that well
with the glass back on the device itself
actually I don't mind this color at all
maybe a little bit lighter actually this
by the way is an iPhone tennis max I
would say then I need to switch hands
let's see yeah yeah definitely the clone
is a bit lighter you know what if you
really look at this font you can also
spot the fakeness look at how much
sharper this font is it's sharper and
it's thinner it's just it's just not the
same phone you have headphones included
even get an adapter in their fake
lightning cable and the
power brick oh this is the white one
okay so this white one actually gives
you a much better representation of the
scale of this potential camera cutout
and then last up we have gold color of
course one plus calling that almond I
know that this particular design for a
lot of people it's it's gonna be a
polarizing type of thing because it is
such a ubiquitous device and so many
people have it once the thing releases
and everybody sees whatever the new
implementation happens to be it's a very
short path to that becoming familiar and
therefore people becoming comfortable
with it I don't think it's gonna end up
looking quite like this in fact I think
it's gonna look substantially different
but anyhow let's go ahead and boot this
up and see how it operates
now the way these things are built is
that they're basically running Android
in many cases or some version of it
within this like Apple asks skin you
know this chin is way too large on the
clone model over here also the display
much more dim
no OLED action by the looks of it so
this is what the chin is supposed to
look like this is what it looks like
over here when you have this switch push
down there's no red indicator to let you
know that it's been activated you know
what oh you do a good job of faking it
again you can tell the fonts are off
here you could be maybe fooled
know somebody just handed to you you're
not fooled someone has to go in and
really modify some version of Android
and that's not so easy to do so there
has to be some sort of a market for this
it must be a significant market because
it wouldn't be worth the investment
otherwise each one of these costs around
200 bucks something in that territory so
I can tell you straight away this is a
low resolution display I can see pixels
from this range which is very unusual
I mean it's night and day as far as I'm
concerned very soft looking image there
at 1x let's not that you slow shutter
and then another soft looking image at
2x and that's it that seems to be the
only options there it's not a good
picture jack it's a lot of noise in the
image you can see beard hairs but like
if you just look it looks like a
painting some of my
is I mean the resolution is obviously
not substantial now what happens if you
go into portrait mode it says move
farther away still wants me to move
farther how far away you want me to be I
mean it's looking for a face does it
even know the difference
just tell me move farther away how far
away it still says no fiber no portrait
mode at play okay so lots of ways to
figure out that this thing is bogus I
mean the last one I want to try out is
sound there we go
all right Apple shrinking the knotch who
the buttons are also a little loose oof
it's so slow it's painfully slow on
Wi-Fi the video quality severe auto
crunch down for like 144 foods and the
audio is crunchings
look I don't recommend that you buy this
thing all right I'm trying to to figure
out how or why these things exist it's
got to be a novelty factor for some it
definitely is for us for me and also for
you watching this it looks close to what
you could imagine the next iPhone the
iPhone 11 looking like you know there
are some other perspectives out there on
what this might look like and in fact I
have one of those other perspectives on
the way in the form of a CNC model so
I'll showcase that compare it to this in
an upcoming video I don't think that
this is what the next iPhone is going to
look like it's sort of in the right
territory but I don't think it's gonna
be this ugly maybe that's it Jack maybe
you buy it maybe it has a limited
lifespan you buy it now to goof on your
friends you you use this you stick your
SIM card in here you use it for the next
few months prior to the iPhone
announcement and you get tons of
attention and people think you're cool
because it's truly an iPhone or at least
it looks like an iPhone that nobody has</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
