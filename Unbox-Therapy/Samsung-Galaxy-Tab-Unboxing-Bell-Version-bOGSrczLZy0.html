today is a very exciting day we've got
the Samsung Galaxy Tab and I have been
waiting to get one for ever so let's get
it open and share in this excitement
first we've got to use our trusty blade
here it is what we've all been waiting
for the device itself as you can see
it's substantially smaller than the iPad
which I happen to like it's closer in
size to a paperback novel let's put it
to the side and see what else is in this
box first we've got a gift from Belle
since this is a Canadian Galaxy Tab we
have a SIM card included from the Belle
Network in the event that we want to use
the Galaxy Tab over 3G next we've got
some documentation extremely exciting
stuff and inside there is all the
necessary components to charge the
Galaxy Tab here is our USB cable which
has Samsung's proprietary connector on
the other end here is our headset
our power plug for North America which
appears to be interchangeable and the
rest of the power adapter let's see if
we can connect the two mm yes
snap success we have a power adapter
array who cares okay we've got one more
piece of documentation you think it's
the manual let's put it up there now
let's get our hands on the device
because that's what we all pay to see it
feels really good in the hands it's a
great size for one-handed holding seems
to have some kind of textured finish on
the back almost like carbon fiber but
probably some form of molded plastic
it's been textured let's see if it has
any power hmm doesn't look like it will
have to power it up later probably want
to charge it anyways anyway hope you
enjoyed goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
