that you probably I don't know if you
heard about it this is the iPhone 10's
max smart battery case they make it as
well for the regular iphone 10s it will
kind of work with the iPhone 10 but
certain little like the speaker holes
don't line up and I don't recommend you
buy it for that it's expensive of course
it's got the Apple logo on it right so
you know you're gonna have to pay for it
it's a hundred and twenty nine bucks for
a battery case we keep talking about
inexpensive smart phones and apples just
like the doubling down they're like our
case will cost half as much as your
smartphone your budget smartphone they
don't care they got the logo nonetheless
some people are power users on their
devices they want more battery life and
Apple has a solution for you in the form
of their smart battery case I do feel
the need to say that if this is a bit
too rich for your blood
there are battery cases for the tennis
tennis max on Amazon I was just doing a
quick peek before I started this video
and we're talking like what is this one
thirty to ninety nine six thousand
milliamp hours this one has two battery
cells around 1300 milliamp hours so it's
also got like four star rating there are
cheaper ones to choose from if you don't
need this logo and you don't mind a
slightly different design you can head
over to Amazon to pick some up I'll link
that one down in the description that I
just mentioned but if you have money
falling out of your pockets 130 bucks
for a case anyhow let's go ahead and
crack into this so it comes in white and
black and if you were familiar with the
previous version of this then you know
it's got the hump it's the humpback it's
the camel the old one was more like that
though because this one it has the one
hump but then the bottom is just stays
fat what a weird product the shape of
this thing is so weird
and that's that is large so is this
really practical I guess if you really
need maximum battery life then you're
willing to put up with it but you can
tell I mean that's fat that's looking
like a beluga whale right there this is
the white version it has like like a
soft touch
imagine the Apple silicone case with a
battery like actually jammed into it
that's what you're working with here now
the buttons are remapped so they kind of
like on the outside these buttons will
push on the actual buttons and to
install your phone into it you just bend
this back like this
the lightning connector attaches and
then the phone is in the battery case
and charging now one thing that did
improve in this situation is the fact
that this has wireless charging
supported now so you can throw the
entire case on to a wireless charger in
terms of the extension of the battery
life on your iPhone this is gonna give
you between 50 and 70 percent more
battery life Apple doesn't tell you
exactly they kind of just scale it up
they say oh with this case on all of a
sudden you're 10s max can do like 37
hours of talktime and so on so there's
improvements in every battery department
in the neighborhood of 50 to 75 percent
so let's go ahead and install the phone
in so like I said you just sort of bend
this back here and you slide your device
in like so boom top fits over whoa
that's a big boy that's a big boy now
I mean is it for the power users this is
for the Instagram professionals all day
all night discover page deep in it
selfie town I'm a photographer hashtag
goals somewhere traveling you really
need to be on your phone a lot to
justify carrying around this tank will I
need you will I need you will you've got
to feel this right now
this is half this is hefty okay what I
want you do you just pick that up you
just take that off the table you just
you answer a phone call
let me you pretend to answer phone call
just do not a big boy yeah it feels
pretty big I'm not used to like is that
a beluga whale it has a hump yeah are
you in the st. Lawrence River right now
did you know belugas they come down the
st. Lawrence every Sunday yeah they do
for what migration I assume it's for
feeding or breeding or something but you
wouldn't expect your it's a river at st.
Lawrence but you wouldn't expect to see
a whale in there five hours later he's
on the hunt he gets nothing he burned
all those calories seven hours later
Beluga it's a beluga whale yeah
to put it thusly I don't know if it
floats but it's a beluga whale I mean
honestly I don't mind it yeah yeah can
we get a pork it can we get a pocket is
it pocketable let's get a pocket let's
get a quick pocket I have pretty big
pockets but sorry I can feel it
what are you thinking right now is this
a fashion show okay that worked
you could pocket it you're okay with it
it is yeah you know what I am - I am - I
know a lot of people are that they're
giving Apple heat on this particular
design all the way from the last one but
in reality it's like battery cells that
you're gonna buy yeah in industrial
quantities that's what their light did
their slivers they're rectangles you see
you slip it in what else can you really
do yeah I would say this design is a
little bit better than the previous
mm-hmm before it would just look like a
giant retina in the middle of good this
time they went all the way down with it
so the other benefit of going with the
Apple battery case as opposed to a third
party like
pick up like the one that I showed off
earlier is that when you swipe over here
you swipe over here and you see the
battery life on the iPhone and the
battery life on the battery case
independently now the other thing that's
special about this one compared to the
last one as I mentioned earlier is the
wireless charger big wireless guy mm-hmm
big fan
yeah you practically invented it magic
boom charging now we'll charge the case
then the device me in this case the
device is fully charged but the case is
getting a juice let's see what it says
actually so yeah look shows charging can
you take out the phone and then just
charge the case using it's a good
question
solving the world's problems see the
case is off what do you think perfect
no there's a light on the case oh there
you go
alele comfy do ya imagine a universe in
which you're an iPhone user okay you
have a 10 s max it's gigantic
yes it's in your pocket the battery is
not enough because you live a certain
lifestyle you need battery you're away
from an outlet frequently you're an
adventurer you have determined that you
want to get a battery case do you spend
129 on the official Apple
with the wireless charging and the nice
little integration here and of course
don't forget the ever-important logo or
do you spend 30 to 99 head over to
Amazon call it a day the cheaper areas
ladies and gentlemen Hayley Hayley do
Hayley whoo it's just so much more money
than the kind of generic versions that
are on Amazon I mean you could buy four
of those mm-hmm cases and in hand them
out
Halloween should do the trick or treat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
