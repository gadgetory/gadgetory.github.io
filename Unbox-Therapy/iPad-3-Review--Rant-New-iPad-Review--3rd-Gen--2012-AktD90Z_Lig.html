my unusual style iPad 3 review that's
right I'm still calling it the iPad 3
just like I did in my unboxing if you
haven't seen my unboxing video and you
want to see this device up close and
personal I'll put a link to that video
somewhere in the annotations as well as
down in the description so here you have
it this is the latest iPad the third
generation iPad and it is very similar
to the last generation iPad that I have
right beside it in white then the new
one I have is in black but they're both
16 gigs and from a layout perspective
they're basically identical you've got
your eyesight camera that's been
improved and now they're calling it an
iSight camera should perform similarly
now to the iPhone 4 you got your power
switch up top you've got a microphone up
top headphone jack 30 pin connector on
the bottom volume rocker and hold switch
that's basically it for hardware except
for in my opinion the biggest
improvement which is the new screen
while most people are going to agree
with me the new screen and as I
mentioned in the unboxing video it's
basically impossible for me to show you
on camera what this quality is like in
person reason being that well first of
all this video depending on how I upload
it but say for example even if it's in
1080p this the resolution on this screen
surpasses 1080p and then on top of that
it's all the all these pixels smashed
into a nine point seven inch frame
meaning that the distance of space
between each pixel is not very much so
the eyes ability to actually resolve
this data on on this tiny little screen
is limited but they're still calling it
retina and that's because of the
distance that you're likely going to
hold this iPad at so anyways I don't
want to get too too technical with this
because the reason I'm doing this kind
of review right here is because of the
number of questions I get that that
break down very simply like Lou do I
need to upgrade to the latest iPad is it
worth the money which one should I get
I've already got the iPad 2 should I get
the iPad 3 and is the iPad 3 better than
some random and
right tablet those are the main
questions so I thought I'm gonna put you
put together a review in that style
because as you guys know the standard
sort of review process is just to list
the specs to list the data that stuff's
available to anybody you can look at a
spec sheet anywhere on Apple's website
and you can look at a hundred other
reviews that are going to be done that
way and so I'm gonna do it my way I'm
gonna break it down for you guys in very
simple terms if I were you if you were
me what the hell how should it be done
and for those that follow the channel
you know I get to play with a lot of
gadgets so I have a little bit of
experience but I still like to consider
myself a regular consumer at the end of
the day and I want to tell you whether
or not you should be compelled to get
the latest one so my short answer I
don't know if it's a short answer I
don't know if I'm capable of a short
answer but if you own one of these if
you own the last generation iPad then I
say no I say you're already okay you're
up to snuff you've got most of what you
need and until you take a look at this
one you won't even know what the hell
you're missing out on it which isn't
very much but then once you take a look
at one of these then you think oh I had
to have that beautiful display so on and
so forth that's a natural sort of human
reaction but in reality right now there
isn't very much that can take advantage
of this new pixel density like I
mentioned earlier and so what that means
is you're buying a gadget for today you
know especially if you're the person
that wants to buy the latest and
greatest you're not buying the gadget
for a year from now when apps come out
that properly distribute data around the
screen so that you can finally take
advantage of that added resolution know
you're not buying your gadgets that you
buy it right now and in that event
you're probably better to save a few
bucks you're probably gonna be able to
get these ipad tools used for a great
price right now and there's still a very
good tablet especially if they're your
first tablet it's a very cohesive
experience there are a lot of fun to use
they're really easy to pick up and get
working with you have a huge app catalog
Apple has really put together a great
user experience and part of it has to do
with how ubiquitous the device is the
number of users that are out there mean
the apps get developed for it so on and
so forth you know it's a very healthy
ecosystem so the improved camera well
who the hell cares because
if you're walking around shooting photos
like this if you're walking around doing
this let me tell you something you're an
asshole
no I'm just kidding not an asshole but I
mean you're gonna intimidate people this
is not a very comfortable look people
see you walking around like that and
pointing this thing in their direction
they haven't seen that before they're
not comfortable with it and most people
who are gonna buy one of these already
have a smartphone here's my Galaxy Nexus
not the best camera on the market but at
least as good as the one on this latest
iPad and that's a lot more comfortable
people are used to it taking photographs
as a social endeavor and therefore
people's comfort level matters and so if
you've got a smartphone use that camera
we don't need a super high quality
camera in this device now one more thing
I know I've been blabbering on here and
as you guys can tell I'm pumped up about
this subject you know tablets have taken
over the marketplace they're a huge
success a huge hit and a lot of people
are loving them but I do I do want to
say a few words about Android and that's
why I've got my Galaxy Tab 10 one out
here you know I use all these devices I
really try and look at them from a
regular users perspective I'm to think
about the user experience etc and to be
honest with you this device here
actually got a lot of use from me for a
while but the trouble is that there is
not a healthy ecosystem I'm sure you all
know that Android and tablets it's still
a relatively new endeavor and as a
result this turns in at least for me
turns into sort of a glorified touch
interface web browser it's access to the
web access to a web browser and that's
fine you know access to my gmail that's
fine because I mean that's a big
percentage of how I use these other
things too obviously but for the average
user who picks up an Android tablet I
think at this point in time you might be
disappointed you might be disappointed
in the sense that there isn't that
healthy thriving ecosystem that you can
sort of explore off the bat and see and
sort of decide how you're going to use
this new device in your life so that's
been a bit of a discussion on tablets I
don't know if you guys are gonna love
this video or hate this video I hope you
love this video it's a little bit
different as I said before it is not
your average iPad
review you know like I said before if
you want to see beautiful beautiful
visuals and whatnot you can watch my
unboxing video but I wanted to give you
guys my interpretation from a user's
perspective do you need to run out and
buy the iPad 3 my answer is simple for
all of you know you don't need to do it
if you don't have a tablet already look
for an iPad 2 you can get a great value
on one you're going to get nine-tenths
of the performance and the experience
that you'd get on this new iPad for a
lot less money you might be able to even
source one elf or half half the price
one last thing before we go this does
have improved graphics performance I
know I didn't talk about I know I'm
gonna have people saying you talk about
the improved performance it does have
improved graphics performance but there
isn't too much on the market right now
that can take advantage of it and that
brings me back to my last point which is
why would you spend your money sit
around and wait I mean unless you're
rich or something sit around and wait
for something to take advantage of what
you've got when you can get a great
value on something like this one and the
last thing before I go holy blabber fest
Apple products iPads especially an
iPhones for that matter retain their
value really really well so if you buy
one of these and you decide hey you know
I want to upgrade at a later date I
guarantee you there's going to be a lot
of value left in the device so that is
definitely something to consider you
don't need to go all the way to the
highest level you can start off a little
bit slower and you can still get most of
your value back when you decide to
upgrade anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
this if you did please like and favorite
the video show me some love it's a
little bit different as I said before
but I just wanted to communicate my
feelings to you guys I'm amped up I'm
motivated about these products and I'll
leave a comment down below tell me how
you use your tablet and how much you
like it and which one you're using etc

guys around the channel thanks for
watching you guys make this content
possible I'll see you in the next video
