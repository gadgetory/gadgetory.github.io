another video and today I've got a world
exclusive for you in front of me is the
back plate from the upcoming iPhone 6s
yes the phone that doesn't even exist
yet you also probably noticed this the
world famous bendgate iPhone 6 plus
which started this entire extravaganza
surrounding the idea of these iPhones
bending but it looks like Apple is
making some changes based on my
inspection of this new upcoming iPhone
6s we see some adjustments here in
various measurements when I'm analyzing
the new 6s backplate compared to the
standard 6 backlight so I'm going to get
rid of the bendgate phone for a minute
because we're not analyzing that one in
this video here are the two shells on
the Left I have the backplate from the
regular iPhone 6 and over here on the
right in gold is the one from the
upcoming 6s I also have a digital
caliper here which can take measurement
all the way down to point zero one
millimeters now upon inspection at first
glance they look to be exactly the same
you will notice that the screw layout is
a little bit different but what caught
my attention immediately was the fact
that this area over here around the home
buttons as well as the area around the
other cutouts where the power switch
would be appear to be significantly
thicker on the 6s backplate compared
with the standard six now of course this
is important because this area right
here is where Bend Gates started I'm
going to go ahead and do some
measurements here we'll start with the
major ones the height now as I mentioned
these are going to be very similar and
close but ever so slightly different top
to bottom on the 6s backplate a reading
of 138 point two six millimeters with
the original six 138 point zero nine
ever-so-slight on the difference there
I'll slide that out and the same thing
happens when you're measuring the width
the old iPhone sixty six point nine one
the new one
67.1 six so seems insignificant but it
isn't insignificant because of the
specific areas that contribute to that
new dimension of course as I mentioned
before the most significant near the
volume button so the old phone is a very
precise measurement right where the
volume buttons are one point one four
millimeters just over one millimeter now
on the new show the new reinforced 6s
one point nine zero almost twice as
thick in that very important region okay
so it's obvious that Apple has increased
the thickness at various weak points in
the back chassis of the iPhone 6s when
compared to the six but the question is
will this result in a heavier overall
device so I've got a little postal scale
over here the regular iPhone 6 you can
see it comes in at 27 grams and now for
the new shell 25 grams so what's
interesting here is not only do we have
what look like enhancements but we also
have an overall lighter shell this
evidence here appears to point in the
direction of a new material potentially
that rumored 7000 series aluminum which
is not only going to be thicker in some
key points here but also probably going
to be stronger in general so coming up
very shortly on the channel I'll be
testing that I'll be comparing these two
when it comes to potential bends so
stick around for that a sort of some
evidence here that Apple took bendgate
seriously but it looks like this time
around everyone's going to end up with a
stronger iPhone than the previous gen
thanks very much for watching
stick around stay tuned for more
exclusive information on the upcoming
iPhone 6s as well as tests I've got some
other components that I'll be showing
you very shortly so make sure to
subscribe and leave a thumbs up if you
enjoyed this content I'll catch on the
next episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
