waiting on this for a while it's called
the glyph this is the founders edition
and it's such a hard thing to explain to
you if you haven't heard of it it looks
like headphones right well it is it sits
on top of your head like headphones so
you can be inconspicuous when you're out
and about but at any point in time you
can flip it down the headphones stay on
and now you have screens HD screens in
front of each eyeball and you can enjoy
something that you will perceive to be
as a 50 or 60 inch television in front
of your eyes without it being there you
know what I'm saying you'll see it works
with smartphones computers tablets game
consoles and even drones definitely
going to try that out in an upcoming
video retinal imaging technology optic
nerve and battery life of up to 4 hours
it charges via micro USB this is not a
VR headset what you are seeing is just a
nice big personal image let's crack this
open it's not cheap ok some cables oh
sweet ok this looks like a micro HDMI to
HDMI a micro USB cable to keep it
charged up oh my goodness is that ever
soft it's like uh-oh
a luxurious carrying case over here some
kind of strap here are a number of nose
pieces ooh
feel surprisingly premium giant padded
ear cups here Oh
the magnetic protector for your lenses
there and then those are the lenses
themselves this side that takes the
micro or mini a power switch over here a
power light so this is where your nose
piece goes I'm not going to install that
just yet it's a little high up on the
head so somebody who's really looking at
you examining you it might figure you
out but here's where things get spicy
though you spin that baby down
all of a sudden look at you now hmm oh
yeah that's way more comfortable oh
that's cool too magnetic fit in there
you know it's kind of like wearing
glasses I'd say it's a little bit more
little softer I want to see what this
thing is all about I mean I want to try
to play some games right now
see if I'm Kate so I've got the Xbox
booted up now there's actual adjustments
right on the lenses so you don't have to
wear glasses Oh
audio is rumbling right now
whoo oh not good it's a little different
get the hang of there we go
if you've never played trials before it
is one of the most frustrating games
haha but I love it I love the
frustration of it eventually you will
snap and you'll take it out on your
loved ones
maybe one day or get it we're ending up
in that futuristic zone of you know
matrix all the time just tapped in and
logged in maybe that's maybe that's
where we're going but I'm not a hundred
percent sure that we're there yet you
know how you like lay in bed with like a
Netflix series or something like that
well if you have your laptop and then
you're cranked the neck is cranked even
with the phone you got the phone up here
you drop the phone broke and face you
could just go future mode alright be on
the cutting edge for the enthusiasts who
give 0 FS you know their mom comes home
