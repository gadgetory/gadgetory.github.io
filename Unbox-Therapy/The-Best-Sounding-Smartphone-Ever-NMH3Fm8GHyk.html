smartphone from ZTE the axon 7 I have
checked out the previous version I did
some audio testing because the audio
performance is a big part of what ZT is
trying to do here with the axon lineup
special bonus they sent me two of them
they said hey Luke
check out the new axon 7 but also give
one away to a lucky viewer so I'll do
that on Twitter as I normally do what is
this phone all about so it's kind of
like it's like a budget version of a
flagship phone 400 bucks the latest in
terms of hardware internally and maybe a
better audio performance than what
you're getting in some flagships that's
the angle here this model has a dual SIM
card slot unboxing experience so far so
good look at that guy there
ooh so it looks like I've got the gold
model here aluminum on the back a power
brick quick charge the device features
USB C and quick charge a USBC cable and
then also a headset now the concept here
again is to take advantage of this
somewhat superior headphone amplifier
digital to analog converter that exists
inside of the axon 7 this metallic
finish to match the device a screen
protector ooh look at that
it's a SIM card tool fits into that unit
and now you can put it on your keychain
cuz you never have one of these when you
need one microUSB to USB see a case one
of my pet peeves though with a lot of
smart phones out there is that if you're
not listening with headphones
later more often than not you don't have
forward-firing speakers not the case
here big speaker grills stereo speakers
facing you when you're watching it
forward facing camera right in that
location and see the fingerprint sensor
lives in this location the mic as well
as the USBC connected hello axon
do-do-do-do-do-do adding various parts
of let's go ahead and test this
fingerprint scanner out oh man these
things are getting snappier here we go
bingo a fairly streamlined interface
here so you got a 1440p display here
AMOLED what more do you want look at
this this is the tray expandable storage
SIM card or dual SIM how you gonna tell
me that's a bad thing
give it 264 gig man ain't nobody gonna
hold you down oh no I got to keep it
moving
okay check this out
dolby atmos so this is like your ability
to really configure the equalization and
dynamics of the audio file you're
working with I'm gonna play the demo for
movie whoo yeah
volume leveler dialogue enhancer
surround virtualizer
and of course graphic equalizer these
are all options built right in I'm gonna
keep listening oh look how many versions
of me exists there Wow how about that
noise it makes when it caught focus boom
want to get a little more manual with it
let's see what do I do here
so now I've got a level there shutter
speed is selectable ISO exposure
compensation white balance interval
shooting for time-lapse a manual focus
control holy smokes
video is currently 1080p 30fps h.264 but
can go all the way up to 4k 30fps and
the new h.265 supported what about that
slow motion oh yeah that guy right there
that's a package this whole deal it's a
package for 400 man has the smartphone
space got a lot more competitive how
about ZTE putting it together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
