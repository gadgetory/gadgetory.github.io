different piece of coverage to break up
all of this smartphone stuff that's been
dominating the channel if these my
friends are custom Xbox 360 controllers
with the unbox therapy theme going on
and they are courtesy of imagine customs
so if you guys are interested in seeing
more stuff like this and lots of eye
candy head over to the link in the
description so you can check out imagine
customs for yourself so this is the
first of three different controllers you
can see it has the unbox therapy theme
on there along with some white buttons
white thumb sticks and of course the
orange coloring around the light in the
center of the controller if the second
controller that I'm gonna show you here
is actually my favorite it's a little
bit different than the other two in the
sense that it has a wrap around it I'll
go ahead and show you this right now
this is the second of three and it has
this really cool burnt orange coloring
along with the smoky XY a B buttons you
can see the unbox therapy logo on the
left hand side and pretty much
everything else is black it's either
black or orange kind of a little bit of
a Halloween theme here you know with
October coming up I'm not sure that was
intentional but anyways this is my
favorite of the three and it's actually
a good time for me to ask you guys which
is your favorite of all three of these
controllers after you've seen them all
go ahead and leave a comment down below
and since this is more controllers than
I can possibly use let me know if you
guys want to see a giveaway of one of
the three or maybe even two of the three
all you need to do is leave a like down
below and that'll tell me that that's
something you guys want to see in the
future and then I'll probably pick
whichever one has the most votes for the
audience favorite of all three of these
but as I said earlier I think you're
probably gonna pick this one because it
happens to be my favorite or maybe not I
don't know who knows what you guys are
looking for maybe you want a darker
controller like the first or the next
one that I'm about to show you so here
is the last of the bunch this one's
probably my second favorite I like it
because it's mostly black kind of
blacked out and you have the large unbox
therapy logo along the bottom as well as
the orange portion on the bottom on the
top and of course the triggers are also
done up in orange you have a
lack battery pack on this one unlike the
first one which was white but you also
have the orange coloring around the
lighting system on the center so that's
carried through on all three controllers
that's pretty much identical
anyways that wraps up this look at all
three custom controllers from imagine
customs huge thanks to them for making
this video possible and thanks to you
guys for being loyal viewers and
continuing to watch all of our content
here on unbox therapy I'll catch you
guys on the next episode later</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
