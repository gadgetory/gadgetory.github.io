today this is not something I ever
expected to see you can probably tell
already that you're looking at a Pizza
Hut logo that's what that is right there
blue that's a funny-looking pizza box I
would have to agree with you on that in
fact when you touch the top of the box
you realize it's got some grip tape on
it almost like rip tape on a skateboard
then you look a little more closely and
you see that it says by pops
now you're getting some ideas and trust
me because I am too inside this box are
incredibly limited edition sneakers from
Pizza Hut a combination a collaboration
that I never thought I'd see they've got
a fancy tech function inside this box
are shoes that can order pizza with the
press of a button we look around the box
you can see this is the official pizza
of March Madness watch some basketball
order some pizza here we go 700 opping
still the pizza theme going on oh my
goodness now you might have seen these
commercials on TV but I didn't know
where they reel was it a thing you could
actually get your hands on apparently
yes look at these neat oh my goodness
is it either even in my size to size 11
whoa the Pizza Hut pie tops nevermind
high tops to kick things off create an
account on Pizza Hut calm down load the
pie tops app to your phone pair your
shoes and enjoy delicious pizza so it's
a Bluetooth type of scenario and then
what you just press down on there and
that's that
oh this one is the button on the right
shoe all right we need an app to go with
these look at DOS I try a bomb first or
get the app boom look how fresh those
white kicks are right there about as
fresh as it gets you're gonna turn some
heads with these plus when the party
strikes you just hit a button people are
gonna be blown away it's almost a
perfect fit as well there we go
kaboom
the boss man he always has is he always
has his feet up on the desk let's get
this app installed most importantly
let's see whether or not we can get a
pizza on its way here because that's
what these things are all about so did a
little bit of research and it turns out
that these sneakers are super limited
there's only 64 pairs on the planet and
they are handmade by the shoe surgeon in
LA so these are legit sneakers beyond
the tech that's inside now it uses
Bluetooth to connect to your phone
through a special app the pipe ops app
this is not the stock Pizza Hut app
you're going to have a Pizza Hut account
tied to these sneakers so that they know
where to deliver your favorite order now
it's gonna use location data GPS data to
understand your location that's wild you
following this jack and the reason that
there's only 64 pairs is in celebration
of March Madness as you know 64 teams in
the tournament sixty four pairs of
exclusive sneakers press and hold the PI
Tops button to pair with your phone as
we take a moment this button oh now you
can pick your regular default order so
it could be super supreme original pen
it could be pepperoni cheese it's up to
you you save that as your default and
then the double tap brings the pizza to
you I'm fired up so is Jack the man is
hungry
he's pretty generic he likes pepperoni
is it pepperoni for you alright so let's
go ahead and save that as a default so
let's go ahead here we go let's click
the button a couple times and see what
happens
ah that is cool the way they did that
all right so you get a notification on
your phone immediately which asks you to
confirm your order a large hand-tossed
pepperoni lover's pizza and boom just
like that I didn't even put my address
in but it
capable of using the geolocation to nail
it which it has and just like that in
about 30 minutes I'm going to be eating
some pepperoni you might think this is a
bit of a gimmick with the shoes but in
reality what this is illustrating is
kind of the smart functionality and
capabilities of ordering pizza a new
high-tech ways so it could be these
sneakers it could be Amazon Alexa but
the point they're trying to make here is
you don't need to pick up the phone
anymore you tech-heads can find a
different way a more efficient way of
getting your pizza delivered let's wait
for that doorbell to ring and just like
that oh my goodness
pepperoni pan pizza let me give it a
shot real quick oh my goodness
rut mmm huh you never thought you'd see
the day pizza
sneakers pizza that came from sneakers
technology's a beautiful thing now leave
me alone I might get to this pizza</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
