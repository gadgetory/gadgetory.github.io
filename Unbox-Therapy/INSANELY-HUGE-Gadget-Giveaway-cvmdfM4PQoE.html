had a chance to sit down and get us
going on this giveaway that it seems
like I've been talking about for a while
I asked you guys in the last giveaway
announcement video what you wanted to
see if you wanted to see one single
large item be given away or if you
wanted to see a package of multiple
items from around the office things that
I've unboxed be given away now the
overwhelming decision in the comments
section of that video was that you
wanted to see a package but I did read a
couple of other comments saying that
people also wanted to see multiple
packages because they wanted a better
shot at winning so I said you know what
I can do that I'll put together two
different packages of items that I've
got here and that way you guys have a
two chances instead of one now the way
I'm going to work it is that the first
giveaway for package number one which
I'm about to get to announcing right now
