another video and my eternal hunt for
cool things on Amazon continues this guy
here is called the Stan's multifunction
stand slash tripod for your iPhone it
uses the Lightning port as a basis for a
quick release on and off functionality
it does some other cool things too it's
even got a bottle opener on it because
you might get thirsty thirsty right now
not only will it let you take better
pictures but it also works as a little
mini stand for watching video and
whatnot you guys have been asking for
more affordable cool items and they're
out there like I said before I'm on the
hunt hopefully this is one of them I'm
not really a manual it's more of a card
explaining what's going on and this is
for the Lightning adapter interesting
well so that's pretty solid made out of
metal oh like oh oh right just like so
sweet now you're just like what are you
doing you're recording video look at
that now you're watching now you're
eating lunch you got this little pocket
stand YouTube videos just got a lot more
comfy if you've got some camera apps
with more functionality you can do some
cool things like longer exposures for
example now this part here is
interesting I guess what happens I see
what happens it clips on to that portion
and then you run your cable through here
let's see how this guy goes alright wow
that's a pretty solid fit in there
anyway that's kind of the idea
the other end goes on here like this am
i doing that the right way there we go
yeah you can see where it lines up user
error there I mean it works if that's
what you're you're hoping for honestly I
kind of feel like I like this thing more
in landscape mode and if you've got this
like say besides your bed or something
and just sits there like that it'll not
only keep your cable your charge cable
on the table but also you just get to
bed you do that and now you have an
alarm clock unless I'm doing this whole
thing wrong which I just discovered I am
it goes like that
I'm doing up I was doing the whole thing
wrong that's the way it goes that's
that's the way I like it
it me needs a ball head so you can
really pivot it Jack you're picking that
up alright
photo boom perfect plus the bottle
opener
what if you just want to have a classic
okay not the greatest bottle opener I've
ever seen or maybe it's just it gets the
job done right now everyone's saying
sponsored by coca-cola not yet if you're
mr. Koch give me a ring holding hand
