the second episode of deal therapy we
started this last week and the response
was amazing so we're gonna make it a
regular thing here on the channel I'm
constantly browsing the web for the best
deals in tech electronics and other
things in general and so I decided hey
let's put this show together and share
some of those deals with you guys you
guys don't need to hear it though you
heard all about the explanation on the
last episode today's deals are amazing
probably better than last week's so pay
attention something to note most of
these deals are available for limited
time so make sure to click on the links
down below to check if that deal is
still available while you're watching
this most of them are one or two days
only so hurry up and click on the
description and check out those links so
the first dealer today is the sony MDR
XB 600 headphones you guys know I'm a
huge fan of the xB series from Sony
these ones are the new incarnation of my
model that I use which is the XP 500 so
this is the newer version and they're on
sale today for 3999 the regular price is
a hundred bucks so a major savings this
is one of those deals that is one day
only this will be over tomorrow so if
you're watching this hurry up and click
the link down below to get in on this
deal on the XB 600 s from sony the next
deal is a gaming deal actually there's a
few gaming deals today this one is from
Best Buy and it is a 12-month gold
membership to xbox live now this
normally retails for 59 99 but in this
case you can pick it up for 34 99 so a
great deal for anybody looking to get
their xbox live membership renewed the
next is also another gaming deal this is
call of duty black ops 2 most you guys
know about a lot you guys already have
it but for those of you that don't or
need another copy it's on sale for ps3
and xbox 360 right now for 3999 of
course the retail price the regular
price like any other game is 60 bucks so
pretty good savings there as well halo 4
is also on sale but it's even a little
bit less it's going to be Third
499 down from the retail of 60 bucks so
some great gaming deals today that are
definitely worth checking out as I
mentioned a few minutes ago all the
links that you need are down below the
next deal is on a TV it would be a
perfect little gaming TV for that matter
it's a sharp 40-inch LED with 1080p
available this is a two-day deal at Best
Buy and it's available for 370 999 that
is down from 450 so 40 inch tvs have
come way down in price and it's a good
size for gaming on because you know
really big screens you have to look
around a lot move your head a lot also
something I've noticed in the past sharp
screens have been good in terms of input
lag so that makes them pretty good
gaming panels so definitely check this
one out it once again is 370 999 the
next deal or it's actually not a deal
just a cool product that i found on
thinkgeek com it's the mini brew coffee
mug and it is a french press single cup
brewing device so you can actually you
know put your fresh grounds into this
cup press them down and drink directly
from the same device so you don't have
to be cleaning you know a french press
as well as a mug so if you like fresh
coffee but you want to make it one cup
at a time you should definitely check
out this mini grew on thinkgeek that
link is down below as well the last deal
of the day is actually on this lens that
I'm speaking into that you're watching
me on right now it is of course you can
an EFS 10 to 22 millimeter lens we shoot
a ton of stuff here in the unbox therapy
studio on this particular lens and it's
available today are probably for a
little bit longer than just today on
amazon for a whopping six hundred and
seventy-eight dollars that's way down
from retail it's it's listed as high as
14 hundred dollars i paid around a
thousand but you can get it today for
678 bucks it's a super wide angle
perspective which i'm a big fan of so if
you're into making videos or you want
some wide angle photography capability
this is definitely a good lens to look
at and of course like everything else
