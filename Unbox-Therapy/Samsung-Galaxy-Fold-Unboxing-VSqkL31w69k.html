got a special package today he pulled
some strings would you look at this oh
my goodness
galaxy F oh l D I mean this is highly
anticipated let's be honest this is the
one people have been waiting for I've
been waiting for myself I talked about
this thing a lot and now it's here it's
in front of me this is a hole this is a
leap in a completely different direction
the slender phone and then the flip out
scenario into an almost tablet like
experience how's it gonna work how's it
gonna function I don't know what better
way to find out than to jump in the box
get the hands-on experience slide this
out okay here we go it's the box in the
box there's a number of combinations you
can get this one in front of me silver
with space silver hinge okay oh it's got
the galaxy buds inside okay we got the
galaxy buds now this device will feature
the wireless charge sharing you'll be
able to drop this guy on to the galaxy
fold and charge this up right from the
device the fast charge power brick
type-c cable to keep the charged up and
the interchangeable ear tips for those
galaxy buds that I mentioned now also in
here there is this little adapter that's
for transferring your data over to the
new device okay but this is what you
care about this is what you're
interested in myself included look at
how slim that is already oh oh this of
course is the full-fledged galaxy fold
right there that's wild
real quick what Jack you never saw that
before
let's be honest here okay that's your
phone or it's your tablet
what we're talking here about OLED if
you didn't have OLED you're not folding
displays you can see on the front here
two forward-facing cameras we flip it
around to the back you see a triple
camera setup in this location so we've
got a wide ultra wide and telephoto this
is already such an unusual experience
with bold in it with both hands now
we're catching our first glimpse
actually at the keyboard and you see you
get this split layout there's a lot of
different ways to unlock this device
face recognition fingerprint pattern pin
password let's give the fingerprint a go
here so fingerprint scanner right there
jack it's a side mounted scanner
reminiscent of the galaxy s 10 e scan in
my thumbprint alright I think we're in
it's booted up this is your that's what
you're looking at there now you can see
the the butterfly wings or the wings do
they flap they fold so does the device
of course close it up for a minute so
this is a four point six inch display it
has nothing to do with the inside
display this is a supplementary display
on the outside it's seven twenty by
sixteen eighty now this is gonna be
useful of course for quick interactions
phone calls things along these lines you
just need to pop this up to your face
and it's very slender actually I mean
it's got weight to it as you'd expect
there's a lot of components at play it's
really interesting now there must be
some kind of magnet at the end of it
because when you get to the full clothes
it sits there let's say I've got you
tube open and now I'm like alright I
need a bigger display to navigate
YouTube I want to watch some videos you
just flip this open and it's it's quick
it's actually quick you're scrolling
around you're looking for a video to
watch if you actually get into a video
let's say click on this video playing
here flip it open
it doesn't skit it's kind of like iPad
Mini territory scale-wise
so it's 21 52 by 1536 at 7.3 inches so
it really is it's like a small tablet
experience to transition into a real
immersive video viewing experience
you just flip it open these devices have
become such major consumption devices
for us
you saw screens scale up over time on
smartphones back in a day when the
original note series came out everyone's
like that's crazy we were like no one's
gonna put that in their pocket and then
inevitably people did
now it's commonplace to see somebody
sitting on a couch with their smartphone
sort of cranked up in front of their
eyeballs in an uncomfortable position
but now when you go all the way to this
form factor right here and you're kind
of in small tablet territory that entire
experience has become less uncomfortable
like a YouTube session on this thing is
a totally different proposition than a
YouTube session on a smartphone as it
currently stands but as far as I can
tell I mean this is the biggest video
watching experience I think I've ever
had on a phone it's super easy to hold
like you're holding it like this this is
real life now guys this is what its
gonna be on the street on the bench in
the public transit it's a whole new
thing and you're gonna notice it from a
mile away I think this thing has fully
engaged the sci-fi lue right now but
what we're looking at is the convergence
of these various devices into a singular
device can this thing get to a point
where it can legitimately put replace
the laptop as well this is a real future
I'm convinced now keep in mind like we
said before you close it down it's like
closing a laptop it's ready for the
pocket and it's slender and it's real
fancy looking this is a double tap to
wake this up on the outside like this
but then over here to unlock it and then
this is your screen off switch and
fingerprints unlock when I'm out on the
street when I'm out just living life
how often do I transition between the
two modes I would think I could get by
through a lot of scenarios in the
clamshell you're surfing the web you
know you hit up Twitter you're just it's
a whole different thing going on
definitely expensive we should talk
about that means $1,980 well USD it is a
powerhouse though 12 gigs of ram in this
monster Snapdragon a 55 it's got a 4380
battery I really think it's the future
it's crazy to say I didn't know I was
gonna say it did some futuristic stuff I
don't the 12 year old me like holy moly
man like just when you thought things
were getting stagnant and now that's
real now that's a thing that's an actual
that's a thing going on now I do need to
say it's very important okay I do need
to say you can see where the display
folds over it depends on the background
as well I made videos on this I expected
this to be the case and the truth is I
don't care I don't care at all
they said magic ranting and raving aside
here it still got a camera hole the
setup is very similar to the s10 you
have the typical wide you have the ultra
wide and of course you also have the
telephoto
here's telephoto first typical wide and
in my favorite ultra wide hold my
goodness gracious
so that's your ultra wide image there's
your wide and there's your telephoto and
as you can see you can compose just like
this just like you normally would
lot to grip onto there so you can see in
landscape I can go ultra wide quick
standard wide quick telephoto quick and
then I can fold it out and I'm still in
the camera module interestingly enough
the same cannot be said for the
front-facing cameras because of course
we have two units here and a single unit
on the outside and we
selphie a slightly wider image and a
slightly closer one very nice Wow Jack
that's the the biggest selfie we've ever
analyzed here in a channel that's a nice
that's a contrast so that's a 10
megapixel camera now on the inside you
have the two camera modules there you
have a 10 megapixel and an 8 megapixel
and we'll try these ones out as well
we'll see if we get any difference so
performance I'd say is similar on the
outside camera and the inside camera now
what about the speakers so first I guess
we'll test it for dialogue with a
typical YouTube video from Apple laptops
from Mac books of all sorts legit
stereos loud you have a speaker unit in
this location over here and as well as
on the other side over here so legit
stereo sound
that's convenient cuz then you can
charge other things up with this brick
in your bag let's try some music real
quick it's got a crispy sound it's
detailed and you got sound out of the
left and right side you actually have
legit stereo separation which is which
is so unusual in a smartphone space I
mean that's really impressive I'm happy
with that what can we really say about
it you come into this thing you want to
be skeptical as your job to be skeptical
and and of course I can find a way to do
that because of the price it's still
very expensive it's almost 2 grand and I
realized not everybody's gonna be able
to to splurge and spend two G's but you
want to frame it a little bit
differently you can say what if that
individual is in the market for a tablet
and a phone I gotta say just as a tech
fan though I mean it's so refreshing to
look at something that's so different a
completely different take on something
that you're so used to and then in the
other departments where it just has to
be a phone first and foremost it's kind
of like a repackaged as 10 which I mean
you already know one of the best phones
out there you guys have watched enough
videos to know it's coming through right
the excitement level is coming through
or it's not and
and this is legit this is the real thing
all right let's look at the other colors
oh my goodness gracious this is bananas
oh my God look at this oh-ho that is the
blue which kind of has like a cool
purplish hue to it with the gold hinge
this one is gold on gold or is that
green that's an emerald kind of green
greenish gold with the gold hinge that's
black with the black hinge what do they
call it as well green Martian green okay
that's Martian green would be silver
hinge Astro blue with the silver hinge
dark silver oh my goodness gracious
kind of like outfitting the interior of
a luxury car you don't just pick the
color anymore you pick the color you
pick the hinge what a time to be alive
ladies and gentlemen our smartphones are
folding now like just stop and think
about the engineering involved all the
people involved when you start to
imagine then the appreciation comes in
that ultimately we get to experience
stuff like this because all those people
going after that ambition that's always
been exciting and its products like this
that bring me back to that excitement
from day one it's the reason this
channel exists and it's the reason that
it's started that's the Samsung Galaxy
fold</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
