returned home from a trip down to
Florida a little vacation and something
that was on my list that I wanted to
unbox it's a pretty unusual pretty
strange this is the big box meal from
Taco Bell and I also picked up the
limited edition mountain dew baja blast
or whatever it's called but this is not
just your standard big box meal it has
something inside of it that I've never
tried before which is the Doritos taco
this taco never launched in Canada I'm
based out of Toronto never had the
chance to try one on my travels to the
US so I decided to take this opportunity
to share the experience with you guys so
here it is in all its glory
it is the Doritos taco but I'm not going
to bite into it just yet I do have to
cover the other items inside of this
particular big box meal as you can see
it has a special wrapper on it so you
don't get your hands all messed up with
the Doritos seasoning but this big box
meal does include a couple other items
as I just mentioned you've also got the
standard taco standard hard shell taco
which I'm a fan of nothing wrong with
the standard edition in this case and
you're going to get I believe it's a
seven-layer burrito as well so this is
this is a great value right here pricing
and availability down in the description
now I'm just kidding but anyways this
video is all about the Doritos taco that
I never have tried before and as you can
see I'm messing it up already I'm not
supposed to touch the shell cuz I'm
going to mess up my hands but anyways
here it is first bite this is legitimate
reaction right here as you can see I'm
happy like a school kid but I'm gonna go
deep in thought for a moment here and
let you guys know what I think no
actually it was really good surprisingly
good didn't expect it to be I probably
couldn't eat a bunch of them but an
interesting flavor definitely worth
trying out let's wash it back with the
limited edition mountain dew anyway guys
that's been a quick unboxing of
something unusual just mixing it up for
you guys on the channel alright catch on
the next one</div></body></html>
