Kickstarter I had my eye on it for a
long time right and recently I'm
browsing around Amazon and there it is
sitting there it's this thing here it's
the amp emove wearable motion charger
normally the agenda is to like uncover
the coolest stuff that's out there but
every so often I bump into a product and
I see a terrible rating this is one of
those products worst product ever and
doesn't do what it says it's supposed to
charge your phone and apparently the
fuck the phone goes down in battery life
committed 61% of the reviews are
one-star 61% you'd have to be training
for the Olympics for this to charge your
phone any significant amount are you
kidding me how's this pure scam of a
product legally on sale do not buy this
I saw all this and I'm like geez I got a
responsibility here warn you about what
to stay away from I think you guys
respect me and I get the sense that this
is one of those moments right now nope
I'm gonna reserve my evaluation this guy
says he ran a 5k practice and after
plugging his iPhone 6 into this he
lowered his battery by two percent the
title to that review is so sad
POS you know what that means Jack P dot
o dot s I don't need to say the words I
don't think I've ever had a product on
this table with such terrible reviews on
Amazon let's first see what they're
saying we all had the same problem our
phones would die before the end of the
day so many people have this problem one
hour of exercise equals five hours of
smartphone battery life this thing
claims to be able to generate power for
your smartphone based on your own
physical movements so you strap this to
you you go about your day you exercise
you do various activities and that
movement translates into electricity for
your smartphone
sells broken most likely sir create
clean energy depends how clean you are
no I what am i generate up to five hours
of standby smartphone battery life per
day with one hour of exercise it stores
a full smartphone charge
apparently the battery on the inside
here is around 1800 milliamp hours meet
the world's smallest wearable motion
charger hold the button down and shake
and you're gonna see that blue LED it
lights up is that impressive probably
not on its own alright anywhere you put
it only extra power source you'll ever
need make your own power no your power
this is the device it's quite heavy here
we go charging it up micro USB port here
if you want to charge this up the
traditional way by plugging it into the
wall oh the indicator is showing a
little bit of battery life that's a good
thing there we go like that like that
depending on how skilled you are at this
particular motion your results may vary
geez man this is insane I already know
it's insane I haven't even tried to
charge anything and I recognize how
insane this is how do they expect you to
put this on your arm there's an armband
we don't have it in this kit here
there's an accessory kit that you buy
extra to go with this okay look at that
charging up so it's functioning right
now oh we're already down to one oh now
we have none whoa those two bars wink
quick it's done already that was two
bars of battery what now the real
question is are we gonna be able to
generate some juice just by the movement
of the amp II it's charging okay the
charge is gone I stopped moving the amp
you come on auntie
nothing poorly okay there that's a lot
of shaking let's see how long before it
turns off there it's gone stop charging
if this is strapped to your arm or leg
maybe like boom boom boom boom you get
the charge icon for a few seconds
I think the claim that three weeks for
an active user to fully charge this
thing would only hold true if you're
training for the longest marathon in the
world and you can dedicate your every
waking day and night to running for your
life they will say your device is
probably faulty and try to send you
another one don't bother just get a
refund buy a real battery bank not this
turd
here that Jack it's just not enough
juice if you're getting a few seconds of
lightning bolt icon in exchange for
minutes of shaking this thing rigorously
it's just not gonna work it's amazing
how in this case concept on its own even
in the absence of execution was exciting
enough to justify the manufacturing of
this product you want to kind of
encourage those people to go after that
thing but this is not that thing it
seems like this is more of a dream than
an actual product I have a hard time
believing anybody's gonna pick this up
and be satisfied with it I think Mosley
would be disappointed and wish you saved
a few bucks and got yourself the power
bank alright it's just ain't cutting it
