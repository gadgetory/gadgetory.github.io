Connor cord hello hello um

therapy how's it going my friend

it's going crazy here let's get your
quit your comment or question in real
quick do you have a question or you want
to make a comment on the iPhone 7 that's
coming out or the exploding battery on
the note 7 question or comment um I feel
for my color okay okay it's cool to know
I probably right yes it is it's very
cool everybody's pumped up now do you is
this something that you're gonna want to
I are you what what feature you excited
about is it the dual camera lenses by
sorry say that again by oh you would
definitely buy okay I'm gonna let you go
because I have to turn off call waiting
on this thing because we are getting
some crazy call waiting here thank you
for calling in
okay more phone calls in a moment folks
I got to turn off call waiting here real
quick and I'm on this this phone here is
on an iPhone so we're gonna have to find
a way here to whoa
we're gonna have the final way here to
turn off call waiting because a crazy
number of calls are coming through now
let's just see here how to do that on an
iPhone before this iPhone completely
breaks okay settings this is something I
should have been prepared for obviously
but it's imperative of course to turn
off call waiting when you're doing
something like this right
here we go our general phone okay I'm
gonna have this in a moment
alright so one second please stop
calling me here
call waiting hurry up okay sweet call
waiting is off okay cool so we're not
gonna get beat like crazy when the next
phone call comes through so go ahead
call in with your next line let's see
what's going on let's see who's here
hello okay this is Lou hang on you just
for some reason you're not going through
bluetooth anymore let me just see
something are you still on the line
my goodness okay we gotta just oh did we
break we may have broken you know what I
think is breaking this iPhone is um I
think this iPhone is busted
from FaceTime it's FaceTime that is
breaking this thing here let's try again
hello please lay off the FaceTime let's
just go with old-school calls here
please oh this is busted this is busted
we may need to do a quick switch a SIM
card switch here into another device
because I think FaceTime has broke has
broken the poor iPhone I'm going to show
you the bottom I'm not gonna show you
the top of the display but if I show you
the bottom here you can see that I can't
ex this out I can't get out because of
FaceTime FaceTime broke the show so I'm
going to extract this I'm going to
extract this uh SIM card here put into a
different device something of course
that doesn't have wow the phone is so
hot right now
Oh taking calls like crazy okay I'm
going to take this SIM card out now a
lot of people recommended that I use the
burner app man the burner app was really
finicky I was trying to bombard it with
some calls and having some problems so
it's it's a really unique set of
circumstances here when it comes to you
know when it comes to doing these mega
calling shows because it's not like a
usual application where you know where
you're getting a small volume of calls
this is an enormous volume of calls that
you're going to get in here and so I
guess it should be expected that your
average device isn't really going to
work alright so I got to get a different
phone actually I was going to just put
it in my phone and I realized how much
of a nightmare that would be for my
notifications my notifications would be
destroyed
give me one moment I'll be back I
promise you okay one second I need
another device once
okay folks I know you're upset and I
appreciate that I've got the ZTE axon
over here and we're going to have to
make do right now now hopefully with the
absence of FaceTime oh hello there
mister look at that look at that beauty
um with the absence of FaceTime I think
we should be golden now oh one thing I
wanted to mention based on the last time
that I did this is that a lot of people
were upset that they actually missed the
broadcast
I'm guessing phone calls are going to
come in like crazy right here a lot of
people were upset that they missed the
broadcast yeah
and so my recommendation here is to turn
on your notifications for my channel
that little bell on mobile then you
won't miss any of these broadcasts
you'll be first to know and you can get
a shot at calling in and having a chat
so this says no service here let's just
see what's going on don't worry we're
gonna be taking phone calls again in a
moment the iPhone terrible idea you know
why because FaceTime pretty much broke
the it pretty much broke the device that
you guys have were requesting FaceTime
you shut this thing down it was
completely impossible to answer it now
as my father should have had I should
have also had the I should have also had
the call waiting turned off and that is
the first thing I'm going to do on this
phone right here see we're already
getting calls coming in here okay so
first things first ha and you guys are
probably going to kill me with the text
and everything as well so let's just get
this set to where you add I'm going to
do no.not airplane I just want to do not
disturb where are you at do not disturb
okay hold up hold up on a phone call for
a minute
haha this is so insane uh do not disturb
they got this slightly different uh
layout over here
don't call me yet don't call me yet
please don't keep calling me yet
frequently used sounds and vibration
do not disturb I don't want to do this
update right now okay always do not
disturb is now on okay next thing is to
turn off call waiting because that
becomes a major headache as you
experienced on the last one or ie I hope
you guys can hear me okay I don't have
any kind of special microphone I'm just
speaking into the phone uh you know what
let me know on Twitter if you guys can
hear me properly at all okay so next up
is what was I doing I was a turning off
call waiting now that's not a thing that
I normally do but where is everyone here
let's see apologies guys I'm going to
get this down I'm going to get a system
here so we know what works and what
doesn't work but you really have to do
this a few times to figure out the best
way if you know what I'm saying so it
should be call settings somewhere here
mhm course call settings where you at
here we go
this period trust we were taking phone
calls and I told you we're going to be
talking about the exploding note seven
and the upcoming iPhone seven that's our
agenda for today if we have one if we
ever get there but I I'm telling you I'm
trying my best here
call waiting is in the call settings but
where the hell are the call settings
here sounds in vibration
alright let's just take a call let's
just take a call and see maybe the
call-waiting won't be so bothersome
hello hello anybody there hello hello
hello
no that person hung up they didn't
expect me to answer it ha yeah well
trust me if you call me I'm gonna answer
it all right here we go hello who they
hung up - maybe we broke this device as
well
maybe it wasn't meant to be folks ok
hopefully this person sticks around
holy smokes hello hey we got a winning
color today you have won an
all-expenses-paid cruise to the Bahamas
how's it going man what happening yeah
man listen the calls were coming in like
hot fire they were coming in one after
the other yours made it through I was
trying to turn off all these different
features because I had it set up on the
iPhone at first and what's getting
absolutely bombarded with FaceTime
request the whole phone was catching
fire I had to shut that down so now
we're on a ZTE and things look to be
working working properly hey I was
watching you know I had my MacBook
already my phone ready my Google Voice
ready all they're all battling it out
one shot it haha well you you sound like
a professional my friend I'm proud of
you you sound like a proper unbox
therapy viewer videos good fan here's a
question for you what do you think about
the new MacBook that's coming in a
couple months give any a thoughts on
that oh well I'm definitely going to
pick it up I have a you know I'm a
MacBook owner for a long time now
currently in in my inventory of MacBooks
I've got a MacBook Pro I have loved them
the 12-inch MacBook I have the old 11
inch MacBook Air and I got an even got
an old-school MacBook Pro that I put
like my own SSDs into so I pretty much
get every generation of the MacBook and
MacBook Pro so this new one I mean I saw
the rumored OLED display panel on there
and and that looks that looks pretty
badass I mean to be honest with you the
the the current design is just a little
bit stale I mean it's been out for a
long time so it'll be interesting to see
how they take a different approach at
the pro and maybe make it thinner maybe
make it a little bit more portable so I
mean you can bet your boots that I'll be
picking one up oh that's nice look like
over-the-air any problem um you know
it's so hard to say if you can only have
one if I could only have one I would
definitely take the pro just because I
do so much video work and having the
extra horsepower is just super helpful
when you need it but that said if I
didn't work in video and it was strictly
for productivity it might be a little
bit overkill so it really depends on the
usage scenario right and and and for
some people that are that are just
typing emails and using it as a student
they might not just be neat they might
not need to spend the extra cash and
carry the extra weight of the pro but
for me it would be the pro all right do
you know I don't want to hold back other
people that are waiting patiently for
the answer no worries dude thanks for
calling in okay so cool I guess call
waiting it looks like call waiting was
off by default there because we didn't
get interrupted during the phone call
which I appreciate you that or we have
another broken phone no we don't okay
cool so it turns out that it looks like
the ZTE is the way to go
on our call in phone for the calling
show hello
hey hey what is happening my panel you
got through oh my god rush to the phone
I saw the notification I opened up my
laptop it's amazing it's it's hard to
believe here here we are after all this
time of chatting to one another just
like a couple of buddies this is gonna
be weird I got your video playing right
here that is weird it's like some kind
of weird inception or something that guy
that was the last guy yeah so there's a
bit of a delay it's a very slim delay
but it's a but it's a very cool new app
new function within the app it's being
sort of rolled out in a very slow way to
test it out but this is one of the
biggest experiments so far so this
entire broadcast is actually running off
of a note 7 right now which has now
which hasn't exploded yet and and I'm
hoping to do this frequently I think
it's a really cool way to connect with
people and show the world that that you
guys are you guys are real you know
you're not just like some some viewcount
or something like that but anyways today
we're talking about and I at least
wanted to have some sort of a topic here
so your choice would you rather give
your opinion on the exploding note 7
battery or the upcoming iPhone 7
which which is more spicy for you
probably the iPhone 7 ok all right so
let me know let me know your thoughts
what do you what do you think about it
will you buy it are you excited are you
lukewarm what are your thoughts I
personally will not buy it I've seen
everything awful crow you know I watched
him a lot I've seen his videos about it
said that Tiger weeks were good compared
to like the changes from like a 5 to the
6 so the 6 because is not going to be
you know they were better than the
changes from the success to the 7 right
and I personally don't buy every single
iPhone that comes out I am except those
the newest like other success from the
four actually that was a last one that I
had so if the five shades altogether
right the headphone jack is there a you
know if there's a confirmed thing about
what was going to come in the box I
don't know the last honestly the last
rumor that I saw said that the somebody
had a picture of a box which had the the
contents and
it looks like there's going to be at
least according to that there's going to
be an adapter for a 3.5 millimeter and
then and then there also might be a
there also might be some your pods that
use the Lightning port alright so I
don't know if either of those things
sort of solved the issue because as you
know with adapters it's the kind of
situation where they're never with you
when you need them to be you know like
you're on an airplane and you're like
damn I left that adapter at home so
there there goes using this this
last-minute headset but I think I think
the agenda here is to kind of push
individuals into using wireless
headphones and it's obvious because it's
obvious to see what they're doing but I
think you know I think a lot of people
are going to share your sentiment but at
the same time it's like I think so many
people are just used to always getting
the new iPhone and you know apples going
to show off some magical thing regarding
the dual lens system and I think it's
going to it's going to get those same
individuals hyped up but I agree with
you I really don't fit I really don't
think that at this point in time there's
much of a need for your average person
your average user of technology to be
upgrading to every single device it's
kind of a it's kind of ridiculous from
an economic perspective considering how
good so many phones are now yeah and
I've I've always you know I've been
growing up with iPhones the my first
smartphone was an iPhone and I've never
had a smartphone over an iPhone but I've
seen your your acts on videos and other
ones over you you just gets iPhone
smartphones IQ mm-hmm and they look
really nice I've always booked mark them
and you know save them so maybe if this
one breaks we'll get a yeah it's
honestly honestly dude I think I feel
like the new the new optimal price point
for smart phones it is somewhere in like
the three to four hundred dollar range
what you're like value value for money
in that range right now
is absolutely insane like I mean the
phone that we're talking on right now
right now is the new axon and it's like
yeah and it's like man you look at the
complete package and you start to wonder
how it is that the market leaders are
selling their products at twice the
price somebody's making money and
somebody isn't you know I mean like like
it's it seems pretty obvious but yeah
and needless to say obviously these new
startup companies aren't going to not
startups but like new to the North
American market they're not going to
have the advantages of the other guys
from a marketing perspective so your
average person on the street is not
isn't even going to know what these
devices are but for somebody who
somebody who's more of an enthusiast
there's certainly a value to be had in a
lot of the cool the emerging budget
Android devices that are out there ya
know yeah you're not gonna see one in
the wild anyways dude I love the phone
call I appreciate it you brought the
heat today you you you were right on the
subject matter educated that's what it's
about I totally appreciate it and thanks
tech yeah thank you very much and we're
gonna see we're gonna see you on the
next call in okay all right later dude
La Caleta how about that what about this
caller bringing the heat you know what I
mean you never expected that let me just
see I just want to ask people on Twitter
real quick from an audio perspective can
you guys hear the caller well can you
can you hear the caller hello I love the
way that you introduced that you were
just like all casual just like you were
calling up your buddy like oh oh hey Lou
how's it going like it wasn't hard to
get through or anything no waiting my
friend actually planted you're saying we
look live right now you're live I know
and it's crazy it's wild is it why does
it why does it feel so weird to be
connecting like this no clue no clue
even though I videos but I know I'm
gonna be honest no but
um oh I've been here morning but that's
a Ferrante I've been whipping my do and
it is not doing he taught me how to live
he taught me how to love you need you
need some very serious self-examination
of course you know you need I think you
need I think you need some meditation
yeah it's like it's like brick it's a
breathing thing you know what I mean
it's like it's like let's do it together
okay three two one I want I want like up
a deep inhale and we're gonna exhale
together okay three two one hold it for
a minute and then let it out ah there
you go my friend you're cured
alright thanks for the phone call
thanks for the phone call uh what uh
what oh what a wild situation you got
every day people on the lines just
reaching out to the audience we've been
live for 26 minutes when is the last
time we hung out for 26 minutes all
right here we go
got what we got another one and another
one and another one they turned down
turned down the show in the background
okay yeah yeah hey man what's going on
haha it's it is wonderful to speak to
you today and this uh Saturday afternoon
how are you doing how are you uh also
I'm also having a good time I'm sitting
here I'm talking to people I'm asking
people questions you know what we've
been talking about specifically is a
technology we were talking about thee
nobody so far as has talked about the
exploding note seven have you heard of
the exploding galaxy note seven no okay
well this is the issue alright so the
new note seven came out recently and
there's been some reports somewhere in a
neighborhood of like 35 reports at least
that's what Samsung saying is of the new
note 7 phone exploding the battery
Catching Fire is this something that's
conservative is this something that
concerns you what about the people who
do are you worried for them all right
well they issued a recall so they're
asking for people to send back their
note 7s in exchange for a new one so at
least that's the good part
yeah um okay so let me ask you one more
thing are you what kind of phone do you
use right now do you know which model no
ok well it's worth at least it's working
for this phone call right here I'm happy
about that
Oh Google Hangouts ok that works that's
healthy um let me uh let me uh let me
ask you do you have any questions for me
before I go onto the next phone call ok
okay thanks for the phone call my friend
talk to you next time how about the ZTE
you guys aren't telling me whether or
not it sounds ok
the caller volume audio is good ok thank
you very much Twitter folks for saying
that because I've been thinking should I
put it through a Bluetooth speaker
something along those lines to improve
the quality but this thing does have
pretty decent speakers and they are
firing upwards so maybe maybe that's
helpful ok oh here we go
alright as soon as I unlock the phone is
another call hello hello yes
uh-huh it's who you called my friend
this is who you called oh you think the
Raiders gonna win this game
yeah ha ha ha I'm not watching the game
uh to be honest I haven't followed too
much football but you're asking about
the Raiders yeah the Oakland Raiders at
uh that's it used to be my favorite team
as a kid actually um cool do they play
I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you
the insight right now who are the who
are they playing right who are they who
are they up against oh the Seahawks okay
and how did that go
okay all right well listen man I don't
Amy I have coffee go ahead I'll get the
Chicago Bears I don't think that's much
of an achievement is it I hate the
Chicago Bears yeah okay I don't know
make a combo win against the pictures
okay all right so let me let me let me
ask you this since we're on the topic of
the Oakland Raiders are you are you
prepared to go out on a limb in front of
almost 30,000 people and and say that
they're going to be the next champions
yeah whoa all right without hesitation
thank you my friend for bringing um for
bringing football into the show today
that's what we were missing
thanks for calling all right well he hit
me on the subject matter that I haven't
been following I definitely will as we
get closer to the elimination games as
you know here we go all right
hello they turned down to a volume in
the background hello hello hello how are
you doing what's your name
oh hello oh my god oh my god oh yeah
dude you got to turn down the background
sorry sorry I'm just over here right now
this isn't good you're you're in here
dude you got to turn that volume down
and there's no background okay all right
so how you doing what's your name Eric
pa rt gave like there for the TV oh yeah
Terral tarik tarik I've heard that name
before were you calling from I'm going
my out okay cool all right no I meant
like the put web part of the world
oh nice watching your video and I'm
talking for hours collecting yeah well
let's just let's focus on this
conversation this is a special moment in
our lives
oh yeah yeah all right so what part of
the world what part of the world are you
calling from what state are you in I'm
in Florida you know I reckon Oregon
lately
if it's crazy man no it was the
hurricane comin Eric yeah do is called
hurricane Harry mean and then it is like
dude it's so we have I saw a car before
like in my face so real that's happening
right now
yeah Wow all right oh yeah I see it
right here Hermine hurricane hear me oh
wow
brings heavy rains in a Carolinas
Florida coast battered by I feel like
we're CNN right now we're breaking the
news I would show you a video but I
can't right now
oh we lose him
do we own oh you're still in the air
okay let me ask you something while
you're sitting there surviving this
hurricane have you been do you have any
questions for me about that yeah I do
have a question actually I just want to
know like you're in a very special
position really you know how much you
know this and you have so many friends
and you have so many people that that
know you and they look up to you I mean
how does that
responsibilities how do you deal with
that and the hatred and all that all the
drama happening how do you feel with
that look how about Tareq bringing the
heat on the sentimental question right
now unbelievable um let me tell you I
don't think it's anything that you ever
really prepare for like honestly for the
most part I feel I feel a lot like the
same guy with the same perspective as
long before anybody was paying any
attention to what I was doing so I think
it's imperative for me to just stay in
that frame of mind that there's really
truly no difference from from somebody
who has millions of followers and and
somebody walking walking down the street
now obviously look but obviously there
is a functional difference if people are
stopping you and asking for photos and
stuff like that but but I feel like you
you turn into a bit of a weirdo if you
really strictly embrace that side of it
and forget your actual pre-existing
identity that was in place long before
that ever was the case so I try to do
this in my videos I try to do this when
I meet people I try to do it even when
I'm taking phone calls from people like
you I just try to bring you the realness
I try to bring you the guy who existed
before all that and I think so long as
so long as I remain focused on
protecting protecting that kind of
character I think that the whole
situation just remains a hell of a lot
healthier so I keep I also keep people
in my life that that bring you down a
few pegs like humble you you know people
who I stay connected to a lot of people
from back in the day I'm still friends
with a lot of people for example I went
to high school with and that it's a lot
healthier to maintain those
relationships with people who knew you
before anything special was even going
on yes 100% anything I've done you can
do my friend Wow
and I remember I've seen you like from
the first
your beginning days don't you used to do
like small unboxing videos and reviews
on little products and honestly you've
inspired so many people and I know that
hums cliche but I'm just take that in
okay all right dude yeah I honestly a
nothing cliche about it I mean maybe
it's been said before but it's
meaningful every time that I hear it
inspiration is a delicate thing and I'm
happy to contribute even if it's just in
a small way so appreciate the phone call
I appreciate the question
good luck with this storm I'm sure
you're gonna make it through my friend
thank you so much Lou and I help you
become more successful than you already
all right thank you so much thank you so
much dude all right so listen we're
gonna end it there I got to turn this
off before a million more phone calls
come in we're gonna end it there that
was a beautiful thing
I appreciate all of you those that
called in those that participated by
watching we're going to have a system
here right I'm going to give better
audio we're going to have a better
feedback I'm going to find a stream line
way of approaching this whole thing so I
don't need to run off camera halfway
through to to address that but we didn't
talk all that much about the exploding
the exploding note 7 or the upcoming
iPhone but I think we had a couple
meaningful conversations in there and
before I take off I just want to remind
you guys if you want your chance to call
in you want to participate live next
time just make sure to turn on that
notification button on your mobile app
there's a notification button on my
channel page it looks like a little bell
hit that button turn on notifications
because obviously if you're not here
live you got no shot at calling in and
hitting me with the hard questions buh
buh buh all right thank you very much
