around for something unique innovative a
combination type of device I happened
upon this thing you guys know I like
wireless charging and you also know that
I like beverages hot cold both I mean
it's kind of an important part of the
day here is a device from a company
called Nemoto no moto it's not cheap
for what it is it's about 70 bucks but
it's the only one of its kind that I
know of so anyhow let's check it out
let's see what this thing is all about
this is what the gadgets gonna look like
right there you see that
you'll warm your mug you keep your drink
hot you charge your phone you live your
life will tells me apparently it will
cool your drink as well
smart warmer and cooler oh smart cop
they gave me a cop the cup has a
metallic plate on the bottom Kirk you
should have known this dude and it's
also metallic on the inside food grade
aluminum alloy oh so this is gonna
transfer heat or cold better than just a
typical mug this is the power brick
that's a simple setup right there oh wow
that's substantial interesting look at
that reminiscent of PC a fan you might
have in your PC in your gaming setup
sort of but it is a qi wireless charger
this little guy is gonna sit there on
your desk maybe in the kitchen well I
mean wherever you want to put it
probably on your desk and then ah so
that guy fits on there perfectly the
metal plate transfers the heat or cold
up to the mug and then over here on the
side we're just gonna blam
just like that so let's get this plugged
in let's see how it operates got it
plugged in oh just notice there's an LED
it cycled through a few colors there it
was just in the center now first things
first as a wireless charger oh yeah
there you go okay cool so charging press
power button once to activate cooling
second time for heating oh oh it goes
red so it goes blue so never mind this
led up here the actual power switch goes
blue for cooling so it's on it's cold
right now lift oh it's cold wills give
me an update it's very important
apparently it can be any cup like you
could put any cup you want on there just
keep in mind the effectiveness is
in relationship to how much transmission
takes place through whatever material
that cup is made of metal is gonna work
best so keep that in mind by the way
that's a warm coca-cola special edition
also unbox therapy coca-cola you don't
even know that existed in a port in on
the cold function here just a little bit
cuz I want to give it a chance here now
typically what you would do in this
circumstance is you would have a cold
beverage already and you would want to
keep it cold so you would have a head
start but I'm curious with just the cold
element there and the cup and a warm
drink
how long to cool it down I'm gonna leave
that for a second okay so while there is
a on/off switch for the cooling and
heating the wireless charger on the
other hand it just works now there is a
fan in here by the way when it's either
heating or cooling in this case pushing
hot air out of the side oh the cup is
freezing okay let me let me give it I'm
gonna give it I'm gonna give it that's
chilled that's how long is that been two
to three minutes now keep in mind it's
just it's a little bit they can see on
the overheads just a little bit of coke
in there let's try and switch it over
now to the heating let's switch to the
heating and let's see how it works with
a regular mug I guess it just fits on
there like that you could use a regular
mug but again the amount of transmission
actually making it into your beverage or
cold making it into your beverage does
depend on the material of the cup that
you choose to use metal is gonna be the
best obviously that's why their mug is
made out of metal yeah I mean that's
nice that's hot coffee I'm gonna give
that a quick tap do not try this at home
caution hot surface don't do this I do
this so you don't have to do this oh
that that's hot okay it's kind of
amazing it's kind of cool it's unusual I
don't know I mean it's not the cheapest
wireless charger but what kind of a
wireless charger does this as well
you're gonna get some questions about
this if you have a crazy desk set up
with everything already on it all your
favorites and whatnot this could round
it out fitting okay quick update here I
just realized there's actually a fan
underneath the Qi wireless charger as
well that cools your device as it's
charging so it can't heat up too much
when it kicks on when you drop the
device down you got the hot drink the
cold drink the cold
own and all the juice Wow a
multi-function multifaceted wireless
charger and it's on Amazon you can pick
it up right now there's a link down in
the description this might be exactly
what you were looking for I don't know
maybe you have everything else on your
desk already and you want to step your
game up even further you want people to
walk by immediately jealous of your
setup because you're always charged and
your copy is never cold and your
coca-cola always is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
