another unboxing of a recently released
Google product this is the Nexus 7 just
got mine today it's packing an
incredibly high resolution display that
I'm excited to take a closer look at at
the time of filming this it is still
available on Amazon it hasn't sold out
like the chromecast which was the last
item I featured so if you want to check
out pricing and availability I'll put a
link down in the description but without
any more hesitation let's go ahead and
jump inside and do the unboxing so the
first thing you're going to notice if
you purchase a Nexus 7 is the bright box
that it comes in in my case I picked up
the 16 gigabyte version but it's also
available in a 32 gigabyte model as well
as an LTE flavor which is not available
yet but will be available shortly if you
need connectivity all the time now the
first thing you notice when you get
inside is just how nice this thing is to
hold its narrow making it really
comfortable to hold in one hand it has a
soft touch on the back let's talk about
the other items inside the box before we
get into the full details on the Nexus 7
you've got some paperwork telling you
how to get the device up and running as
well as a warranty and safety manual
that probably 1 to 5% of the audience
will read maybe not even that many I
don't even know you've also got a USB
cable and then a power brick those
things look pretty damn standard so
we'll push them to the side and look at
the Nexus 7 in more detail so as I
mentioned it is very comfortable to hold
in one hand that's courtesy of the
aspect ratio which in this case I
believe is 16 by 10 16 by 9 or 16 by 10
anyways not an iPad aspect ratio for
sure
now as I flip it over you can see that
all of the important stuff is basically
on the back you have your speaker on
this side as well as a microUSB port for
charging the Nexus logo is embedded in
the centre in a landscape kind of format
there's another speaker so that's stereo
speakers as well as a rear facing camera
now you got the headphone jack in this
location your power switch volume rocker
and microphone live over here as well
you have a forward facing camera as well
as a light sensor above it that's on
front of the device booting up the Nexus
seven will bring you to a familiar
screen where you go through a couple
steps to set it up get it connected to
your network etc in this case it does
require an update right out of the box
other than that you're ready to go so
one of my favorite things about the
Nexus 7 besides the display of course is
the dimension the width of it it's
actually fairly narrow now some people
criticize that they say it's you know
it's not so great for all different
types of content like for example an
iPad Mini which has a different
dimension but it actually makes it way
easier to hold with one hand when you're
gripping it in this fashion here as you
can see it's it's a little bit less
comfortable for me to grip this iPad
Mini in the same way as I am with the
Nexus 7 now granted I have average too
large sized hands so I can pretty much
get them around this iPad Mini anyways
but just barely
whereas in the case of the Nexus 7 it's
really easy to do obviously there's some
drawbacks it's a slightly smaller screen
but then again you're getting that lower
price point I'm not going to go into too
much detail here after all this is just
the unboxing video but if you do want to
see a more elaborate comparison of these
two devices of the Mini oh look at that
thinness they're very close and thinness
of the iPad Mini which is upside down or
the Nexus 7 leave a thumbs up down below
just as your vote if you do want to see
a comparison or a versus video of these
two devices but anyways for the for the
sake of this unboxing video we can wrap
it up there I'm impressed so far it's
actually a pretty decent device when you
consider the fact that it's only 229 and
it's really quick so far really snappy
anyways now I am rambling so if you guys
want to see that comparison video as I
said before make sure to leave a thumbs
up just to let me know that that's
something you're interested in and
hopefully I can get to it next week
other than that I thank you as always
for watching and I will catch you on the
next episode later guys</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
