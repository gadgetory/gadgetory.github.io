the high-fashion world it's very
difficult to so I'm walking through I'm
seeing all these different booths and to
be honest with you I'm thinking why not
just shoot after all I'm trying to give
you guys the experience of what it's
like to be here on the floor so
something caught my attention here I'd
be Jay Rob dick booth up down and all
around is that we have a GPS button
there's a Wi-Fi button in this location
here power switch and this switches the
mode so completely waterproof like more
rugged I suppose than other 360 cameras
that are out there yeah we've all heard
about 360 video we've seen 360 video 360
video exists on YouTube I haven't you
know personally experimented in a big
way because one of the issues with 360
video is how do you look at it how do
you display it unbelievable I wish I was
there right now it's so hot in here I
could be in the snow frolicking in the
French Alps
you could be on you could be on a phone
right and and and scrolling around that
way but that's a really flat kind of
experience this is what I'm especially
interested in because this is something
I haven't seen before this is an actual
360 version maybe one day in the future
all those flat screens in your house
won't exist anymore maybe it'll be orbs
in your living room anyway pretty cool
try rob thicke I'm gonna keep walking
around and I'm gonna probably keep
stopping at various bait places with
cool things
you're listening right here pick this up
now that's not everything it actually
has a built-in battery to 3000 milliamp
hours so it can recharge your phone
this display kind of tells you what's
going on you've got volume as well as
the channel that you're on and
essentially what you've got is two-way
communication here without the need to
make a phone call the network crashes
the EMP hits the towers are down
well now you've got communication at
least point-to-point
with another individual or maybe we just
get a couple of these in the office more
ways to yell at Jack so you're rolling
another interesting thing is there's
actually a Bluetooth version of this and
that's gonna allow you to pair a
Bluetooth headset to the walkie-talkie
campers hikers climbers
yeah outdoorsy type people I guess the
applications really up to you three
kilometers what did I say just to
clarify a few things
three kilometers one point six miles
as my friends is a professional I'd be
nowhere without this man hello
it's just a barrel of excitement check
to check what's up guys this is Luke's
cousin Thomas 2016 yes and here we have
some lovely ladies you know just
relaxing being able to be in Bermuda and
Las Vegas at the same time via beans
pretty awesome I'm talking to two girls
from two different countries in Las
Vegas it's pretty wild
don't be the small present system by
suitable attack and it basically allows
you to connect remotely from anywhere in
the world so if you cannot physically be
present in Las Vegas right now you can
do like Tina and I are doing and using
beans to communicate and look and sound
as great as we would if you were there
yeah how about just like the coolest
dance moves do you think we could do
something like that I think we got it or
its whirling how did Tom do everyone
hear that ladies this stuff is pretty
cool I think I might maybe I should
drive one of these what do you think I'm
gonna try I'm gonna try this out
this is beam on beam action right here
I'm doing very well
I'm really enjoying going up it hello
hello I'm still trying to figure that
out I'm in some other world I've become
a robot now yeah I know a little bit
chat a little bit
and where are you going
how's it going
nice to meet you I'll make you up front
I seen videos on these things before but
until you actually used one you don't
really understand how cool that feeling
is to be somewhere you're not as you
guys can tell LG has uh stepped up the
stepped-up the set up game a hundred and
twelve 4k OLED displays running this
video in native native resolution this
is some kind of a challenge
oh my goodness
so what do you guys think racing
simulator in front of this I could just
have some different window open in each
display I actually want to show you guys
one other thing follow me
98 inch super UHD TV 8k in one display
you can smell the pixels you're gonna
need some content for it not a lot of
stuff in native 8k so many kaze eight of
those Ches Ches for days you people need
this no this place CES this ain't a
place in need this is a place a want the
progress of Technology through mankind
and Mike monopoly close it out here
there you have it I think that wraps it
up had a lot of fun out here at CES
