therapy comm and today I've got a
special Android treat for you literally
a treat
it's an android sucker from the happy
folks at the Sony store for the Xperia
Play launch they had a couple of extras
including this keychain as well
says Android is ready to play I sure
hope so let's find out so you guys have
probably heard of this device it's the
Xperia Play or what was once known as
the PlayStation phone I was super
excited for it ever since the
announcement now let's find out if it
can live up to all the hype some people
were not impressed by the spec list that
this phone ended up shipping with but
hey if it plays the games it's supposed
to play I guess it does the trick right
so anyway here's a phone itself I'm
going to place it to the side so that I
can get through all the other things in
the box I'm gonna place everything down
on the table here so I get the box out
of the way and then we'll move on with
all the juicy details
fairly straightforward stuff everything
you'd expect with a phone we got our
paperwork a little QuickStart guide but
let's get those out of the way a USB
cable which you've all seen before it's
micro USB on the other side a little
travel power adapter and a 1500 milliamp
hour battery which is pretty much
average for phones in this sort of range
we got a decent headset we've also got
adjustable earpieces which is nice now
the phone here's the important part now
I have to say it's a little chubby I
mean it's chubbier than what you're used
to in android smartphones or any smart
phone for that matter but there's a
reason why and I'm sure you know why and
we're about to find out in a second why
let's get these protectors off as she is
damn she's beautiful look at that
that's why she's fat and she does so
much more than any other phone the
mechanism feels tight this thing feels
pretty high-quality all around
we got our shoulder buttons on the side
along with our volume rocker and then on
the bottom side we have our microUSB
along with our headphone jack
there's obviously a camera on the back
side along with an LED flash and our
power button along the top so you got to
insert the battery here to get it booted
up and the nice thing is to give you an
8 gigabyte microSD dam that mechanism
feels tight so here we are booting up
and guys I got to be honest this thing
took forever to boot so I mean I got to
cut this one here because this thing
took forever
it was also Rogers branded which I wish
it wasn't but anyway you slide that
screen up like that and you can unlock
it in landscape mode oh I got to do a
couple set up things here hang on one
second so now I don't have a SIM card
installed right now but I should be okay
because really what I want to look into
is some of the games that are on here so
you have it and once you're in the OS as
you slide the screen up you go right
into the Xperia Play section I've gone
ahead and installed air attack HD and
let me tell you this thing looks wicked
on here the depth and the colors all
look pretty sweet go ahead and try FIFA
10 which is included for free with the
device and this game looks pretty good
for something that's free anyway I was
waiting for some action to happen in a
game play here and that turns out me
getting scored on is the first action
but as you can see the game really helps
to bring out the vibrant colors of this
screen and it really gives you what
you're used to in any FIFA game but in a
handheld with proper tactile controls
now I'm really happy that Sony included
a bunch of games for free such you can
start playing right out of the box and
get an impression of what this little
machine can do you can see you got
madden star battalion fifa bruce lee and
i already put that
attack HD on there that's not included
free here's a look at the OS and it's
got Sony skin on it which sort of lags
it down a little bit
that being said underneath it all you
got Gingerbread running which I was
happy to see they easily could have just
thrown 2.2 on there but you can see the
different notification bar here it is up
against some comparables the Galaxy S
and the iPhone 4 as you can see it's
chubbier that's for sure but it's
understandable why here you got your
different buttons they're all tactile
and it's beautiful control it's all real
solid real nice feeling you got those
optical thumb sticks the d-pad and
here's that beautiful mechanism anyway
guys be sure to subscribe I got the full
review coming up later on and I'll
really test this thing out along with
the pre-installed games
