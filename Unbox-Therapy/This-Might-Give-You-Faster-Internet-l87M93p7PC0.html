another video and today as you can tell
I have a beautiful little package this
arrived from a company called 0/ee are
oh these guys claim to have fixed the
age-old Wi-Fi problem on the outskirts
of your house on the edges on the
fringes maybe it's a bedroom somewhere
maybe it's the basement and that's
signal it just starts to drop off a
little bit or maybe it comes and it goes
or maybe it was never there to begin
with the idea here is to have multiple
little stations to spread that network
more widely anyway let's get inside look
how they package this it's exciting
apparently I haven't opened a package in
a long time ok there we go
blanket your home in fast reliable Wi-Fi
no more buffering no more dead zones
that's that's a very attractive
proposition there have been other ways
of achieving this but it's never been a
super simple setup for the most part so
there's an app to ensure that the setup
goes seamlessly hopefully look at the
packaging very Apple esque it has a 1
gigahertz dual-core processor 512 Ram 4
gigabytes of flash storage us in each
unit and I know many of you are gonna
say but Lou why not just spend the money
on a better router well yeah I mean if
you live in an apartment or something
but if you're in one of those pesky
environments you have drop-offs dead
zones you have to cover a large area
with walls all over the place
then a system like this is pretty tough
to beat nice unboxing experience let's
kind of remind me of something maybe a
Apple TV you've got a reset button power
2 Ethernet ports and then a USB port but
I believe the USB port is only going to
be used for firmware updates or
something along those lines pretty
substantial cable as well a power brick
which is apparently just as stylish
Android yeah it's here iOS Wow look the
reviews are pretty good here's what you
need right god
unit number one plug it into the modem
as asked of course the wall as well and
then I'll come right back and we'll get
the other unit set up so it's connected
now to the router that's how far away is
that that's a forty feet something like
that you can pick a room so we can call
that a particular room the Situation
Room well the other units I got to get
these babies juiced up I want to start
immediately extending my network Oh
network name I got do some basic stuff
I'm just going to call it zero for now
and password I don't need a password I
need a password it's kind of just like
next next next success your network is
running now add another ero for optimal
performance place within 40 feet of each
other so we're right on that fringe of
like how you should set this up Oh found
it it's using some kind of Bluetooth
situation boom alright add another one
and you can see this and anybody could
do this I mean they look look at them
they're pretty friendly looking okay
we're good got a little speed test going
on here tells me the number of devices
connected I can set up guest access
family profiles I've got another router
back there I can do a quick speed
comparison I'm on the Euro Network right
now oh pretty fast not bad so now we're
on the network I was using previously
just a router sitting in the room over
there whoo I know the nerds are
screaming at me right now going oh well
if you were standing right beside the
other router of course but what I'm
trying to portray to you is how most
people set up their Wi-Fi do you need it
I don't know I don't know how grim your
situation is right now but what I do
know is you're like me and you
appreciate quality Wi-Fi so if you're
having problems it's time to talk to
somebody about it
and I'm listening and apparently folks
at Euro are too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
