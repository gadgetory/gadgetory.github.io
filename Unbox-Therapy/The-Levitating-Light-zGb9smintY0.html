another video and today it's another
something that floats levitates you know
I love levitation this is some
next-level thing it's called flight it
is a floating light bulb legitimately
flight set the light bulb free this is
fancy stuff let's crack it open get
fancy together very nice unboxing
experience flight on the top for some
reason I looked at this cork looking
deal and it reminded me of that game
Myst did you ever play mist you never
play mist you did thumbs up if you
played Myst hell of a game it was a
little weird ooh ah this helps you get
the bulb in the right place wow wow wow
that's kind of heavy I guess this is the
base here sure let's put that down we
have some various tips so no matter
where you are in the world you're gonna
be able to take flight see what I did
there get it very short power brick and
then a longer power cable that it plugs
into that again I'm getting mist-like
vibes here it looks like a rope on a
pirate ship or something like that this
is a classic looking light bulb this is
the kind of light bulb that you would
see in a cartoon like when the thought
when a guy gets the great idea this goes
off Bing oh I feel the magnet already
working take the the guide here and then
I'm gonna slide it out
we're floating now gently tap the flight
base to turn on the LED ah wireless
power that's cool I'm into that should
we hit some lights Oh futures now my
friends that's some high-end kind of
look it's it's very instant to the touch
control wait a sec how long does that
spin for human beings are weird
are we not look what we do you need to
have like it's just a room a huge empty
room in the center is this thing doing
this and you invite some people over
you're not there it's just the lamp then
there's a record player and it's just
laughing around it's been it finished a
long time ago
it's just shuttle puddle you know
