showed you some cool gaming equipment
sent to me from the folks over at live
with YouTube gaming and they were like
man that was exciting we want to send
you round two except you're gonna have
no idea what it is until it shows up and
this is that moment right now I just
showed up and what is that thing it's
called the core FX I had no clue that
this thing existed prior to this video
taking place together we shall find out
exactly what it is that makes up the
core effects all right the Box is fairly
nondescript inside you've got this
contraption that's got some strong
military vibes going on I feel like I'm
about to go out to battle have those old
flash back you know better than I it's
an immersive gaming vest what is an
immersive gaming vest I don't know let's
find out inside we got the vest itself
I'm about to feel like a real pro when I
put this baby on
what are these motors in here I don't
really know it's probably gonna vibrate
core FX tactical response there are a
bunch of cables USB power cable mini USB
mini Jack audio little digital to analog
converter you can input Toslink coaxial
and then output to either an audio
system or pair of headphones guessing
that the immersion here probably when I
get shot that thing is gonna let me know
mmm physically
this little box in the box it's got a
line out so maybe what we do is we
probably just take this analog line in
from the digital out and send that baby
into here that's my guess
oh nice they've also included an optical
audio cable user manual maybe I don't
know normally no but with this little
box you can have it simultaneously
sending audio to a headset and an audio
system outboard alright lets you know
what battlefield one here I come so I'm
mounted up now I got the core effects on
so I got it all hooked up the little
digital analog box it comes out of the
ps4 is very straight forward into this
box we're saying goes into the headset
which I should probably be wearing as
well I'm going straight MLG look at me
now I look like I'm ready for real
warfare here put me in the game Delta
alpha beta stack power whoa get a
intensity up whoa whoa oh it's vibrating
me right now kind of sensual jack nose
on top probably not actual let's play
some games oh oh it's just reacting to
the in-game music right now and it's ooh
whoa it's little tiny vibrations in the
chest there Oh with these like big boom
it's like four oh man
Oh Oh baby oh I got somebody
Oh so you know what I gotta say it's
like you feel the vibration at gun power
but as well what you feel is the music
like the bass in the music oh that's the
flamethrower okay he got me I can feel
the sizzle right now mom fire and I can
feel the sizzle
all right I'm running in there he's
going in that didn't last oh oh I got
the Gatling gun
Oh baby not that that that that all like
got hit by the Hindenburg up there so
alright I'm on to the shotgun now sit
down buddy
whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho he got me again with
the back it's always the flamethrower
man I need to tell you guys exactly
what's going on here the sound input
from the game whatever game it is
Asscher playing to give a kind of
physical representation of that in the
form of this best gun games firefights
kabooms like that's the intention here
maybe you've got the VR headset on maybe
that's the complete package in the game
like you never been before you play some
of those horror games you strap them
into this Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
