another video and today we're going to
be looking at a heavily requested device
I've received requests on Twitter and in
the comment section for me to take a
closer look so this is an early unboxing
of the galaxy note 4 which isn't out in
North America until the 17th of October
so this is obviously a Korean version
and I've even got a little card here to
test out the card gate controversy that
a lot of people asked me to test there
is of course this issue of a little gap
around the screen the glass panel on top
of the screen so I'm going to be testing
that in this video and otherwise we'll
be doing an unboxing and first
impressions of the Galaxy Note 4 so
let's go ahead jump inside the box and
take a closer look at this highly
anticipated device so as I mentioned
this is the Korean version and actually
I'll flip it over just for a moment to
show you guys the specifications on the
back because it is the Korean version it
has the octa-core processor this is not
the one that we'll be shipping with
North American versions it's got the 16
megapixel optical image stabilized
camera that many people are excited to
learn more about of course the quad HD
Super AMOLED display so here's the phone
go ahead and peel off screen protector
and this extra plastic feels very light
that is my first impression here it
still has that same texture that the
previous version had without the
stitching around the outside and
actually not a terrible feel obviously a
real leather something like that might
feel nicer but Samsung is famous for
these removable backs so that you can
carry an extra battery with you
for example the other new part here is
the fact that we have this metal band
around the outside instead of plastic
which is supposed to give you a more
premium feel and at first touch it is
more premium the question is is it more
durable because the previous generation
note which I actually happen to have
over here is one of the most durable
devices that I tested in my various bend
test videos that I'm
pretty sure you've seen and a lot of the
internet has also seen so as you can see
they are similar but different and the
new one is attempting to go up market
with these chamfered edges and this
metallic band around the outside you
have the stylus housed in this location
down here it fits in there pretty snugly
I have not been a huge stylus user on
the note in in the past so having it
nice and tight in there if I don't want
to use it it's locked in place that's a
positive thing let's go ahead and look
at the other accessories inside the box
after all this is in unboxing and first
impressions video some paperwork as well
as USB cable a headset with various tips
so that you can get a decent fit when
you insert these into your ears you have
small/medium as well as large then we
have extra tips for the stylus it looks
like we've got a European wall adapter
again this is the Korean model so I have
an adapter for this to use with North
American plugs but then again I have
many different power bricks that I can
potentially use with this device and
then our battery which in this case is a
pretty big 132 20 milliamp hour rating
and let's go ahead and insert it might
as well while we are here this baby
lifts off just like this this is a
classic Samsung kind of pack you have a
SIM card slot as well as a micro SD card
slot here for expanding the storage on
the device and that's the thing about
Samsung phones is that you know many
will argue they're not the prettiest
things in the world but from a
utilitarian perspective they give you
options through expansion through a
removable battery etc and that's not
very common in the marketplace right now
you look at something like the HTC One
m8 no removable back that means no
replaceable battery and that might not
matter to a lot of you but if you travel
a lot sometimes carrying an extra
battery is something that a lot of users
can benefit from so there you go you
have that option now let's go ahead and
test out
this gap Gate issue Oh mine doesn't have
a huge gap hold on here not enough for
this car this is a standard this is a
standard card it's obviously not a
credit card because I wouldn't want to
expose the head for personal reasons
this is like a metro card for going on
the train and it's not going to fit in
there at least not without some force
there is a little gap is it any
different than the old version okay so
yeah so there is a slightly larger gap
than on the old note which goes edge to
edge but in this particular case it's
not really as big as I expected to be I
thought I was going to easily fit this
card in there instead it doesn't look
like it's happening let's try this one
of these sheets of paper see if that
will go in there this I'm sure this will
fit not a fit right what about gap gate
it's supposed to be a big thing Wow even
that's a little bit tough to get in
there okay so my version maybe they have
fixed it or maybe it's less maybe this
is a manufacturing issue where some
devices are showing it more than others
but this but I lease on mine oh there we
go I think I got this part in there we
go alright I was able to get it in so we
have a little gap there now the funny
thing with this gap is that people were
you know concerned about it saying well
what about dust and grime and now I'm
starting to find this on this side the
gap is the largest right around this
volume button so people were concerned
that dirt and grime is going to get in
there potentially moisture as well it's
not a huge gap but there is one there
there is enough this is something that I
have never really inspected on hardware
in the past never thought - never heard
of it is really the first time so yes
look at this a sheet of paper and quite
easily fit into that gap right there
does that bother you is that a huge
issue go ahead and let me know in the
comments down below but I definitely
can't get a credit card in there it's
more like she
paper type of gap now will that change
over time of course we'll have to wait
and see of course these things can shift
and I think the official message from
Samsung is that that gap is built there
to potentially deal with shifting God
knows why maybe because they released a
video recently telling you that you
could go ahead and sit on this device
they were very proud of that so let's go
ahead and boot this up now the entire
edge here is chamfered much like the old
iPhone the iPhone 5 and 5s in fact this
looks like a scaled up version of it in
many ways
so I'm greeted with this Korean screen
here I'm going to go ahead and select
English of course and just like that we
have in English device that was easy
I'm not going to insert a sim right now
hopefully I don't have to okay so now
we're set up and you can see the home
screen here once again it is an AMOLED
display so you're getting really rich
and saturated colors and of course
you've still got the TouchWiz interface
which some people are okay with some
people are not huge fans of it like
myself I do prefer a stock Android
experience that being said you can use a
launcher to get somewhere closer to that
experience mine is preloaded with some
Korean stuff that I'm sure I can remove
yes of course and so I'll be cleaning
this up and personalizing it and then
coming back to you guys with a more
elaborate video with my experiences etc
this is literally my first impression
with it so I wanted to focus a little
bit more on the hardware design and how
I felt about it in general so on the
right hand side we have the power and
lock switch which lands right on your
thumb when you're holding it in a
standard fashion like this and as we
move around to the bottom you have the
location of your stylus as well as the
USB port you can see some minor breaks
in the external sort of chassis to deal
with the antenna on the left-hand side
you have your volume rocker which is
much clicky er than it used to be a
little bit more satisfying and then on
the top of the device is where you're
going to find your headphone jack on the
back
ak is the home of this new 16 megapixel
camera you can see the flash below there
down here we have the speaker which is
in a new location compared with the old
note the note 3 and it has that kind of
slight raise to it so if you place it
flat on a table that should still be a
little bit of room for sound to bleed
out this is the black version of the
device it's also available in white and
there's even one with a slight pink tone
to it for individuals who are into that
kind of flare at the top you have your
earpiece as well as some sensors and the
forward facing camera which has also
been improved from the previous
generation anyway guys there you have it
a quick look at the physical changes and
design cues of the brand new galaxy note
the note 4 is the card gate thing an
actual issue where you can slide
something into the chassis in between
the metal band and the glass screen I
have no idea I don't know how that would
impact or affect you maybe I'll need to
do some tests with moisture or dirt to
see if it actually gets in there I can
get a sheet of paper in there as you can
see right here but I'm incapable of
getting a full credit card sized card in
there so I don't know I think this is
going to be a manufacturing thing where
some people could potentially see a
bigger gap than other individuals the
other thing is I know a lot of you are
going to ask me to bend test this note
for I want to use it first much like I
did with the iPhone 6 plus use the
camera do some various tests potentially
benchmarks etc so there's a lot to do
with this phone before I start bending
it because my past history with bends
has resulted in some pretty gruesome
Affairs much like this right here yeah
that's the iPhone 6 plus so anyways I
don't expect this one to Bend quite as
easily if it's anything like the
previous generation note which if you
haven't seen that Bend test video go
check it out because it holds up quite
well in fact even in the Consumer
Reports test this old note is capable of
150 pounds of force whereas the iPhone 6
for example is around 70 I believe so
these have a history of being fairly
durable devices but will this metal band
around the outside be as durable as the
plastic which can lose its shape and
then come back thanks to that magnesium
chassis that's on the inside underneath
all of that plastic so anyways many
things to think about I'm sure I will
have plenty of questions on Twitter if
you're not a subscriber go ahead and
become one because lots of coverage
coming up on this note for including a
more in-depth look as I get to use it
more this was strictly in unboxing and
first impressions and leave a thumbs up
down below if you eventually want to see
the aforementioned Bend test of the note
4 before it even launches here in North
America alright guys thanks as always
for watching and I'll catch you on the
next episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
