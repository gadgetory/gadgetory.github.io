this time another day another smartphone
leak in this case my goodness it's like
the whole device the Huawei P 30 P 30
Pro the latest flagship from Huawei it's
leaked out even so far as showing up on
Amazon with a price and a spec list it's
pretty wild so yes this is very likely
an image of the next Huawei flagship P
30 that's the P 30 Pro in that picture
right there and that's the amber color
with 128 gigs of storage price point it
looks like it's gonna be around a
thousand bucks if this post here on
Amazon is to be believed but I'm fairly
confident at this point based on all the
leaks piling up now so the main focus
with this device to change of course it
comes on the camera unit this has been a
big performer in the camera space in
fact the camera stuff that Huawei has
been doing in some people's book is is
the premium in the smartphone space this
is gonna be a quad camera set up with a
40 megapixel sensor a 10x hybrid zoom
sensor and also a 20 megapixel sensor
the front camera the selfie camera is
gonna be 32 megapixels it's a it's a
megapixel fest going on now based on the
information that Huawei leaked out on
their own website it sounds like this
thing's gonna be an even better
low-light performer than the previous
version which is kind of hard to believe
but that's what they're saying I expect
them to put a lot of focus on the camera
setup when the event actually happens in
a few days here now it looks like
there's gonna be two devices P 30 P 30
Pro we have what look like images for
both as well as a nice little sampling
of the various colors that will be
available it's kind of similar in some
ways to other products we've seen from
Huawei with these color shifts and these
kind of rainbow effects on the front of
the device the cutout is not so much of
a notch I mean it is a notch but it's
kind of somewhere between a teardrop and
the notch that we saw in the essential
phone it's a tiny little dot in the
center of the top edge of the display
otherwise you're looking at a really
slim bezel all the way around and
you know this kind of meets the criteria
for what you would expect from the next
generation Huawei flagship from a visual
perspective now because his device
leaked out in the form of an Amazon post
it goes a step further with this leak
this actually specs that we're on that
Amazon page that we can presume
quite possibly are accurate I would
guess and this and this page just got
published before it should have so in
this case we're looking at a seven
nanometer Kirin 980 platform eight gigs
of ram the model that was showcased on
amazon has 128 gigs of storage and a
4200 milliamp hour battery so that's
actually a slightly bigger battery than
I personally expected but I wouldn't be
surprised because man in a smartphone
marketplace at the flagship level is now
so competitive in order to differentiate
you've got to be you got to be
delivering on all kinds of categories
now of course this is gonna come in some
different models that is the pro version
that the listing leaked out for and the
price point puts that model somewhere
around $1000 so squarely planted in the
premium smartphone segment up against
the galaxy s 10 and of course the iPhone
10s now another feature that was listed
on huawei zone website when that post
went up inadvertently was this ability
to utilize that camera array on the back
of the device in an unusual fashion at
least the way I haven't seen before in
which you could record two simultaneous
videos at different vocal ranges so you
can get both perspectives or the best of
both perspectives at once when you're
trying to capture an event that's a
pretty cool feature there's some other
ones listed on their website some other
claims that of course can't be tested at
this point in time but everything is
looking legitimate as of right now you
had the post go up on their website with
the product page
you had the amazon post here will is
showing off some of what leaked out on
the website they went into some detail
on the color as well as a heavy focus on
the camera unit I think that's how
they're going to market this device I
think they're gonna call it just the
best smartphone camera I believe that's
what they're going for and who knows
they might just achieve that
so the event is scheduled for March 26
that's happening very soon but I fully
expect at this point to see exactly what
we're seeing here just in more detail
hopefully we get some different price
points and maybe the non pro version
comes in a little bit more affordable we
see all the colors we're gonna see the
camera samples hopefully the night mode
can blow us away once again now you let
me know down in the comments where do
you think this is gonna stack up against
the other flagships do you think it can
beat products like the the galaxy s10
where do you stand what are you saying
let me know in the comments I will check
back here on the 26th when we have an
official product but I think it's gonna
look like this I mean it would be crazy
if it looked like anything else at this
point with all the information that's
leaked out on Wobblies own website and
on Amazon come on we're gonna see it
it's gonna look like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
