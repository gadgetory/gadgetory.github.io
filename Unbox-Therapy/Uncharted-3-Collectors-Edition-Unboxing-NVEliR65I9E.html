just got back from the midnight launch
of uncharted three lots of swag let's
talk about the GameStop extra they
included for pre-ordering it's the
creepy crawler kickback that's in-game
material of course the next thing I
picked up was the collector's edition
game guide you're gonna get some extra
swag with that too including an
uncharted 3 soundtrack with 10 tracks on
it and some other cool material I'm
gonna show you in a minute but let's
talk about the main attraction it's the
collector's edition of uncharted 3 one
of my favorite games and that's just how
we roll here on unbox therapy if there
is a collector's special limited edition
of anything any game we're going to pick
it up you can trust it so let's go ahead
look inside let you decide for yourself
if you want to pick up the collector's
edition or kick it standard so on the
left the very first thing you notice is
this very nice steelbook case I really
do like these it's a very nice and safe
way to keep your game and recently some
manufacturers have been real chintzy as
far as including game cases you know for
example the Batman special edition or
collector's edition the only case you
got was the special book there so but
anyhow let's talk about this a real nice
tough looking case a fairly substantial
manual as well and some DLC in there so
all that good stuff that we're looking
for in these kinds of editions the next
item we've got physical item here this
feels like brass it's an actual heavy
you know belt buckle so if you guys can
picture it picture picture Lu rocking
one of these or maybe one of you guys
rocking one of these but anyways yeah it
feels heavy I don't know if it's real
brass or not but sure feels like it the
next thing we got is of course the ring
here on this leather strand I suppose
like a necklace you would call it and
I'm gonna get you guys up real close you
know get you inside the material as
close as humanly possible that's how we
try to do it here on unbox therapy and
the last item a fairly major item in the
box here is of course the Statue the
figurine you could choose to terminology
then that you want and as with all of
these guys you know there's varying
degrees of quality this one looks
actually pretty good
get you up close here I don't know if
it's hand-painted or not but some some
nice stuff here you can stick it up on a
stand put it up somewhere if you're a
big fan you know you might want to have
this like I said before I'm a real big
Uncharted fan so you can throw them on
this little stand right here pretty
self-explanatory and on the bottom it
says uncharted 3 and on the bottom of
that on the very bottom you can see the
manufacturer it's called Sideshow
Collectibles and of course it's made in
China because what the hell isn't these
days so let's go ahead and get inside
the guide as I told you before there are
extras besides just the guide including
that soundtrack and the back goes over
some of those features you've got the
walkthrough redefined top-down Maps
that's all normal stuff you know you're
gonna be able to find all your secrets
so on and so forth there's a cast
gallery and of course you're going to
get that free audio CD if you like the
music in uncharted and check this out
uncharred uncharted golden Abyss this is
an advertisement and you're going to see
it's the PS Vita guess what
I'm gonna pick that up and unbox it as
soon as it's available subscribe to this
channel or else you're missing out so
here's what the guide looks like real
nice beautiful visuals inside just like
the game I mean the game is visually
beautiful you probably already know that
if you're watching this video and
there's that disc I mentioned earlier
that's the audio disc I'm gonna get you
guys an even closer look at what some of
this artwork looks like inside of the
collectors guide if you're thinking
about grabbing one of these two anyway
guys if you enjoyed this content
hopefully you can like and favorite this
video as it does help me out a bunch and
if you haven't checked out my new
channel yet it's called the beast feed
I'll put a link right down here please
go ahead and do that - hey if you
haven't subscribed to this channel you
might want to do that because I got a
lot more coming up I got Lord of the
Rings special edition I get Goldeneye
special edition holy crap there's too
much stuff going on too many games I
guess that's what it's like before
Christmas anyway guys as always I want
to thank you for watching I'll see you
around the channel later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
