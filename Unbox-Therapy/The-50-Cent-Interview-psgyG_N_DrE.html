gonna have a little bit more of that on
it yeah the more well look at me so
anyways we're here to talk about SMS
today right yeah yeah and I was I was
out in the booth testing some stuff out
I hadn't tried the noise canceling ones
yet
those are nice yeah on the show floor
lots of noise cuts it down mm-hmm yeah
so that's a that's a big thing and then
the other thing you guys have got is the
the ones for fitness where some sports
courts ones can you tell me a little bit
more about those ones well this
desportes has said the sports version of
SMS street right it's a it's the same
size as the traditional street version
and it's the same 40 millimeter driver
driving the musical gadget components
it's just not a low-end there right
looking for that bass right and and it's
it has a actually polyurethane nylon to
create the durability that you know I
used to twist the headset oh yeah I did
that in a video I made I was looking at
the original Street yeah yeah I show
people yeah there's like a perforated
leather around actually so it's a big
difference and it's code it has a
technology around it to actually
waterproof see so a lot of times we'll
be out and it'll start raining or and
we're not actually you're not gonna take
your headphones off your hat when it's
actually raining out right right I feel
like it's protective but it's not yeah
for sure so yeah once again when you
make an investment in headphones to know
that they're durable it's a big deal
yeah I mean I guess sweat too right yeah
exactly
inside the actual ear cup that did it
gets through to actually you know
enjoyed actually listening the right
depending how hard you're working
they work hard I'm not working as hard
as you are man the damage that actually
if you getting off with one little bead
running down yet I was looking at your
Instagram feed I saw you hitting a speed
bag yeah today I'm like I'm not on that
level if you doing a little something
like I got too much or that around me
not to be inspired by it I was doing a
little bit of research and I found out
you actually did some boxing at a young
age
younger some people don't know that yeah
yeah do they the book Passover that I
always told them that I was living
vicariously through Floyd my knees
because you know I actually got into it
was into a long time ago without you
know I I was more fans of the net
Whitaker Mel to tell Michael none it was
news to it was news to me but it sort of
made a lot of sense
you know that ended up over I don't do
anything is not organic to my
personality or to what I actually would
use myself and music like when it comes
to like what I did with vitamin water
was actually it was taboo in the past it
was you across across a no avoid you a
sellout then it changed artists mind
when they realized how much money and
inspired the 360 deal cuz following that
is when they started to implement the
360 deal with they did add my finances
to the actual advance
mmm-hmm for the causes but they they
didn't add additional staff or employees
that would actually get you to deal so
it says if if you actually make it to
the point that you actually have deals
away from the actual music they get a
piece of it of course but you don't then
it's cool well better on the music yeah
yeah most definitely
no I mean in a time of sort of the the
power of social media right you know
influential people become that much more
important right look at how influential
you became the new to YouTube channel
that's exactly correct
you see I mean like and it's like this
is a reflection of the times it's
changing yeah and then not everyone is
actually has the skill set or the idea
to do what you actually did and a lot of
times like I see I see
the visual is becoming more as important
as the actual song itself yeah video
getting crazy that's the way people
consuming music so it's like when you
hear a song from a new art you maybe are
you familiar with the actual artist but
it's a new song you know what was that
and they'll end up on YouTube yeah going
to look to hear the song again and say
yeah this is the song that I heard on
so I'll play it few times if they enjoy
it from YouTube for sure so if there's a
visual or something connected we started
putting out word videos like when when
the song came out the video came that
actually had the lyrics yeah YouTube
yeah no for sure it's become a huge
music player you've got videos with
hundreds of millions of views you know
because people are hitting that replay
button they're sharing it's definitely
shareable format you know it's faster
than word of mouth I can get on Twitter
get everybody's connected yeah that's it
and so you know you could take a
traditional sort of format which is
telling people what you like it just
gets amplified you know yeah yeah and
yeah I've been noticing the hashtags on
your Instagram it's like you know no
matter what you're talking about
it's SMS Audio yeah yeah but I don't
because I before I've worn a lot of
different things but I want them to
forget music because I like this is my
personal interest that if you involved
in music and eventually you're in front
of cameras so often that you become
comfortable and if you actually
traveling if you like it the effects and
the actual films glitters lucasfilm's
that the deal with Star Wars with SMS
cool looking headphones by the way yes
yeah you got a semi to cool this one
that according to the New York Post the
coolest oh sorry that was ok we got to
do better yes 2014 all right I am a fan
of the stormtrooper ones plus the Jedi
the rebel Jedi ones not sure that's the
right way to call them but there they
are they're behind you right now
those are some nice color scheme
Chicagoans cool hazard yeah when are
those available do you know first
quarter yeah okay so pretty soon so stay
tuned to the channel guys we're gonna be
showcasing that stuff as soon as it's
available to us take a good a chance to
show you the workings the inner workings
oh yeah I don't know if you've ever seen
one of my videos but we go in-depth you
know we take we take sort of a normal
product video and turn it into a your
really informative you know content and
you know not to speak about us too much
but like it's sort of you know extends
the experi
it's like video like you spoke about for
music it's sort of the same way in the
product world right you know the cool
part is now devices have advanced to the
point that your telephone and shooting
HD so that's sufficient for in studio
performance right lock it to the music
and put it up on your YouTube
yeah the barrier to entry keeps getting
lower the amount of money it costs to
get into it it's not laws now you know
if you got real artists can do things
with nothing right now yep because the
instrumentals but what we were doing in
a very beginning like the cool part the
thing that I did with mixtapes was I
format it what was a freestyle
performance in song format he's made it
work yeah so they didn't know that it
wasn't as cool as the actual album right
someone else was making cuz it in format
and then it changed the way they make
mixtapes I went like when the artists
say he has a mixtape coming out it's
actually his album before his album
yeah 90% of the time song all for that
tape becomes the record that leads into
his actual yeah no for sure I mean it's
like it's it's also kind of like a
market test in a way this put it out
there as a sample see if people enjoyed
then you know you know right vein that's
right a material you know I read
something about you about how you when
you first went in the studio you had
sort of lyrics on a page but not
formatted right and yeah and I kind of
feel the music if you're not actually
impacted with the actual music I don't
think it matters
yeah I think I hit record is a marriage
between the content and the actual music
this there for sure yeah you know you
need both yeah if you put weak lyrics
over really good music right barnaby
interests if you put the most phenomenal
lyrics fo awesome garbage yeah you need
it oh that's an angle people don't want
to move if it doesn't make you feel good
yeah point right yeah one question for
you I got a lot of viewers who are
younger you know just starting to get
into tech and stuff but you know a lot
of them probably into music - right and
just since I got you here wonder if
there's any advice you give
regardless of what it is that people
want to do I mean you you essentially
came from the bottom right all the way
up to here we are you know what I mean
and so you know any advice you could
give this to somebody out there that
sort of wants to create something but
it's intimidated or doesn't think they
have the skills to go now
you got to first break that phobia and
then do it openly and you know so even
if it's look you could be the room by
yourself
and do it when you post it you did it in
front of a lot of people that's true you
know but you gotta actually perform the
practice into a brick past that point
and your confidence is so important as
an artist that sometimes you have to be
overconfident to withstand the doubt
diddle-eye actually happen for you until
it's your actual time like I thought I
was ready in 97 but it but hip-hop is
about what he cares yeah but it's about
having that know you've got to have the
bravado if you don't have it before you
start yeah you're gonna get it but what
you get is through the artist community
even an established artist feels the
synergy because the new artist I felt
like yeah it's great that you made it
because your confirmation the success
and I want my shot to make it and then
when you keep making it over and over
now and again I felt like I was ready in
97 and nobody was planning it and
nothing's I wasn't ready it's not I
wasn't ready in 90
I put I'm out power $2 I wrote it in 98
it came out 99 and on Columbia Records
and I thought that record was ready and
that one didn't come up but I did have
how to rob on it you know I got some
attention and made everyone take note
that I existed as an artist period and
then mm yeah thousands when I was
I had actually got ready because it was
I've lost my ability to be marketing
promoted by major record company mm-hmm
and I had to figure it out on my own
Wow yeah it's a it will be interesting
to sort of you know if you were coming
up right now in these times like you
didn't have YouTube back oh there
wouldn't be it wouldn't get attached to
me they'd already gonna sail up now they
got access to things that I didn't have
access to yeah that the ability to build
the following look at this 700,000
subscribers to your actual you actually
check me out yes I did all right
why you got that going this is you
sitting it and technically analyzing
products and when this is cool this is
not good yes it out of here but but
you're doing that alone your personality
is withdrawing 700,000 people to you now
if you had musical content that people
will actually generate interest that's
700,000 people that will potentially be
buyers of your actual music for sure and
and just a circle of people around you
they could just be into that like
reality television like watching you
upload things I would actually have
cameras plan in the house 24 hours run
cut it we go edit it no it's true
it's amazing like I see I view YouTube
as a social network yeah just like
Twitter just like Facebook just like
Instagram except you have video which
from a communication standpoint it's the
best we have on the web right
I used to face we could see people even
in the artist community they have strong
points that you just didn't be really
really really talented guys cuz they
come out with really good material and
then as soon as they start to move
something goofy happen you know yeah
yeah what's wrong manufacture standstill
like the girls in the music video yeah
some of them is Dan you be like
drop-dead gorgeous I see I see normally
know they made those like that then you
go the music starts and she stopped
moving
you like oh no baby steps he'll go back
to standing still look just move the
camera don't move you know yeah you need
the whole package yeah I'll be there
sure all right well that's some that's
some good stuff great advice for people
we're gonna see some brand new SMS
products coming out shortly yeah I'm
excited like I said to take a closer
look at them especially the ones with
active noise cancellation as well as the
athletic stuff I can work on my own
personal athletics yeah see I play huh
get Oh hardly alright Huck is really a
boxing sport you think so
well put you in the face all right
that's true they get off and going
that's the highlight when they actually
start to have an okay that's true that's
true that's when you stop on the ESPN
you jump I always stop to see that yeah
and my imagination is just running like
what now do you fight somebody on on
skate that's what I was about to say
they so comfortable skate nigga do it
you ever been on skates
I did like 2 to 2 times a time really
the react video we shot it in the ice
skating rink wow I never saw a video I
got to look that up is that on YouTube
go look it up everybody yeah I really
didn't know why the fuck they wanted to
ice skate like it was tough for me like
he was like wild put me in the box maybe
they're fans of the sport I was there
like the day before a nice game ring
with little kids like trying to learn
practicing it's not easy if you wait
like where I'm from I'm from Toronto huh
they get you on skates when you're 4
years old so yes that's right it's like
you need to know it's a coming-of-age
type thing though yeah and so as an
adult it's easy but you get somebody who
has never tried before later in life
yeah it ain't pretty
that's look I went to the X Games right
right and I saw the crazy things is
known as the skateboards though and it
told me it told me stay in your lane
yeah I like the obvious amazing kids
they're like 12 years old yeah it's not
and I wasn't dude they kind of be doing
about 35 miles an hour by the time they
come out of the ramp easy it's not easy
that fast and that
that's a tough one yeah that's what
that's that's the tough part - that's a
tough one
how would you take it if your son came
along so decided I'm gonna be on this
BMX or motocross or something crazy like
that well I mean it's a process like
you'd say let's do it good yeah that's
right
get some help some people who know how
to do it I know you're a boxing fan do
you ever watch UFC or no yeah yeah yeah
you saw what happened I understand Silva
yes crazy Oleg was one of the ugliest
things I ever saw on TV seen it one time
before the boycott really yeah I watched
I had went to uh was I was on tour I
went to Taipei
Thailand wow you did it look Bangkok and
Taiwan that's like world central
headquarters for a movie yeah and I went
and it was cool they actually start
trying to early to like they actually
decide early on is only gonna be like
that right yeah I saw a documentary on
muy Thai where the prisoners know
certain jail once a year hosts fighters
from international destinations can come
in and you can fight a prisoner but
their trip their train they train all
year huh it's like their one day to
perform but it's like a religion to them
over there yeah it's another level that
dad to work and uh that might be
something they could do to prevent
aggression like what's that movie we
just watched the purge yeah everybody
that we write but there's a lot of
training to that you got to do in the
meantime and I know you're into training
you know if you feeling aggressive
before you know you get on the weights
or whatever on the punching day you feel
better about it
I assume yeah absolutely I don't have
any experience not every time I think

adjustment when you start to see
yourself being able to do more did you
