videos here in fact on unbox therapy
regarding it now the biggest and most
controversial development in the world
of iPhone 7 talk is this idea of Apple
eliminating the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack
that's the little audio jack on the
bottom of your iPhone that allows you to
interact with regular headphones what
you would consider to be standard
granted a lot of people started using
wireless headphones for convenience but
this next iPhone the iPhone 7
apparently that jack is no longer gonna
exist kind of like this Jack over here I
was pretty good the way I put the jack
then what are we gonna have instead is
it gonna be wireless headphones
headphones that are in the box to use
the Lightning port or no headphones at
all speculation is rampant these are
headphones that showed up straight from
China you show you inside instead of
terminating into a mini jack 3.5
millimeter connector we have this a
lightning connector right on the end of
what looks like standardized ear pods
now these have shown up on various leaks
and rumors sites let's take a look let's
find out if I can just plug these into a
standard iPhone and even get an audio
signal on the current software without
any kind of third-party app I have to
admit though they have nailed the kind
of ear pod design what happens here if I
I'm into the Lightning port right now no
third-party app oh by default
works by default works right away I'm
assuming
I just stumbled into a banger when
you're plugging your phone into a dock
or a third party accessory that uses the
Lightning port to output audio I assume
that we're using that same pin situation
in order to get that audio output to
this cable here now the question is do
we have an improvement in sound quality
I think the next obvious thing to do is
to play back some tracks over the
Lightning earpods and then compare that
to a standard set of 3.5 millimeter
ear pods which I need to go get right
standard authentic set of
current-generation
ear pods it is time for our test okay
standard ear pods wait a second wait a
second something seems off here hahaha
the standard ear pods sound way better
way better
here's what I think I don't think these
are legit at all and if I had to
speculate right now I would suggest that
Apple is not going to include a set of
lightning ear pods in the next iPhone
the headphone jack will be dead I think
it's going to be up to you to pick up
either a third party or maybe an
accessory that's official that that
Apple makes or a couple of headphone
options a marketing ploy a marketing
strategy if you will to cause consumers
to look at the headphone section of the
Apple store or the website and think
about immediately grabbing an upgrade
and spending more per transaction if
you're on the street if you're on a
subway on a train on an airplane you see
these things everywhere now if you owned
beats as well as Apple you'd be saying
how can we sell a pair of headphones
with every iPhone here's how take this
out of the box change the port so that
the old ones don't work and force people
to look at lightning options or Wireless
options which of course in the store are
going to be dominated by Beats products
I think there will be an adapter in the
box
there will probably be a lightning to
mini-jack adapter so you could use old
headphones if you wanted to the real
move here is to go with something
Wireless there's a lot of great ones out
there in fact I've done many videos so
go watch those just because there's no
headphones in the box doesn't mean you
need to grab those beats</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
