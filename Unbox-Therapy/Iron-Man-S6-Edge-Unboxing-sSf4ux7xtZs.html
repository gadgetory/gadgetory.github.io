jack-jack what's up guys Lew here back
with another video and today we are
checking out something very exciting
this is the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge
ironman edition these are incredibly
limited and pretty expensive right now
because there's not many of them out
there so they're pretty much only on
eBay now for way too much money but
since I'm always bringing you guys the
latest and greatest here on unbox
therapy you're gonna get to have the
unboxing experience of this very limited
phone right here so it starts with the
packaging as you can tell you have this
red finish with the gold Iron Man mask
or helmet in the corner here you can see
Marvel Avengers age of Ultron in cinemas
now you have the LTE - a 3 band 64-bit
octa core processor quad HD display 16
megapixel camera 64 gigs of memory this
also comes with a clear cover and a
wireless charger included so let's go
ahead and open it up oh my goodness look
at that would you look at that already
very special black on the inside here
what is this solid oh my goodness
so the s6 edge over here in this
beautiful gold and red the Iron Man logo
in the back and over here is the
wireless charger little USB connector
now this box is no joke this is like
velour foam never seen velour foam and a
little badge we are greater than I whoa
how about the deep statement there from
Marvel and Samsung that's like us we are
greater than I as a group what do you
think Jack next up there's a little
clear case included along with the gold
trim if you want to use it just like
that we have a sim tool in this box here
we have our power brick and last up have
some headphones
the same as the standard s6 or s6 edge
how about the unboxing experience here
though this is the stuff that unboxers
dreams are made of what a great way to
keep all of your accessories together
look at that
it's like when you open up a box for a
fine scotch or con yak a fine cognac but
even when the bottle is empty you put it
back in there you hold on to it which
way am I going to do this just like that
now I do have a regular s6 edge here for
comparison there's the standard a6 edge
versus the Iron Man Edition the limited
edition badge down here which identifies
this as number 534 and also the
specialized wireless charger where you
just drop the device on there like that
Booya you're charging now the case it
has an even glossy er looking gold
finish on it okay so now we're booted up
and as you can see completely customized
theme you have a customized clock these
buttons down here as well as the
background obviously Avengers age of
Ultron in theaters now look at this your
apps it's all themed up Ironman style
yeah so here you can see the Ironman
limited edition theme is installed of
course you can switch to other themes if
you like why would you spend all the
money on the Ironman edition and then
use a regular theme I don't know but
here you can see the home screen the
lock screen the dialer contacts and
messages of course I want to see that
dial in real quick look at that look at
that feel like Iron Man making a phone
call this Iron Man make phone calls it
doesn't matter anyway so there you have
it the Iron Man Edition s6 edge very
cool limited edition obviously not a lot
of these out there and the exciting part
about this video is I'm not gonna keep
this actually I'm gonna give this away
to one
viewer cuz that's just how we do it but
it's even more special than that it's a
collaborative giveaway a three-way if
you will myself Marquez from mkbhd and
Jon from TLD today are all combining
forces like the Avengers sort of like
how they combine forces well anyway that
three of us are going to give away three
separate devices three separate Ironman
phones and they've all got videos on
their channels right now with the phone
featured so all you need to do is head
over there subscribe to their channels
and leave a comment on their video in
