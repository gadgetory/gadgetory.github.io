long awaited announcement of the winner
of the first package of my two different
giveaways you probably know one giveaway
is going on or was going on here on
unbox therapy and another one over on
the Beast feed I'm gonna go ahead and
announce the winner of the first package
in this video here the second package
winner is going to be over on the beasts
feet I'll put a link to that
announcement in the annotations as well
as down in the description but before I
announce the winner of each package I
want to say thank you to everyone for
helping me get to 50,000 subscribers it
is a major major milestone for me and I
will not be taking it lightly more
content on the way you know without you
guys this wouldn't be possible and I
love doing this so I really just want to
reach out and say thank you for making
as possible and then next I just want to
say sometimes when you run a contest
people they get a little bit out of hand
in the comments section they go crazy
they get upset that they didn't
personally win something I want to say
is keep your cool I want to do this
again I want to do this more often in
fact I want to announce another major
giveaway very shortly so before you get
angry before you unsubscribe think about
that you'll probably want to stick
around because I got another big contest
planned so keep your cool keep your cool
folks it's all fair it was completely
random so there you have it so without
further ado the winner of package number
one the Kindle Fire package is YouTube
user I'm gonna have to read it here
because it's a bit unusual YouTube user
X X M s YJ X X so can't really be read
but I'll put the name up here in the
annotations as well as likely down in
the description if that is you if that's
your YouTube username then
congratulations you've walked away with
the Kindle Fire package and give me your
address send it to me in my inbox my
youtube inbox and I'll get that package
wrapped up and shipped out
to you as soon as possible once again
guys I want to thank you all for taking
part not only in this contest but in my
content on a regular basis you guys are
really the best and I really owe it all
to you so until next time until the next
big giveaway that you're gonna want to
stick around for it trust me it's even
bigger than this one I'll see you around
