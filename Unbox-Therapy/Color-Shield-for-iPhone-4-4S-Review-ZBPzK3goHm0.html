therapy and today we're taking a look at
a product called color shield from
brixon this product is a skin or a
shield for your iPhone 4 or 4s and it
comes in a number of different colors as
you can see in front of me here they
sent me a bunch and the reason for that
is because I'm gonna give a bunch of
them out to you guys really cool people
over there now the question is which
colors should I give away and which
should I keep what should I install I
think I'm gonna go ahead and surprise
you guys right here I'm gonna install
the pink one on my iPhone 4s and right
about now you're saying wait a minute
here Lou I don't peg you for a pink kind
of guy and let me let me tell you
something about rockin pink if you can
put pink on your iPhone and get away
with it and dare people to say anything
about it and back up your color decision
then hey you're a true badass nah I'm
just kidding this is for my wife she saw
this color and went head over heels plus
she's rockin the perforated case from
incase if you haven't seen that unboxing
I'll put a link in the description as
well as the annotations and that's gonna
allow the color to show through so it
should be real cool now brixon includes
everything you're gonna need to get this
baby up and running you've got the color
shield you've got these cleaning
microfiber cleaning cloth you've got
everything you need
this is an anti-glare style protective
film so no fingerprints hopefully you
know no major glare issues and the
colors actually called juicy pink how
appropriate let's go ahead and get it
popped open and see exactly what we get
inside and also the installation
procedure etc so first of all you've got
this bricks an envelope and inside is
all of your materials and then on the
back of that envelope are some very
detailed instructions some of the best
I've actually seen on any kind of film
or any kind of sticker decal you know
how it goes now what I like about this
particular product is it includes some
alignment stickers because as we all
know it can be a major major headache
trying to install some of these things
especially if you don't have a nice
clean flat environment if you got dust
particles floating around you can you
can go pretty crazy trying to install
these things now brixton has done a
couple of things and included a couple
of things to try and make this process
easier I'll show you those in a second
first of course the silicon squeegee the
microfiber cloth make sure that you guys
wipe down your phone that's the biggest
thing you've got these alignment strips
for making sure you're gonna get a
straight installation and then you've
got these cleaning stickers if you do
get dust underneath your shield you can
lift it and use the sticker to pull it
off without smudging it up with your
fingertip if you've ever experienced
that before that's near impossible to
get dirt off just using your fingertip
now as you can see it does have that
anti-glare coating you can see as you
see my hand underneath here and I'm
really impressed with is that with it at
this point I mean I'll have to wait and
install it and see how it looks with the
screen behind it so through the magic of
video editing here is installed and as
you can see it has some incredible anti
glare properties that fit and finish is
unreal I mean everything is tight
they've even included a button cover
that has a gel kind of coating on it
real nice overall and I'm amazed by the
fit I'm not an expert at installing
these things by any means and I was able
to get it on here incredibly tight the
cutouts are precise so this is
definitely a high quality product
they're retailing it for $19.99 it's on
sale right now via their website I'm
putting a link down in the description
but I totally think it's it's a great
value at that price you can definitely
get crappier decals and skins than this
for that amount of money so as I
mentioned before we're gonna be using
the encase on here as well the encase
perforated snap case again if you
haven't seen that unboxing I'll put a
link up here and down below but the
reason that this is gonna be a cool kind
of combo overall when it's all said and
done is because the color on the back
actually Peaks through a bit so you're
gonna get a lot of protection you've got
skins on the front in the back and then
on top of that you got the little snap
case and you still get some of the
coloring through it so a real cool
overall package I know my wife is over
the top I just showed it to her and
she's absolutely loving it so anyway
guys as I mentioned before this is real
precision engineering it sounds kind of
strange to say that about a product
that's that's basically a sticker but
really I've seen some bad ones out there
and this one is not one of them this one
is one of the best I've ever seen and it
all comes down to fit and finish
once you've got this thing installed
you're not even gonna notice it's there
it does not alter the design or
functionality of the phone at all it
just gives you that protection without
the bulk real cool anyway guys I'm gonna
give you a closer look here but
