Apple product that never happened of
course it was called the air power and
who knows why we can just speculate at
this point why it never came to be it's
very uh napple like for a product to
make it that far along from an
announcement to being on the website to
them vanishing outta nowhere an Apple
saying hey we couldn't do it very
bizarre especially for a product which
seems simple a wireless charger that can
charge multiple devices at once so then
a product came along we made a video on
it it was a triple wireless charger
aimed at filling the void that the air
power had left but the design of it the
aesthetic it wasn't really Apple esque
so that's where this comes in is called
air Unleashed very aggressive possibly a
too aggressive type of name Unleashed
but kind of fitting actually because
they unleashed the thing that Apple was
trying to hold back they kept it on the
leash these guys Unleashed it
so obviously it's strongly inspired it's
a knockoff of air power that never
happened it's very a very strange story
but nonetheless here it is and I think a
lot of people are gonna like the look of
it because of that inspiration it's
super simple look at that little thing
bedside table it's got a soft touch
material it's got an apple esque
microfiber almost suede like surface on
the bottom of it and then that
terminates into a USB plug now there's a
little bit of paperwork in here as well
probably can tell you be careful with it
don't let it get too hot it does require
a QC 2.0 or higher charger now I don't
know if it's included or not when you
buy this thing for us they did ship a
Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 power brick so
anyway you need a hefty power brick for
it that makes sense though because
you're trying to charge multiple devices
at once three devices in this particular
case now it looks like two of the Qi
wireless charging spots on there
indicated by these plus symbols are
gonna be standard so that's gonna be for
your smart phone and also for your
wireless charging air pods
I have be very fancy
custom color wear black air pods in the
house so we're gonna test it out with
these and then you have this third spot
in the middle here which is gonna be for
the Apple watch of course that's kind of
a proprietary little indent there
because of the way that the Apple watch
charges now the device that I showcased
previously it was kind of this portable
plastic triple charger unit I didn't
really have a problem with it as I said
before but the look of it wasn't to
everybody's taste and and this one on
the other hand I think is gonna be more
in line with what an Apple customer
might be looking for so anyhow let's
plug it in let's make sure it actually
functions and let's see what it looks
like with all the different devices
installed on top of it phone goes over
here Oh actually lined up pretty nice
pretty easy then started charging
straight away watch drops in there
there's a little magnet that grabs it
and then of course the air pods are
gonna go in the far side on top of this
plus and that starts charging right away
no delay I don't know if you picked that
up jack the overhead did the light
kicked on straight away now the watch
hasn't kicked on yet but I think it's
cuz it's completely dead so we're gonna
give it a second right there boom
lightning bolt on the watch so if this
is your setup if you have all these
three products right you're super into
the Apple ecosystem I think you're gonna
want this wireless charge pad it
fulfills the Apple prophecy that never
was which was this idea of one charge
pad for all your devices because it's
kind of messy right now to be honest we
need to see more of this kind of stuff
this integrated stuff so we can we can
have a more seamless kind of charge
situation like I said on the bedside
table or wherever it is that you happen
to charge your stuff all right so here's
the part you care about if you're
interested in this then you probably
want to know the price at this point
it's gonna be 99 bucks so it's not cheap
alright you can even definitely find a
cheaper solution you get a couple of
wireless charge pads I mean we got like
these little these little bricks like
this I mean you can pick these up for
like $10 so so obviously this might be
cost prohibitive for some people but if
you want the seamless you want to
integrate it you want the full-out Apple
lifestyle then you can pick this up for
99 bucks that
doesn't include the power brick though
the QC power brick that they're selling
on a site they want like another nine
bucks for it so is that the only place
you can get it we'll just on their
website
nothing items on just their website
alright so the watch finally got enough
juice to boot up completely and there
you have it I mean it's the perfect
little package everything is charging
it's the Apple promised that they
couldn't deliver on who knows why I'm
not really certain we're gonna have to
wait and see if they eventually approach
this product but in the meantime you
have to knock off it's available
it'll cost you 100 but it's really the
only way to get this package right now
and I gotta say I think it's pretty
clean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
