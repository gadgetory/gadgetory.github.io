nondescript box like this one things are
about to get exciting I happen to know
what's in here it's a prototype captured
a ton of attention on Kickstarter some
stickers
those aren't stickers those are business
cards the CEO let's just get back please
ah the world's smallest phone this thing
is unbelievably small
the zanko tiny t1 world's smallest phone
you know I've covered plenty of phones
world's small as this and that this has
to be smaller than those sync contacts
and music with your mobile phone
mono color screen voice changer three
days of standby time does have Bluetooth
built-in it takes a nano SIM and it can
store 500 contacts that's right it has a
voice changer you can be a man woman
child old cartoon young optimist duck
robot Evie a whatever that means wall-e
rap man and rap woman well this just got
a lot more interesting let's see how
small this thing actually is whoa that
is unbelievably small it does not seem
real holy it looks like it has a speaker
on it too on the back there SIM card
goes in the side here this thing makes a
nano-sim look big smaller than my thumb
about as big as an SD card about as big
as a coin smaller than a small-sized bic
lighter much smaller than a ketchup
packet barely more than two pieces of
gum it's tiny a micro USB cable to
charge it up oh and a sim tool this
little guy is around fifty five bucks
and at this moment you're probably
thinking who is this for what is I mean
it's obviously a novelty thing is for
people who have all kinds of tech pull
this thing out at a party and people
will be amazed you make a phone call on
this people's minds are gonna be below
the buttons are way smaller than my
fingertip there you go Jack what do you
think about that that's a pixel two XL I
mean obviously they don't do the same
thing but holy smokes
just dwarfed oh there we go we got the
time we got full battery life all right
I'm gonna put my sim card in I'm gonna
try to make a phone call what do you say
looks like I have message let's give it
a shot well what's your phone number
did you guys hear that that's kind of
nice I think it's ringing this is so
bizarre oh wow
kind of a loud speaker hey man you sound
alright in here really I did not expect
to have any kind of call quality here
yeah you too man and loud feel like a
secret agent right now leave your phones
at the door sir I'm like no problem this
thing's in the sock you like to go for a
jog you need to maintain the contact
maybe you don't want that whole
experience you know what I mean maybe
you need something more discreet should
I try the magic voice okay well I'm
gonna we're gonna switch wills gonna
come in
all right so obviously a novelty item to
begin with it kind of adds to the
novelty factor you want to have a little
fun with it but when it comes to other
productivity stuff like texting you can
imagine that's gonna be a nightmare and
for calling it worked surprisingly well
what what are you talking about that
little guy could fit right in there you
could get a full-fledged phone for 50
bucks but you can't tell anybody it's
the world's smallest as a novelty item
as a gift for somebody who has
absolutely everything there's no doubt
this is gonna put a smile on their face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
