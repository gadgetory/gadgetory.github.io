therapy and today we're taking a look at
the newly released retina model macbook
pro yes I finally got my hands on one
this one here is the base specification
with 2.3 gigahertz of quad core Core i7
goodness and as you'll notice the rest
is base spec as well if you want to
check out the other configurations and
pricing availability etc I'll drop a
link down in the description so you
could see what is available across the
board in the new retina MacBook Pro
space but let's get a look at the
product first after all this is unbox
therapy where products get naked and the
very first thing you're going to notice
in all its glory is the brand new retina
model MacBook Pro I'm gonna put that to
the side for a moment and get through
the more boring aspects of this unboxing
they do have to be completed you're
going to get a little bit of paperwork
from Apple here something that says
hello a little guide as well as the
ubiquitous Apple stickers and you are
free to do with those as you please and
you get a cleaning cloth in this
particular model I noticed on the last
MacBook Air unboxing you did not get a
cleaning cloth so that is a bonus and
you've of course got the new MagSafe
adapter it is slightly thinner than the
previous generation so let's go ahead
and get this beauty unwrapped right here
for all of your viewing pleasure of
course and the first thing you're gonna
notice is on the bottom you've got the
MacBook Pro insignia basically planted
right on there no big surprises as I
turn it around and get it flipped open
there was is one little change on the
front side of the unit which I'll show
you in a quick second nothing really
major so I'll go ahead and remove this
protective covering from the screen
we're gonna boot that up in a quick
second and really start to appreciate
what Retina means in the world of
laptops as you'll notice they removed
the MacBook Pro insignia from this
portion here under the screen where it
used to live might have something to do
with them needing to make this one
significantly thinner the they've also
moved the power button from its
traditional place to write on the
keyboard much like the MacBook Air so as
we look at the right-hand know left hand
side of the MacBook Pro Retina you're
going to see a MagSafe port two
thunderbolt ports
a USB 3 port and a headphone jack as you
turn to the other side you'll see one
more USB 3 an HDMI port and an SD card
reader now this thing is incredibly thin
that's another thing to mention and a
big improvement and to get this thing
they had to come up with a new cooling
configuration you can see here you've
got these little slits on each side this
thing is half as thin as an SD card or
maybe even a little less than half
that's crazy thinness for a computer
with this much power of course so here
it is the Virgin boot the very first
boot up on this particular brand new
macbook pro and I'm not gonna make you
sit through the entire setup but I do
kinda want to give you guys one tip if
you don't want to do the registration
information you can Apple queue that or
command Q and skip over that portion to
speed up the process I've been doing
that for years just wanted to give you
guys a little tip in case you didn't
know about it now the main thing here
with this unboxing and this model for
that matter is the screen and it's very
difficult to portray to you guys through
this video here just how crystal clear
it is that's because this display is
capable of portraying an enormous amount
of pixels way beyond what your 1080p
television can do it runs a resolution
of 2880 by 1800 but you're not gonna get
that actual workspace that's something I
wanted to make clear in this video that
of course if you had that kind of
workspace you wouldn't be able to read
anything so you've got a number of
different configurations available and
you can find which one works best for
you the stock configuration gives you a
workspace similar to a regular old
edition MacBook Pro if you need more
workspace and you want to sacrifice some
of the text size you can get it up to
1920 by 1200 in terms of the appearance
of the workspace even though you are
still looking at 28 80 by 1,800 in terms
of pixels it sounds pretty complicated
it's not at its highest workspace this
is what its gonna look like you're gonna
have space for two browser windows and
at the stock workspace well your your
work space is limited as you can see
here when I make the switch you sort of
lose the ability to have two windows
open at the same time and be able to
look at them in real time so the beauty
here is that you've got options you can
pick whichever configuration works best
for your particular use case scenario
now you've also got a back
keyboard on this model but that's pretty
common now the MacBook Airs have it the
older MacBook Pros did but the main
thing to talk about and what everybody
is talking about is the clarity of this
new Retina panel text looks sharp it's
incredibly beautiful to look at
stick around the channel for the full
review so you guys know what I think
about this model and if you enjoyed this
content please remember to like and
favorite the video as it does help me
out a bunch and if you haven't
subscribed yet please go ahead and do
that too
I've got like I said lots of content
coming up on this particular model I've
also got content on my channel of the
latest MacBook Air lots to look at
thanks as always for watching I'll catch
you guys on the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
