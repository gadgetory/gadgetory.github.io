therapy comm and today we're taking a
look at the nikon d50 100 this is still
a pretty new camera from Nikon and we
actually got a SanDisk 16 gigabyte card
included as part of a promo on going
over at Best Buy
so because it's the kit we're going to
get the 18 to 55 millimeter VR kit lens
it's nothing to write home about but
it's apparently pretty sharp for a kit
lens and for the little bit of added
expense along with the extra SD card you
might as well take it so first things
first we got the Nikon warranty then we
got a boatload of paperwork over here
it's going to be your Quick Start Guide
and a bunch of manuals probably in way
too many different languages at least
for me that is and next we've got our
accessory box and here is the main prize
the main attraction the body of the D
5100 itself so let's get that box out of
the way here's the lens it's the 18 to
55 like I mentioned now my experience
with kit lenses is that you know you
sort of get what you pay for
they're not going to be super Pro glass
by any means but they're going to get
the job done so along with the lens
we're going to get some more paperwork a
warranty for the lens itself as well as
a manual believe it or not which is kind
of crazy because it's just a lens but
then again now with VR and all the rest
of it I suppose they're a little bit
more technical than they once were or
maybe not depending on how you're
looking at it because manual lenses were
tough to use anyways
we got our Nikon strap bog-standard
I'm sure every human being on the planet
seen one of those before next we've got
our AV cable and a little eyepiece cover
I suppose if you're going to be storing
a camera for a while we have our data
cable in case you don't want to use an
SD card reader or maybe you don't have
one
anyway standard USB no big deal next
we've got the battery which is the en el
14 and unfortunately if you've got older
batteries from say addy 5000 they're not
going to work on this new camera
here's the battery charger super slim
got the flip out prongs got to love it
anyway this is what we all came for the
d50 100 body and I got to say it's small
its small and light actually I've used a
number of different digital SLRs and
they seem to keep getting smaller
there's that twist the flippy screen
that everybody wants it's all the rage
right now you can take pictures of
yourself or hey you could take video of
yourself yeah it doesn't matter but it
feels good in the hand you know you got
your wheel on the backside you don't get
a wheel on the front side you got to
step up to a bigger camera in order to
get that so you'll have to hold the
modifier button if you want to control
shutter speed and f-stop on the fly
anyways here is that kit lens I was
talking about and again it's not too
special it's mostly plastic construction
but it's light it's got a versatile
focal range what can I say about it
so here's that card and I do not want to
bore you with the antics involved in
getting into this strange containers so
anyway there it is it's only a class 4
so it's not super quick but hey it was
free don't complain and they gave you 35
free songs on eMusic anybody want that
anyway here's a little bit of the setup
it's got a brand new screen a shitload
more pixels gotta love that and there's
a look at the info - as you see it says
subject is too dark that's because the
cap is on here is our controller wheel
on the top side and a better look at the
specs of the lens you can see it's
variable aperture there's that one wheel
we have on the back you'd have a another
wheel on the front if you had a bigger
body directional pad okay button
our trash
play button all the rest of the buttons
we have our GPS port a mic port HDMI
port and of course our data port pop-up
flash we've all come to love and of
course our SD slot lastly we've got our
lens controls for VR and all the rest of
it as always guys visit the channel and
subscribe so I can keep bringing this
