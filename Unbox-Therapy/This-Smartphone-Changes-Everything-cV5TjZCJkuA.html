game changes in front of me I have the
future and it's in the form of the find
X this thing's been top secret and for
good reason because it changes
everything this is the stuff I've been
talking about in my videos this is the
stuff I've been looking for in you too
everybody's been asking for innovation
in the phone game and not just some
concept but a thing I can buy right now
a thing you can buy right now so that
you could put the future in your pocket
the find X from Oppo you can see the
packaging very slick but you care about
what's inside so let's do it
I happen to know that we are looking at
an extreme the screen to body ratio
according to Oppo and astonishing ninety
three point eight percent sim to a
little bit of paperwork an audio adapter
a set of earbuds type-c to keep it
charged up of course it's got fast
charging through this brick right here
and this cable it's vo OC ok now it's
time for the main attraction and I know
you're screaming aren't it on I want to
see this all screen design this one is
called Bordeaux red there will be
another color as well which is going to
be more of a blue and then on top of
that there's even gonna be it completely
over-the-top Lamborghini version of this
device this is covered in Gorilla Glass
5 on both the back as well as the front
look at how slim that bezel is no knotch
no kind of weird cutout at all and I
know that's giving you questions right
now you're like how is that possible
where's the camera this is supposed to
be the future like I told you at the
beginning of this video so of course
we're gonna find out you see what I did
there Jeff
find X find out that's why you come to
unbox therapy in the first place you
need to find out the latest the greatest
I bring it to you oh my goodness now I'm
not gonna mention any other brands out
there but I'm just saying you're telling
me this is not it you're telling me
that's not the future continue Oh
oh did you see it daily Dec what
so they've hidden two lenses in a flash
look at the design the way that comes up
and then down let's do it again
two lenses in a flash just real slick
that is futuristic Inspector Gadget it's
what I've always wanted because the look
is clean they used it as a design
element they could have easily just had
some box come up from the top but they
didn't just like that it's gonna uncover
the front-facing camera and sensors as
well whoa Oh baby that is crazy cool
alright so it's not just about this
incredible screen to body ratio Oppo is
also very proud of the tech that's
hidden in that section that comes up the
motorized section there including their
3d facial recognition for unlocking the
device now Oppo claims that that
recognition has a failure rate of 1 in 1
million compared to like a fingerprint
which is somewhere in the neighborhood
of one in 50,000 all right I'm gonna go
ahead and enroll my face here
[Laughter]
so satisfying all right so this section
on the top is not just a front-facing
camera in fact if I give you the right
reflection let me show Jack here some
other sensors over here there's a bunch
of them there's a flood illuminator an
infrared camera proximity sensor dot
projector receiver and RGB camera it's
all hidden in there
this is packin a Snapdragon 805 it's got
eight gigs of ram 256 gigs of storage a
surprising 3730 milliamp hour battery I
told you about the dual-sim capabilities
and then of course the camera which is
the obvious next place to go I have a
plant this wonderful model here we'll
see if the camera can figure out what
this is the thing is with this level of
detail you can definitely tell that's a
fake plant and I have not been watering
it quick little portrait of my sidekick
here how freaky is that thing picked up
portrait there it knows we are taking a
picture of a face boom there you go Jack
are you happy now thank you very much
for your service
no mannequins were harmed during the
production of this episode now of course
it wouldn't be an unbox therapy video
without a quick selfie test we'll see
how the beard hairs show up and so on
look at this guy's beautifying to the
next level 3d face beautifying oh I'm
looking more beautiful already flawless
Instagram will never be the same the
real me ugly the new me beautiful all
right let's try one not beauty because
I'm a realistic guy the truth ooh
no that's a selfie anyway I'm happy with
it the beard hair test there it is can
you count individual beard hairs yes you
can you think a few people would
download this wallpaper have a couple
nightmares real quick screen to body
ratio though it's all face I do feel the
need to let you know at this point I
can't really deeply evaluate the phone
because this is an early model an
engineering sample something they got to
me before the retail launch now I
realized at this point I haven't told
you how to navigate the phone it's all
screen to body ratio you can't really
have buttons or you wouldn't want to so
instead it's a gesture based setup
swiping up from the right hand side acts
as back if you want to go home you swipe
up from the center and then of course
there's multitasking as well you just
sort of hold and then scroll through
like this but really what this thing is
all about is the display six point four
two inches it's got AMOLED technology
and it's actually manufactured by
Samsung the resolution 1080p so on the
sides of the device you're looking at
one point six five millimeters of bezel
on the top one point nine one and then
the chin a little bit more at three
point four millimeters you don't get a
gigantic phone but you get a ton of
screen okay so look this is very new it
just got announced the device is not
ready for a full evaluation this is more
of an introduction so the battle right
now is in the realm of screen to body
ratio and to this point I have seen
nothing this impressive in that
department the Oppo find X Jack what do
you think is it the future I do believe
so incredible screen to body ratio and
don't forget the very cool
rise up sensor system as well as cameras
a crazy unique amazing implementation
and where did you find out about it on
unbox therapy that's where</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
