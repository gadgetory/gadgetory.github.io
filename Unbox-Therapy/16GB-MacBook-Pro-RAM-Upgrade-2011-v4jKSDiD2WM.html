therapy this is a special presentation
I'm going to be putting sixteen
gigabytes of RAM inside of this macbook
pro I've got a screwdriver I've got an
Android figurine to supervise the entire
procedure I'm just kidding
you do not need an Android figurine
here's the RAM that I chose this is some
Corsair memory called mac memory and
this is ddr3 at 1333 megahertz and these
are the timing's nine - nine - nine -
similar to mine from early 2011 or even
2012 its ddr3 ram with those timings you
don't need to buy mac specific memory or
something labeled like mine is just make
sure that those timings match up also
get yourself a decent screw driver the
screws that Apple is using on this
underplayed here are not the greatest
I've ever seen so if you come in with a
cheap screwdriver you might mess it up
get yourself something half decent so
here you can see my incredible speed at
undoing this bottom plate here all you
gotta do is take this puppy off and you
should be good to go you'll see the
wonderful innards of your MacBook Pro
shortly after that process and here you
can see in mine it doesn't look quite
like a stock one that's because I've got
the vertex three in the top right corner
but look at all that gadgetry all that
goodness on the interior there but yes
I've got the vertex three SSD in the
regular drive bay of my Mac Pro Pro and
then in the optical drive bay I swapped
out the optical drive for my traditional
hard drive I guess it was a 750 gigabyte
drive that lives in there for extra
storage because I don't need the optical
drive the RAM lives over in the center
of the macbook pro where I'm pointing
right now and to get it out all you got
to do is pull these little tabs to the
side here's a closer look at what they
look like there's one on the left one on
the right you pull them away from the
RAM chip and since it's spring loaded it
should pop up and then you just pull it
out and you should be ready to go then
you've got to open up your new RAM of
course and get that inserted you insert
it in the manner opposite of the
extraction process as you'd expect and
it's really easy to do you just line up
the pin
that's the main thing make sure you line
up the pin on the correct side slide it
in there the bottom one is a little
tougher to line up then the top one and
then press it down you'll sort of feel
it slide in and then click down towards
the bottom side of the laptop or top
side depending on which way you're
looking at it so there you go here's an
even closer look for you guys to figure
out don't be scared give it a little
pressure it'll all be good if you want
it to be flush and straight down so the
last thing to do is just to zip the
bottom plate back on once again I'm
going to do that in super speed mode
here so that I don't bore you and then
the last thing to do after you've
completed this is to boot up your
macbook pro make sure the ram is
registering correctly there are also
some tests you can run to make sure that
it can handle a full workload and in my
case here it boots up just fine I've got
the wonderful Apple logo to greet me and
then after getting into the OS the only
thing left to do is to click on the
Apple logo in the top left corner about
this Mac and here you see this is mine
16 gigabytes 1333 megahertz of ddr3 RAM
now I've just got to go out and use it
and if you're considering doing this
then let me know how you would use 16
gigs of ram or if you even could anyway
guys if you enjoyed this content
hopefully you can like and favorite this
video as it does help me out a bunch and
I stay tuned the channel for more
content on the way and I will see you
guys on the next one okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
