therapy and today we're taking a look at
the case prodigy from zu goo this is an
iPad case which will work with the
latest generation iPad as well as the
second generation or even the first so
in that sense it's kind of flexible you
know you can use it with a number of
different models but what's special here
is that it features six different angles
that it can be used at because it does
feature a built-in kickstand now why
would you want to have that many angles
for your case that you're using your
iPad with I'll tell you why because you
might want one angle to use for
productivity for typing you know for
doing work while you're sitting in a
coffee shop or at a desk or table then
you've got other angles that are better
suited for media consumption you know if
you're traveling on an airplane or
watching movies on the couch or in bed
then you might choose some of those
other angles but having flexibility and
having options is always a good thing
in the consumer electronics world or the
accessories world and this particular
product offers up a bunch of flexibility
as I just mentioned
so as this unboxing moves forward I'll
give you guys a better idea how each of
these angles functions in the real world
I will be inserting a retina model a
latest generation iPad something else to
note they do make this exact same case
for the brand new iPad Mini as well so
that's something to keep in mind if
you're an iPad Mini owner and if you'd
like to check out the description down
below I will have links to the zoo goo
website and hopefully Amazon as well if
I can find the product on there so there
will be links down below so you can
purchase the case checkout pricing and
availability for yourselves after you're
done watching so as you guys can tell
it's a flip style case you know kind of
like a portfolio or notebook and on the
inside it ships of course with silica
gel this is to keep the interior dry
during shipment that's always a good
thing and you have this little
placeholder in order to keep the
structure of the case as it ships to you
but that portion there in the center is
where you're going to insert your iPad
and I'll go ahead and do that in a
moment there's a velcro latch to secure
the iPad in place there's also a cutout
on the back for your camera and this
should give you a better idea in a
moment here of how the complete package
looks once I have the iPad installed so
it slides in really easy
it's easy to insert as well as remove
because you have little tiny cut bends
you know for the forward-facing camera
as well as your home button and there is
a magnetic clasp along the top which
sort of secures the whole thing when
you're traveling with it there's that
cutout I mentioned earlier for your rear
facing camera on the iPad and here is
the kickstand that really sets this case
apart so as I open it up here I'll give
you a better idea of how that kickstand
functions there's actually magnets in
both the kickstand and the surface of
the back portion of the case this means
you're going to get a secure fit that's
not going to accidentally drop down but
at the same time it's easy to remove and
shift the arrangement if you choose to
or if you just want to fold the thing
back now on previous models of zoo goo
cases the clasp or the locking mechanism
rather than being a magnet was actually
velcro now that has its benefits and its
drawbacks obviously velcro is not quite
as elegant as magnets are the exterior
of the case on this one in my opinion is
a little bit more streamlined and a
little bit more desirable so I think
that this particular model is definitely
an improvement as you guys can see here
the workmanship is very nice you have
this leather like material that actually
feels and looks a lot like genuine
leather and as you can tell the main
purpose here is to get a very flexible
case that's going to allow for you to
use your iPad in a number of different
ways enhancing the ability to be
productive as well as the ability to
consume media so anyway guys that's been
a first look at the case prodigy from
Zoo who you can see the iPad Mini model
over on the left they also have some
products they offer for the iPhone 5
