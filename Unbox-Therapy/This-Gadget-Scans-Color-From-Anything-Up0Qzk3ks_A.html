a loud chair move chair sound today I
got a cool one for you
seriously pay attention expanding the
attention span because this one might
change the game it's called the NYX
color sensor and what this thing claims
to do is to take any color in the real
world and turn it into a digital
representation as an app that goes with
this thing and shows you the digital
color palette as extracted from the
real-world object you see where I'm
going with this real world things made
digital maybe I should just show you now
they sent this over to me this is not
pink oh my goodness
here it is NYX color sensor nice little
packaging made in Canada made of maple
syrup well guys a little quote on the
side poets say science takes away from
the beauty of the Stars mere globs of
gas atoms I too can see the stars on a
desert night and feel them but do I see
less Oh what does that even this
includes one NYX pro color sensor 1
microfiber carrying pouch one micro USB
charge cable and you can get the app to
go with it on either Google Play or the
Apple App Store how do i crack this baby
open though Oh a flat micro USB cable
word up
what an unusual shape I assume the
sensors in here I'm gonna place it on
something it picks up the color
apparently right about now you're
thinking who is this even for interior
designer illustrator creative person if
you need to quickly sample the real
worlds I need to match that right this
what I'm looking for this is the way to
do it to set this guy up it's all about
some microUSB download the app it's the
terrible Wi-Fi
I have a light now connect baby found it
okay I got some things to scan over here
of course Mountain Dew maybe you want to
paint your bedroom with Mountain Dew
orange the pink tiny posh phone a pool
ball we're about to take a ride on the
color train you're invited you're not
yes Jack's invited too I know it's gonna
ruin the trip for everyone else but
three minutes in he's got to go pee
already the man's got no bladder it's
all that silica gel he's giant up from
the inside I'm gonna line this up scan
it look at that look yes now of course
you know your screen is gonna represent
it a little differently but that's the
digital version what does it say RGB
CMYK hex whatever you're working in it's
all represented right there
I can tweet out that color I can save it
it's magical how much can this guy oh
look at this orange oh I got the pool
ball oh ho ho Mountain Dew Bree wait I
gotta get the lighter part of it yeah
there might be more Mountain Dew to me
can I scan my hand here hahaha
what if I'm trying to coordinate the
outfit and I like I gotta get pants that
are exactly this list is this dangerous
should I be scanning my head too late Oh
gotta get the grey hat oh I don't need
to be plugged in so now I'm just I'm
just walking around the place phone in
hand boom scan boom scan oh that is
Starbucks green go and grab any color
you might need for your project and be
inspired
everybody knows Ferrari red with the
Knicks you're real quick
boom Ferrari red take it with you who's
better than you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
