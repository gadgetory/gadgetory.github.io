a loud chair move chair sound today I
got a cool one for you
seriously pay attention expanding the
attention span because this one might
change the game it's called the NYX
color sensor and what this thing claims
to do is to take any color in the real
world and turn it into a digital
representation as an app that goes with
this thing and shows you the digital
color palette as extracted from the
real-world object you see where I'm
going with this real world things made
digital maybe I should just show you now
they sent this over to me this is not
pink oh my goodness
here it is NYX color sensor nice little
packaging made in Canada made of maple
syrup well guys a little quote on the
side poets say science takes away from
the beauty of the Stars mere globs of
gas atoms I too can see the stars on a
desert night and feel them but do I see
less Oh what does that even this
includes one NYX pro color sensor 1
microfiber carrying pouch one micro USB
charge cable and you can get the app to
go with it on either Google Play or the
Apple App Store how do i crack this baby
open though Oh a flat micro USB cable
word up
what an unusual shape I assume the
sensors in here I'm gonna place it on
something it picks up the color
apparently right about now you're
thinking who is this even for interior
designer illustrator creative person if
you need to quickly sample the real
worlds I need to match that right this

it look at that look yes now of course
you know your screen is gonna represent
it a little differently but that's the
digital version what does it say RGB
