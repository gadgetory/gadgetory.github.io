came with it this came with it Jack show
them that look at that the whole big box
with this whole system in so it's from a
company called I have gum in my mouth
hello Z smart core battery plus memory
plus LED light plus wireless charging
plus plus plus
lotta plus 5 S 5 c SE 6 6s what
accessories can paddle with every iPhone
ever
there's even iPads listed in there and
it's 128 gigabytes I know okay so it's a
lot to wrap your head around this smart
core is a modular accessory and you can
add other aspects to it
like these things here to make it work
with whichever phone that you have we
love your YouTube channel Lou we're
honored for you to feature our cool
product Z core smart K so while it's
featured now so 2600 milliamp hour
battery in there LED light wireless
charging you know I love wireless
charging on everything put it on all
things so this gives you better I get
this image here of how the whole thing
is gonna break down the device slides in
the front hello future oh my goodness
look at this hello so friendly Z smart
belt this is the magic piece that will
enable the smart core to be connected to
any one of those cases over there
alright I'll put that down oh that's the
smart core that's nice brushed aluminum
Quick Launch button is actually a button
on there one long click launches the Z
core app one short click checks the
battery level two short clicks activates
charging so this part here can be used
to charge up the z-coordinate for file
transfer this port on the bottom is
what's going to go to your actual device
this guy right here you can fit in like
that these both look like they're for
the 7 black and clear and white we slide
the core into the case low and then this
guy goes in here this is what it looks
like now you do end up with this kind of
strange bump on the bottom here that
you'll be living with but I don't know I
guess in your pocket you probably
wouldn't notice it too much
that might be an eyesore for you so you
still have access on the back to the
charge port you got to keep everything
charged up you're not gonna want to take
it on and off
too often huge cut out here for the cab
right and then the magic is here in the
middle this button here is what will
launch the app apparently okay cool we
have the app now check it out blue light
Oh baby look at that started fourteen
point eight one gigabytes available on a
32 gigabyte iPhone 7 the Z core one
twenty seven point zero seven of course
formatted size of 128 gigabytes I mean
your start your stored everything now I
can see what types of files are being
stored
I can organized by the type whether it's
a document music photos etc there's
nothing on the Z core right now if I go
to the iPhone memory for example you can
see there's some app some music some
movies and so on the Z bar is at 23%
iPhones at 100 I can hit this little
swish now I'm charging seizure fest I
mean there's an emergency scenario in
which that would be helpful for you
right or maybe you're at a concert hey
Jack you'll maybe instead of just
recording some video you can hold this
up out of love or you can sync it with
the Z camera mode so within the app on
video mode look at this I can increase
or decrease the bright as you can see
that in my hand there and that's all
during video recording that's cool right
kaboom go over here you take a picture
kaboom kaboom this is just a normal
iPhone camera app there's a few pictures
there if I go back into the Z core I'll
select these different images I just
snap copy photos folder on the Z core
select it paste copying done now I can
delete those images I can keep them in
two places as a sort of backup now if I
want to send images or videos straight
into the xik or I can just go grab the
camera app and then shoot that photo in
here instead kaboom kaboom look at the
flash in sync oh my goodness the power
lives natively on the Z 4 and if I
wanted to move that over to the iPhone I
could this case is just aiming to add I
guess all the things you might wish
exist
in the iPhone to begin with better
battery 2600 milliamp hours better
storage 128 gigabytes of extra storage
the crazy light wireless charging it's
kind of a crazy contraption I have to be
honest look at that
and then this guy then look at that look
how flashy that is I'm about to get my
party on here everybody's having a great
time then I arrived
sometimes the best gadgets are the weird
ones I grew up watching Inspector Gadget
speaking of gadgets spinning in in it
NIC NIC NIC NIC NIC thinning in an
ethnic man Inspector Gadget where you at
play the tune jackets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
