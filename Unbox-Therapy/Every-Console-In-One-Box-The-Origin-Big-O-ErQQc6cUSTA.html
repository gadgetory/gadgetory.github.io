obviously tell a very elaborate super
workstation slash gaming computer
potential look at this that is I don't
even know how you H that in that's my
face in case you're wondering and it's
like laser etched and big oh this is
from Origin PC it's two boxes
apparently inside of this box is a
gaming computer / Xbox / PlayStation /
Nintendo switch in one unit Kirk am I
correct on this is that the package deal
all in one place so you get the best of
all worlds one for everything they call
it the Big O I'm excited this is
different I've never looked at anything
like this before
here we go oh boy there's a whole
process here it's a process important
high performance origin thanks for help
well I was already well break a sweat or
what I don't even know how you fit all
those things into one PC case but I
guess if you've got a big enough PC case
ok when you buy like a high-end car then
you put like this wrap on it when you go
to collect it it's kind of like a
high-end vehicle right here oh man ok
this is insane
what that's way better than I expected
it's crazy they got each thing
identified and water cooled the Xbox is
water-cooled with Xbox looking fluid the
playstation 4 playstation looking fluid
Xbox ps4 switch HDMI out for a wired
controller so you okay there's a custom
stuff right here really that's all you
this is all you would need for the
person who has everything you put this
in the game room check that out
oh wait a second wait a second yeah
the switch is gonna slide in here and
dock you see the the USB type-c
connector you can freely remove and
insert a Nintendo switch that's a HDMI
switcher box on the front you can switch
with a remote control so you never need
to change the TV's input the TV stays
HDMI one the PC runs all the liquid
cooling pumps for the entire system
including the liquid cooling on the
consoles this exceeded my expectations
this everybody who worked on it check it
out man we'd call it the Big O this 2019
edition of the big old combines an Xbox
one X a PlayStation 4 pro a Nintendo
switch and an extremely high-end gaming
PC all into our flagship Genesis desktop
chassis the Big O is a testament to our
hard work and creativity when it comes
to PC building we're proud to share it
with you and your team to show the world
with the signatures everybody who worked
on it that's really that's cool if you
slide this panel up you get access to
your power switch Type C other USB
inputs and this is oh this is a switch
okay that makes sense and you're gonna
slide this guy in and dock it like that
holy Wow check this out okay so void Pro
RGB gaming headset in here PlayStation
controller you're gonna need that
connect your joy Kahn's in there too
that one Xbox one X it's gotta be
blacked out got to match the case of
course the premium headset stand with
7.1 surround so this goes with the void
Pro headset as you can see that's what
it looks like docked the m65 RGB elite
gaming mouse this is a mouse mat with
built-in USB pass-through of course a
gaming mouse pad obviously k95 RGB
platinum as you can see RGB colors in
the back mechanical keyboard MX Cherry
MX switches this thing is made out of
aircraft-grade anodized brushed aluminum
and I can tell from a weight
I think cereal
okay so we've got it all set up now it's
all hooked up and there's a couple
different ways that you can utilize this
the way it's going right now is that all
the systems the PlayStation the Xbox and
the Nintendo switch which is docked in
the front are all heading via HDMI into
this HDMI switcher on the front right
here which has a remote control to go
with it now that is gonna have its own
independent HDMI output which is going
to one of the inputs on this monitor
right here that we selected
that's the ultra wide latest 38 inch 38
40 resolution but most interestingly one
millisecond of response time is from LG
I'll link it in the description for
gaming you're gonna want a fast response
time in the millisecond department but
then you're also gonna want the
resolution to take advantage of having
like a $3,000 + graphics card obviously
so Kirk look at him Gila it looks
beautiful he's he's look at the
responsiveness look at the FPS it's over
watch he's eliminating the foes he's
even playing with Dave 2d I think right
now so how about that for a shout-out so
input one would essentially be all your
consoles input 2 could then be your PC
and the reason I think this makes sense
is because the consoles themselves are
gonna output likely a different
resolution than what the PC is capable
of as you can tell here this is a
unusual aspect ratio on this display
well PC gaming that's no issue just map
it out accordingly consoles on the other
hand not really doing the exotic
resolutions so you're gonna have black
bars when you switch over to PlayStation
Xbox or Nintendo switch so send them all
into the same HDMI switcher since
they're gonna be pumping out the same
resolution to begin with the other
potential implementation is more if you
plan on being a game streamer and you
want to stream games not just from the
PC but
also from all of the consoles then what
you're gonna want to do is utilize the
game capture card which is in here
capable of 4k 60 frames and then all you
would do on the same input on the PC
input you would just launch into the
capture card and maximize that frame and
then with no latency you'd be able to
play with your various controllers so
you wouldn't need to utilize another
input on the monitor now the last way
you could send the PC output to a
monitor like this one which can really
take advantage of the PCs capabilities
then you could send the HDMI output from
the switcher to like a TV which you also
have in the setup the singular HDMI
output from this HDMI switcher to the TV
and keep the PC active on the monitor
and then just flip between the two all
coming off of one single box something
cool I noticed on the back of the device
this hardwire this hard-line Ethernet
connection is coming from the Xbox you
would obviously want to have a wired
connection to the motherboard of the PC
then you could share that connection via
this Ethernet cable which is
pre-installed and connected to the Xbox
so the Xbox hypothetically would have a
more reliable connection so anyway ok
Kirk is on the PC he's playing right now
as far as he's concerned right now it's
a regular typical PC gaming type of
scenario now switch the input on the
monitor so he'll just reach over switch
the input and what you'll see is it'll
go right into Nintendo switch but then
he's like you know I won't play that new
spider-man which I have on the
PlayStation and then you simply use this
controller to switch the input so I'll
just hit number 3 now he picks up the
playstation controller and all sudden
amazing spider-man which by the way I've
been playing and kind of a joint in fact
open world style navigate around the
graphics webs fight combos of course
since there's also an Xbox in here I
could just simply hit number one on the
switcher he could pick up the Xbox
controller and now he's got the Xbox
love as well so he's easy ultimate gamer
status right now no matter where his
friends happen to play he just jumps
into that spot
and he's doing it all from one box in
probably the most seamless
implementation I've personally seen the
cool thing is if I take the switch for
example it's ready to go still that baby
just pops out and now you're taking the
Yoshi on the go you could slide the
joique on in look at this guy I mean
who's better than him he's ready he's
ready to game in any situation it's just
really cool it's really ambitious the
execution unbelievable I think Origen
knocked it out of the park
it's called the Big O it's a custom
thing as far as I know it's a
one-of-a-kind thing I just think it's
amazing
