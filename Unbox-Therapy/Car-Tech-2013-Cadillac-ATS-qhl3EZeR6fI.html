me is the brand new Cadillac ATS and as
requested I'm going to give you guys a
first look show you some of the
technology inside because I know that's
what you're interested in so without
further ado let's go ahead and take a
closer look at the 2013 Cadillac ATS so
as you can see it's got the red coloring
on this particular one you can get it in
a number of different colors you have
big 18-inch rims I believe they're
18-inch not all models come with the
same rims this is the top-of-the-line
model top trim line I believe it's
around 50 grand spected start a lot
lower than that in the high 30s so the
first technology feature I want to
mention is actually the handles you've
got LED lights right inside the handles
now besides being a feature to help you
find your vehicle maybe in a crowded
parking lot or something like that it's
also a really good look and since the
car features push-button start with
keyless entry you don't actually even
have to remove the key from your pocket
you just press this little button here
to lock or unlock the car assuming that
the key fob is close by now the car is
running right now so I don't I don't
have to lock or unlock it obviously I
don't even think you can lock it when
the car is running so go ahead and walk
around the exterior just quickly before
taking a look on the inside another
technology feature here is the adaptive
headlights these headlights here
actually going to move as you turn to
help illuminate the bend as you turn
around it's off there's I don't know an
animal or another vehicle or something
you're going to see it before you make
your turn
here's a closer look at the front end as
you can see sharp lines in the design
carrying forward the Cadillac look if
you will from previous Cadillacs you
have the emblem there as well
I'll move around to the other side and I
guess we should go ahead and jump in
maybe I should talk about the engine
we'll jump in the car first it's
actually a little chilly outside right
now this morning it's pretty early so
this one is the four-cylinder model
there are actually three different
engines you can get in here you can get
two different four cylinders this is
probably the one most of you're going to
be interested in if you're interested in
this vehicle it's got the turbocharged
272 horse
power engine to go with it you've got
four-wheel drive so this is going to be
a good choice I guess for those that are
in northern climates and have to use
this vehicle when the weather is not so
nice so looking around the interior here
you can see you've got all your normal
controls in the normal sort of locations
you've got controls on your steering
wheel we've got a big display over here
and everything in the center - center
console here is touch screen touch
enabled I should say including haptic
feedback which is kind of interesting it
takes a little little bit to get used to
I have to admit but after you do you
start to get the feel for it so
everything in here responds to your
touch with a little buzz much like your
smartphone does and as you can see
you've got your normal controls like
volume here I can control volume just by
swiping like this you can see volume
goes up volume goes down and on top of
that you've got just normal controls
that aren't swipeable but will turn on
you know your fans or things like that
climate control you can see it's it's
sort of reflected up in the screen as
you touch things down here heated seats
obviously are there as well I should
turn off the fan actually so you guys
can hear me better instead of the fed
the screen also has a proximity sensor
so if your hand is not near it if it
doesn't sense that you want to input a
press or something like that then it
will have this more sleek interface
where you're just seeing the song
playing and you know whether you're
listening to radio or you have nav on
and then as I come closer like this
you'll see the controls pop up so that's
a kind of cool feature because you know
these can look a little bit cluttered
when you're not using them and not as
elegant as the ride itself is now I
guess we should just dive right into the
technology might as well there's a push
button start of course put your foot on
the brake start up and and you're ready
to go that's beautiful this of course
has satellite radio that's what you're
looking at right now but as I come
closer you'll see you've also got voice
activation or I should say voice
controls that can control a number of
different elements within the interface
for media you've got a lot to choose
from actually you can use USB SD card
slot there's an SD card slot in the in
this section over here actually I'm
gonna jump
right in here quickly before we continue
on in here in the center console that's
what this is called
you've got auxilary two USBs they're
tough to make out you're going to have
to trust me on that there's an SD card
reader and there's also a little slot
over here worth mentioning where you can
put your key fob in if it runs out of
battery and the car won't start you can
insert your fob right there as an
emergency sort of protocol getting back
to the dash over here so you do have SD
for media as well as USB you can put a
USB thumb drive in here you've also got
bluetooth of course I got my Nexus 4
paired up right now so you can stream
Bluetooth audio phone calls all that
good stuff next what do we have next
auxiliary which I mentioned before and
you can just cycle through your media
options there's also traditional CD and
the CD player is in the glove box over
here it's not actually in the dash the
funny thing here is that's because the
dash has a really cool feature if I
touch down on the bottom right here
you'll see it lifts up which is damn
cool in my opinion
to reveal a nice compartment nice sized
compartment here which also features
another USB and something that's a nice
touch is that this USB is illuminated so
if it's late at night and you can't see
in there you can sort of see you can
obviously see at night because of that
illumination and you press here on the
front right here
I believe am i pressing the right spot
there we go and it'll lower back down so
a real cool way to hide your media
player your smart phone anything like
that as well as keeping it connected to
your system while it's hidden away let's
go ahead and jump back to the home menu
here within the home menu you can
actually move these icons around kind of
once again like your smart phone so say
I press and hold on settings and you'll
see that all of a sudden it becomes
movable I can move it over here and
it'll rearrange my dash if I want to
have it that way I can also move things
to different pages not sure why you'd
want to I know that if the car is
Pandora enabled or if you have Pandora
where you live you might see a Pandora
icon here as well you press the home
button when your fin
editing an agency I've changed around
the location of the icons
you've got audio is the first one I
guess that we should talk about the
radio has XM you can browse through all
your different stations in this manner
here now you can also scroll using the
scroll bar if you want to speed things
up so there is some availability there
to speed up the process of inputting
your channel if I exit from here we
should go ahead and look into the phone
phone is pretty straightforward you've
got your phone book as well as an
interface for inputting phone numbers if
you just want to dial in the traditional
manner there's nothing interesting on
this particular vehicle is the nav the
nav is actually multi-touch enabled
actually this whole screen is
multi-touch enabled so you can you know
pinch and pull like this to get closer
it does take a little bit to input the
data takes a little while it's kind of
load up a couple different things at
once
because they've got traffic enabled on
there and I don't actually have a route
enabled right now but you can also nudge
left and right it does work but it's not
the fastest if you're used to a smart
phone you're probably not going to be
all that impressed with the reactivity
of this particular you know - here but
it is a little better than some of the
other stuff that's on the market it
doesn't even offer pinch-to-zoom at all
you can go and you can nudge it a little
bit - but like I said before it does
take a little bit to get used to the nav
itself looks really good and there are a
number of POS and our had no problems
using the nav and you can also use your
voice to input destinations and things
like that so that's pretty standard fare
in in that particular area and
Department but as we move over here
things get a little bit more interesting
and a little bit more unusual you do
have a HUD HUD if you guys don't know
what that is that means that you're
going to have displayed up on your
windshield and and I'm pretty sure well
actually you can kind of make that out
let me see if I can zoom in here and
give you guys a closer look see that
they're just floating out there that's
my HUD and right now it's set to show
the speed I'm traveling at as well as my
rev counter there because this vehicle
does also include
shifters we have shifters on the
steering wheel as well as down here so
if you choose to use a manual mode or if
you want to switch gears you can do that
even though this is an automatic ride so
the HUD can be configured in a number of
ways depending on the height that you
are you're going to want to move it
around which is totally possible you can
see there I can move the HUD until it
will vanish at some point but I can move
the HUD around into the optimal location
we'll keep it right there for now maybe
that's a good spot yeah and then you can
also change what it displays so you can
have a speed limit warning you can have
the radio station you're listening to
you can have the direction you're
traveling in and nav so that'll also
update your turns and whatnot if you do
have a destination set and you're
traveling on a navigation route I don't
know I kind of like the look of the rev
counter I've been you know trying to
drive this car you know get the most out
of it so I've had the the rev counter
that you can also just a brightness down
here in this location everything is
controlled in terms of the HUD right in
this location here which might be tough
to make out on them you've got a clear
view there you can also control a couple
of other cool features down here
including your lane departure warning
which is pretty cool I'll explain that
right now there's so much technology on
this car guys it's I've already been
going ten minutes and I'm not even all
the way in there but you've got lane
departure warning and that is probably
one of my favorite features because it's
unusual it's not the way that most car
companies do lane departure what it is
is you actually get a buzz in your seat
that's right at the bottom of your seat
you're going to get a vibration that
lets you know if you are departing your
lane without signaling so it you know if
you're doing it accidentally if you're
swaying if you're sleepy you're going to
get a vibration on the right hand side
if you're swinging to the right and a
vibration on the left hand side of your
seat if you're swaying to the left so
very cool little alert system without
annoying everyone else on the car as
well you know some of those beeps get
crazy now on top of that you've got a
blind spot warning over on the mirror
it's going to illuminate right within
the mirror to let you know if there's a
vehicle in your blinds
that you need to be worried about so you
don't switch lanes when there's another
vehicle there in terms of the interior
I'm kind of jumping all over the place
but I just noticed the interior one
feature that I like which is on the side
on the doors on the side of the doors
and the interior here you've got these
brushed aluminum looking trim components
which I think are really sweet look and
you've also got really soft touch
materials everywhere leather everywhere
you've got the Cadillac little emblem
there in the center of the seeds the
seats are all leather trimmed as it as
you'd expect you know a luxury vehicle
all the way around I'm going to
concentrate more on the technology in
this particular little first look video
because that's what you guys are
probably most interested in on the
steering wheel you've got controls for
all kinds of things including volume
up/down you can switch between radio
stations this selector here controls
this screen another screen another
screen yet so this screen right here
underneath the speedometer can be
controlled and what you can do is if I
press this here so I'm just pressing on
this particular button between left and
right right will access the screen
towards the right now you can set that
for speed I get set it for tire pressure
I could set it for oil life distance to
destination if I have one set travel
time whoa check out this SWAT vehicle
holy smokes sorry guys I had it I just
had to interrupt that is a serious
machine you want to mess with those guys
I think they're going to Starbucks I
think they need some coffee there
they're up for a tough day today anyways
um so as you can see here you can set it
for a number of different things and
then a timer fuel economy fuel range
odometer and then if you want to shrink
it you just press over so I press right
one more time on this particular button
and that will shrink it or make it
larger and the same goes for the left
hand side I can pick another piece of
information that I choose to display on
a regular basis and then I can also do
the same in the center so ton tons of
configuration options here and really
you can set this thing up however it is
that you want to use it
and however it is that
suits you on the left-hand side you've
got your voice communication you've got
this is another cool feature here worth
mentioning but before I get into that
heated steering wheel and a way to drop
your phone calls if you choose to up
here we have a distance warning for
front in front of you
to avoid front collisions and this is
actually going to do the same thing it's
going to buzz your seat if you get too
close to vehicles in front of you and
you can set it if it's annoying you to a
couple of different methods so if I
click on it you'll see the gap adjust is
the way to adjust when it warns you you
can set a medium gap a near gap or a far
gap so depending on the way you like to
drive if you like the tailgate a little
more than others you can set the
adjustment so you're not getting worn
too often or you're getting warned just
as often as you like it now as I
mentioned before I didn't give you guys
a look here but you do have paddle
shifters not those are tough to make out
yet you do have paddle shifters on there
for driving slightly more aggressively
if you choose to now I got to remember
if I'm if I'm missing anything on this
vehicle or if I hit everything oh you
got a compartment down here I almost
miss this little there's a cool little
cubby hole there you've got your regular
power outlet cigarette lighter style
power outlet if you choose to charge
maybe another device in this compartment
here you've got a mode selector almost
missed that this is more driving-related
this mode selector will be reflected up
on this screen and you can set between
tour sport snow and ice and as I said
before this is the four-wheel-drive
model with the four-cylinder engine
turbocharged four-cylinder engine and
this particular engine puts out 272
horsepower so paired to four-wheel-drive
is going to be a pretty decent vehicle
to drive even you know in snowy
conditions wintery conditions there is a
rear-wheel drive also available which
would obviously be a little bit less
stable under those conditions up here
you've got your standard GM stuff which
let me see if I can bring it out yeah
there you go you get your OnStar of
course and controls for the sunroof and
your lights they're pretty standard fare
anyway that's a quick look I think I
went over most of the technology if I
forgot something well that's too bad I
don't want this video to go on to too
long one more thing that I almost forgot
to mention is the wonderful Bose audio
system inside of this vehicle not only
does it sound good but it has a very
cool technology feature it will
automatically adjust volume levels
depending on the amount of noise in the
cabin so if your driving conditions
change you're about to merge onto the
highway and road noise goes up you're
not going to have to reach for the
volume buttons on your steering wheel it
will automatically attempt to adjust the
volume of what you're listening to so
you could still hear it even as road
noise increases now this feature is
especially useful if you like listening
at lower volumes obviously if you like
to you know bump your music real loud
you're still going to have to do that
manually but it gives you a little bit
of adjustment that happens automatically
you really hardly even notice it a very
smart and very cool feature that I
haven't seen personally on an audio
system before anyways I think that
pretty much covers most of the awesome
technology features on this particular
ride if there's anything that I forgot
let me know down in the comments section
if you're familiar with this particular
car if you guys enjoyed this video
please remember to leave a thumbs up
down below as it does help out a bunch
and I'll see you guys on the next video
remember I'm renovating my new office
right now it'll be finished very soon
and I'll be back to regular upload
schedules very shortly thanks for your
support as always I'll catch you guys on
the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
