therapy and today we're taking a look at
a package from tokyoflash japan a
slightly unusual product to be featured
here on unbox therapy but it's exciting
nonetheless the guys over at tokyoflash
were cool enough to send this out to me
for review they said go on our site take
a look at our different models etc and
this is the one that I picked which is
called the stencil but they offer a
multitude of different designs and color
combinations so you're definitely gonna
want to head over to their website to
take a look at what they offer i'll put
a link down in the description so here
you can see the shipping box it's got a
slogan on it that says change the way
you think about time and that slogan
right there speaks to the fact that each
one of Tokyo flashes watches has a
unique method for telling time on them
now right about now you're thinking what
does that mean will you mean a unique
method well as I open up this user
manual or user paperwork here you'll
notice that the time looks a little bit
strange at first glance and this is an
example of what I'm talking about each
one has a sort of cryptic approach to
reading the time so that the user the
person who owns the watch is going to
glance down and see the time immediately
after sort of training themselves a
little bit but to the onlooker to your
know your average friend or something
like that they're going to look at it
and say how the hell can you tell the
time on their kind of thing you know so
it's a conversation piece a lot of their
watches our conversation pieces I'm
gonna go ahead and unwrap this one here
and give you guys a closer look so there
you have it right about now you're
probably saying I don't see the time in
there well think about the negative
space the negative space is what
represents the time like bubble letters
or bubble numbers this watch also has a
backlight on it sort of like the indiglo
watches of past so you're going to be
able to read it either at night or
during the day the nice thing about
reading it during the day is that the
lines within the watch our metallic or
reflective like a mirror almost finished
so if you're out in direct sunlight you
can really get a lot of contrast between
the lines and the negative space as I
turn the watch around here you get a
look at the back side you can see the
model name on their stencil with the
metallic back and of course the genuine
leather strap with a metallic clasp
so a real nice finish all around
definitely a classy looking watch with
the black strap it's also available with
a white strap and you can get the LED
backlit screen is LED or LCD any way you
can get the backlit screen in a number
of different colors from blue red green
so on and so forth Inc there's even
white you know there's a lot to choose
from in terms of combinations when you
pick up a watch from tokyoflash so I
want to get you guys up close and
personal here you can appreciate that
leather strap it has an embossed sort of
numerical pattern on there and once
again here's a look at the backside of
the strap of course identifying the fact
that it's genuine leather so here's what
it looks like mounted up on my wrist I'd
say I have an average to large sized
hand so you can get an idea of the size
and the way that it fits on me I had a
couple of notches left over so it could
fit a fairly large wrist because i'm
pretty sure that mine is on the larger
size at least when comparing it to
people around here so it will work for
either a male or female it's not huge
but it's not too small either so there
you can get a look at the back light in
a darker environment really cool and you
know it's a really cool looking watch
obviously it's unusual it's not going to
be for everyone but that's why I
tokyoflash has so many different designs
on their site so hopefully you can find
something suitable I'm really used to it
now I look at it now and I see the time
right away for example that's 1203 right
there but it did take a little while of
playing with it but after setting the
time setting the alarm so on and so
forth I was able to get the hang of it
so anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
