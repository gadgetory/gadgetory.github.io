and we are continuing the super macbook
pro project as you can see I got my work
space set up here for the upgrade I'm
actually using an official unbox therapy
t-shirt in order to make the surface a
little softer when I flip the macbook
pro over I don't want to get scratched
or anything like that and you can
actually buy your very own official
unbox therapy t-shirt now we have a
store set up we don't have too many of
them so if you want one click the link
down in the description and check out
the store we've also got sticker packs
if you want to check those out those are
a little bit cheaper anyways this video
is about this upgrade we're going to do
to turn this macbook pro into an
absolute beast
you can see here I've got some RAM
options from Corsair the one on the left
is the Mac memory we'll be using that
one first and foremost but you can
actually use even higher performance
memory which I'll be testing in a future
video but for the purpose of this
particular upgrade we're going to be
using the Mac memory 16 gigabytes worth
that's not nearly as exciting as all
this SSD storage right here these are
two neutrons ETX SSDs 480 gigabytes each
for almost one terabyte of SSD storage
I'll be installing those in a raid
configuration for ultimate performance
you're not gonna want to miss it now the
way that that's possible is by removing
the optical drive within the system and
replacing it with this bracket right
here which essentially turns a standard
optical drive slot into a slot capable
of taking another two and a half inch
drive in this case another SSD and then
I'll be setting up the raid in the
software when we get to that point when
we get to the software installation
process now you're going to need some
screwdrivers obviously in order to get
this job done this is a Phillips zero
screwdriver you'll need this one as well
as a Torx t6 I will link a kit down in
the description that has both so you're
ready to go and everybody really needs a
good precision set of screwdrivers
anyway so check out the link in the
description if you want to pick that up
and be sure that you've got the right
screwdrivers to do this job you want to
remove all the Phillips screws from the
bottom of the case now they're all
pretty much the same
least rlphillips three of them are a
little bit longer on the back edge you
can see along top so just keep that in
mind
so you don't forget when you go to put
it all back together on the inside you
can see where the RAM is you see what
the battery is you can also see where
the battery is connected now before we
start working the very first thing you
want to do is disconnect the battery you
don't want power going through to the
logic board while you're working so
that's the very first thing to do
there's a number of other steps involved
for the sake of this particular video
we'll be removing the RAM at this point
and then I will go ahead and remove the
standard the traditional hard drive
since I got this MacBook Pro stock
because I knew I was going to be
replacing everything this is just a 500
gig drive and it's really easy to remove
actually this tutorial would work even
if you just wanted to replace the stock
hard drive with an SSD of your choice
you just remove two screws from a
holding bracket lift up the drive and
then remove the actual SATA connector
and power connector from the back you're
going to want to be gentle because the
ribbon is relatively fragile the only
other thing you've got to do is remove
the four screws from each of the slots
on the hard drive I'll be doing that in
a moment but obviously I've got to open
up the first of our two SSDs in order to
you know install those screws into the
new one you have a bracket included for
adapting the 2.5 inch disc to 3.5 if
you're going to use this SSD as a boot
drive in a desktop computer if you're
interested in the specifications on this
upgrade you know if you want to know
pricing and availability on any of the
items that we're using I will link every
single item down in the description so
that you can replicate this build if you
want to or possibly pick and choose a
couple of components that you know will
work from this particular build so after
removing the Torx t6 screws I don't know
if I mentioned that but these screws are
Torx t6 so you'll need a different screw
driver for this particular objective so
you want to remove them from the old
drive put them onto your new SSD you
also want to glue on the little tab to
help you pull out the SSD in case you
ever need to then you reattach the SATA
connector and you maneuver the drive
back into the location that the
traditional hard drive was in you take
your mounting bracket
with the little rubber feet on it and
then you will secure that back down
using the standard Phillips screwdriver
one thing I want to mention at this
point guys don't over tighten anything
that's never a good idea especially when
you're tightening down plastic
components they can crack you can strip
the screws just don't do it just nice
and snug and then be done with it next
thing we need to do is remove the
optical drive because we're not going to
need it anymore there's a couple of
cables that have to be removed be gentle
with these as well trust me you can do
it this looks intimidating it's not just
be really really gentle you want to
remove all three of these ribbon cables
I don't know if the first one was
technically a ribbon cable anyways all
three of these cables in sequence after
you're done that you can start to undo
the optical drive it uses Torx t6 screws
as well so you'll be using the same
specialized screwdriver
unlike the Phillips tip and there are
three Torx t6 holding down the optical
drive as well as a couple of Phillips
screws that are holding down this top
portion here I've seen some people take
shortcuts and not actually remove this
and then be able to slide the drive out
I recommend taking this out as well so
you have more room to work with and
you're not really forcing anything now
there is one more Torx t6 connected on
this particular one in the top corner so
I'll remove that and that should
completely loosen up the optical drive
so I can go ahead and remove it but
we're not completely done with the
optical drive at this point you need to
remove a couple components from the
backside you have the SATA cable which
just slides out and then you've also got
a tiny little bracket with two Phillips
screws which helps to secure the drive
down to the logic board so both of those
need to be removed and they need to be
placed onto this mounting bracket that
we're going to be replacing the optical
drive with first I'm going to slide in
our second nutron GTX SSD once again
these are four hundred and 80 gigabytes
this is going to be insane performance
when these things are in raid zero the
bracket that I'm using has the mounting
screws on the outside so it's screws in
that way some mounting brackets I've
seen actually screw into the bottom
holes on an SSD you know you can
obviously figure this out depending on
the bracket you're using many nine point
five millimeter adapters actually end up
working and Amazon has a bunch of
selection you will
pay a lot for this particular adapter
they started like 10 bucks
once again refer to the description I'll
link everything you need down in there
so you don't miss out and you buy the
right stuff so fitting everything back
in is actually pretty easy you just go
in reverse of how you took everything
out so you want to maneuver this bracket
along with your SSD back into the
location that the optical drive came
from you want to tighten down those
three Torx t6 screws followed by the
Phillips screws make sure that your
cables are all back in the correct
location and that they are connected
because you don't want to have to come
back in here if something doesn't
function so double check make sure that
they are clicked in each of the three
different ones on this particular
section here lastly we have the RAM
which I'm putting in last you don't have
to put this in last but that's just the
way that I did it
it's actually pretty simple you just
angle it in there make sure it's fully
inserted and then you clip it down you
will actually hear a click and that's
how you know that you've installed it
correctly after this you want to re
insert the battery connector because you
want some power now and since you're not
going to be playing with anything on the
logic board anymore it is safe to re
insert the battery cable at this point
then you zip up the bottom plate using
the same screws that were removed
remember that the three on the right
hand side on the back of the laptop are
the longer ones and all the rest are the
same shorter style screws don't over
tighten these ones as well they can be
stripped fairly easily especially if
you're using a cheap screwdriver so just
touch tighten make sure that they are
flush and then you are ready to go the
next thing to do is to boot up the
MacBook make sure that you're getting a
screen and a chime this is what you
should see because there's no operating
system on this MacBook right now they're
two blank drives so you see the folder
icon in the next video I will be taking
the stock MacBook Pro hard drive that
came in here and I will be installing it
into an external enclosure at which
point I will boot into the recovery I
will put the two drives into software
raid and then I will install the OS and
do some benchmarks and show you guys
just how this thing performs I didn't
want to make
a video that's way too long so I'll make
a playlist when this thing is over but
expect the next video to be coming up
shortly and we'll actually see what this
thing can do anyway guys thanks as
always for watching if you're enjoying
this content make sure to leave a thumbs
up down below and I will catch guys on
the next video
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
