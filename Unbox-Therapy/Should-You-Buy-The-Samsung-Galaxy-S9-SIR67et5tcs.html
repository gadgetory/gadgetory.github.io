now I'm watching you see here's the
thing all right I told you a little
while back I switched over to the s9
plus and I thought it was gonna be a
painful experience because I was so into
the pixel to excel but then a few of you
guys who saw some follow-up videos in
your leg I saw he's using the pixel in
that video so he did that video was shot
beforehand all right I have legitimately
been using this s9 with my sim card in
it as my exclusive device I didn't reach
for this guy on the right at all it's
like Lou you told us you would switch
how does it break down how do I spend my
dollars I worked so hard for those
dollars what should I do
I have some thoughts but I want to talk
about a few differences few things that
I've noticed two things that matter few
things you should think about the entire
tech community is sorta in love with
this pixel device because of that
beautiful little camera up there pixel
to XL single lens can do some of the
dual lens effects that you've seen just
through software and one really nice
camera module on the s9 plus you get the
dual lens setup the variable aperture on
one of the two lenses bit of a gimmick
if I'm honest but it's still a two lens
setup so there is an actual two times
optical zoom straight up no zoom image
for image my eyeballs still like the
pixels to excell camera a little bit
alright I don't know why there's
something going on with the software
processing it just it creates a really
nice image that said you throw in the
little bit of optical zoom on the s9
plus and all of a sudden there's a
little extra versatility there I was
using it the other night I was at the
Raptors game
rest in peace Toronto Raptors I hit the
2x zoom all sudden I'm at it's like I'm
standing at center court for the tip-off
just a little bit of extra optical zoom
don't need to induce the digital version
the pixel nightmare the scrambled eggs
that are induced by that you don't have
to do it you got optical zoom because of
that I kind of like level the two out
little extra versatility over here
slightly better software over here
nonetheless you're making nice photos
with either of these I promise you that
since we're looking at the backs of the
devices here I might as well talk about
that to design functionality
first off the glass back situation not
really my thing
all right that's why I'm always talking
about putting like a case a leather case
or some kind of texture on the back of
it a glass is a bit dainty little
fragile little fancy might work for Jack
Jack's a fancy boy you already knew that
but there are advantages that come along
with it like one of my favorite features
in the world that many people will argue
until the end of time wireless charging
check the record books
I've been talking about wireless
charging for a decade it's a nice thing
to have I got the fast charger sitting
beside the bed I get home it's late I
slap it down no fiddling I never want to
be a fiddler I guess it's an instrument
a fiddle so that guy wants to be a
fiddler but that's he's the only one
anyhow you plop it down and now with the
new fast charging stuff over wireless
you're actually not giving up very much
in terms of speed either pixel to excel
no wireless charge that kind of got used
to not having it but then going back to
the s9 plus it was like you know I gotta
have it what are we doing this day and
age granted it means you get this glass
design you get this fingerprint magnet
speaking of finger prints these two
things they have much different
fingerprint layouts all right the pixel
to excel in my opinion here far superior
and the reason is the shape and the
location no competition with the camera
you know exactly where it is they look
at the shape of my finger is that more
rounded or more square this is what they
should be a nice little circle like that
capacitive fast
every time nail is now on the s9 plus
they did improve it over the previous
version I was really critical of the
location on the previous version because
it could quite easily be misconstrued
for the the camera lens like you could
mix the two up less so here because you
know it's the first thing you touch and
if you put a case on like I did and
would then you just look for the ridge
and bam but Samsung is still worried
about it because when you launch the
camera out it still tells you hey make
sure you got a clean lens because a lot
of people I hand this to a friend
actually
like what are you using these days Lou
that's what the real conversations
happen what's the phone in your pocket
should I buy one should I get it s9 plus
I took it out of the case I handed it to
him immediately
he reached up he put his fingerprints
all over the camera lens all right no
granted he would get used to it but I
get it from a design perspective but you
just can't compete with the layout over
here for capacitive finger prints now
you have other options on your iris scan
facial recognition but for me the only
face unlock that I really like is on the
1 + 5 t fast
kablammo that said security disadvantage
over the capacitive fingerprint I'll
still use the fingerprint scanner over
the face unlock and that remains true
with these two devices right here you
probably noticed an extra port there
that's a headphone jack useful I've used
it many times already it's much like I
was talking about in the apex video it
maintains a headphone jack alongside the
USB type-c connector we have a
traditional 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack it's not doing anything to the form
factor it's not making the phone bigger
or harder to hold there's a really no
downside if they can fit a headphone
jack in that device with like no bezel
anywhere I'm not satisfied with this
situation anymore I got a headphone jack
you don't go take a nap I do prefer this
texture though if I was gonna go
caseless the pixel 2 XL has a little
grit to it this has a little confidence
to it when you hold it if you choose to
go caseless this is probably the better
option from a texture standpoint but
it's not all rosy over here on the s9 +
side this Bigsby button is still here
hmm it's still there obviously I would
choose Google assistant 999,999 x out of
a million a million times out of a
million seem like why do you want to
battle with a system are you insane you
won't go head to head you won't go toe
to toe with assistant why don't you go
ask Siri how that's going I'm dying I
don't even need to feel bad about it
because you all know that already if
you've seen any comparison man everyone
is trailing so far behind and it's hard
to do hold the whole machine learning AI
scenario you can't just snap your
fingers
or some guy and be like yo so I try to
minimise Bixby's interference with my
day to day and the first step in doing
so was putting a different launcher on
the phone you're looking at Nova
Launcher right there even though you can
disable the bixby button now in the
bixby settings a left swipe will still
bring you there but if you replace the
launcher which you know in my opinion
you might want to do any ways to get
around TouchWiz then you eliminate the
left swipe to bixby that you might not
want so in this scenario Bigsby's never
coming up I got the button disabled no
big be there on the button and then the
left swipe is gone as well and the push
and hold down here on the home button is
bringing up assistant so I kind of
pixelized my s9 plus and it's the beauty
of Android you know turn the interface
into something that works for you of
course you can go in here and modify
even further the size of icons and so on
but nonetheless I made this look
essentially like my pixel and completely
obliterated the Bigsby button here okay
let's let's talk about overall usability
because I am such a fan of stock Android
it's like what is the downside of going
away from a pixel device onto a Samsung
device to a lot of bleeps and and Boop's
a lot of Samsung sounds and appearances
that come with it but they're negated in
a big way by just installing your own
launcher like I've done here in the case
of Nova all of a sudden I was like man
launchers are pretty cool this stuff you
can do the level of control that you get
over the appearance and functionality of
your device I know most users aren't
gonna dive into that alright well maybe
you guys will but maybe the people that
you advise they're not putting launchers
on are they I mean if they are I kind of
want to meet them I want to see the the
granny with Nova Launcher she's out
there somewhere I guess they're gonna
use the phone the way that it is and in
that case I give the software edge to
the pixel you're gonna get the fresh
software first on the pixel devices you
have to figure out how valuable that is
to you to have the latest features
immediately super slow-mo is another
advantage I will give to this device on
the on the camera mode even though it's
not super high res 960 fps is cool I've
never met a person that didn't think it
was cool so
it might not have the most day-to-day
usability but you pull that out and
you're gonna catch some attention it's
it's really super slow-mo Jack's gonna
sub in the clip right now with the
lighter and in it I mean you can tell
that's that's actual slow-mo and then
ain't some fake slow-mo speakers this
one is actually probably a tiny bit
louder but it's not firing at you to the
same degree you get a little high end
out of the earpiece region but on the
pixel and get two large grilles on the
front clarity is probably a little
better watching video on here from a
sound perspective but I actually think
the s9 might go a bit louder so that's a
wash as well there's some plastic
components here whereas this one build
quality wise like the entire frame is
metal they both got USB type-c the s9
plus gives you expandable storage
whereas the pixel choo XL doesn't I'm
starting to paint a picture here I'm
starting to feel a story here last thing
is the display but it's not even worth
comparing because obviously the OLED on
Samsung phones including the s9 plus the
latest and greatest
that's top tier everybody's buying these
displays from them to put them into
their devices like Apple because they're
the best in the biz look at the blacks
on there that's the absence of light you
can't beat it we know about the screen
issues on pixel to excel you will get
used to either display but out of the
box there's no doubt in my mind that
this is the superior one you guys see
where I'm going here see I sat down I
didn't know necessarily what I was gonna
say I was just gonna try to put my
thoughts out there and come to this
conclusion live I'm pushing myself to
make the best recommendation through my
usage and exposure to all be smart but I
mean that's really the job to be done
here that's really what I have to do for
you
if you're making a decision between
these two devices right now at this
moment I'm gonna say get the s9 plus you
heard this whole story you heard the
whole thing I did that video with all
those other tech youtubers which phone
is in your pocket right now this phone
was everywhere so where I phones it was
like a split I mean that's a lot of
people just being dead on it like look
this phone is in my pocket and this
phone is in my pocket right now
all right that really happened and it's
gonna stay there I'm not gonna switch
back I'm not sure the s9 plus represents
the best overall value in the entire
smartphone marketplace but I do think it
represents a better value at the current
price point then the picks will choo XL
for what you get but let's just do a
quick recap on the versatility offered
up by this device right here headphone
jack
check not on the pixel 2 XL wireless
charging it's on the s9 plus it's not on
a pixel 2 XL the camera maybe not quite
so good but again more versatile dual
lens setup for optical zoom it's over
here it's not over here expandable
storage it's over here it's not over
here display I'm giving the edge to the
s9 plus the beautiful oullette I'm just
gonna give you the advice put your own
launcher on pixelize your s 9 plus get
the best of both worlds and cherish the
versatility when you plug a set of
headphones in or when you slap it on the
wireless charger that's my pick I can
only pick one I'm forcing myself to make
the pick and it's hard for me to do like
I said I really did enjoy using this
phone it's still really nice it's a
great device but I'm supposed to tell
you
you know the truth on the matter that's
my job here taking it very seriously
recently the truth on the matter for
your dollars she works so hard for

this price category go out get yourself
