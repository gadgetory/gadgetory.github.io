mean it's part of the job new iPhones
you need me to check them out because I
tell it like it is no special privilege
these came from the store money bought
these things right here Tim Cook he
never came around the tweets went out
the retweets went out from you guys he
never came around no special treatment
from box therapy here on YouTube
alright now some youtubers they got they
got treated very nicely so I commend
Apple for at least doing that but in my
case not the case in my case but because
of that I feel free you know like a burg
I feel like I can just look at these
things evaluate these things interact
with these things like you do when you
go to the store and you take out your
card and and you you watch as your
hard-earned dollars are transferred to
the most valuable company on the planet
yeah that's right what are they a
trillion dollars will trillion dollars
where are you well one point zero five
trillion dollars obviously customers
they decide who wins and who loses in
this game so people they love their
iPhones and for good reason I mean let's
be honest let's have a little chat here
if it wasn't for that original iPhone
we're not here today I got to tell you
guys you know I get a rep from a lot of
people they say Lou you're always hating
on Apple look please hating on Apple I
wouldn't be here on YouTube without
Apple without the without Final Cut Pro
and and me experimenting with video
editing once upon a time that ain't me I
ain't that a turd I use everything it's
my job you see I have to look at the
whole scope so I take that
responsibility very seriously the info
the Intel I'm trying to deliver in front
of me right now I have the new tennis
and the new tennis max of course the 10r
is not out yet yes we are squarely in
the era of $1,000 plus premium
smartphones in some places these things
are up to $2,000 u.s. equivalent these
are expensive smartphones and they're
becoming harder and harder for me to
wreck
because of how good the cheaper
smartphones are getting but there's
always going to be people with money
there's always going to be people that
want premium and this thing this whole
experience it spells premium so let's do
it
let's check out what a premium unboxing
experience is like I'm gonna start with
the 10s max would you look at that
designed by Apple in California the
biggest iPhone the 10s max 6.5 inch
display there's no more home button the
home button is completely dead space
grey color that's actually a nice color
I like that now you have the glass over
top you have the power brick I've been
critical of Apple in the past because of
this power brick yes it's super portable
but it's not capable of any style of
quick charge it's a slow charger this
phone is capable of a quicker charge
they're just not giving you the brick to
take advantage of it so you will need to
spend extra money if you want to charge
your phone more quickly like you can on
various Android devices come on Apple
put the quick charger in the box please
okay remember guys we can't we have to
talk about stuff like this so that we
can hopefully see in the next version
that improvement maybe get the quick
charger without the extra 40 bucks on
the thousand dollar smartphone
nonetheless that's the power brick
earpods these are wired ear pods another
thing that's absent in the box which was
in the previous version is the Lightning
2 headphone adapter camera module up in
the corner here who will lend set up on
like the budget 10 R we have the larger
power switch just like on the iPhone 10
I mean this is this is really like a
scaled up iPhone 10 to be honest do we
have any plus I should do a quick
comparison actually there is the 8 plus
versus the 10s max so you can see the
footprint nearly identical if I hold
them like this it's basically the same
you still have the big notch at the top
necessary for apples style of face
unlock face ID there's a lot of tech
housed up in there so that's the
trade-off here is your first look at the
OLED display it's vibrant I mean this
this kind of is a must in my opinion
like if you're spending this kind of
money you got to be in the OLED
territory it's just more vibrant the
viewing
angles are so much better this just
emits a nicer image in my opinion I'm a
bit of a speaker junkie when it comes to
smartphones
the iPhone sounds better you know it's a
pretty big deal against the note 9
because the note 9 is one of the better
sounding smart phones I'm giving it to
the 10s max oh you have a quick size
comparison there - I'm impressed
with the sound it's pretty good for a
smart phone you know what this sound is
really good even on video like holy it's
super clear this thing is crazy
expensive but it sounds really good so
that's what your notch looks like during
video when it's up against a white
background it's a little bit more
offensive but here it's not so bad now
the thing about the notch is it's on so
many devices now it's kind of hard to
criticize it on the iPhone because it's
just like it was adopted by so many
including the device that I was most
recently using the Polka phone but at
least in that case you can turn it off
and just have it blacked out like the OS
will essentially put a black bar across
the top as if you had a bezel apple on
the other hand there's no option in the
settings menu to block that out the
knotch life is here to stay at least for
a bit that said still not my personal
preference let's check out the camera
real quick so I'm gonna go for a little
portrait mode here where's Connor
MacDougall move him into the foreground
I know he's a 1/8 of a smack look at
that beautiful bokeh in the background
that's what you're looking for in your
portraits actually grab the edge pretty
nicely around the hair that's that's
normally what I look for I'm not a huge
fan of these portrait modes I've told
you that in previous videos but as far
as they're concerned this is definitely
one of the better ones I mean this is an
$1,100 phone it's one of the best
cameras in the business let's go ahead
and do a regular photo so I can just
show you the difference this is what it
looks like with no portrait effect you
can see the depth of field is completely
different it's been a long time since
I've done an iPhone selfie in fact maybe
even a year iPhone 10 era circa my skin
tone is looking quite healthy on here I
look more alive than usual less zombie
like not sure I trust it jack is that my
actual skin tone
how do you feel about that I think it
makes me look a little more pink than
usual it's a hell of a selfie gets a
nice selfie honestly I expected to love
the camera on here in fact it's probably
the reason you would buy one of these is
a big reason is because of how great
their cameras have been and for how long
granted we got to keep on seeing things
through the lens see what I did there
through the lens of the price point is
it three times better is it twice as
good now let's go ahead and quickly
unbox the regular 10s
kablammo I don't know for me if I had to
choose one for the extra 100 bucks I
probably go for the larger one you get
the bigger battery I said in the recent
video the battery actually shrank on
this one from the iPhone 10 it's a
little smaller granted the processor
should be a little less power-hungry so
expect battery life to be similar to the
iPhone 10 let's go here we go
here we go
we have every single new iPhone 10s and
10's max we have the Space Gray but
that's kind of like pearl essent what
are they calling this just gold they're
just calling that gold now you would
really expect them to go all out on the
naming there it's not color I've seen
before there's a pinkish rose to it
actually we have silver with the white
back that's probably the last one I
would pick personally but it's up to you
and then on top of that we have some
special ones here courtesy of the brand
these ones have the new matrix skin on
them so if you're looking for something
a little more aggressive a little bit
more matte how about that ooh very nice
apparently there's a deal on these right
now 15% off site-wide so if you want to
get a custom look this is a nice way to
go okay so there you have it another
year another new iPhone the most
expensive iPhone ever this is in the
iPhone 10's max I know a lot of you guys
are interested in this as a lot of
iPhone fans out there in the audience of
course this is just a preliminary video
this is an unboxing video you might test
it out just basically whatever I can do
in my first impressions and so on but I
do intend on doing something more
comprehensive if you hope to see that do
me a favor and leave a thumbs up down
below to encourage me to do so but I
could possibly see myself switching to
this iPhone 10's max if you guys are
interested it's gonna be a little bit
painful but I might have to do it for
you it's quite possible alright 10 s max
10 s every single one unboxed here on
unbox therapy subscribe I'll see you
very soon
using my my android phone now
yeah I don't like the way apples and
treating people you know I'm talking
about coming clean these guys are you
know they're trying to pull some strings
here I think for a lack of a better term
and it's not working out for them
they're being opposed there's a there's
too many people they're aware of this
this scam that's happening the scam
called Apple
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
