phones could be the future well what
have you seen this yet take a look at
this video okay give it a peek
give that a peek look at that isn't that
cool Roy royal Royale Royale with cheese
Royale with cheese
it is the Flex pie foldable phone it's
all the rage everyone's talking about it
at CES and will you think it's the
future I kind of do I think it's pretty
useful it looks like garbage dude well
right look it could become a tablet or a
phone yeah that's true that's what he's
doing right now and I look it's cool
it's like science fiction kind of but
look at it flashing and it's jaggedy and
what about multimedia I mean the OS is
not really set up very well I know
Android is supposedly working on it but
in its current form
can you imagine carrying that thing
around like it's a slab in your pot look
at it glitching oh yeah
listen this is just a prototype I mean
yeah I guess you can buy it but 2019
seems like that's fairest right that's
fair well I will say in general I'm a
fan of ambitious products and designs
where they're going after you know
something that seems unattainable like
this idea of this folding display so
it's like everyone's look look what
they're trying to you know get people's
attention they're trying to reignite the
smartphone hype and so people are
reaching and I appreciate the reach the
ambition that Samsung's working on it I
mean they started with the know 5 or the
note series that had a 5-inch screen
like just going to a bigger screen exam
this is now every phone has so this is
the next phase a giant screen that that
that folds out it could be the future I
don't know if anyone in the comment
section is gonna be on your side right
now I'm gonna need to test it out check
it out for myself
I think right now it's garbage look at
this guy typing on the sandwich I do
appreciate the ambitious nature of it
the attempt the approach the idea that
the technology exists to be able to do
it I like pushing the boundaries all
that stuff good stuff but if this was a
physical product you buy right now or
recommend right now I mean holy smokes
it looks like a headache
imagine you pull that out right now as a
phone imagine what Otis would think it
would be kind of cool cuz no one else
would have it we did a video way back in
the day on that one
what was that device with two screens it
folded up your eyes just had a hinge it
was a ZTE device on the axon em from ZTE
and it was a you know there was a high
novelty factor playing with it games and
so on like you flip it open comfortable
and but the the value proposition wasn't
enough to justify the the strange form
factor you got a fatter phone when it
was in phone mode you got this sandwich
effect this extra hinge there was all
this extra hardware for this potential
moment when you flip it open now if
you're a serious gadget head you're
motivated by the weirdness of it then
you can make a point but as far as
folding screens being the savior for
stagnant smartphone sales I just don't
know if people are gonna be clamoring
for this type of an upgrade especially
when you consider there's been this push
industry-wide to like shrink everything
like slim it down eliminate bezels all
right let's see if we can get the other
specs on that device though Qualcomm
Snapdragon 8-series eight gigs of ram oh
so it's like a powerhouse in almost
8-inch display when it's unfolded 1440p
display AMOLED of course cuz it can fold
I mean that's not terrible a spec list I
don't think this thing is the future I
don't know what it is I'm just I've been
looking at this for a while
and I saw the videos come out of CES and
there's just something that feels off
about it and being a technology fan and
being that Inspector Gadget kid that I
referenced from earlier there is a sense
of excitement just because of the
novelty factor of like whoa you're
folding a screen you're not supposed to
fold the screen screens don't bold there
is that factor that wow factor you could
probably sell a few units on the wow
factor in a museum like it seems like
something you should have but when it
comes to day to day I don't know that
it's solving a problem effectively you
end up with a seven point eight inch
screen what kind of is what how big of a
screen is on this like six-and-a-half
already and it's crazy thin way lighter
a totally manageable form factor it's a
tough sales pitch if this thing goes
through and becomes a legit advancement
in the smartphone space it's going to
have to be crazy thin to the point where
when it's folded up it's similar to this
now I don't want these guys out there
saying all smartphones have to be crazy
thin but I think they do need to be
thinner than what Royalle or royal is is
showing off with this flex pie situation
at CES for now I'm gonna say it ain't
ready it's garbage that might be a
little harsh
it's kind of cool I'm not telling
anybody to order that thing dude I'm
just not doing it I think it's kind of
cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
