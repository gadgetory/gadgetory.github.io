another episode of deal therapy it seems
that you guys are a fan of the series so
far at least on Twitter and Facebook
that seems to be what you guys are
saying but more importantly than
anything if you guys like this series
make sure to leave a thumbs up down
below it helps out and it just lets me
know that you guys want to see more of
these anyways let's go ahead and get
into today's links first one not
necessarily a deal but just a reminder
that if you haven't yet pre-ordered GTA
5 now might be a good time to do so
especially if you're hoping to get the
special edition which is generally
pretty limited and it's available right
now on Amazon the link will be down in
the description if you want to get your
pre-order in for either console and I
also want to mention a special incentive
for Canadians yes finally Canadians get
a sweet deal that might be better than
our US counterparts so on the Canadian
Amazon you can actually get $10 off of
any other Rockstar title if you put it
into your cart along with your
pre-orders that's a pretty sweet deal
for people in Canada all the links will
be down below I'll have the pre-order
links for the US UK and Canada the next
one is kind of unusual but I like to
keep it fresh here on Deal therapy this
is an RC spider from our friends over at
airsoft RC they sell airsoft guns as
well as RC vehicles but this is not a
vehicle it's an RC spider so that means
remote-controlled for those of you or
radio-controlled for those of you that
don't know what RC stands for so you can
literally with a controller you know
move this this spider around your
premises so I was thinking it would be
funny to make like a cat video or a dog
video or something having them chase
this spider around or even to scare your
girlfriend or something along those
lines anyways it's on sale right now
it's 25 bucks regular 50 bucks this is a
weekly deal so you have to hurry up on
this one in our sea friggin spider next
we have a deal on the 32 gigabyte iPod
Touch it's not a huge deal but then
again deals are never really that huge
on Apple products so any kind of
discount is welcome it's 20 bucks off at
Best Buy or 24 bucks off at Amazon so
depending on where you prefer to shop
there's a four dollar difference I'll
have both links down below it applies to
all colors and the 32 gigabyte
sighs as I said before so you're gonna
get the iSight camera that you don't get
in the lower model so that's really the
model you want is the 32 gigabyte model
the next deal is a headphone deal I know
you guys love to see headphone deals
when available from Amazon they are the
clip I hate saying now hurt anyways
clips reference one on your headphones
they are $85 which is almost $100 off
their suggested retail price that's
really good and the reviews back these
things up significantly so if you want
to head over to the Amazon link read
some of the reviews and find out why
these things are so popular it's a great
deal on a great set of headphones if you
don't have a pair yet the next deal is
from case-mate if you haven't heard of
them they make high quality cases for
all types of mobile devices from your
iPhone to your Galaxy s4 to a bunch of
different tablets well they're having a
promo right now which will give you 10%
off the purchase of $55 plus it will add
on free shipping but you do need a promo
code for this if you're interested and
it's valid until July 31st the promo
code is save 10cm save 10cm but I will
put it down beside the link in the
description remember all the important
information is down in the description
so click that see more button or
whatever it is for everything you need
to know next we have some deals on some
awesome Corsair stuff you guys know I'm
a big fan of Corsair stuff you have
their headsets as well as speakers which
are 20 to 30 percent off on Amazon right
now so some of my favorites the
Vengeance mm wireless gaming headset for
PC I featured it here in the channel as
well as the SP 2500 high powered gaming
speakers some of the most powerful
standalone gaming speakers that you can
get with a massive subwoofer so some
great deals they are worth checking out
in the audio space remaining in the
audio realm the Turtle Beach XP 300
wireless gaming headset for consoles but
that the Xbox Live or for your
PlayStation 3 and hopefully the next gen
consoles that's also on sale on Amazon
so I'll put that link down below the
other audio link for the Corsair stuff
next we have super cheap HDMI cable this
is kind of a weird
but I thought it was worth mentioning
because there are some crazy prices on
HDMI cables out there and a lot of it
comes from a lack of understanding on
the consumer and there is no reason to
own a $100 HDMI cable so I thought this
was worth mentioning you can get a
6-foot HDMI cable from Walmart comm link
down below for two dollars and 78 cents
plus 97 cent shipping so grab a bunch of
these if you're in need of HDMI cables
and don't overpay for HDMI cables they
are all well insulated and it is a
digital connection the connection will
either be made or not made and they are
not nearly as prone to signal loss as
analog cables so you do not need to be
spending 100 or 50 or even $20 on HDMI
cables pick up a bunch of super cheap
six-foot HDMI cables from Walmart comm
and you will be good to go I guarantee
it
two dollars and 78 cents plus 97 cent
shipping next these guys were on the
show last week but they're back with a
different promotion it's PacSun I'm
trying to keep you guys looking good
especially in the summer months you
might not have a summer wardrobe hooked
up so you have a huge selection of 50%
off stuff and there is no need for a
promo code which makes your life all
that much easier but you can get free
shipping with a promo code more about
that in a moment
they got denim as low as 15 bucks
brand-name tees for 10 bucks you know
the brands are used to seeing at PacSun
you've got vans young and reckless we SC
Volcom blah blah blah everything you
need to know is down in the description
you can stack a code on top so you can
get free shipping as well like I said
earlier so it's gonna be 50% off a bunch
of stuff on the site no code for that
but then if you want free shipping to go
with it just use the code fireworks at
checkout and that should supply you with
free shipping on your order as well the
last deal of the day is for my friends
in the UK I'm trying to look out for
everyone it's tough to search for these
things it takes me a long time but
anyways ideal for those of you that are
in the UK I found a actually this is a
really good deal it's
on the Microsoft Sidewinder x4 keyboard
it's a gaming keyboard and it actually
comes highly recommended because you may
recognize it from the room tour slash
gaming setup video that I did for ali-a
last time I was in the UK he actually
uses this keyboard and it's an
incredible value for a gaming keyboard
you can save 32 percent right now and
get it for 33 quid you see that I'm all
up on my UK slang I didn't say pounds
anyways 33 quid from 50 and that's
available at Amazon UK dot co dot UK
whatever it is anyways the link is down
below so endorsed by you know somebody
who works on the computer all the time
and he was absolutely happy with it so
for 33 quid it actually looks like a
relatively great value and on top of
that it has great reviews on Amazon so
check that out if you're in the UK
that's especially for you guys I know
you appreciate it and I like to look out
for you guys whenever I can
anyways that wraps up this episode of
deal therapy I try to mix it up with a
bunch of different things I hope you
enjoyed the show you did like I said in
the beginning the best thing you can do
is leave a thumbs up if you want to go
one step more you can tweak this video
out share with your friends put it on
Facebook do all that fun stuff it helps
me to continue to do what I do anyway
guys wraps it up love you all catch on
the next video later
