people asking me just what kind of stuff
is in this gadget graveyard so I thought
I'd give you a little bit of a look
there's some nice stuff like fire wire
hubs and networking stuff as well we've
also got a dual USB car charger here for
obviously smart phones iPods or whatever
probably won't put these DVDs up there
obviously SD micro SD card readers
we got a fire Wave that's a 5.1 surround
sound external sound card for mac we've
also got the Griffin elevator which is a
laptop stand so you can get an idea to
kind of stuff that I've got left over
here we've got some iPad skins down here
look at this we even got the cult of
iPod Book different colors silicone
skins these are all basic now some of
this stuff is not going to be up on eBay
right now when you visit over there but
over the next few days it's all going to
be up there you saw some keyboard skins
as well from Isis day here's a bunch
more stuff we got portable USB hubs
there's a pretty cool let's see card
reader there as well there's also some
cleaning kits in here a shitload of
cables this is the Griffin I mic for
recording LPS and stuff on your Mac I
also got a bunch of laptop sleeves a
bunch of different designs backpacks
some different iPad cases some of those
book boa sleeves for your iPad that you
guys might have seen in a giveaway I've
also got some vintage Canon lenses and
of course the MacBook Pro components now
this is obviously for an individual
knows what they're doing but there's a
bunch of logic board and different
components that are still attached to
the cases as well as other components
that aren't now we've also got a bunch
of top cases these are the parts that
fit on top of your MacBook or MacBook
Pro along with the keyboards some
screens some more top cases some of them
are pretty mangled up there just a ton
of components so hopefully this will
give you better
idea of what's in there and definitely a
reason to check out the eBay page and as
always visit our channel we got lots to
look at</div></body></html>
