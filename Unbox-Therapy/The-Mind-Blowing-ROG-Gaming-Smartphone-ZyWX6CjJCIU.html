unusual in front of me it's a prototype
it's a smartphone in one of the most
unique boxes that I've ever seen it's
the ROG phone join the Republic it is a
gaming phone gaming phones are becoming
a thing and this is a very interesting
one
but remember front of me right now is a
prototype nonetheless this is worth
checking out let's open up this really
unique box check this out this is the
fingerprint scanner which is I've never
seen one with that shape on it before
type C headphone jack a docking
connector it's also got this interesting
adapter on the inside and it gives you a
headphone jack as well as a type-c
connector so when you're playing your
chords are going down type C tables
paraded a power brick alright let's get
some quick info on this thing optimized
Adreno graphics AR core support
ultra-fast gigabit LTE innovative game
cool system for 40% more power input 3d
vapor chamber cooling technology in
copper heat spreader course has got
Qualcomm Snapdragon inside 90 Hertz
refresh rate but it doesn't end there
the way this is gonna work is that
you're gonna buy this accessory with
this pre-installed on the bottom it's
not a secondary phone you're not gonna
pull pop it out and use it as a phone
tactile controls as well as well as an
SD card slot oh that was pretty easy it
just clips right in that is absolute
insanity
look how robust this desktop dock is
this is gonna turn your gaming phone
practically into a desktop computer
it'll dock in here like this and then
give you access to an enormous number of
ports this is wild SD micro SD
DisplayPort USB C 4 USB Ethernet another
display 4 HDMI and audio jacks what
maybe this can become the horse power
for someone gaming experience even at a
desk it's a wild thought with a dock
like this it is possible
corners okay so here's the device I've
got it set up now you can see screen is
turned on couple of forward facing
speakers front facing camera they're
cameras on the back dual this is kind of
interesting here this logo it lights up
it's RGB if you go to Game Center get a
bunch of details about what's happening
with your phone it gives you the
temperature and also the clock speed is
CPU GPU and so on you can actually
adjust the fan speed of the device
manually also so this is the aura
software and it allows you to customize
that RGB light on the back you can do
everything from a color cycle to static
breathing strobing and so on it's a 90
Hertz display also AMOLED so it kind of
fits somewhere between you know a galaxy
s 9 and something like the razor phone
so you get some gaming improvements now
probably the coolest feature on this
device have these things on the top
called air triggers this software that
allows you to map each one of these to
those locations of the display so that
you can interact with a mobile game in a
similar fashion to what you would do on
a console so a lot of this is controlled
through this game genie button for
speeding the system up using your air
triggers doing key mapping that's right
you can actually connect this device to
a dock and then use a keyboard and mouse
to play mobile games which you probably
think is crazy but in many parts of the
world mobile gaming is taking off it's
becoming the most prevalent platform for
gaming in general and so now all of a
sudden as these devices improve from a
performance standpoint there's a reason
to take advantage of features like that
on mobile it goes even deeper than that
you can go live from here you can do
display scaling you can record your
gameplay this is an actual functioning
fan which will cool down your device
allowing it to perform better over
longer periods so as you can see the RGB
it carries through onto this adapter you
can actually hear the fan and again
because this thing can increase
performance the phone won't need to
throttle its performance if it can stay
cooler this is the insanity this is not
something I ever expected to see this
screen on the bottom and the physical
kind of contraption it's a control
this is just a display on the bottom
with a built-in battery 6000 milliamp
hours to provide power to your phone
which lives on the top so the phone can
be extracted from here and inserted you
can actually do two different things on
each of the two displays maybe in the
future one thing on both once developers
get access to this particular device
right now the setup is a game on the
bottom and then twitch on the top the
ability to stream mobile gaming on
Twitch with chat in one pocketable
little situation an SD card slot
I don't know store some movies whatever
you like a type-c connector to keep the
whole thing charged have youtube or a
web browser open on the top display and
then anything else on the bottom one
it's basically multitasking on your
smartphone with a dual display setup how
about this mobile gaming on a PC style
setup with a mouse and keyboard are you
serious what are you into I want to know
if I can report it to the authorities
the precision of the mouse and the
keyboard together so you could have this
little dock next to a TV next to your
computer setup of course it has all the
peripherals connected the dock is
multifunctional how powerful can the
phone get so this is a wireless video
receiver which is going to take
transmission from the device and then
pump out an HDMI signal so this is the
last piece dongle setup type see a major
solution for competitive gamers on
mobile because you have the landscape
port you have this one you play like
this look no interference at all and
then your other connections come down
here to the dongle itself this is now
the living-room scenario where alongside
that wireless dock that I mentioned
before the wireless receiver now becomes
a sort of makeshift console where I
could leave that tactile controls
shoulder buttons and it's all happening
on this big 65 inch display of course
this display could be any size that you
want I mean who's better than you oh I'm
dead so somebody's definite
better than me talk about bragging
rights you're like what do you do with
your phone huh as mobile games continue
to improve get better be dominant games
like fortnight pub G I named them I
think the demand for this type of
hardware it kind of goes up alongside
the improvement of the software so maybe
not now but definitely not never
the ROG phone the latest in the realm of
gaming phones and possibly probably the
most fleshed out from an ecosystem
perspective it's modular it can do a lot
of different things and it's finally
starting to make the case for why these
gaming phones should exist and who they
might exist for now you let me know you
tell me down below in the comments are
you ready for a gaming phone do you see
a purpose is this the coolest thing
you've ever seen in your entire life I
want to know thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
