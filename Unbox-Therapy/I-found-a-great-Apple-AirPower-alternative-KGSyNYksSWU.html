to do a quick announcement believe it or
not there are a bunch of members on
unbox therapy not just subscribers
they're a step better they're elevated
elite class members the special parts
for those members as well there's a
button down below this video you could
become a member yourself so go check
that out
Hot Tamale Apple they cancelled their
air power product it's been covered
everywhere including on this channel
everyone was talking about it it seemed
like a simple thing this idea of a
first-party wireless charger from Apple
they end up cancelling the product that
so many people apparently were waiting
for people started to point to an
alternative from a company called Nomad
but then that thing was sold out
everywhere because those that had been
waiting for Apple's official first party
product went out and purchased that one
then I was surprised to have this pop up
maybe the perfect alternative to Apple's
own air power or the absence of it
unravel it supports apple watch iphone
samsung galaxy and more so it will also
charge up the watch that's another thing
that air power claimed it was gonna be
able to do and if you look at the
picture on the side here not only does
it work as a triple device charger but
it also folds up kind of origami style
in order to do so it has to have some
pretty serious power 3 10 watt fast
wireless charging panels they've also
included this 60 watt type-c adapter I
don't know anything about this company
prior to this package arriving it just
showed up so this is my first experience
with it too but the moment I saw it I'm
like man that could be the solution that
everyone's looking for and wanted
anti-slip runners Apple watch compatible
panel and position locking magnets I
mean that sounds pretty good to me so
this is the product interesting so it
folds up like this
it just pops open like so to more
typical qi wireless charge
let's see if we can figure out how the
other modes work well there's two sides
to that that goes like that
that goes like that Oh Oh manual time
like this oh and the magnets just pick
up did you see that that's cool and then
you would just take a phone and you
would just toss it on like this in
landscape mode the single mode which is
like this so it takes up less space they
also included a couple of more colorful
ones this one over here
fire emoji red glow in the dark ah okay
so just one just glows on the sides
there's a little cutout here for the
Apple watch you probably can't even see
it it's a tiny little divot there let's
get this plugged in let's see if it's
legit so it's a c2c connector over
charging protection once your device
nears a full charge the current will
automatically reduce to a trickle for an
object detection low heat and
overheating detection this seems like
the product Apple was trying to make so
here it is fully functioning this is how
you would use it and I gotta say I'm
pretty satisfied from a functionality
standpoint it's all right there you drop
it on charging straight away okay great
Blue means charging then in a case of
the air pods you see the red light red
means fully charged as you'll see with
these air pods over here if I flip them
open 100% hundred-percent and the Apple
watch section doesn't have to be just
for a watch you'll see if I place down
the p30 Pro on there boom okay so that
one starts charging up as well charging
up charging up charging up this mode
over here you'll pop open this section
could drop it on like so you see it's
charging straight away you could pop
open you tube this is the bedside table
format I think people will use this for
the alarm clock as well this one just
drop it on it's charging it's simple now
this one also has the light on it so we
should check what that looks like real
quick maybe kill the lights it's pretty
subtle it's not it's not glowing too
much and then there's a red one so
that's another option as well you can
pick whichever color you like I mean
this thing is functional it does the
trick it's actually here and air power
isn't you just pop them on and they
start charging right away it's quite
convenient to be honest it's called on
Ravel the company called ampere
something tells me it's gonna be pretty
popular product even Apple couldn't
produce the thing so just from that
standpoint alone that it's here and it's
working I think that's impressive to
begin with and then possibly beyond that
when I use this on a day to day I'm
gonna go do that now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
