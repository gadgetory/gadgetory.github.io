here they revamped the gaming lineup as
well and I saw one particular model that
was of interest to me which was in this
new finish they're calling it mercury
not the typical black matte black type
of finish that you've seen on Razer
gaming laptops in the past so I was like
you know what I haven't checked out one
of these in a while so maybe I should
start with this this new color
especially since these studio laptops
that they're putting out very shortly
are gonna have a similar color to this
one I'm like alright let's see what that
feels like and looks like in a razer
package and of course the specs have
been upgraded big time here as well
we've got an i7 9750 H processor there's
a 240 Hertz display now this unit is
available with a couple different
display options you got the 240 Hertz
1080p for the gaming centric audience
there's also a 4k display available on
the 15-inch
this one has 512 gigs of SSD storage and
the r-tx 27 d processor inside these
guys have made a name for themselves and
they're branching out Will's been in
touch with Razer as soon as we're done
with this one and those ones are
available I'll showcase that one also
because you have the graphics card the
high power graphics cards you're gonna
need some juice for it so you have this
braided cable and this proprietary
connector which I have to say is a
little bit better than your typical
barrel style connector in my opinion
it's a 2 30 watt unit so actually fairly
compact when you consider the amount of
horsepower in that guy right there
got the Razer green on the bottom of the
box what a package they've put together
here whoo all right so it's got a
metallic look to it it's like a it's
like a bright silver in fact Willy dudes
gonna give us a quick Space Gray
comparison this is lighter for sure than
Space Gray there we go that's Space Gray
versus razor mercury a lot of input
output over here a couple of traditional
USB ports headphone jack this is the
proprietary power connector one more
traditional USB type-c probably in the
form of a thunderbolt then you have
DisplayPort and HDMI and it looks like
Kensington lock is also there
like this I like that look a light
keyboard as well some people gonna love
it some people maybe not so much if you
were to see this from a distance you
don't really feel like that's any kind
of special gaming laptop at all it is an
option you do not need to pick up this
particular color one of the other things
I should mention with the lighter color
it's no fingerprint potential at all
that's what fingerprints look like on
this surface I like that that's
appealing to me now as I mentioned this
one has the crazy 240 Hertz refresh rate
on the display Full HD 1920 by 1080 15.6
so that's gonna be appealing to gamers
specifically a couple of speakers
front-facing which I like the display
also matte finish big fan of that as
well so this this laptop has a lot going
for it right now so we get the backlight
on the key caps and right away it's this
kind of cool blue color it's cycling
through the RGB as it would it's a razer
product still this is the first look at
the display I'm pretty happy with it
you've always got one of these very
colorful razor backdrops there's two
ways to look at the 15 inch display
option you can go to 4k get the extra
pixels maybe you're into some sort of
design work or video editing or you just
like a lot of pixels but the downside
there is you're driving all those pixels
even when you don't really need them
we're having the lower resolution
actually might give you a slightly
better battery life and of course a
different cost I'm kind of split on this
as far as which one I would go for this
one looks plenty good for me if that one
end of the spectrum you have like the
Acer predator remember that thing that's
one end of the spectrum it's really one
functionality person and everything else
and then on the other end of the
spectrum you have something like this
this also has the Windows hello the
infrared camera so it has face on lock
which is nice Doria I'm actually gonna
do some gaming - how long will it take
me to download like overwatch or
something well ready
all right so I have a game loaded I have
a gaming mouse hooked up hello see
that's how you that's how you famous
severally I've got over watching sold
and I have it at 240 Hertz it's like
it's crazy smooth obviously the game is
playing a 1080p right now and I'm gonna
go get killed for you now a couple dudes
dead couple dudes dead there it might
seem like I know what I'm doing I
promise you're not I just know big gun
lots of bullets that's all I know
whoa what'd I get hit with there I mean
I got somebody I don't know so we lose
we lost okay that's a fun experience
like could I get into gaming is that
possible maybe you can do the thing with
the whole rig and the lights and it you
could swap graphics cards and you could
build a gaming PC obviously I've done
that in the past when I was younger have
more time I'm starting to come around to
the idea of the gaming laptop because
it's like you make the case to own it as
your computer and then it's like and it
can game and experience you can have on
this 15 inch blade with the 20 was it 2
2070 that's in here well yeah RTX 2070
it's like man that says what that's all
you need guys do you need more than that
will maybe you would prefer to have a
mechanical keyboard or something I guess
you could you could add that the 240
Hertz display 1080p is plenty and it's
kind of nice matte finish and then you
kick out of this you exit the desktop
like that you unplug this guy and look
at you I mean you what do you do you go
to the meeting now look at you Jeff you
go to the meeting they don't know what
you've been doing they don't know what
you've really been up to gold medals and
whatever it was I was up to they donate
they don't know and here's the face
unlock boom you didn't see that did you
catch that the speaker sounded good in
game but what about like music what
about YouTube I know our audio is pretty
good on the loo later channel so
obviously you've been left out of the
smartphone conversation a little bit
lately there's been so much going on I'd
say they're pretty good the MacBook is a
bit better
given the entry point of their products
the price point way more base for their
products like the like what it costs to
potentially some some sort of shots at
companies like relative to the rest of
the technology marketplace when they're
side-by-side you notice it for sure that
the audio is much louder on the MacBook
Pro but there are a lot of laptops with
terrible sound this is not one of them
should I play a tune
it's good enough a lot of people gonna
be using headphones so let's just let's
just keep that in mind what can I say
about this laptop I like it I guess you
can probably tell I like it it's a
powerful computer let's say it's a
powerful laptop without your typical
powerful form factor what's the weight
of this will I'm gonna say it's like
five pounds 4.8 man I see Jack come on
man hey I wasn't born yesterday in this
game this might be my favorite razor
laptop ever Willie do just informs me uh
this guy starts around 1500 goes to
three grand
thirty three hundred bucks okay not
cheap nope not cheap by any stretch of
the imagination
let's get wills opinion we'll come on in
you're a guy you're known to have tried
video games before I'm a fan of
overwatch yeah they're doing some pretty
cool stuff it's a fun game man yeah it's
a teamwork than a situation like you
could dominate on your own dude really
yeah
but ultimately the goal is a team
victory it is yeah yeah yeah what do you
think about this guy right here
I've always liked Razer products the
look that the laptop game their designs
are really really sleek it's a slab yeah
it's kind of like a Microsoft Surface
laptop there you go anything over like a
hundred Hertz is amazing for games
bananas I guarantee you like it can
really help with your game like you're
aiming it's just some more percent more
tight it's just so much more into it
yeah see you get the feel yeah yeah
Willie do the ladies each other for a
fan of it I'm a fan the little pricier
it's okay
it starts at 1500 which is not bad yogi
yeah it is yeah it's fine he loves
raiseth areas that's him a man in the
world playing games Willie this episode
is brought to you by IBM for all you
programmers out there or anyone starting
to program IBM developed a few lessons
to help you get started on this a drunk
now it's called IBM developer and allows
you to quickly and easily program your
drone to do stuff like this
like this now with little or no
programming experience I managed to
build out this little UI with simple
controls so you can see here I have the
acceleration both XY and Z you got the
speed and you also got the battery life
here and you got simple controls or
left/right you can actually do a back
flip or front flip you can also connect
the drone to IBM Watson and he uses
visual recognition to identify objects
that the drone sees so all in all this
was pretty interesting IBM's given out a
couple of drones check out their website
on the link below and you can get more
information about their giveaway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
