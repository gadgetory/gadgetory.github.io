therapy calm and as you all know I just
picked up a Nintendo 3ds and it wouldn't
be too useful without some games for it
so as you see I picked up ghost recon
shadow Wars as well as steel diver now
I've heard a lot about this Ghost Recon
game and I'm looking forward to it it's
a totally new style so let's go ahead
and get inside pretty much know what to
expect in here just wanted you guys to
share in the excitement both of these
games are going to be part of the
official 3d s review which I'm still
working on as you all know I want to
make sure I cover everything it's gonna
be an incredibly extensive review which
is why it's taking so long for me to
finish anyways you can see we got these
new 3ds style cartridges and they're
incredibly hard to get out of the case
let me see if I can get it there you go
hopefully that'll loosen up over time
anyways they're these little miniature
cartridges like I said and I've actually
got an accessory kit with some cases
that hold them that aren't quite so big
a couple of manuals since we're up here
in Canada we got French and English not
gonna get too much use out of the French
version but that's just me let's move on
to the next game so we've also got steel
diver and this is an augmented reality
style game so this will be interesting
to get used to seeing more of these
movement requiring games it seems like
all these different systems are trying
to get you up out of your seat you know
whether it be Kinect their PlayStation
Move and now these augmented reality
games for your handhelds
so as we pop it open we see the same new
style little cartridge of course and a
couple of vouchers it looks like yeah it
says we're going to earn some exclusive
rewards so that's cool got another
manual that's a very slim one and it
probably shares both languages Oh picked
up another game while I was out this
one's for the ps3
it's another one of these Star Wars
games and I happen to love these things
you know you just want to chill out you
know do some fun style gaming you know
you know you don't want to go shoot each
other up Call of Duty style maybe you
just want to relax and kick some ass
Lego style that's what these are for
so anyways is obviously being a few of
these I've had tons of fun with every
single one here we've got our ps3 disk
got Yoda on there
seems like Yoda oh yo ders on the disk
and also on the cover and here we have
the world's slimmest little manual I
think it's like about six pages maybe
five look at that thing
oh well save the trees I guess eh
anyways you guys should subscribe to the
channel we got a lot of gaming coverage
we got iPad coverage we got 3ds coverage
it'll be worth your while</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
