another video and today I've got
something that happens to be the world's
smallest this is the world's smallest 3d
printing pen this thing here will allow
you to draw three-dimensional objects
see how I'm doing that there and as the
material comes out of the pen tip it
hardens in real time it's a very unusual
experience to crack it open whoo that is
pretty slick look at that kind of got
like a military vibe to it like a
tactical pen this is cool so there's
like some designs to get you started
here cuts a little elaborate probably
not going to start there so this is ABS
black filament these little strips are
what become the eventual structural
component of your 3d object some color
ones so it looks like standard USB on
one end power connector on the other
this plugs into the back of the pen
right there let's get this baby booted
up and see what I can create the
filament it goes in I don't know if you
can see that there Jack that little
channel there let's start out with the
black filament goes right in here Wow
200 degrees Celsius the bottom gets do
not touch the tip holy got one led to
one so I guess I got to wait a minute
you can also adjust the rate of
extrusion I don't know which is better
for me probably slow oh we got something
coming out yes
much better now not really probably not
doing this right definitely not doing
this right going for it anyways you have
to really make an effort to stick it to
the page
look at that I like how loading this one
up is pretty straightforward I'm going
to try and make like pyramid points at
each intersection here see if I can do
this
there's my structure of some kind look
at that thing
3d doing it all let's get some colors
going on
like for the ability for that thing to
stay upright as you're drawing it where
is the point of failure oh ho it's like
a plant there's a much more organic
feeling to this like this is like some
kind of life-form
it's like mimicking like some kind of
natural thing
this one gets hot it's hot to the touch
obviously you can you can now appreciate
just how artistic I am what's
interesting is once you go to the next
color you usually that next color is
what pushes down the remainder of the
the last color you were using I think
the most amazing thing to me about this
material is how strong it is somehow all
of my 3d pen creations end up looking
like something out of a Tim Burton movie
we're gonna need Oh snapped it good as
new unbox therapy just turned into art
class
it's what you're in welcome to art class
therapy there you go it's Tim Burton's
sienta Oh No No
who knows what my future holds obviously
you could tell them an architect if
you're one of these people that you
could imagine prototyping the next
masterpiece using one of these you
should definitely try it out it's a
really unique experience drawing in 3d</div></body></html>
