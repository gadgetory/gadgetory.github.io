pen there's something satisfying about
it when you're using your finger you
have obviously a limitation of precision
now the thing with your finger is it's
useful right you have many of them you
can do lots with these it's really the
thumb to be honest with you right that's
what separates us from the other
creatures the thumb allows you to grip
things carry things anyway bottom line
is think of it this way and I've been
thinking hard on this because I'm really
trying to give this phone a shot as my
daily device and I feel like I haven't
invested enough time in s-pen life in
the s-pen lifestyle to accurately gauge
whether it makes sense or not daily for
me like when compared with the standard
phone but here's a little analogy that I
thought of fingers have been around a
long time no seriously though fingers
have been around a long time and so have
instruments like this pens in order to
circumvent having to use the finger now
when you're a kid when you're a child
you do things like finger paint right
the level of precision that you're
expected to get with your finger is is
limited by the instrument itself I'm
sure there's some like finger painting
master out there that you guys are gonna
link me to and be like no Lou you're
crazy look at this guy he's doing what
is it van Gogh with his finger okay fine
that's that's a fringe case for most
people when it comes to precision for
like a physical input this tip offers
significantly more precision than a
finger ever could and most artists would
probably tell you the same you know
another thing too is finger prints this
is a weird one I'm not sure I've ever
heard anybody talk about this but these
displays get gunked up with garbage from
these like you touch everything with
bees I know you do
meanwhile there's a guy who like wears
gloves everywhere because he's a
germaphobe ease like no I don't live
finger prints aren't a problem for me
Lou I wrapped my fingers in cellophane
you are not included in this scenario
but essentially these are prone to all
kinds of garbage coming back to the
with the pen why on desktop computing
platforms haven't we completely switched
to touchscreen to interact with your
hands rather than a mouse and keyboard
for precision pointing device why do
people keep reverting back to the
precision version even though the
convenience of the hand should outweigh
it like it has in mobile devices so I
don't know listen I feel like there is a
place for the pen in this world I don't
know if anybody's completely cracked
that nut but I do think we're getting
closer and this might seem weird but
this little click on the end this little
satisfying kind of I don't know is that
it is this obsessive-compulsive for me
to be so satisfied by this I have done
it for 10 hours straight and that's the
longest I've done it there's a certain
satisfaction you get from the click
which leads me to believe that the click
in and of itself might convince you to
pull the pen out more often just because
you're missing the click that that
sounds crazy but that little activity
you might be sitting there looking at
that I mean you know I'm gonna extract
that right now not because I have
anything to write not because I'm gonna
interact with my device but because it's
like a habit not like a habit a habit
does that mean the S Pen will make an
appearance more often for people who
have bought the note let's say the
previous versions for example and under
utilize the pen just forgot about its
existence maybe we need an addictive
habit to force us into really trying to
utilize it anyhow back to business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
