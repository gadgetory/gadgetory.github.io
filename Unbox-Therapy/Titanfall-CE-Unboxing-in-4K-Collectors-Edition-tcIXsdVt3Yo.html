a very exciting unboxing for you this is
the collector's edition of titanfall
I worked very hard to track one down so
hopefully it's as exciting as I expect
it to be but Before we jump into that
unboxing I want to give a big shout out
to the sponsor for today's episode that
is Boost Mobile they've actually got
some great deals happening right now
if you switch over to Boost Mobile
before the end of the month you can get
$50 off of a device there's no contract
necessary and they've got a number of
different plans including unlimited talk
text and data so do me a favor click on
the link down in the description check
out Boost Mobile and all of the
different deals they've got up for grabs
and help support the show at the same
time alright let's go ahead and jump
inside this box so just before we open
it up I want to give you guys a closer
look at the box and the artwork since
this thing is so massive it's kind of
tough to portray it to you here in this
video I had to modify my space just to
show it to you but you get to see the
packaging in brilliant 4k detail I
should also show you what the back of
the box looks like as well the back
identifies everything that you will find
inside including the largest item which
is the Titan figurine with diorama the
game as well
there is a collector's edition book to
go with it enough about that we have the
box here so why not just open it up so
bear with me on this one as mentioned
this is huge so I'm gonna try my best to
do this in an elegant fashion and pull
this out maybe it is taped on the bottom
as well oh never mind it does open that
way geez Lou get with the program whoa
if you guys aren't a fan of the word
whoa or wow then I'll ask you to leave
this video right now because you're
about to hear a lot of it top of the box
you've even got titanfall in the
styrofoam here is the certificate of
authenticity limited edition titanfall
Lecter's edition statue so this is a
very detailed portion of the larger
figurine I'm assuming because of this
little peg coming out of his foot oh it
looks like his barrels a little bit bent
there we go that should fix that so
here's another one same deal
looks like he's going to fit on to the
larger figure pull this out holy smokes
this is packed in here very well haha
this is this is difficult I'm gonna pull
the whole thing
hopefully not destroy everything oh all
right so it's well padded and that's a
good thing means that we're not gonna
have a broken figure wow that's wild
that's the biggest figure I have ever
received with a collector's edition you
can see the scale there there's me
beside it and there's a figure wonderful
sound of fresh styrofoam I will be
honest with you guys I have not played
any titanfall not the beta nothing so
this is going to be a fresh experience
for me so Statue kind of a big deal
let's get this giant box out of the way
and inspect this statue more closely
boys and girls this is it ladies and
gentlemen
wow it's giant
the quality is insane the level of
detail also insane insane in a good way
of course make sure to bump up your
quality settings on the video if your
computer can handle it word of warning
may crash your computer if you watch in
full res but this is 4k resolution right
here and you can really appreciate the
detail when you're checking it out
unbelievable so this is obviously the
biggest deal in this unboxing video at
least in my opinion although I do like
the art books oh I should see where
these other guys fit in I could always
read the paperwork but you know I hate
doing that oh he looks to fit they're
sort of here's the paperwork right here
come on Lou read a little bit of
paperwork for once geez statues
what the on/off switch there's an on/off
switch oh my goodness but where this
rock right here and that can is what
opens up the battery compartment and
then this little rock actually controls
the lights on the Statue there you go so
it lights up in this region here blue
and some red lighting on that guy up
there I'll just sort of rotate this
around for a moment so you can really
appreciate all the detail it exists on
there you see a flashing light activated
at the back there Wow
hands down the coolest figure I have
ever received in a collector's edition
I'm going to put that to the side for a
moment okay so here are the other things
inside the package first off we have
this poster which I will unfold here
operational zero nine point two three
let's just get the game out of the way
see if there's anything exciting on the
inside it should just be your standard
kind of setup okay so of course we have
some DLC and as usual you guys can have
it so the first person to register this
DLC is going to get a two-day Xbox Live
Gold trial there you go
hurry up guys as always bonuses here on
unbox therapy so there's the game on the
left-hand side lastly we have the art of
titanfall collector's edition I am a big
fan of these art books I've been
collecting them for a while the number
of different video games sometimes you
forget that a video game is an art form
that's somebody's art you know it starts
out as a concept the imagination behind
it started a lot earlier and the number
of people involved in bringing that game
to you is huge I don't know how many
people worked on this game but I assume
it's plenty so here we have some imagery
giving you an idea of the background
here you can see even an artist named
Kevin Anderson they're different
characters vehicles weapons
railgun data knife obviously I can't
show you guys this whole book anyways as
you can tell very beautiful artwork I'm
a little bit more excited than usual and
it has to do with just how ambitious
this this statue is this figure
obviously this is not a cheap collectors
edition it's around 250 bucks maybe the
price will go down a little bit now that
the game is out I don't know
they are usually fairly limited in
quantity if I can find a link that still
has these things I'll put that link down
in the description anyways thanks a
bunch for watching this is crazy I'm
gonna go play the game as I said before
I haven't even played the beta so I'm
really pumped to actually check this one
out if you guys enjoyed this content
please remember to leave a thumbs up
down below leave a comment as well also
share the video it helps out a bunch
thanks as always for watching and I'll
catch you on the next episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
