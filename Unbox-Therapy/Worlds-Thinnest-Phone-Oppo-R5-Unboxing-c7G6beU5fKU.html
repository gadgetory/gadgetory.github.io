another video and today I've got an
exciting one for you we are checking out
the brand new Oppo r5 which in case you
haven't heard is the thinnest phone on
the planet even thinner than the new
iPhone 6 it has a 5.2 inch AMOLED screen
1080p it has a 13 megapixel rear camera
and a 5 megapixel front it also comes in
this crazy box it's made of plastic and
when I first got the larger shipping box
which actually came with two phones
you'll see the other one shortly I was
wondering why it weighed so much but
it's because Oppo uses these really cool
plastic boxes which are obviously going
to protect your device and look pretty
slick at the same time oh my goodness
yes that is thin my friends Wow a lot of
confidence holding on to it here because
there is a sort of sharp edge there that
you can feel my goodness that is thin
I'll pull out an iPhone right now to
compare and it might be hard for you to
tell because they are both incredibly
thin but we are looking at a very very
thin device it's made mostly of metal at
least that's the way that it feels the
camera does protrude a little bit and
you have a flash in this location right
here now one thing that you'll see is
missing or you won't see is a headphone
jack
there's no headphone jack on here it's
so thin that they couldn't fit one so
you'll actually use the microUSB port to
connect headphones we have the gigantic
power brick here this is obviously not
going to be useful to me but that's okay
I have a lot of USB power bricks you've
also got some headphones
that's a nice addition these look to be
specialized as I said because they use
the micro USB port to connect otherwise
fairly standard stuff they do have a
little angle to the connector and they
look to be an in-ear style so they'll
probably fit a little bit deeper inside
your ear oh there's a disconnection
point here as well so you can use them
as regular headphones if you're not
using them with this device you know a
stand
headphone jack otherwise you go into
this adapter here and then you get the
microUSB on the other end now my
thinking here is you could probably use
whichever headphones you like as long as
you're using this adapter this is a very
important adapter probably a good idea
to not lose this though you could likely
get another one if you really needed to
over here we have our sim tool this is
of course for installing your sim into
the r5 and they've even included a case
in here a flip cover case I don't
normally use these style of cases I like
to have access to my device immediately
but if this is your thing you have a
flip style case with some information
that will be displayed in this cutout
here this little frame and lastly you
have a micro USB cable this of course is
going to be used to charge and sync the
device and I almost missed these little
guys right here you have some extra ear
tips for different sizes for those
headphones I talked about earlier so you
have some little ones some big ones and
it appears that the medium ones are
pre-installed so that gives you an idea
of what's inside the box but let's go
ahead and take a closer look at the
actual device and just how crazy thin
that it is okay so here's a closer look
at the r5 and as mentioned this is the
thinnest phone on the planet and it
might be hard to tell because you don't
really have a comparison or at least
you're not holding the device in your
hand
obviously phones are getting crazy thin
these days in general the new iPhone was
about as thin as I thought phones needed
to be if not already too thin if you
guys have seen my previous videos you
probably know why I'm thinking that but
one thing I will say about the r5 is I
appreciate the fact that there's an edge
to grip on too because when you're
dealing with an incredibly thin phone do
you have confidence in your grip is it
solid and the iPhone 6 is incredibly
slippery its slippery in your pocket
slippery in your hand just giving you a
quick look around the device you have
your volume rocker in this location your
power switch lives here that'll line up
with your thumb when you're holding it
on the front of the device you have some
capacitive buttons along the bottom
back home multitasking on the top you
have your earpiece as well as some
sensors in the forward-facing camera on
the other side you have your SIM tray
and then on the bottom you have your
micro USB port and microphone and that's
pretty much it fairly slick device here
so there you have it in unboxing an
overview of the brand new Oppo r5 the
thinnest phone in the world make sure to
stay tuned to the channel for more
interesting videos featuring this phone
