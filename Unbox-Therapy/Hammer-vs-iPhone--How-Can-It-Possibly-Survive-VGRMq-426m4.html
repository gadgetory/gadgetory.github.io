of something that they said you could
use a hammer they sent me the clips I
was like I don't know if I buy it but
apparently it's got some kind of impact

exciting there's like a normal screen
protector and here is their specialty

sure each one of you knows a human being
who's walking around with a smashed
phone you know they're answering phone

down their face don't be that guy get
yourself some supramolecular protection
look at this look what they sent me they
