recently $20,000.00 fortnight gaming
setup it's the hot title ok people love
it go ask ninja this video did well
people were interested right crazy ultra
wise I am some monitor this is 49 inches
hooked up to this amazing gaming PC from
Zytek species course this video is not
about this setup it's about the next
elevation or going straight to the top
completely ridiculous setup that no one
should have that no one should use we
have to do the things that normal people
wouldn't approach to show you the most
extreme but how whoa of course I took
notice of that giant spot on the wall
over there you may have seen a little
teaser 250 inches diagonally a fortnight
so here's how we're gonna do it all
right this thing has plenty of
horsepower the dual GT X 1080 GPU should
be enough horsepower I reached out to
Optima they make high-end projectors
will not just do 4k they'll do 4k at 60
Hertz and they've even got a game mode
so there's not like crazy input lag now
you notice there's two of them here so
we could stitch them together in Windows
to get something close to 8 K across an
ultra wide wall space Optima was also
nice enough to send an extra one for one
of you guys this is the UHD 54k UHD and
HDR and one of you guys is gonna win it
go follow me on Twitter if you don't yet
and I'll have all the details over there
but one of you guys is gonna win that
randomly and then Willie do will ship it
to you right well yeah he's good
ladies and gentlemen I present to you
245 diagonal inches of force I promise
I'm gonna perform better this time than
last I'm not sure if the game is any
easier or harder playing at this size
the cool thing is that there's not very
much input lag on these projectors
definitely less than I originally
expected that doesn't mean it's gonna be
helpful to me oh that was quick
especially with this weapon I don't even
like this weapon that much the challenge
with a setup like this is to stitch the
two projectors together without having
much of a seam in the middle these
projectors can supply a really vivid
image even at the distance they're at oh
I found a vending machine let me get
some wood I could get some stuff from
there oh boy ah the reason that these
projectors were a good choice for this
particular setup you got to have a game
mode otherwise are gonna have horrible
input lag and it's gonna be unplayable
also they need to be reasonably bright
the ones I'm using around 3000 lumens
the resolution it wouldn't have been fun
to do to 1080 projectors so we had to go
with 4k models so we could get that
crazy almost 8k setup I can show you the
settings that we've got here you can see
here 76 80 by 2160 is what we're working
with most of the settings at high here
if I go up to epic it'll run fine but
the framerate is somewhere like high
forties high settings 76 80 by 2160 this
is a way where you can still have plenty
of pixels to work with and a reasonable
frame rate I've been trying to toggle in
the sensitivity settings so they kind of
match playstation and with varying
degrees of success so yes I'm making
excuses no you will not believe those
excuses when you see how terrible I am
but I really need to put that out there
anyhow all right here we go doesn't seem
busy right now where is everyone all
there's some scumbag oh that was easy
cheese what's wrong with that guy
that was not even good shooting and I
got a kill already okay this is going
better than I expected it's certainly
better than last time oh I got that
golden the deagle it's not gonna be as
responsive as like a gaming monitor or
something like that but it's better than
I expected it to be oh I hear somebody
in here who just went upstairs I'll
chase him oh no aah I told you to be
over soon I got a couple bullets in them
I mean yes this type of setup is
absolute insanity ok for an experiment
in exercise in what's possible when
you're using some really cool equipment
like these projectors from Optima this
is the stuff I used to dream about as a
child okay there it is guys oh my
goodness world's largest biggest
Fortnight setup that exists have you
seen something bigger find a big wall
and see if you can beat this but for now
that's 245 inches the new world record
Guinness is not here but Matt is so how
am i alive right now doesn't have to
just be games a setup like this I mean
we could put sports I could play other
games too if you want to make a
suggestion some other game let me know
down in the comments which game
would you play or want me to play on
this insane 245 inch set up let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
