wow we got people in here already so as
you probably know because you've been
following along on social media I'm a
Munich right now that's right Germany
and there's a special reason for that
and it's right down here let me show you
that's right that is the mate 10 pro 3
versions of it right there in the blue
over here and then the kind of grey
color and of course the porsche design
version which has the 360 camera
attached to it I will show you how that
operates in a minute and then over on
the other side here we have beam 810 now
this one has a slightly different aspect
ratio as I'm sure you found out and so
it's a little bit wider and slightly
different spec as well this one comes in
some different color variations as you
can see here now the specs on the mate
10 you can see 5.9 inch HDR display this
is an exciting one the largest aperture
dual camera so each of these two camera
lenses here RF 1.6 that's the same on
the pro as well supercharged so this is
gonna give you a big boost to your
battery life quickly and it's also got a
large battery four thousand milliamp
hours comes with Android eight you see
this is a 2k display on this version and
if I go back over to the pro here you
see it's a slightly different spec list
with an OLED panel an OLED display
instead six gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of
storage and that goes up on the Porsche
design model this one here has 256 gigs
of storage on each unit that one is a
limited edition in conjunction with
Porsche now I'm in the booth okay let me
let me just show you guys around a
little bit
check all this out and there's some cool
displays that they have set up this one
over here for example is the night
photography section and because of those
F one-point-six lenses that I mentioned
you can get performance in low-light so
this is meant to simulate a low-light
environment those are miniature little
objects inside of of this casing to
create a tiny little town that's what's
going on in there it's pretty intense
now if I load up one of these you can
see the type of image it can take of
that pseudo town square because of the
low-light performance on that camera
lens and of course this camera also
features a monochrome sensor which is
capable of pulling more information out
of a frame so or of course taking
monochrome photos if you want that
dramatic black-and-white look now that's
not the only thing here there's a demo
on this side which has snap shot with a
eye motion detection right here look at
this as soon as I as soon as I saw this
car track I realized I had to show you
guys but essentially what this is about
is the ability to take a photo of a
fast-moving object in this case this toy
car right here without an enormous
amount of motion blur so let me just tap
this back on here you can see some
samples of that and these are images
that were taken that kind of captured
the car as its sped past the device and
of course normally that would be a
complete blob a complete blur but with
that wide aperture on the lens f-16 it
can snap a photo leave the shutter open
not as long and capture an image that
isn't blurred so that's the idea that
demo right there now I guess we might as
well take a trip over to the other side
here it is a
large booth and you see the poster here
for the Porsche designed version kind of
cool with the background of the car
itself that's inspired by and this is
really what's different about it if you
see the stripe here vertical instead of
horizontal like on the May 10 Pro and
this this one as I mentioned before
comes with 256 gigs of storage
compared to 128 on the pro alright
moving through here a little more oh
this is cool alright so this is what I
mentioned in my video this is actually a
good time to remind you guys that I did
an unboxing video a real special early
unboxing video of this device so if you
haven't watch that go check that out
right now but one of the things that
this phone is capable of is determining
what you're about to take a picture of
before you take that frame and that
means that it can give you better
results without you needing to go in and
manually adjust settings it's using AI
to do so so if you look at this display
right here all this beautiful food is
can I eat any of this oh really Wow okay
in a moment I will be sampling food as
well very exciting and but if I were in
the camera app on a separate device and
I pointed it at food it would
automatically be able to adjust camera
settings so I get the best results with
that food photo
now there's other there's other things
oh let's here here's a demo let's see if
we can grab it
oh there you go you see the food icon
comes up as he looks at the food item
very cool now that will function also
for things like portraits for things
like nature flowers for example if you
frame those up and this is kind of just
giving you the ability to probably get
better phone photos
without the need to use manual functions
now me I'm a big fan of manual features
in a camera app so it does have those
features still available to you so you
can go in and adjust aperture shutter
speed and those things if you want to
get more creative now another thing that
I showed up in the unboxing video was
the ability to broadcast the display of
the smartphone onto another display let
me show you what I'm talking about here
so this is the mate 10 simple one cable
hooking it up to this display here and
all of a sudden you've got your mobile
games on a much larger display with one
cable but there's a Productivity
component as well if you look up here we
have a desktop style interface being
driven by the device which is actually
which is actually acting as a touchpad
at the moment so I can interact with
this and let's see where my cursor shows
up there it is over there so you see my
cursor there so even without a bluetooth
mouse and keyboard I can still interact
with the device on a large display now
granted if you want to take it to
another level from a Productivity
standpoint you can add a bluetooth mouse
and keyboard and then you're gonna have
the ability to input text more quickly
you can have the ability to just
interact in a more desktop style I don't
know are we ready are we ready for the
idea of having a single device of not
using your laptop we're using your
smartphone primarily even even when
you're dealing with look at me look at
me sliding through unbelievable okay
cool anyways I don't know if we're ready
I know a lot of people here we're
interested in it they're like well I
mostly do web browsing and email could I
get by with just the device alright
anyhow the last thing I want to show you
guys real quick is the 360 functionality
I have it connected here to the Porsche
Design device so I just want to show you
what that interface looks like I'm gonna
hand the phone over here alright
let's see if Ryan it all rests on you
right now okay I got it so here we go
okay so we're gonna go ahead and just
connect the camera here it's USB type-c
by the way just see that it's connect oh
and there it is all of us in 360 and of
course we can manipulate the frame here
and navigate around we can snap a photo
we can also do video from in here and of
course that video will then be capable
of being navigated after by an
individual who's enjoying it so of
course this is gonna be popular for
people who travel if you've got a nice
landscape a nice environment this is
gonna give you a much wider field of
view and as you can see there's a lens
on each side so that image is stitched
together in software which is what gives
you the ability to move quickly from
front to back very cool okay I'll take
this back from you thank you very much
Ryan for helping out there alright so
there you have it brand new device cool
device many different options to choose
from which I like ton of different
colors on a may 10 side as well as on
the May 10 Pro side and then also if you
want to step it up to the Porsche design
because that's the way you you like to
roll with with the top-of-the-line model
well they've got that two overalls
really it's kind of amazing to see the
level of hardware that's coming out of
China right now specifically with this
device it's oh let's do quick cameo
quick cameo almost forgot we got mr.
Thai boxing and now guys what's
happening everybody knows who you are
alright go check him out let's check out
his channel as well and we got Danny

nice photos on a animate 10 Pro or what
