probably heard about it a huge event the
stage does this it does that it's the
new powerhouse it's the top of the food
chain got a pen it's an upgraded version
of the previous one in fact if I pull
the previous one out over here you can
probably hardly maybe not at all tell
the difference but there are some
differences and the new one is better
this one here actually steps up point
one inches diagonal screen space the
resolution is identical but this one the
note nine is six point four inches
diagonally compared to six point three
on the previous version the screen to
body ratio slightly better flip them
over you can see the camera layout has
changed a little bit or a fingerprint
scanner in relationship to the camera
layout underneath the camera modules it
was really hard to distinguish the
difference and you would end up touching
the lenses themselves the cameras are
different now too on the note 9 they
catch up to the s9 plus the same two
lens system with the variable aperture
now this device is obviously big is for
power users and that's what was a bit
confusing about the previous generation
right after the battery Fiasco the new
one here they get aggressive with the
battery all over again this one is gonna
feature a four thousand milliamp hour
battery this thing's a little bit fatter
a little bit heavier not a big issue not
for me Samsung saying is all-day battery
life I hate that kind of marketing
mumbo-jumbo all day who's day my day
your day I'm just gonna say it's gonna
have some awesome battery life the
storage options right out of the gate
there's a 128 gigabyte option no more 64
gigabyte option at all there's a 512
gigabyte option both expensive starts at
a thousand bucks u.s. and in the bigger
storage version which also comes with a
little bit more RAM goes up even higher
to twelve hundred and fifty dollars jet
that is twelve hundred and fifty dollars
now I know you got plenty cash remember
you were talking about the music
festival the other day I'm making decent
cash remember that well you said that
well I could be in the VIP section at a
music festival because I'm making decent
cash
so for you this is nothing but the world
doesn't live like you man Snapdragon 84
5 in here 6 gigabytes or 8 gigabytes of
RAM also has liquid cooling scenario as
well partnership with Fortnight for this
device specifically I installed it on
here already
of course it's not coming through the
Play Store which was an interesting
development fortnight didn't want to
kick any cash to Google so for the first
48 hours of this devices existence
you're only gonna be able to play
fortnight on Galaxy phones that's that
seems to be the deal that they struck if
you're familiar with gaming pcs you've
probably heard of water cooling it's an
unusual thing to have in phone Samsung
kind of wants to dive in to that same
department to a certain extent consider
this phone to be their gaming phone why
can't it be a gaming phone you're trying
to say you're a note they're trying to
say it's productivity whoa who is this
who is this thing for I think it's for
people who do a ton of computing on
their smartphone all of a sudden you
start to make the case for the s-pen
this pen here is a little different than
the previous version bluetooth LE
charges inside of the phone you can
control your music from here I don't
know am i holding this thing and
skipping tracks that said you have over
4000 levels of pressure sensitivity on
that pen you know Willie do he like
stuff he's a bit of a sketcher maybe we
bring him in here maybe we ask him if
it's the real deal or not that's for a
later date nonetheless
you can draw on your phone pretty nicely
this one now features stereo speakers of
course look at my recommendation no
one's logged in or anything it's just
like
I could probably be more impressed to be
honest okay look it's better it's
forward-firing there's also a little bit
more bass to it which I like
yeah it does it does feel a little bit
heavier a headphone jack and jack is the
biggest fan in the world of headphone
jacks right jack fingerprint scanner on
the back is like what about the reach
but take a look at this this is the old
note that was a nightmare location
especially on this device with the large
display there's something unnerving
about hitting this rectangle and feeling
the edges there's nothing as satisfying
as hitting a circular fingerprint
scanner so who is this phone for
somebody who wants the biggest baddest
doesn't care about cost he's somebody
who really gets a lot of use out of that
s-pen look it's a Samsung device it's
gonna be good with this one you can make
the case that you've got the four
thousand milliamp hour battery you've
got the biggest screen high spec out of
the gate with price tag to match the
speakers are now better as well the only
thing holding this one back is the price
if you can afford it you might love it
if you can't you can get a lot of value
for a lot less I'm putting that out
there
look I'll eventually switch to this one
in a minute don't you worry about it you
know I'm experimenting with the p20 Pro
right now give me a minute please and
whether or not I can recommend it as a
real buy and slap the plastic down of
course if you're not a person like jack
with the money falling out of the
pockets you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
