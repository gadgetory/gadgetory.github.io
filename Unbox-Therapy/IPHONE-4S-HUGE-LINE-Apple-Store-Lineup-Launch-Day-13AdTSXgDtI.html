obviously unbox therapy but you're with
me in my car right now and the reason
for that is because I'm out here at my
local Apple store it's 1123 p.m. Eastern
Time and we already got maybe 50 to 75
people out front right in front of me I
just took this picture long exposure on
a tripod for you guys to pull out these
people in this line so you can get an
idea of what to expect at your local
Apple stores if you thought you were
gonna roll in there at 8 a.m. and get
something you're probably wrong the hype
is real people really care about this
iPhone 4s as crazy as that is they're
out here lined up overnight and I don't
live in a huge town so there's
definitely a demand for this thing if
you want one some more when you haven't
pre-ordered you're gonna be looking at
one of these kind of lineups and you're
gonna have to get there soon anyway guys
as you know I'm gonna jump in this line
right now report from here I'll be
taking pictures images tweeting about it
follow me on twitter at unbox therapy
that's twitter.com slash unbox therapy
to find out everything about this lineup
and what's going on with the iPhone 4s
release as soon as I receive it I'm
gonna unbox it review it I'm gonna try
and be the first person to do it so
definitely stay tuned the store opens at
8:00 a.m. Eastern Time so you're
definitely probably gonna see coverage
of the new device at that time so anyway
guys just want to give you this quick
update in case you're interested in
picking one of these up and you haven't
pre-ordered yet this is what the lineups
are gonna look like crazy stuff they're
making my job hard I think I'm the only
person out here that's actually gonna
report on this thing everyone else just
wants it crazy anyway guys until next
time and as always thanks for watching
definitely stick around the channel
tonight and tomorrow morning and
tomorrow shits gonna go down alright
