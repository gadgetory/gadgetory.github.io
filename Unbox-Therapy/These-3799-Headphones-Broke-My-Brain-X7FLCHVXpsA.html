some headphones it's been a thing that
I've been focused on in the past in fact
if you look at the channel you can see
that I have tested some very expensive
headphones but nothing in the same realm
as what I'm about to do today I have my
very first set of headphones from a
company called final kind of see that
in-between this crazy texture that
exists on the box this is a company from
Japan claims to make the greatest
headphones ever inside of here's a
product that is handmade all the way
down to the drive but it's not just
about the look the appearance the
craftsmanship it's also about
performance and these have been very
highly regarded even at their
astronomical price tag it's called the D
8000 so here we can see the impedance 60
ohms the sensitivity 98 DB they are 523
grams a couple of different cables 1.5
meters and 3 meters and there's even a
stand-in here apparently what did I tell
them how much the final D 8000 these are
almost $4,000 headphones 3799 USD or
3,000 British pounds let's get inside
the box first
it's a box in a box situation this looks
like it's unit number 323 well how thick
those audio cables are the stand is
nicer on its own has some rubbery feet
on it so it really sticks once it's on
the table oh man there you have it this
is the final D 8,000 neoprene almost
material on the ear cups the ear cups
themselves they pivot they articulate
360 degrees on the headband everything
is metal here with the exception of the
headband which is leather on the bottom
you have your cable connections one on
each ear cup hole that's your setup
right there
I've got everything hooked up now I got
the darkboys tube headphone amplifier
also got this little phono box here
let's try them on course open back
design I can hear myself
foundings I'm looking for that wide
soundstage yes look at those babies
that's serious hmm yes
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
salt here's the thing right like music
everybody listens to music modify Apple
music Google Play next next next next
the thing about it that's hard to
explain is that a process like this is
set up like this in a product like this
it's really beyond the scope of
practicality you are in the realm of
experience you're in the realm of nuance
you're in the realm of subtlety you're
trying to examine it like a piece of art
in an art gallery you're sitting there
like hmm right there's that and there's
also that and even that and as it all
comes together your ability to discern
those small little fragments changes
your overall experience of the art
you guys don't understand how hard it is
to be ever in a situation in this
environment sitting right here where I
can even momentarily completely forget
that you're sitting right there I've
done this what like 1,500 times like
I've sat here - Mike there's monitors is
a big TV it is not easy to forget that
all of that is going on
somehow that experience right there I
was gone I wasn't here
I don't know was I in the studio with
them was I had a live show in the early
70s was I even on planet Earth can you
put some Black Sabbath on and just be
there for a minute huh are you available
to even know what it is to listen to it
I don't know I don't think I was and
then I was it's kind of crazy to me that
this experience that I just had on
camera it required this video to take
place I didn't do this on my own accord
it had to kind of happen in order to
snap me into this mode right now and I'm
not sure it's what you tuned in for but
I'm not sure you have a choice at this
point we just had that experience
together you and I that's right jack
well chances are you probably want to
listen to some music properly for once
and now I'm starting to sound like some
kind of elitist I don't necessarily
think you need these headphones I'm just
saying I got a lesson in paying
attention right now today are these
headphones responsible at least
partially because of these headphones
I'm asking you to do a better job paying
attention maybe you do I don't know but
myself and a lot of people around me I
don't know I'm seeing some things I'm
not feeling great about it so that's my
challenge to you pay a little bit more
attention throw some Black Sabbath on
put some headphones on I don't take a
minute you're alive it's happening it's
all right here make yourself available
every so often please thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
