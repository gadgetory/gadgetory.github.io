you can tell there are two iPads sitting

up there's also a couple of Apple
pencils on top of each box and then in
the middle something is a little bit
strange and you're probably not used to
seeing it here in the studio that is a
electric head shaver razor deal of
course yours truly uses this on the
regular the two guys that I'm about to
inviting they actually they like the
hair that they have so what are we gonna
do we're gonna have ourselves a little
bit of a contest
Ryan versus well it's gonna be a drawing
showdown using the latest iPad and the
Apple pencil these guys will sit down on
a timer with 15 minutes to not only draw
some kind of masterpiece but also unbox
these things and set them up is it going
to be intense well yes of course
especially when you consider the
consequences the individual that loses
this contest will have their head shaved
by the winner in the next video why will
we be waiting until next video to
determine who won and who lost
that's because you'll be deciding this
side down
in the comments through one comment who
you think did the better job who you
think has the better picture at the end
of this contest so if you'd like to vote
for well simply comment well and if you
would like to vote for Ryan simply
comment Ryan
without further ado let's invite in the
contestants in the blue corner the one
the only right now you guys don't know
this but before Ryan started working
here he was invested in the artistic
realm he spent years honing his skills
that's that's not sketching the passerby
x' passers-by never sketch anything ever
using nothing but charcoal and cardboard
i've never i've never indrani's selling
many of his pieces for upwards of six
figures somewhat of a cult favorite ryan
has an abstract style cult that's pretty
strong weird
some have compared him to picasso in
fact yeah on a serious note the thing
I'm worried about with Ryan is that he's
not even gonna get the iPad set up in
the first place to even get a drawing

dick you might be shaving your head

ball let's bring in the next contestant
