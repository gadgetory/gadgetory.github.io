showed you some components for what will
be the next generation of iPad or the
iPad 5 if you want to call it that but
those aren't the only components i
received i also got this right here and
if you can't tell already this is the
back plate for what will be the next
generation of iPad Mini so in this video
here I will be comparing these two in
terms of dimensions and you can figure
out just how much closer the full-size
iPad has gotten to the Mini before we
get into that particular comparison I
want to do an obvious one here and
compare this brand-new bat casing to the
previous generation of iPad Mini granted
I've got a different color here don't
let that really bother you too much
because the white version of iPad Mini
did have an aluminum back similar to
this leaked back casing that I'm showing
you right here of course there is one
slight aesthetic difference which is the
mirrored finish on the Apple logo
otherwise you're looking at two very
comparable form factors in fact I think
every single dimension is identical here
so no real big changes in this
particular department that being said
most of the improvements on the rumored
iPad Mini 2 are about the screen people
are hoping and thinking that there will
likely be a Retina display in the next
generation of iPad Mini we'll have to
wait and see I don't want to speculate
too much the mini measures in at 13
point 5 centimeters for width of course
that brand new iPad full-size is 17
centimeters is quite a bit more narrow
than the last generation of full-size
iPad so they're closer now than they
used to be the height measurement puts
the iPad Mini at 20 centimeters in the
next gen full size iPad at 24
centimeters but when talking about
thinness these things are identical in
fact if I didn't put the heading in
those two clips right there you'd be
hard-pressed to tell the difference
between the two the story's a little bit
different when you place one on top from
this particular angle but the question
now becomes with the full-size iPad
getting closer in dimensions to the iPad
Mini are you gonna be as compelled to
pick up a mini of course they're what
likely still be price differences we'll
have to wait and see if the Mini does
support a Retina display you would
assume it would have to go up in price a
little bit but of course only time will
tell
I'm gonna let you guys roll out on a
little
of an i-pad sandwich here so you can see
all four stacked up on top of each other
