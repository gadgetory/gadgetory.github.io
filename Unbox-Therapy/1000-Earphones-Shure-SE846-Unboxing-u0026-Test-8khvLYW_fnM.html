guys Lew here back with another video
and I am very excited for this one in
front of me I have the se 8 4 6 from
sure these are in ear headphones
earphones whichever you prefer to call
them and these are very high end as you
can tell from the title of this video
and the pricing and availability link in
the description these are for serious
audio file type listeners for
professional musicians etc these are not
run-of-the-mill earbuds and they have
some very interesting innovations that
make them special so I'm excited did I
already say that let's go ahead open
these up and take a closer look at what
makes the SE 8 4 6 from sure so special
wow this is a very high quality box my
friends it's got like the head soft
touch plastic going on this is some
serious presentation that's how you know
his product is no joke on the front here
se 8 4 6 in this kind of nice glossy
type of finish here on top of the matte
box and then they lift open like this
like a treasure in earphone with true
subwoofer performance it demands
absolute precision what an experience so
far so we have a little bit of paperwork
over here the SE a 4 6 of course nice
glossy little manual limited warranty
some safety precautions some other
information here this traveling case is
really high-quality on its own it
reminds me sort of like one of those
Pelican cases that you guys may have
seen before has these clasps on the side
there for making sure that it's locked
and you are gonna want to protect these
obviously after making that kind of
investment in a pair of earphones
this baby open so there we go
first thing you'll notice is this
cleaning cloth on the top bring that
down so you guys can have a closer look
so I suppose this is gonna be used to
maintain the shimmer and shine and that
factory-fresh feel so you got a cleaning
cloth then you have a case on the left
and the earbuds on the right let's look
in this case first wow this is this is a
pretty solid case on its own so I assume
if you're just taking the earbuds with
you maybe you can just probably take
this little smaller travel case so lots
of stuff to talk about in this first
case right here on this side I'll open
up this package first I can see there's
a cable installed on the earbuds so this
looks like an extra cable here you can
see it's super sturdy this cable braided
and then there's plastic over top of the
braiding so it doesn't fray and of
course these cables are removable you
wouldn't want to have a super expensive
set of earbuds or headphones without a
removable cable because if you have an
issue with the cable easily replaceable
you've also got a quarter inch adapter
so this will fit onto the end here for
high end audio systems or really
anything that uses this quarter inch
style instead of the mini jack connector
there's a shirt clip as well you manage
your cable an airline adapter and what
do we have here
this looks like a little volume adjuster
so if you want to have an inline volume
as opposed to reaching down to your
device
you have an inline volume adjuster also
inside this case are tons of different
ear adapters so you can get the right
fit and this is important with in-ear
headphones earbuds etc you want to make
sure to get the best fit that will give
you the best frequency response if you
get a nice seal and it'll also help in
the low end frequencies the most because
if you have sound bleeding out you're
not going to get the full impact
those low end frequencies so you can see
there's a number of different styles
here that's because everybody's ear
canals are different and so you're gonna
want to test out each and every one to
determine which one works best for you
and gives you the best results lots to
choose from and play with there and this
is where things get really really
interesting this is one of the unique
characteristics of this earphone this is
a tool here on this side and this is
used to swap out filters on the
earphones and you're probably thinking
what is he talking about what is this
gibberish with filters these earphones
have the ability to modify the sound
signature so by installing different
filters here we can see them here in my
hand hopefully you guys can see that you
can actually warm up the sound if you
want to you can have a flat frequency
response if you prefer and then the last
one I believe is a little boost in the
brightness so the higher frequencies if
that's a sound signature that you prefer
so these are really heavily customizable
to suit your listening preferences
depending on how you like to listen to
music and the kind of music you want to
listen to try them all out just like the
ear tips and then find out which is most
suitable for you and then stick to that
one and they're very easy to install and
change out so here are the actual se 846
as you can tell not your everyday earbud
these are not the earbuds included for
free with your portable media player
phone etc these are a totally different
beast and that's what's beautiful about
them there's all kinds of engineering
and design that goes into each one of
these traditionally earbuds have had
difficulty delivering really low-end
heavy-duty kick you in the face type of
bass but this design right here might be
the best in the business at delivering
those frequencies while maintaining a an
accurate response in the other ranges so
true subwoofer really super
low frequency bass coming out of these
guys you'll notice there's a little bend
there these are meant to fit over the
ear so that they'll actually go over the
top of your ear to help secure them you
know like a like a professional monitor
like you would see on stage for a
musician or singer vocalist etc you've
also got a removable cable as I said
before I really like the translucent
design here so you can actually see the
components on the inside so what's left
to do except try out these phenomenal
things I mean I know they're amazing
I've already read some reviews and have
been have looked at some other videos
and these things are kind of the
undisputed champs as they should be for
the price these are obviously not going
to be for everyone but you guys need to
remember that if you're a professional
if you're earning money because of what
you're hearing in your ear canal and
musician or professional audio engineer
etc etc then all of a sudden as a tool
these become that much more attainable
because you're actually gonna be making
stuff using them for the average
listener this is only going to be for
high-end listeners obviously at this
price point but for those individuals
that can appreciate fine tuning their
listening experience I'm gonna be
testing these out with a couple of
different audio players and some flak
files so I am really excited to do that
but for now let me go do a quick test
and come back to you
okay I need to have a serious moment
with you guys right now these are the
greatest headphones I have ever listened
to in my entire life hands down no close
second this is serious business
I am shocked whatever sure has done here
is next level you understand me
this is a completely different listening
experience to anything that I've heard
before the dynamics are insane the
isolation as far as these ear tips the
ones that were pre-installed they just
shut off the rest of the world beyond
even what you know active noise
cancellation can do so you can really
appreciate every little nuance in the
music the bass is insane for an in-ear
headphone everything I expected to
happen just happened and I am blown away
this is obviously a very expensive
product but goddamn now I know why this
is engineering at its finest right here
hands down check out the link in the
description no joke from sure I don't I
got nothing left to say
I just laughing literally but when I put
on the first song I just started
laughing and smiling and I couldn't stop
that's what these headphones did for me
and listen I'm a tough person to get
that kind of reaction out of I'm playing
with new gadgets and toys all the time
and these things have made me very happy
I can't wait to do some more listening
and try out some different types of
music and maybe even try out those
different filters and everything I'm
pumped alright guys thanks for watching
this video if you enjoyed it make sure
