Apple officially cancels the air power
product citing inability to meet its
high standards for hardware nobody saw
this coming the air power mat has become
like a meme in the tech community if you
follow any tech enthusiasts on Twitter
Apple enthusiasts and so on people have
been talking about this air power mat
and how it was announced like two years
ago never got released then the wireless
ear pods come out and everyone's saying
that air power mats gotta be closed then
I'm doing an air pod video and on the
backside of the wireless charge case it
shows the air power mat references the
air power mat and now this officially
cancelled they'll sell you the wireless
air pods wireless charging air pods but
they won't sell you the mat to charge it
after all apparently this product is
just too difficult to engineer to
manufacture to release and now Apple has
officially cancelled it as far as I know
I mean I can't recall a moment where
Apple has canceled a product they've
announced before it was released that
obviously this is not an iPhone it's not
a high profile product it kind of became
a high profile product after time and
then just as people were hyped up to
receive it it gets cancelled very
unusual for Apple here's the official
statement after much effort we've
concluded air power will not achieve our
high standards and we've canceled the
project we apologize to those customers
who are looking forward to this launch
we continue to believe that the future
is Wireless and we are committed to push
the wireless experience forward that was
said by Apple's senior vice president of
hardware engineering dan Rickey oh wow
I know this might not seem like a big
deal to you but for a company like Apple
they're all about appearances they just
had an event recently where they marched
out every celebrity on planet Earth it's
all about the way that things are looked
and cancelling a product is never a good
look why can't the the biggest company
in the world make a wireless charging
mat I mean making products is obvious
difficult and this is one of those
circumstances almost like a Kickstarter
circumstance where they're like show you
the thing and they're like one day we
will make it now the difference being
that Apple is such a well-established
company that when they put the message
out you thought they really could
deliver it but it turns out that heat is
an issue and when you pile together you
know these three separate charging areas
on one singular wireless charging
surface you get an issue with heat and
apparently it's the heat that eventually
spelled the end for this particular
device there was the potential for the
devices that were on it to also overheat
themselves and Apple didn't want to do
that so you kind of have to commend them
for not just releasing it anyways like
for example the keyboards on the Mac
books that for whatever reason haven't
been changed yet and keep getting
released so I'm glad people didn't spend
a boatload of money receiving these only
to find out they were gonna cook their
devices well there's two ways to look at
this right you could say that Apple has
changed for the better or for the worse
you could say they're more transparent
they're letting you know what's going on
it's not you know they're not locking
the door here they're letting you and
they're saying hey we made a mistake and
you have to appreciate that or you could
look at it in another way and say
they're not who they used to be the
perfectionist that they used to be that
maybe they're overstepping
over-promising and then not being able
to deliver why why is that the case they
obviously have the talent is it a
strategic problem has their relationship
with the supply chain changed so there's
a couple different perspectives you can
have there I'm just glad it's not a
fiasco where people are going to pay for
it and then customers are going to
suffer I get it some people might have
been waiting for it but the damage at
this point is at least fairly minimal no
one has spent money on a product that's
subpar but nonetheless no one saw this
coming there's been all kinds of jokes
on social media and now we have an
answer it's not just delayed anymore
it's simply not happening and yes Apple
has said that they are not giving up on
Wireless they still believe that
wireless charging is the future but they
haven't
mentioned some other product they
haven't mentioned like a singular
wireless charge pad every other
manufacturer in the world has one of
those at this point and of course you
can pick one up for a couple of dollars
on Amazon practically so you would
assume Apple could at least deliver that
nonetheless apparently they have very
high standards I was surprised to find
out this news I'm sure you are as well I
guess the jokes can stop now or they can
accelerate who knows there's probably
plenty of memes left to be had in the
tech universe when it comes to Apple's
air power there you have it officially
canceled don't wait for it now's the
time if you're a super Apple fan and you
were waiting for this thing before going
Wireless you can now officially go to
Amazon and spend a lot less money maybe
20 bucks and get a decent wireless
charger just make sure it's Qi
compatible it'll work with your iPhone
and it'll work with your brand-new
wireless charging air pods
there you have it air power our IP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
