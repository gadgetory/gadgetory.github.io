the other strength is up it fades with
age and succumbs to singing then there
is the chief the inner strength everyone
possesses it too but it is indeed much
more difficult to develop the inner
strength lasts through every heat and
every cold through old age and you know
listen today is a very special day I
know I say that often but I've never
felt that way more than this moment
right now I got back from lunch I was
feeling a little bit sore maybe even
under the weather and I took a look over
here I took a look at this this box now
to you it's just a wooden crate but to
me
it's a whole new experience inside that
box is a massage chair a luxurious
high-tech massage chair from true medic
it's the MC mm this is something I've
wanted since I saw the very basic
versions sitting in the mall and I put
my coin in and I sat there and I stared
up at the universe well or the ceiling
of the mall but I'm sore all right maybe
I should just let the chair do the
talking how much is this thing worth
well about five grand it's time to show
the world what a five thousand dollar
massage chair can do for your life shall
we
you know when it's in a crate like this
it's got to be serious the little hook
there yeah and then I think I'm gonna
fold this up oh-ho-ho-ho oh man it's
like a capsule
there we go oh man I mean your legs
they're gonna fit in here this thing
elevates your reclining your arms go
into here this is squishing down on the
arms here's the remote what do we have
old a screen on the remote zero gravity
mode volume up and down emergency off
when the pizza guy shows up oh man is
this some next-level situation right
here it's not on yet but I can feel the
mechanisms in place that are going to
rearrange my body and that sounds
dangerous but it's exactly what I need
are we plugged in oh it's beginning
something's happening look at a pinpoint
accuracy on there oh I'm moving right
now I'm going to zero gravity mode oh
man oh this I can push against this
whatever my length is you see that okay
let's just do a quick relaxation here we
go
oh oh oh man leave
oh boy I want you to intensity right now
oh the strength I'm being squeezed oh
God
this is real right now this is real life
I'm a changed man
nothing will ever be the same what it's
doing to my legs right now the squeezing
of the legs is serious oh the way is
gripping the my legs down there it's so
powerful I don't understand how it's
taken me this long to have this
experience but I don't understand and I
see it as a failure on my behalf that's
the level of experience of having 100
Bluetooth should I try the Bluetooth
okay bluetooth is now on oh I just heard
a beat there speakers can you see these
yo did you show them the USB port there
as well throw a podcast on you know MMA
our few blocks look at that from where
it's in the speaker in ours New York
City studio that is located just a few
blocks away you can elevate the
different aspects independently like the
footrest section up and down or you can
quickly select the zero gravity position
which was the one I started out in I
could pick automatic settings for
whatever my ailment is recovery pain
relief white-collar Shopaholic back yoga
athlete mode of course there's also
manual it seems to be like inflating at
different points with a different
intensity level of course there's the
heating which you can stop or start
timer and then there's a stop button
should I try falling tensity or what
let's try athlete mode I'm now maximum
intensity athlete mode
I was gone for a minute man I was hard
to finally speechless like this with the
holy relaxation going on here
I never been squeezed like that before
you know I'm not done yet
like leave me alone now I'm going back
in Willy dudes gonna help me with
question time what's your favorite
activity other that'd be my favorite
activity I think it might be this now I
like to play video games I like to play
basketball
of course hockey which is something that
I do quite frequently as well I like to
listen to music eat pizza you know the
first day of day of school they're like
what do you like to do video games and
eat pizza and make music sometimes I
haven't done that and way too long the
thing is YouTube is like a thing that
encompasses a lot of what I do so you
know I don't mind that either Yugi from
Twitter says how long does it take to
edit a box they're people so it really
depends right on how comprehensive the
video is some longer so much shorter but
it's always in the realm of like a
couple of hours basically to start to
finish making a thumbnail you know Elmer
from Twitter says our hot dog sandwiches
are they</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
