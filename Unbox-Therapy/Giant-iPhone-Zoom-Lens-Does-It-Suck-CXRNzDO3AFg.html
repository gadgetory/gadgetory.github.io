another video and today we are going to
it's gonna be a resurgence of a series
which most of you know about some of you
don't it's called does it suck and what
we do here on that show on this channel
is we look at items from Amazon usually
Dan you know you're probably skeptical
about this my friends is probably
something that you have skipped past
scroll past you've seen it and you said
those things can't be any good can they
better yet let's put it in unbox therapy
terms Lu does it suck this is a giant
telephoto lens for your smartphone these
things I mean look at that monstrosity
right there look at that
I mean its optics right I mean you're
putting it in front of your smartphone
lens and you're hoping to get some extra
range maybe it's not bad maybe it
doesn't suck probably does oh look at
the phone suggesting on a side bunch of
old-school device including iPhone with
a capital I and a space whoa that is
even bigger than I expected it huh this
you think smartphone and you think this
decent piece of glass they're a couple
of caps to protect it a mini little
tribe well that's useful on its own and
then a mounting bracket that's what
makes it Universal this thing here
what's that gonna be for they're gonna
go in there a cleaning cloth or
traveling pouch that's it that's what
you get it's really amazing that these
things sell as well as they do on Amazon
people seem to think they need it and
everyone's doing their photography on
their on their phone so maybe they're
like hey this is the next step it's
gonna take me to the next level of
Instagram photography does this screw in
here you kind of get this adapter on
line up the lens oh man
that's gonna be tough to do okay come on
you can do this still moving around ah
God hey my phone's powering off it's
hitting all the buttons on the side
volumes up and down oh man this is this
is bad news right now I'm almost a real
photographer guys wait my even this is
perfect for the elevator music right now
we haven't used that in a while eh oh
man that's off setup is not the strong
suit here all right I got it let's find
out
what am I do what is this what if I just
did like this and I just line the thing
up on my own first of all it can barely
stand up
well anybody who has to be doing what
I'm doing right now even one time is too
many times Philly I got something here I
might snap a photo real quick
that's your photo right there this thing
sucks
it's terrible you'll hate yourself for
having purchased it I did one a lens
adapter case for the iPhone which which
was good this is a nightmare
I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight
after this having nightmares right now
