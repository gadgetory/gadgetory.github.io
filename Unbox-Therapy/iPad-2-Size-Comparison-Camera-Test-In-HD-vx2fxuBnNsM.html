and I just got home from my crazy iPad
trip to Buffalo rather than wait in line
with everybody at the Apple store I took
a trip over to the Target and everybody
there was mad cool rather than make us
stand around all day they started
handing out tickets tubs to make sure we
could get one and take off so I spent
most of the day at Starbucks and went
over and picked it up at five o'clock it
was sweet anyway here's a better look at
the iPad and just how thin it is here it
is up against a polycarbonate MacBook
against a Magic Mouse I mean this is
crazy thin it's stupid thin I mean you
really need to hold it in order to
appreciate just how thin it is it's less
than half the depth of this Magic Mouse
and the Magic Mouse ain't fat by any
means here it is up against my galaxy s
smartphone and for those of you who
haven't held one of those it's basically
the same depth as an iPhone 4 or any of
your Android smartphones like Android or
anything like that here's a look at the
screen and I was actually surprised a
lot of people made a big fuss about the
screen but here it looks brighter than
my Super AMOLED screen on my galaxy s so
at this point I'm impressed this isn't a
review by any means I mean I just got
the device but it's definitely
impressive at this point here's an above
angle of the galaxy s on top of the iPad
2 and as you can see it's a little bit
smaller than the iPad 1 in many of its
dimensions all around here's a picture
taken from the back camera on the iPad 2
and I mean it's not amazing or anything
but it's usable for you know little
posts or updates or whatever you might
end up using that camera for here's a
picture from the front-facing camera and
as you'd imagine the resolution takes a
big hit this front-facing camera is just
a VGA camera
nothing special they're supposed to use
it for chat but I wanted to show you
anyways what kind of a still it would
produce at that resolution and here's a
look at the video recording
functionality as you can see I mean this
is a low light environment but still
there's noise everywhere all over this
video so again this is not it's strong
suit it's really all about the thinness
it's all about the redesign of the
enclosure you got to check one of these
devices out visit our channel we're
gonna have a full review once I have a
chance to play with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
