looked at a Nokia device what was the
one with the crazy camera unit it was
like 20 megapixels it had the huge it
was yellow the Lumia 1020 might be the
last Nokia phone that I featured here on
the channel that could be crazy maybe
I'm wrong but now I kind of feel
compelled to jump back in because a lot
has changed and now we're talking about
Android 1 which as you know from
previous videos is of interest to me I'm
a big fan of stock Android bringing a
uniform experience to more Android
hardware so this of course is the Nokia
7.1 it's packing the Snapdragon 6-3 six
set so it's not blazingly fast but it's
got a pretty attractive price tag you
can pick this up on Amazon right now for
around 350 bucks for the 64 gigabyte
version yes there are some other devices
in this space that may be a little bit
quicker but what you get here is fit
finish polish and of course Android one
5.8 inch 19 by 9 F HD Plus display no
OLED or anything remember the price tag
350 bucks it is capable however of HDR
video a 12 plus 5 megapixel rear camera
with Zeiss optics and an 8 megapixel
wide-angle front-facing selfie camera ok
so first impression it does not feel
like a $350 device this nice bevel
around the edge it's polished there as
well a lot of glass is in play metal
components it's kind of boxy on the edge
oh they give you a headset as well you
don't see that every time these days a
rear fingerprint scanner I've become
really accustomed to this location dual
lens setup you see the Zeiss logo
obviously a reputable brand this is the
important part for me it's the Android
one signature there SIM card tray is on
the other side and it also features
expandable storage and then you've got
USB type-c on the bottom once again
capable of that quick charge now you can
tell straight away
it's a bit of a notch city you also have
a chin here so some people might be a
little upset about the screen to body
ratio but in my opinion at this price
point there should be other things that
are more important to you register the
fingerprint pretty straightforward
change the grip okay let's give this
fingerprint of shots yeah that's that's
pretty quick hang on one more time
hmm from from a blank screen yeah
average whatever acceptable as you can
see stock Android experience beautiful
wonderful it's like a warm blanket now
out of the box this is Android 8.1 but
it's supposed to be getting upgraded
this month in fact again part of the
Android one program you get the updates
to the latest version a little quicker
maybe not
pixel quick but next in line for sure
okay let's go ahead and give the camera
a quick look here the camera app is not
stopped this is not the pixel camera or
stock Google camera and that means that
you have a few more options in here that
they've added including a stacked image
processing which is gonna hope to
replicate some of the effects that
you're seeing on those higher-end phones
okay let's do a quick little test here
Auto HDR it's turned on it's gonna
attempt to bring up the shadows in the
frame and give you more detail in the
highlight I'm not sure how well that's
working mean it's a very bright
environment but it looks a little blown
out on the side of the face there that
looks still working a little bit better
I mean not bad not terrible definitely
not the best I've seen let's try it
without Auto HDR hmm that one there is
the auto HDR and that one is not so yeah
I mean you could see it brightens up a
touch there's a little bit of work going
on there the camera is a pass I've seen
better cameras of course I've seen
better cameras I'm looking at phones at
every price range and we need to and we
need to make the adjustment here for
three hundred and fifty dollar price
point okay it's not terrible
you know the highlight here
the nose and the cheek it might be a
little bit blown out but the details
okay in the beard and whatnot I'd say
that's an acceptable selfie speakers not
nice it's very tinny and it's mono out
the bottom it's easy to cover it up it's
not blowing anyone away it's not like an
incredible value it's not one of these
packaged phones where you're like how
did they do it for the money
low to mid range vibe in general I take
the surprising thing here when you grab
it is the build quality for the price
pick it up and you're like mmm that
feels high-quality that feels expensive
but then you start to play around it and
you're like this is okay the speaker's
not that great it's got the slower chip
inside of it but then again on this side
you have the stock Android experience
which is hard to come by if you're an
individual who's on a budget and you're
trying to get something in that $300
range and you value the stock Android
experience it's a big component for you
and build quality is a big component for
you then you might look at this but if
performance is number one I think
there's some other options out there
including the polka phone that probably
deliver on those aspects a little better
what I really want is the polka phone
spec with the Android one program
something like that now we're talking so
there's one for me this is I'm not gonna
switch to this one this is not a switch
video by any means it's got some things
going for it it's readily available
unlike some of those other options and
in various markets this one you can pick
it up on Amazon right now you can't say
the same for some of those other
products so you got to dock some points
there as well but if you're willing to
import man there are some amazing phones
three to four hundred dollars in that
range</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
