looking at best-selling products in
different categories on Amazon I'm
trying to get to the bottom of what's
happening out there where the value is
what do people like today it's another
video in that installment in front of me
is the best-selling Bluetooth speaker on
Amazon this thing goes for about 22
bucks 11,000 plus reviews a discounted
price down to $22 and I think the
average rating around four stars it is
the anchor sound core it comes in black
red and blue at 22 bucks how wrong can
you really go a pretty simple design
cool to the touch
possibly metal actually the grille on
the front the controls are on the top of
the unit it has a soft touch rubberized
material very simple interface there in
LED light an auxilary in and a
microphone so you can use it as a
speakerphone also micro USB charge cable
it's a simple package it's simple
product the question is does it deliver
how does it compare let's find out would
this be a good time to bring Ryan in we
have a guest in the house today and he
hasn't been here in a little while and
the man is the most requested guest here
on unbox therapy he's a man with a plan
he's a man with a tan ladies and
gentlemen all the way from the wild wild
west your favorite cowboy
where you gonna get an intro like that
yeah you don't get you don't get home
from work and get an intro like that you
know what just thinking okay alright
well that's you you're right that's you
right there okay
I feel come it's a new t-shirt or
something so much more bigger than me
I'm just I'm leaning forward there you
go Hoxie looking for a new Buchi speaker
mine recently broke it stopped charging
had for a long time it was it was good I
can't remember what but anyway is a blue
one it was nice but this is a little bit
smaller but what's the sound quality
like that's the real question
that's what you're here for we're gonna
get to the bottom of it but my thing is
people beat them up right like jamming
bags should we really be spending $200
on these or just $22 make a lot of sense
this is a little different - hey the
buttons aren't real buttons are just
they do press down yeah they do press
down hmm
Mike and never seen a Mike over these
40% charge straight out of the gate
that's recharge that's a little pre
charge on there so you get the party
going yeah nothing like having to stop
everything and then go and charge up
your bluetooth speaker or everybody's
looking for some teens right spoil the
mood that's right you know what thing or
two about mood these guys have done this
before I guess right well you asked me
if I've ever been to the Calgary
Stampede of course I have I told Willie
can come out anytime I hope they beat
him to it a real fun night
you know with the boots and a guy like
will out yeah he'd fit right in he
always struck me as a cowboy we could
make a couple nights over - oh my
goodness gracious I finally broke back
mountain right there
we turn into a weekend because there's a
lot to do okay here we go are you ready
this is Kirk's recommendation
doesn't track us for sure
like you know what's surprising about
these is how much low end they can get
out of such a small package yeah like
there's actually some bass coming out of
here right now if you're getting like
six to eight hours that's a good boy
what do they miss the battery like that
well 24-hour playtime you're not running
out at a party wow this is surprising
for a $20 bill I like to design like it
simply said small you're getting the
most you're gonna get it as something
this size for sure right 20 bucks
you can't go wrong 20 bucks he's not
gonna be disappointed 20 bucks
what do you get a pizza you're gonna
pizza what's the last thing you got for
20 bucks probably a pizza and where's
the pizza now that's where it wouldn't
look guys you know you're good for a
year if you don't lose it for sure I'm
just doing that are you are you are you
creating your own warranty I'm just
saying that I'd feel comfortable give
eyeball and I think I should Ryan just
gave you a one-year warranty on Ryan
signed Ryan is an $80 speaker with a
brand name on it four times better than
this I think we both agree no if someone
came up to me like yo I need a Bluetooth
speaker I'd say just pick that up what
tech you can't wait a year you can't see
you can't use a finger here the
technology you know it's too quick and
then it's too late
something new comes out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
