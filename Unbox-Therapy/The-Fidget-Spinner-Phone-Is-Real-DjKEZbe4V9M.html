back to get me might be funny have them
there come on man why are you here when
you in town well I need your help
take a look man yeah it's uh never end
what do you think about this it's like
Christmas morning here Willy do on the
camera today really doing the camera
Taylor's here for Willy doing a camera
no no Jack who needs him now I'm just
kidding Jack revealed ten million
subscribers tell your friends subscribe
jack in all of his glory exposing
himself to the world I'm gonna stand
near you awkwardly as you unbox there it
is here we go and he's getting right
down to business a little bit of hair
and look at this getting right to it
that is a lot of product but I'm not
sure what brand is from power port solar
little thin solar panel twenty thousand
power core power drive speed to quick
charge 3.0 this is the one I was looking
for three the three indication therefore
quick charge three so this is gonna
juice up your device obviously rapidly
oh here this is a monster look at this
26800 milliamp power port plus with
Qualcomm quick charge free oh yeah look
at this beast right here just think
about that for a second 26 over 26
thousand milliamp hours now this one has
three ports on it including the quick
charge 3 and the input to charge it and
I was like this and you can tap this
button here in order to indicate how
much charge you have left I'm gonna get
that guy boost it up very cool what did
you get 360 camera so it's called the go
extreme action series I'm guessing we're
looking at kind of like a budget style
GoPro competitor Wow look at the
accessories holy kaboom you know I love
wide-angle just a wild ride
around and he really in his natural
habitat he will be packing away many
different foods for the offseason there
is nuts and berries
well this is so easy look at this with
the time no it's not oh we love these
guys these are cool man this is a
company called moment I use their
products so I've done some live streams
recently the pixel event and the iPhone
event before that and the problem is
with the phone the phone doesn't have a
very wide lens so you're trying to fit a
few things into the frame and you can't
so we've been using the wide-angle
moment adapter now this looks like they
sent us the tele lens v2 so that's gonna
be a zoom lens 60 millimeter equivalent
and these just clip on to their cases oh
this is for the pixel - this is some
early accessories for the pixel to pixel
to XL
oh okay I think this is cool but I think
this is cool because of this little logo
right here I feel like that's a key
indicator stuff like that this is their
new product yeah it's a simple product
but it's called the Caddy Shack caddy
sized caddy sack named after Caddyshack
but like it looks like a book but then
you unzip it and it's got a spot as you
can see in the picture here it's got a
spot for all your all your dongles and
you can see you have all the little
compartments elastics silica gel for
Jack that's gonna have to go too well
because Jack's not here up here I'm
doing SD cards you could do a pen in
here
thinner cables or dongles over here and
your big power brick goes on this side
I'm assuming Wow
you know what it is you there's some
prejudice that goes on with a box like
you pick it up and you think you know
what's in it before your chest generally
speaking weight you associate weight
with value if it's really light you're
like yeah can it be that good over there
over there over there no idea came from
Hong Kong when you see the orange tape
you know it's about to get exciting oh
that's right
it's a company called elephone maybe
you're about to turn to the budget
device look at this very slim bezel on
that four gigs of RAM 64 gigs of storage
USB type-c it's booting up Wow I might
do a whole video on that that's wild
look what they're doing these days
look what they're up to I like how it
doesn't have overwhelming branding on it
and how the front is mostly screamed
what oh I know what this is I got to
give a shout out I meet Bonnie he's got
a YouTube channel and he featured this
and I was like dude you guys tell me one
of those cuz cuz you can't get it over
here it's lonely in India yes yeah I'm
about to blow
I'm about to ball your mind I'm gonna
blow your mind okay set is this like
threatening tell the people what that is
that is a bigoted spinner cellphone yes
it is oh my goodness here I'm opening
this up the spinner phone K 188 it
launched in India all right it's it's
inexpensive it's obviously a gimmick
it's obviously ridiculous in fact it may
be a key indication that the world is
coming to an end
I'm not sure comes in a few different
colors as you can see in the back here
it is obviously not a smartphone it's
just a basic phone what what here we go
I have never fidget spun a smartphone
before
you know what oh we got it we gotta
charge this I mean we obviously have to
there we go
are we gonna get that oh there we go
okay if you're gonna be fidget speeding
your phone you might as well have
Littlejohn they just see it makes sense
right settings application alarm
calendar calculator sound recorder
world's alright it's pretty
comprehensive for what it is
comes off look at the battery it's all
bulgy
Wow alright let me throw my sim in here
oh wait a second no it's not even a nano
sim it's a micro sim rather than a nano
sim so it ain't happening there's no
phone calls happening right now this is
a this is a special day in the world of
technology it's when the mean becomes a
reality in the form of a product like a
lot of people blame me in it to a
certain extent for the fidgets spinner
thing because I made a video about them
before it was like they fully blew up I
do deserve some of the blame in that
sense but those things like how did it
take off how did it get to the level it
did as quickly as it's like what
happened how did it strike the chord
with Humanity in such a way what you're
spinning something what what's happening
here it's in a cell phone that's a real
thing this is a real product this exists
in the universe now it's hard to believe
it's hard to believe and then you boot
it up and it plays Little John it's it's
like what universe and my in rate of
what is where am I</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
