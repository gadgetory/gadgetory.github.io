tell but of course if it was just a
regular everyday backpack I probably
wouldn't be showing it to you because
you can see that anyway it's from a
company called M packs I'll link it in
the description but this my friends is a
backpack that is also a chair excuse me
two things that you never expect it to
collide now when it comes to weird
chairs I did do a video once on a chair
peg kind of thing that fits in your
pocket
very bizarre video I recommend you go
check it out now I can't it's not fair
it's not fair the people gotta have more
cushion on it give you a front picture
hey let's get it out let's get it out of
the bag that's a big backpack I mean
it's almost in like kind of like
suitcase territory maybe you've got a
lot of stuff to carry this guy on the
front actually comes right off there's a
strap here you don't even need this
piece on it you know if you don't want
you can just carry like that a padded
laptop sleeve a lot of compartments for
your cables and stuff so maybe it's like
two bags in one jeez they've even
included a little tiny pen in there then
we got pockets a separate pocket on the
other side I mean that's it's a big bag
can I say I mean this could fit a huge
laptop in it I don't know whatever it is
you're into but where things get magical
is on the back here and it's hard to
tell it first because it's kind of all
hitting but inside of here under here is
a rigid frame the whole thing seems kind
of wild to me so that slides open like
that and then you got a chair hidden in
your backpack so this thing look at that
what is going is that right did I do
that right
oh there and then like this and look at
that the padding drops down I don't know
what kind of person you are but maybe
you can see use for this maybe you like
to sit out in a field somewhere in
between classes at university you got a
little seat maybe you do some reading
maybe you're waiting in line for the
next iPhone because you just can't wait
oh maybe you go to an amusement park
sometimes there's a lineup for the rides
now you're sitting down maybe you like
to have a picnic whatever you got
whatever you bring with you maybe it's a
little chilly that evening you've got us
what
or something along Cardian once you get
there you're chilling out on a chair let
me know in the comment why you need a
chair in a bag it's time to take a seat
on this thing and see if it makes any
sense at all I'm skeptical all right
jack you ready for the brass tacks let's
imagine I get to the I get to wherever
I'm going
it's on the back I chuck it down boom
boom extend it like that drop it down
here we go whoa who's comfier than me
right now you know what this is kind of
comfy I'm getting into it I feel like
I'm at a music festival right now I'm
probably getting trampled can anyone
hear me right now
Tom get over here hey come on I said oh
my
it's a little tough to get in and out of
if you know what I'm saying
there goes Tom that's actually not bad
he's in there give it a lean back are
you a soccer mom you're not are you are
you waiting for sneakers Oh a comic book
Magic the Gathering cards oh maybe
you're hunting pokemons I wouldn't be
made sure no you oh you don't have to
put on a front in front of them you're
allowed to be a pokemon fan I don't like
oh yeah see what he's doing now
halt it's actually a strange disorder in
which he's actually attracted physically
attracted to pokemon he doesn't really
want to talk about it which is fair
we're not gonna talk about it here in
front of millions of people that's fair
Jack will never leave this in give us a
breakdown Tom you're gonna have to speak
up you're getting tough to whole it's
not very comfortable well you got to
lean back more yeah but I don't
I'm not comfortable lying like this all
the time I think this is a little weak
eye strain the neck too I just bring a
chair
Tom's probably right is a little wacky I
don't know would I carry a bag like that
probably not but I told you earlier you
are the land of imagination and
therefore you have a better idea maybe
than I do of what you might do with a
chair like this never know what if it's
ten dollars no the extra weight I
wouldn't want to carry their own money
this is I think Tom and I agree there's
probably a use for it neither him nor I
can imagine strapping that to our back
and and utilizing it but maybe we just
lead less exciting lives than you do
leave a comment Tom needs it ha ha ha
that's a good point well please no more
no violence against dad all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
