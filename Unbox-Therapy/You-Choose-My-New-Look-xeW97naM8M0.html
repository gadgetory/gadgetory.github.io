different glasses so you can let the
audience decide how you should move
forward in terms of your look so today
I'll be giving you a fashion show so to
speak and then you can pick which pair I
will wear in the next video I know it's
crazy
so glasses USA it's a site where you can
order glasses for a fraction of the cost
right that you would normally pay in a
store oh my goodness here we go
sunglasses to kick it off that's a
different way to do the show Who am I am
I like DeNiro and heat right now when
they have to sit down him and Pacino
everybody wanted it you can order online
you can even put your picture in as well
should kind of pseudo try on the glasses
before you order them all the details
would be in the description there's
actually a promotion right now oh it's
about to get Harry Potter up in here

get some votes that's a different type
of therapy right there Jack some decent

encyclopedia it's weird how glasses they
can shape your mood I'll show you the
books you want to read the glasses USA
box and the rest is history one more to
go I mean that's a look we'll go out to
brunch you get some eggs Benny here
well Instagram I don't even know like I
have to look like I don't even know how
many followers I have these lenses
actually have a coating on them and the
reason for this according to them is
because it filters the light which can
then decrease the amount of eye strain
you get when looking at screens so this
is something I'm gonna have to try out
so there you have it eight different
looks you get to choose what do I wear
in the next episode we will peruse those
comments and look for the popular answer
and I promise you in the next video I'll
be rocking some of these what's it gonna
be is it the hipster version is it going
