definitely caught the last video I don't
know if you definitely did hopefully you
did if you did see the last video then
you know my experience with the Galaxy
fold is over so the sim card it's out
and it needs a new home and I asked you
guys I said you know what should be my
next smartphone now I knew that at this
point my next smartphone was probably
going to be one of my previous
smartphones because there's nothing
especially new right now that I haven't
tried yet so I did a little bit of
lurking in the comments section and then
I already kind of had my mind set as
well because I have been on Twitter you
know on social media a little bit
leading up to this eventual switch back
to some other smart phone and I realized
there's one group of people that really
needed some love some tender love and
care and I wanted to be there warm
blanket and that is of course the Apple
community see I'm a man of the people
I don't care if you use Android iOS I
really don't like that's the thing I got
a video coming up actually on my history
with Apple I've been into Apple stuff
please what's up guys it's Lou from
unbox therapy and this is the iPhone 4s
so because this galaxy fold just brought
all the Apple fans out of the woodwork
it really did I promise you I'm pretty
sure about a million millions and
millions of views 99% where Apple I I
found myself having all these
conversations Android versus Apple even
though I just was publishing about this
very weird bizarre fold phone take the
Apple fans they wanted to talk big-time
so I plan on extending that conversation
right now
by dipping my toe back into the iOS
universe that my friends is a premium
top-of-the-line very expensive as it
should be iPhone 10s max I use this
iPhone people don't know me they think
they know me they're like you know is
given iPhone a bad rap if you originate
it if you were a key player in early
stages of smartphone development like
Apple was like when it comes when I when
I start to think back and my experience
with smartphones I always go back to
that original iPhone experience as being
the
transformative for myself and my
impression of this technology but also
for what happened after that and because
of that all props in a world sending
mega props out to Apple there's this
tough part about covering Apple as
extensively as you do Android only
because that they put out devices once
per year and they make the only hardware
for their software so you end up
covering it but there's one point in a
year and then the rest of the year
you're constantly interacting with all
these various Android devices and
switching between them so I think in
order to remain relevant in order to
speak to all the various crowds that are
out there the vocal Apple fans I think
this is the perfect transition I go from
kind of the most ambitious weirdest
least smartphone like new device a
galaxy bolt to go from that device to
kind of the classic when this device
came out of course I had to use it for a
while
I think I use it for three weeks in fact
it's a good phone but I want to reflect
back right now I'm gonna use this for a
while Apple fans rejoice I'm back on
your team now
well can I message each other during the
at the same time and iCloud airdrop
bubbles blue bubbles green bubbles I
promise you I'm in this game to
experiment I'm in this game to use it
all so let's go ahead insert the SIM
card Tim Cook you can celebrate pop the
champagne right now it's going down back
to the iPhone 10's max look would you
look at that bling bling bling the sim
is in daily Drive iPhone tennis max
