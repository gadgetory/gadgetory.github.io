another video and today I've got a bit
of a mysterious one not just mysterious
for you but also myself because I'm not
100% sure what to expect inside of this
box as you can tell it's relatively
nondescript it just says 3G phone series
on the top as well as WCDMA plus GSM
smart phone other than that there's no
branding no no brand name no graphic so
let's go ahead and jump inside the box
and see what this thing is all about so
first thing you'll see is the device and
it's wrapped up in some bubble wrap and
has some writing on the screen protector
the wireless ap 5 inch HD screen 5
megapixel front camera 13 megapixel back
camera Ram 1 gigabyte plus ROM 4
gigabyte 3G connect HD camcorder dual
mode dual standby Wi-Fi GPS you've
probably noticed at this point that this
thing looks a little bit like an iPhone
it's obviously got a bigger screen it
actually feels kind of impressive from a
build quality standpoint given what it
is you have your volume up and down
switch as well as your power switch on
the other side it's moved to this
location here the back is plastic but it
has a brushed kind of feel to it kind of
emulating aluminum or a metallic finish
and of course your camera so let's peel
this part off the front there we go get
rid of that oh there's another screen
protector on there as well I don't know
I'm gonna leave it on for now I have no
idea what I'm dealing with let's try and
power this up ooh an android logo so
that should tell us a bit of the story
already and as that's powering up I'll
look at the other items inside the box
we have a white headset of course this
is after all made to look like an iPhone
these are not very high quality earbuds
it has an inline microphone USB cable
also white micro USB power brick for the
wall and a manual with the heading
manual on it perfect probably not going
to read that so here's the device itself
I think we're powered up now are we yes
the screen is quite dim okay so there we
go
I have now maxed out the brightness and
you can start to appreciate the
wonderful background image that they've
selected otherwise this looks like a
standard Android device to be honest
with you no skin attempting to make it
look like an iPhone in any way you can
see it has two SIM card slots that's
cool a lot of Chinese phones actually do
have two two SIM card slots for
individuals who travel or have multiple
data plans etc I wonder if the back pops
off on this thing
should you see you there you go the back
pops off and you can see you've got your
expansion slot for storage and then the
WCDMA GSM slot and then a GSM specific
slot and of course the battery fits in
here it's not easy to get back on yes
this is kind of bizarre from a build
quality standpoint it sort of feels
somewhere between like a galaxy device
and an iPhone
I guess I'd probably have to change this
background so I don't come off as the
creepiest dude ever of all time you know
it actually feels surprisingly snap it's
not terrible it's not the fastest thing
I've ever used but it appears to be
working
whoa now we're sensing some slowness the
typing that's fun let's check out the
specs on this thing see if we can figure
them out model number I six of course
attempting to be the iPhone 6 quad-core
4.4.2 let me open up the camera check
that out hmm what do I have here not bad
pretty fast actually anyways what we
obviously have here is an attempt at
guessing what the next iPhone might look
like and it's packaged in this thing
called the i6 but based on the leaks
that we've seen and
the mock-ups / dummy units that people
have gotten their hands on this is
probably not what the next iPhone is
going to look like this is borrowing
most of its inspiration from the
previous generation iPhone and just
scaled it up in size to a 5-inch device
kind of strange but as you can tell in
Android experience on something that
looks like an iPhone I'm kind of in
bizarro land right now playing with this
device and imagining an iPhone running
Android which might actually be pretty
cool wouldn't that be the perfect world
where you could pick your hardware and
choose whichever OS you wanted I'm
obviously dreaming because that's not
happening anytime soon
time to go change this background and
experiment with this phone a little bit
more but there you have it the 3G phone
series from god-knows-who and a rather
crude attempt but maybe this is the
closest thing we have to an iPhone
running Android is it I don't know all
right that wraps up this video and quick
look at this strange thing that showed
up at my door if you guys enjoyed it and
you appreciate these unusual items that
come to my mailbox remember to leave a
thumbs up down below subscribe if you
haven't yet and I will catch you on the
next episode later
