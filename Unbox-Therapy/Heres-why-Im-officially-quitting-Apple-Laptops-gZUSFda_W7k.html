a while actually somehow I didn't
realize that this had even happened and
that I hadn't updated you guys I've had
some findings some some adjustments to
my life and I think you might want to
know about them so I mean you probably
read the title this video you kind of
know what it's about on the left hand
side here I have the 13-inch MacBook Air
over here is the ThinkPad x1 carbon now
when this laptop came out I made a very
complimentary video about it the best
laptop for most people it wasn't brand
new and based on that evaluation at that
moment it seemed like a really good buy
for a lot of people especially
considering its starting price the build
quality the association with the Apple
brand you know just just a good package
for a lot of people so I called it that
but I ran into problems with this
shortly after publishing that video and
in fact I kind of felt guilty having
called this laptop the best purchase for
most people so I came on here and I
showed you guys that the keyboard was
not functioning as expected I had
problems with the e key Jack has a
MacBook Pro Kirk has a MacBook Pro and
will has a MacBook Pro and I do too so
this isn't coming from a place of just
wanting to bash a particular brand Apple
anything like that this is just a
personal experience so anyhow the e key
starts to give out then I kind of put it
down and went back to using the MacBook
Pro then I come into work and will tells
me his MacBook Pro is now exhibiting the
same thing that this one was then the
emails start to roll in for me of other
people having experienced the same thing
and I was like man I think this issue is
bigger than I had ever expected and the
guilt started to pile up for me maybe I
should be warning people will Apple fix
it presumably but if this happens to you
after your warranty expires that could
be a very expensive fix and this is not
an inexpensive laptop when that happened
it kind of reconfigured my brain a
little bit I was like man I've been
using Apple laptops exclusively for a
very long time almost 10 years and I was
like I should go back to Windows and see
what's happening in Windows and search
for some windows-based devices that I
might actually like so that took me
- ThinkPad path and guess what I loved
it Wow I really didn't look back I just
tweaked it a little bit so that it was
suitable for myself so that I liked it
and I have fully switched over from Mac
to Windows without much fanfare
obviously without telling you guys
officially and I'm not missing it it's
kind of a flipped version of that ad
campaign from back in the day when you
got the guy who's the Mac and the guy
who's the PC and the one guys in the
suit and the other guy's cool
now I'm going the other direction this
became my main laptop x1 carbon good
battery life surprisingly I began to
really like the matte display without
the glare and the gloss not the
brightest display in the world but I
lived with it I even lived with the chin
on the bottom here I lived with the
inferior trackpad on this ThinkPad when
compared to the MacBook I lived with the
bizarre button placement I lived with
the weird location of the fingerprint
scanner live with all that stuff and I
did so because when I got to type on
this beautiful keyboard you see how I
did that right there Jack it's like
Vanna White I just I come across it when
I typed on his keyboard I had a sense of
euphoria an epiphany of sorts that I was
like man I've been missing out there are
great laptop keyboards out there I'm
talking about the actual experience
having used this even if this thing was
completely functioning correctly I would
trade it in a second
for this experience this thing invites
me to answer emails and nothing does
ever I never want to look at email but
here it's a pleasure it's a joy and it
got me thinking about laptops in general
in the modern era Apple used to have
some pretty strong advantages in
thinness lightness battery life things
like this but now we look at a product
like this it's like geez it's barely
thicker it's lighter in fact with a
bigger display 14 inch display two and a
half pounds 13 inch display 3 pounds
pretty much has thin light way more
interface capacity here type C - a
breakout Ethernet you
speed there's an HDMI port another USB
port headphone jack SIM card slot you
could enable this device for full mobile
connectivity along with a SIM card and a
connection through your carrier so
you're always connected it could be an
always-on mobile device but the biggest
thing was Windows itself I went with
like the simplest setup ever that I can
show Jack here I took the number of apps
that I use I got a relatively frequent
basis
I made them nice and small I pinned them
and then most of what else I do just
lives within the Chrome browser right
there and via tabs I mean this thing is
so clean that's basically what I
interact with my daily life cup of
coffee over here maybe it's over here
and checking you know a couple of
different apps I mean its Windows guys
what do you what do you really need it
got prettier it really did it's not like
it used to be it's more reliable its
smoother it's better looking I turned
off most of the system based
notifications that I didn't need so
they're less abrasive that for me was
like that's way more seamless that's too
easy and I should have been looking at
these products a long time ago because
they are valid substitutes for what
Apple is doing now I should say that
these food flexes are not necessarily
targeted at the same clientele I think
most people gonna say this thing looks
prettier of course myself I like the
industrial appearance of the ThinkPad
this is a simple matte finish it's like
it's a tool it's cool with being a tool
it's a cool tool it gets like smudges on
it it's so what I'm okay with that I
don't think everyone will be the
exchange you make there is you must go
with this wonderful slick aluminum which
I have to admit it looks great but I was
surprised
I enjoyed the switch and I'm I'm
actually quite happy to be in the window
space now and have the wide variety of
laptops to choose from what is a laptop
for most of us these days what do you
really need here what are you paying for
durability form-factor you need
something that's light you need
something that has good battery life and
then after that it's a keyboard and a
display so ask yourself how good are
those components and I can pretty safely
say not just
based on my experience but also on the
reliability factor that these keyboards
on the MacBooks are flawed and that is a
major if not the most major component in
a laptop it's a reason to pick up a
laptop when compared to a phone or a
tablet or some other device that you
have if you do this experiment yourself
if you move over to a keyboard like the
one on the x1 carbon you will never want
to touch or tap anything like this again
Windows is not that bad it's not as bad
as it used to be it's actually kind of
pretty now and you can make this move I
have officially quit using Apple laptops
and it kind of happened quietly I didn't
even really expect it I didn't even
really set out to do it but I'm living
over here now and I'm not missing much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
