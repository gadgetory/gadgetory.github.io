go further what's up guys Lew here and
the cool products continue here on the
show floor at CES 2013 this is a laser
television I haven't heard of this
before maybe it's existed I'm not sure
but LG is calling it the world's largest
wall mountable display now what's
special as we pan down you'll notice
this console looking thing down here
it's actually like a projector yet it
can sit so close to the display and
project a huge image like this they call
that short throw in the projector world
but LG is calling this a display they're
calling it a laser display so it's kind
of an unusual place here it's called the
hecto and it is 1920 by 1080 in terms of
resolution 10 million to one
dynamic contrast ratio but it is one of
the best projected images I've ever seen
we also took a look at the for cater
from Sony but that was in a dark room
this on in the other hand on the other
hand sorry is in a very bright booth
LG's booth and yet the image is still
incredibly vibrant now there is this
frame on the wall that makes it look
more like a flat panel I'm not sure if
it has to be used with this frame or if
you could take the projector or laser
display laser TV if you want to call it
that and move it to different rooms in
your house potentially for gaming I
think this would be really interesting
if you you know hooked up a console to
it and all of a sudden had a hundred
inch display wherever you wanted to
bring it but I do think that there is
some kind of element to this screen
which allows for the projector to
measure up the frame so there's no
overhang so it's not over projecting
beyond the edges of the screen I've
played with projectors in the past
especially at a hundred inches we're
just getting a straight line just
getting a straight display is difficult
to do but looking at this laser TV it's
write beautifully on the edges with
perfect precision so they're doing some
kind of special magic something or other
here it's incredibly thin and as LG said
at the moment it's the largest thing you
can hang on your wall the sound system
you see featured that incredibly small
sound bar is not included with the
television but it is going to be offered
as an accessory it's you're going to get
a hundred inch image being
22 inches from the wall very cool anyway
