really bad
it's a crisis it seriously is worse than
I originally thought
this very special character a text
character that is crashing iMessage it's
rendering iMessage useless but I told
will to look into it like see what this
thing is all about and it turns out it's
way worse than that on his MacBook this
character is also wreaking havoc oh yeah
the Notes app has already been crushed
on the laptop his notes are gone because
there was one note with this character
in it that's all it takes is that one
character that's the reason we brought
well on because like I mean he's been
looking into this all morning we want to
test it a few different ways see how bad
it is he's got an Android phone here
there's an Android phone over here and
then of course we have the iPhone 10 I'm
gonna paste the character into a text
chat Android to Android to make sure
that it's iOS and OS 10 specific so here
we go my reception is really bad yours
oh there we go you see on Android
nothing happened it's it's perfectly
fine well where things are about to get
dicey that simple little character there
is probably about to destroy the
messaging app on the iPhone 10 this is
crazy and who knows what other apps
after we discovered show Jack short okay
the character is there if he touches
that character highlights it dead show
them what happens when you try to open
notes
I mean notes won't even open anymore
iPhone 10 on the left your phone is on
the right I put my sim card in it this
could be a disaster I should warn people
don't do this all right this is a
disastrous is terrible you could break
someone's phone yeah let's just confirm
that what's happening is what we've seen
reported so here we go I'm gonna paste
it in there there it is
sim cards in here now let's go ahead and
send this over you were telling me
earlier this character some sort of
foreign language yeah it's a character I
think in India
Kaluga it's a foreign language character
so what's happening right now if you're
in that country if you're you if you
that's your keyboard everyone's brick
yeah so once again
little slow on the on the send here why
do I feel like as soon as I write test
it goes right away I think it just takes
a while oh do we get it oh boy this is
dangerous
whoa it rebooted but if I go in here
okay I'm gonna open I'm gonna open it
ready but what I don't understand is
it's not killing my messages so the
issue is because I wrote the test it's
okay if the person that sent you the
terrible message to begin with is
willing to help you out they can send
you a rescue message so that when you
launch your messages app it doesn't have
to render that character in the subject
so before I do it look you'll see boom
crash I can't open messages now rescue
and then boom I can get into my messages
now if I do open up the message from
well I'm still gonna be messed dead but
if I paste this on its own and if this
comes through we're dead new message so
it's they're now dead instant messages
are completely dead the messages app is
crushed it's over the extent of this is
more major than I had assumed this is
some serious stuff right now Apple we
hope you can get some engineers working
overtime here this is a that's a problem
remember your uncle Lou told you don't
go do this makes you realize how much we
rely on technology yeah these little
bugs can freak you right out one simple
character just break everything really
dude thanks for your hard work on this
and sacrificing your machine yeah I'll
just be over here using my pixel 2xl
Android devices and I'm gonna text this
to Jack though no I'm just kidding don't
do it it was a joke that was a joke</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
