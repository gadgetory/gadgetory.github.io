therapy and we are continuing the series
here the little mini series on the razor
edge gaming tablet if you guys cut the
last video then you know I already
featured the tablet portion this part of
the video series is dedicated to the
gaming controller which is a very
special element and truly turns this
tablet into something very unique now if
you didn't catch that last video I will
link it in the annotations as well as in
the video responses so you can go check
it out but rest assured I will be
recapping everything in one finale video
where I'm going to do a little mini
review I know I don't usually do them
but I will be doing a mini review in the
finale video going over the gaming
controller the tablet as well as the
multi media dock so this video here
dedicated to the controller and the dock
let's talk about the controller first as
you can see it is huge it is large but
that's because it has to fit the tablet
inside of it now the materials in use
here are all very high quality in fact
the controller is actually pretty heavy
and once you get the tablet into it it
gets fairly substantial to say the least
now that's not necessarily a bad thing
I'd rather have high quality materials
and have the thing weigh a little bit
more than have cheap plastic or
something like that so you have a lot of
aluminum in use here inserting and
removing the tablet is really easy to do
so you could do that while you're on the
go if you you know need to adjust and
just start using the tablet something to
mention here is that this controller has
an extended battery which is capable of
almost doubling the battery life I
believe so you've got an extended
battery in here so that when you're
gaming or whatever you're using those
extra system resources you've actually
got a little bit more power in the
controller itself to do so the
controller though is not all that cheap
this is about 250 bucks if you want to
check out exact pricing and availability
you can do so down in the description
I'll link all the components to the
Razer edge system down there you have
pretty nice triggers on here so you can
actually use this controller for some
first-person shooters or racing games
I've actually used it with some first
person shooters myself through Steam
I'll be showing you a little bit more of
that as the video progresses and you can
of course map all of these buttons too
their relative buttons on the keyboard
so that you can get a real full-featured
gaming experience on a rather unusual
platform all the buttons that are on the
actual tablet are remapped to the
outside of the controller attachment so
that you still have access to things
like volume your power button you know
the speaker still have the ability to
play through and you've also got cutouts
for not only a headphone jack but also
for the events because this thing does
produce a little bit of heat as I
mentioned before but that's to be
expected considering the fact that this
is a powerhouse at least in tablet
standards by tablet standards in the
tablet world so to speak so anyways I'll
go ahead here and show you guys how to
insert the tablet in a moment as well as
give you a little bit of gameplay that's
only fair but as I mentioned before this
is just the feature video on this
particular component I will be doing a
full recap shortly so if you aren't
subscribed yet now is the time to do so
and be on the lookout for my actual
thoughts after using this device for a
more extended period of time I wanted to
give myself about a week with it before
giving my impressions I don't normally
do reviews but in this case I wanted to
since this is just such a unique device
that so few people are actually going to
have the opportunity to play with so
inserting the tablet is actually really
easy to do there's this little port on
the bottom which you can eject by
pressing on these two little levers
it'll pop out the bottom portion I'll
show you here in a moment so as you pull
away on these two little corresponding
levers that middle portion will pop down
and allow for you to go ahead and insert
the tablet now after inserting the
tablet you'll have to sort of you know
maneuver the connector the proprietary
connector back inside but I mean that's
all pretty damn simple to do like I said
just put the tablet in you know you put
the top edge in first and then click the
bottom up and you are good to go so
anyways let's go ahead and check out the
tablet it's pretty straightforward just
like any Windows 8 tablet when you're in
the that sort of menu but where this
thing really shines is when you start to
play some games so in this case I went
ahead and mapped the controls for
Counter Strike global Offensive from
this theme library
it takes a little while to get used to
but after a bit you sort of just feel
like you're gaming on a console I guess
in this case you're left thumbstick just
controls your movement you're right
thumbstick your perspective you got your
triggers for shooting and you can map
everything else the way you like it you
can see there I'm not doing so great so
give yourself a little bit of time to
get over you know the learning curve so
you can actually become decent playing
PC games with a controller interface now
this works completely well as a regular
tablet in fact the web browser is really
fast and the touch interface is one of
the best I've ever used so navigating to
your favorite websites is very easy to
do in this case I actually navigated to
the brand new unbox therapy comm if you
guys haven't visited it yet do it now
there's actually some merchandise you
guys can buy up there go ahead and check
it out regardless unbox therapy comm
I'll link it down below so now is the
point at which we take a closer look at
the multimedia dock this is one more
accessory that lives in the Razer edge
family this is going to allow for you to
connect your device to your television
or other HDMI enabled screen so you can
output you know Full HD gaming to a much
larger display that's a pretty damn cool
thing or maybe you just want to use it
to play movies or something like that
this once again is not cheap it's 99
bucks I will link it down below as well
but it does diversify the usage of your
device that you spent a bunch of money
on so now I can become an HTP see that
means home theater PC so you can use it
to stream your favorite content from
your favorite sites but that's not the
coolest way I've seen this thing
utilized when I was in Vegas for CES
this year at the razer booth they had
this connected to the television along
with the Razer edge tablet and a USB
razor controller coming out of it giving
a console like experience so you can
play your PC games from the couch you
know you can use theme with their big
picture setting and get a pretty unique
experience that still is the holy grail
of living room entertainment on the back
you have three USB ports as well as an
HDMI microphone in headphone out and a
proprietary connector these can also be
utilized on a desktop say for example
you want to get some work
done you know you want to hook up a
keyboard and mouse or maybe you like to
game with a keyboard and mouse you can
do that as well that's fully up to you
it works just like any other PC that has
USBs on it it does seem like a weird way
of achieving a mouse and keyboard gaming
setup but the whole point here is to
give you a diverse experience that you
can use in a number of different ways
whether it be the couch or the desktop
there are obviously cheaper ways of
doing this you get a desktop computer
for a lot less and hook up a keyboard
and mouse but this device aims to give
you a different answer to a number of
different gaming scenarios potential
gaming scenarios anyway guys that wraps
up this video stay tuned for the review
on the complete system you're not going
to want to miss it subscribe if you
haven't yet thumbs up if you like this
series so far and I will catch you guys
on the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
