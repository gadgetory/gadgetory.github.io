Samsung the market leaders its s9 time
and s 9 plus the larger brother with the
dual land set up what's the name of this
color what I have in front of me here
titanium gray is never just great now I
know it also comes in a kind of lavender
color is it midnight black and then
there's a blue as well right coral blue
I actually kind of like this one I was
trying to put fingerprints on it be like
they show up a little less than on the
black color but at this point you
probably saw a couple videos on these
but you are like you know what I got a
sea loons video I want to see what he's
saying I want to see how he feels
obviously this device it's a bit of an
iteration on the last one there's no
overhaul happening here that's ok though
I used the s8 for a very long time it's
a comfortable hold it's a nice little
size well here's the thing in the
meantime in the past year or so the
competition in this marketplace I mean
it's kind of changed to compel you to
spend your extra dollars no price
increase here in fact depending on how
you purchase these and which carrier you
purchase them from you might actually
see a price reduction I take that as a
response to what's happening in the
marketplace and the quality you can get
at lower price point a couple things
about this device that I like straight
away the movement of the fingerprint
sensor underneath the camera lens
something I complained about on the last
one what ends up happening you end up
putting your finger in many cases on the
camera lens and smudging it up sometimes
manufacturers listen you can see the
evidence right here other than this
you'd be hard-pressed place and s8
beside this s9 and really tell it
actually we have an s8 well could you
grab they're very similar in appearance
now that could be a good thing that
could be a bad thing and from the back
the movement of the fingerprints got
better spot easier to reach the speaker
grille which looks different now the
single channel opening there on the old
one the grille looked a bit different
the reasoning for this is an improvement
in the audio performance of the speaker
so Samsung acquires Harman Kardon and
the thinking there and improve in an
audio performance from the speaker unit
firing audio from this location as well
as on the bottom all the rest of the
stuff that you love is here the
headphone jack is here USB type-c it's
here the SIM tray with expandable SD
card storage who doesn't
like expandable storage who doesn't like
options display OLED very pleasing to
the eye is curved edge I'm still a
little bit undecided on whether or not
I'm completely sold on that idea because
when you're watching content you lose a
little bit of it right it wraps around
the edge which it looks cool but does it
do you enjoy content more or is it just
a novelty factor I'm not a hundred
percent decided on that recently I've
been using the pixel to excel a lot now
everybody knows this is not the greatest
display in the world and you can kind of
see how the white is represented a
little differently I think it's kind of
interesting having this phone out
compared to this one these are both 850
bucks
these things are competing head-to-head
one of the main reasons this remains in
my pocket is the incredible camera that
brings me to the camera on the s9 Plus
for the first time ever has a variable
aperture F 1.5 or F 2.4 F 1.5 F 2.4
conor mcgregor figurine here this is f
1.5 so the plant in the background is a
little bit more blurred out compared to
f 2.4 i think for most of you this comes
into play just in low-light situations
if you need more light it'll trigger the
larger aperture the portrait mode as
well which i tested earlier this is
actually a wide selfie mode there's a
front camera wide-angle selfie and it's
guessing via software where the edge of
the foreground or the subject in the
foreground is but as you can see it did
a pretty good job there's mo right there
let's see here edge recognition around
his beard is pretty good as well I think
this one it stacks up kind of nicely as
of right now against the pixel 2xl it's
also got this super slo-mo mode can
shoot up to 960 frames per second so you
tap the record button to start a
recording and the slow motion starts
when something moves within this square
960 fps is pretty wild look at that
flame it's not crazy high resolution
720p it's a nice little gimmick you put
that on social mediums like what are you
doing how'd you do it it looks cool so
yeah now what about the speaker in
general here see if I try to cover up
the audio on the bottom I'm still
getting it through the earpiece here
I want to grab the old s8 over here
it does sound better it ain't razor
phone territory it's a little more full
it's a little more pleasing okay look at
the options in video mode it's
unbelievable you HD you HD 60fps you go
up to 4k 60fps that's pretty cool I mean
we might as well so this should be 4k
stabilized pick up this guy right here
oh it is nice and stable you see the
fingerprint nightmare I have a solution
for that in a moment
of course we pan around we see the squad
we see Jack over there you know what's
the take what's the take away here I
told you earlier I used the essay
extensively take away from me is pricing
I'm really interested in the pricing
component you guys know that if you
watch my videos I'm looking for value
you go to work you work hard for your
money so I'm gonna treat you right
do these devices as of right now do they
justify the cost you're in the territory
of the Google pixel product if you're
gonna compete with the pixel then you
gotta bring the top-notch camera because
that's one of the reasons a lot of
people are picking pics you're gonna get
the fastest updates if you're on the
official Google hardware I mean there's
no other way around it the fit and
finish here quality the glass back I'm
not such a big fan of course you get the
wireless charging with it kind of
sacrifice appearance once you start to
get fingerprints on it look at this so
you have some options alright you go
with a case or you go with the skin
check that out that is the brand new D
brand camo skin and you can probably
tell no fingerprints plus it like has
this cool shifting effect depending on
the lighting I mean I don't care which
phone you have so if you want the black
camel you're gonna have to head over
there I don't know maybe they're gonna
run out I heard me I hope not but anyhow
like look at that that's kind of cool
for me personally I don't know what this
thing can really displace the pixel in
my pocket can the wireless charging get
me back the variable aperture maybe I
use this a little bit more and I'm just
like wow that's gold I can't live
without it the audio probably not enough
for me right now the improvement there
it's tough at the moment I'm a little
bit undecided but I'm intrigued
I think this phone has a real chance to
be a major player in something that I
could could really recommend for right
now
I'm skeptical this episode of unbox the
repiy has been brought to you by Dollar
Shave Club you're probably wasting time
with your shaved goods going to the
supermarket looking through the shelf
you don't know what you need and then
once you finally select it you're
probably paying too much well with
Dollar Shave Club you save time because
it just shows up at your front door so
you're always using sharp blades and not
trying to get extra use under the old
one with the ingrown hairs
it's no good now you might not be able
to tell the glorious beard and whatnot
but every so often I gotta shape it up a
little bit listen your tech savvy you
use the Internet why are you still
wasting time heading to the supermarket
or a drugstore for your razors it's just
not cool now the promo right now for
unbox therapy viewers is this kit right
here ok this is the trial kit which
comes with a little bit of everything
you get the executive handle that's a
robust handle you get a bunch of razor
blades to keep you sharp through the
month and then inside this kit over here
you get even more use the one wipe
Charlies aloe vera civilized way to wipe
shave butter as well as the body
cleanser alright so next time you're
standing there in front of the mirror
you're looking a little disheveled you
need a touch-up maybe you need a clean
shave all together and then you stare
down and you see that disgusting razor
that's sitting on the countertop I want
you to remember this dollarshaveclub.com
