therapy and I'm going to show you real
quick how to do a restore a
factory-fresh restore on your 2011
MacBook Air the first thing you got to
do is shut down the system obviously
pretty self-explanatory and the reason
I'm showing you this video is because
this one is a little different to do
than previous models there are no
restore discs and there's no restore USB
so you kind of need to know what you're
doing the first trick is the power plus
option key trick you got to hold both of
them down at the same time after you hit
the power button you can see the machine
booting up you can let go of power but
keep holding option and once you've done
that you'll see two options amazing the
option key gives us options what a
surprise you've get the Macintosh hard
drive on the left and then you've got
something called recovery HD on the
right that's the important part you want
to select it click enter and it'll boot
into this special recovery partition
that's hidden on the SSD very cool what
you can do from here is a number of
things you can either wipe your system
out clean completely delete everything
or you can restore from a time machine
back up or you can access Disk Utility
number of things so the first thing if
you want to wipe it clean is to open up
Disk Utility and erase your hard drive
obviously that's very important so you
want to select Macintosh HD that's where
everything you've got is stored that
will present you with a number of
options across the top the one that's
important for this particular scenario
is the erase option that's how you're
going to wipe it out of course there are
two buttons down here and you select the
race and then you've got to confirm it
because after that it all happens very
fast if you you don't want to do this by
accident you know you get some stuff on
there that you're trying to protect now
you really want to make sure that you
want to erase it from there
you've got to reinstall an OS though the
disk is clean at that point so you want
to select reinstall OS and this is
obviously an OS 10 Lion system now I
sort of thought that maybe it stored the
entire OS on that hidden partition but I
was wrong in fact it's got to go and get
the components from the Mac App Store so
you spend a lot of time sort of
retrieving those components from the web
even more so than installing it so
that's a bit of a headache but you want
to select your Macintosh HD the same one
that you wiped out as your install
destination of Cour
and then it'll go reach out to Apple's
server and servers I'm sure they don't
have one and start to grab those
components necessary for the
installation of Lion there's obviously
some kind of authentication process
making sure that they're going to give
you the right set of components for your
system after that's all completed you
get a system reboot and then it begins
to install this takes about half an hour
so it's about 45 minutes for the
download and then about half an hour for
the install so not you got to set aside
a little bit of time so you get a little
check mark after that part has completed
and an automatic reboot which will bring
you back to factory fresh you will boot
right back up as if you just pulled this
thing out of the box so anyway guys the
reason for this was just to illustrate
the steps involved in in restoring your
system of course and since it's unlike
any of the Mac books before it I thought
it would be you know worth doing a video
about I also think you're probably going
to see this kind of restore system in
other Mac books and maybe the entire
Apple line at some point so it's good to
familiarize yourself with this
particular process anyway guys if you
