of them in front of me here and I know
you've seen hundreds maybe thousands of
videos on different headphones not just
here on the channel but cross YouTube
but usually I'm looking for something
unique these are called the warehouse
arc what's different about these is that
these have something called wireless
audio sharing synced up with nearby
warehouse headphones and listen together
this is about socialization this is
about being able to share in the same
media that your friend happens to be
listening to well guess what if you're
at school you're in the cafeteria or
something boom just linked from yours to
theirs and they can kind of DJ let's say
for example if someone has a movie on
their laptop on an airplane you're
sitting next to them this is an elegant
way to both be watching the same screen
and listening to the same source on your
own independent headphones and you're
doing so wirelessly so there are some
use cases in which this might be
interesting customization of the color
so you can actually control the color
touch control so you can tap the side
and then they claim there's precision
tuned audio here you can see 40
millimeter drivers that's pretty good up
to 30 meters of thinking range up to 15
hours of battery life you could have
like your own silent party you know
maybe you got the neighbors constantly
complaining I mean it would be a weird
look alright it's got me thinking let's
check these babies out Oh a bit of an
unboxing experience here look at that
presentation
it's an on-ear style but if you push
down into the ear cup there's like a
concave in there so we'll see how I like
that generally I like around the ear
style but this is maybe a hybrid here
you can see the controls on the side
beautiful
it shows you how the touch controls work
in auxilary cable there Mike yes a
microphone here and button oh sweet
look at that create a station it's like
your own radio station you're
broadcasting what your battery life is
in percentage it will tell you what's
playing if you have a song playing and
this is also where you can broadcast
join stations and switch the light
setting Wow so check it out I'm
listening to a podcast right now the Joe
Rogan experience you can see the artwork
now showed up now playing
volume-wise I've tested a lot of
Bluetooth headphones which don't give me
the juice I'm looking for these things
are banging I can move around the color
wheel and that's kind of nice idiot it
moves in real time and then there's a
few different multi color options also
getting here Tom brother more Tom more
Tom for Tom Moore Tom guys thumbs up if
you can't get enough of Tom thumbs down
if you're fed up he's like oh oh okay so
there's Tom solos there's my solos so I
click on the broadcast button over here
and I can name my radio station big lose
audio extravaganza high school
extravagances now on Tom's side he's
going to join the nearest station boom
he just joined the extravaganza and I'm
broadcasting from my head I feel like a
is the closest I've ever felt to being a
radio DJ right now you're on my watch
brother prepare to have your life
changed who'd have a lot - it didn't
look like mine inside big low why am i
screaming any that are yours was loud is
mine oh man I'm getting blasted here I'm
getting blasted we're gonna switch over
to SoundCloud does that work
oh okay so I completely changed audio
source I went from google play music
into SoundCloud now and Tom still in the
mix you don't you want going freestyle
to this so you want priests out of this
sure they already saw me freestyle so I
know nothing I do not make her there's
nothing that I know we could rhyme right
now it could be a whole circle of people
he could be involved yeah but I would be
the guy listening me like that's good
that's great you know no no I give them
a is that one you're heading mr. wu-tang
classic yeah this man
mine's delayed they have to be in sync
or this is pointless imagine we were
watching a video
delay delayed it's a couple of frames
delayed to me that's totally watchable
like the lips are ever so slightly ahead
of the words music is going to be less
of a problem yeah oh yeah because if I'm
playing a song for you as long as you
don't hear mine there's liner blasting
rapidly well you're not playing my phone
not working listen there are a little
bit finicky on the connectivity between
it too slight delay and then at time
connections on and off theoretically a
lot of this stuff could be fixed through
software updates new apps when it's
working it's kind of a cool concept that
slight little delay I think some people
might have an issue with it others
probably not so much it's a pretty cool
contest how much do you care I think
it's according to Ashley
scale of one to ten the Tom care factor
hey whoa
all right so I'm surprising you there
he's usually on the lower end of the
spectrum so uh there you have it Tom
give Tom your thumb right where it
counts</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
