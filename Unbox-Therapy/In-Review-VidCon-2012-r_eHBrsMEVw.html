to you by gamefly what's up guys Lew
here and it is early Monday morning I am
finally back home from my travels I was
back out on the west coast for an event
called VidCon which I'm sure some of you
know about I did post a little update
from out there but I'm gonna give you
the full review of the event now it's a
conference or convention depending on
what you want to call it for video
makers that exist mostly online
independent video makers and there's
people there from YouTube there's people
from the tech world like myself there's
also people from the vlogging world you
know it's a it's a big sort of mix of
all the different people making content
online there's also a lot of fans there
that come out to meet their favorite
youtubers and scream and cry and all the
rest of it and they had also a large
sort of stage where live performances
were taking place i watch the guys from
five second films come out and do a five
second film live they recorded it live
so there was a lot to look at and a lot
happening all at once it was pretty hard
to take everything in but I did get to
meet a bunch of new people new cool
people who all talk about towards the
end of this video but i also want to
just talk about the concept of VidCon in
general if any of you guys are
considering going in the future so
VidCon offers some some insight some
good information for those that are just
starting up their their YouTube careers
or their online video careers there are
these things called breakout sessions
happening all over the convention center
and everybody is speaking on tips and
tricks to both develop your channel in
your content but also things like social
media so on and so forth and you can
watch influential or successful people
in the field give you some of the inside
tips that that normally are unavailable
to you so in that sense it's a very
productive and valuable event but
there's also another element as well
which is the networking element the
partying element you can hang out with
people that are literally in your field
and get to know them better and also
potentially
collaborate in the future after all
collaboration is a very powerful tool in
the world of online video and so making
those connections can lead to greater
success for yourself now youtube made
some interesting announcements as well
in their presentation they talked about
a big giant golden button that was
getting some press basically there's
this framed golden button they had that
they said they were going to be handing
out two channels with 1 million
subscribers or more there was even a
rumor going around that it was solid
gold or something but it's probably
gold-plated I don't really know I wasn't
sitting in that particular session that
was on the very first day which was
industry day my past gave me access
following that day I was a little bit
late signing up so I was lucky to get in
at all and then they announce something
else as well which was for those with a
hundred thousand subscribers plus
apparently there was going to be a
special bag a special backpack i believe
and also five hundred dollars to spend
at B&amp;amp;H which of course is the superstore
both online and in new york city that
sells digital photo equipment audio
equipment basically all the equipment
you'll need to improve your setup
improve your production value and
continue to progress what you're doing
now I don't even have a hundred thousand
subscribers yet but I'm approaching it
quickly I'm probably going to do a
giveaway when I get there as well but
that's a totally different topic maybe
B&amp;amp;H will reach out to me or YouTube
directly I'm not really sure they
weren't a hundred percent clear on
exactly how that promotion is going to
work I assume i'll probably receive an
email at some point in the future who
knows how long it will take but back to
VidCon I got to meet lots of people that
you probably know here on YouTube spend
some time hanging out with tldtoday some
time hanging out with soldierknowsbest I
got to meet ty from ty's iphone help
austin from dunkin 33 303 i also got to
meet Ellie from app chat the guys from
ipod uplink Phil from I cryptic I'm
gonna now I'm going to forget somebody
and that's not going to be fun Hank from
logically Hank that's that's a lot of
people there right there on its
own but there were many many more and if
i missed you i'm sorry if i missed you
i'll link your channel in the
description but i got to spend some time
hanging out with all these different
people oh I get to meet Jon from Jon for
lakers or TechnoBuffalo I really don't
want to forget anyone but anyways these
people that normally only exist in the
online world become real people that you
can shake hands with and talk to you
directly when you go to events like
VidCon and the difference between VidCon
and events like CES or III or these
other sort of events that i go to cover
is that VidCon is open to the public you
don't need to be in the industry you
don't need to be press or anything like
that so it's open to anybody no matter
what stage you're at in your video
career and so that's I think what makes
it special you have this mixing of
industry people with regular everyday
people and it so it sort of builds this
casual environment and its really a lot
of fun I do have to say so overall I'd
say I had a great time out there my
review is that it's a solid investment
there are three different tiers of
passes that you can buy all of them a
good value I believe the most expensive
passes the industry pass but like I said
for those of you that are just starting
up there's plenty of good information
for you to get with something called the
community pass which i believe is 80
bucks so definitely consider it next
year I will be there next year so you
can come out and meet me and everyone
else and it keeps growing I believe
there were six or seven thousand people
this year which was triple what it was
the year before so it continues to
become more and more popular and yeah
just a lot of fun all around so to those
of you that I met out there what's up
nice to meet you all for those of you
that I didn't maybe I'll see you next
year and that's going to wrap up this
particular episode here I've got a lot
more content playing guys I told you
before I gotta catch up on exactly
what's going on here on unbox therapy
after all this is about unboxing videos
I've got a couple products lined up
right over here to my side which I'm not
going to share right now and then as
always I've got more stuff coming in
that fits the regular unboxing style
right here on unbox therapy so stick
around the channel for that and most
importantly stick around for a hundred
thousand subscribers because
is going to be something very
interesting given away haven't 100%
decided on it yet but I might be
collaborating with another big YouTube
channel to make it possible so stay
tuned for that I've got Betty the
headphone junkie coming up I've got the
ultimate gaming PC project so everything
you care about it's going to be handled
