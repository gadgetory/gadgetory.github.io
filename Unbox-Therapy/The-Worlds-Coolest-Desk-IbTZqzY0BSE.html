therapy and today is a very exciting day
because what you're looking at is our
brand new unboxing table slash desk in
the headquarters and it is not your
everyday table a desk that's because
it's motorized and at the touch of a
button you can elevate or lower it it's
called the vert desk and I am very very
impressed not only can you elevate it
and lower it it's also super sturdy it
can hold up to 500 pounds so you can
load this thing up with your computer
gear and still maneuver it after the
fact
now the reason someone might be
interested in a desk like this and the
reason you should be interested in it is
because most of us are used to working
in a chair and sitting in a chair for
hours well let me tell you something it
ain't healthy every so often it's nice
to change your position work standing up
and it promotes a healthier lifestyle
using your body using your muscles every
so often now for us in the studio this
makes a lot of sense as an unboxing
table as you can see we can elevate
closer to the lens without a need to
change the lens just get some incredible
flexibility without having to change too
much of our camera setup so I'm just
loving this thing I want to give a huge
shout out to the people at vert desk for
sending this my way and if you guys want
to show them some love I mean you
definitely should if you want to check
out pricing and availability I will put
a link down in the description you can
get this thing in a number of different
colors and dimensions and I just think
it's so damn cool I wish that I had two
more one for Kirk's desk and one for my
desk so that we could not only have our
unboxing table behave this way but also
our workstations I think that would be
so damn cool anyways that wraps up this
quick look at probably the coolest desk
in the world or one of the coolest desks
in the world it's the vert desk and by
the way you probably noticed Betty the
headphone junkie chilling on top leave a
thumbs up down below if you still want
to see me stick some headphones
top of her for some tests I know I
haven't got around to it yet but I
really really want to so hopefully you
guys are still interested in seeing that
anyways thanks for watching thanks to
vert desk and I'll catch you guys on the
next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
