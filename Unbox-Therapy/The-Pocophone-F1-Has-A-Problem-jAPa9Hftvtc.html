you'll ever need so I've been using the
polka phone f1 yeah I told you you
didn't believe me the SIM card is in you
can see I even have a couple of bars
there right now I have it on the table
next to an s9 plus and I'm going to tell
you why in a second year it's because
many of you guys have been hitting me up
on Twitter asking a very specific
question about this poke foam and that
question is specifically about how the
polka phone deals with drm content that
is digital rights management
it's a terrible term nobody likes it but
it's it's a reality of modern content
and the Internet some of it is protected
for obvious reasons and that content
lives in places like Netflix Amazon Hulu
BBC and other places that stuff is
protected and because of that there's a
whole protocol there's a whole hardware
software scenario that's necessary for
decrypting that encrypted content now
news started to break about an issue on
this particular device when it comes to
decrypting that encrypted content that
lives in places like Netflix like Amazon
it's not that it can't do it at all but
it can't do it in HD I thought I needed
to make you aware since I've done a
couple videos on it now and I know it
generated a lot of interests a lot of
you guys are asking me about it it turns
out that it is true this unit is
affected because of that let me give you
a little more detail here so there's
something called Widevine Widevine
support and that's what's necessary to
decode in full HD or even in some cases
HDR content from sites like Netflix the
poco f1 comes with Widevine DRM l3 but
wide vying l1 is what's necessary to
decode in full HD resolution from
Netflix Amazon and so on
instead on a device like the poco you
are stuck at 540 P on Netflix now
because of the number of tweets that I
got regarding this particular topic I
real
it must be important to allow to you to
be able to look at HD content and it
kind of makes sense especially if this
is your main display now this is not
something that can be updated through
software it's not it can't be addressed
via software update it's not like
eventually it's going to support HD
resolution on Netflix unless to some
sort of modification to the actual
physical unit now this particular
problem is not exclusive to the polka
phone or Xiaomi devices in fact it
happened previously to oneplus devices
as well in the 5 and the 5 t now I don't
know if this is something that was just
overlooked or if it was a cost-saving
thing I'm not a hundred percent certain
but nonetheless at the moment if you
purchased this phone you will not be
watching Netflix in HD so the purpose of
this video right here is to not only
advise you and let you know about that
flaw but to also test how big of a
problem that is so I have a galaxy s 9
on the right hand side the polka phone
f1 on the left hand side I'm going to
launch Netflix on both of them these two
pages look very similar while they are
it's the same show but what you'll
notice is on the s9 you see the HDR logo
that's for this particular show if you
pick another show that might not be
available in HDR you'll just see the HD
logo instead but regardless of which
show you pick on this device over here
you will never see an HD or HD R logo on
the content this will be locked in to
540 P the question is is that enough
pixels how big of a difference is that
going to be and so on so let's load
something up and take a look here
top device s9 + that's running in HD and
then the device below at 540 P the poco
f1 now of course this is a difficult
thing to evaluate you're looking at it
through a camera lens then back on your
phone that you happen to be watching
this but I can attempt to do my own
analysis the HD image looks better but
surprisingly on a display this size the
540 P version of Netflix looks pretty
good like totally manageable look if
you're a super Netflix or Amazon video
enthusiast
probably gonna want the best resolution
available that's understandable but if
you're a casual viewer and you're
already on a cellular network and
watching your data consumption I don't
know you might be better off just
watching it in 540 P anyways it would be
hard for me personally because generally
you want the best capability you want
the highest resolution available
wherever possible that said YouTube
completely fine Full HD actually I
should show that off real quick YouTube
does not utilize this type of DRM as
you'll see on YouTube we can go up to
1080p this is an unboxing video and of
course full res thank goodness I'm a
little less worried I don't think this
should be a deal-breaker it's not a
massive enough difference stepping down
to the 540 P that the polka phone f1 is
capable of I think it's less of a big
deal than then some of you out there
might think it would have been not the
deal breaker now of course this doesn't
conclude my evaluation I told you I
wanted to do an extended scenario like I
have with so many other smartphones
recently and I'm going to continue to do
that with this one I can tell you that
so far it's been very promising this is
my main phone my SIM card is in here as
promised I have a lot of thoughts on it
but that's gonna continue to evolve a
little bit more is shaping up with my my
final evaluation and feelings regarding
this device at this price point there
you have it yes a flaw not as major as
some people think in my opinion kind of
sucks but we don't need to throw the
baby out with the bathwater just yet
