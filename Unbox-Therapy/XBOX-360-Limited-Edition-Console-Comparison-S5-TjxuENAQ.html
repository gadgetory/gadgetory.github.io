therapy and today I'm featuring three
different Xbox 360 consoles that have
all been unboxed originally on the
channel somewhere I'll put links to each
independent video in the annotations as
well as down in the description so if
you care to see more detail on any
individual unit you can click through to
those but this video here aims to just
compare the visual aspects of each of
these three collector's editions
comparing the controllers as well and
then looking at the custom sounds that
each one produces so let's get right
into it so we'll start from the side of
each console you can get an idea of the
paint job here of course the Gears of
War model done in a very nice black and
dark crimson red and as you'll notice
here certain elements on that paint job
on the Gears of War unit are matte
whereas others sort of have a semi-gloss
finish the modern warfare 3 console as
well as the Star Wars console are
completely matte in terms of the paint
job finish right across the board now as
we flip them around to the other side
you can get a better idea of some of
that glossiness that the Gears of War
one has is a little bit of reflection
there whereas the other two are 100%
matte as I mentioned earlier now from a
technical standpoint these are all
identical of course though I did notice
something strange on the back where the
AV port is the modern warfare 3 console
had three metallic exposed pins on it
that didn't appear on the other two not
sure why they function identically
you've also got a special message on the
inside of the disc tray for the Star
Wars console other than that that sort
of explains the appearance of each one
of those now on to the controller's here
you can see the Gears of War controllers
the modern warfare 3 controllers and
then one single controller for the Star
Wars special edition and I'm not really
sure why they didn't give you an extra
one probably because they included
connect with that particular bundle and
because you got to play their new game
using Kinect so anyway you're only going
to get one golden controller instead of
two something to consider if you're in
the market for a collector's edition so
getting a closer look at the Gears of
War controller here you can see that
sort of marbled paint job you've got
some black elements to go with that dark
crimson red of course you've got the new
rotatable d-pad now as I flip the
controller around you
is a two-tone color scheme on the back
you've got the black battery pack to go
with that same crimson red from the
other elements of this addition and then
on the bottom you have a little piece of
trim done up in glossy black so here's a
closer look at the modern warfare 3
controller which has a completely matte
paint job the whole way across and
something that I noticed in terms of
differences is that these thumb sticks
the newer thumb sticks are slightly
different they're they're a little bit
deeper and have a slightly sharper edge
around the rim whereas the older
controller had these four nubs instead
as you can see here so it's actually
something ahead and considered and I
didn't notice until this particular
comparison here's a look at the Star
Wars controller which shares those newer
thumb sticks with the modern warfare 3
controllers all of these controllers
here have the rotatable d-pad the new
rotatable d-pad so you're not gonna have
to worry about that and I suppose the
last thing to mention is the color of
the back side of both of these newer
controllers they're both done up in
black the only difference here is on the
bottom side that little piece of trim
the Star Wars controller has this wiring
being shown here so slightly more
interesting paint job so let's hear how
they sound because as you guys know they
do have special sounds built-in so
there's a look at the Star Wars model I
open the disc tray now and then close it
up now let's let the modern warfare 3
console make some noise this one
probably has my favorite sounds that
most understated now let's go ahead and
close up the disk drive and try out the
last one so here's a look at the Gears
of War 3 console
kind of a strange sound that it makes
when you turn it on and then of course
to open the disk drive and close it up
so anyway guys there you have it these
three consoles these three editions
