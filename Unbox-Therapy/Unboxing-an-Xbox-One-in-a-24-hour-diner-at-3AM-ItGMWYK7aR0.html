unboxing and Mikey
min it's alright man come on why do you
like the PlayStation 4 better min what's
up guys Lou here is late at night right
a 24-hour restaurant but the Xbox one
came out today and so we're going to do
a late game early game unboxing video
it's just on the fly it's just a new
style just for this one so it is not the
day one edition unfortunately although I
don't know what the difference is
between the two anyways let's go ahead
and check out what's inside so a few
more items in the PlayStation for us
because we've got the camera included
inside we got some paperwork here as
usual HDMI into your TV
power into your Xbox we still have this
gigantic power brick unfortunately don't
know why they like a gigantic power
brick but anyways we still have that we
have another power cable controllers in
here the controller believe it or not
still takes double-a batteries I was
told although they don't stick out
anymore
so now it's a little bit more lower
profile controller feels alright but one
thing is the thumb sticks are smaller
right we got the basic headset inside
you guys are familiar with this into the
controller
you might upgrade that you probably will
upgrade that they have included an HDMI
cable that's a plus actually looking a
pretty high quality for my cable we have
a bad-boy camera this was a you know
controversial item back at e3 when it
first got announced because it is
included and I will be attached
system pretty much all the time so this
is your camera Kinect sensor etc all
right so lastly we have the main
attraction and in there is this the
first 24 hour restaurant X box unboxing
it might be but if you go back in my
videos you'll see that one of my first
big time unboxing was an iPad inside of
a Starbucks so if you find that video to
see it's not the first time I've been
messing around doing unusual unboxing
videos in unusual locations this is
probably a little bit more unusual cuz
it's huge
alright so there it is the Xbox one
bigger than the PlayStation has some
different features so you got a USB on
the side I see the SS logo so super
speed USB 3
I got your slot-loading Drive on the
front Xbox logo over here on the back is
where your connectivity is power HDMI to
TV so the HDMI out there's also an HDMI
IN so you put your cable box into here
I've even seen people put their
PlayStation HDMI out into here
PlayStation 4 that's an interesting move
right now you've got optical audio spin
if audio couple more USBs camera input
Kinect sensor input what is this right
here IR out and of course your network
connectivity so anyway that pretty much
wraps it up so as you can tell we made a
big mess over here we Came we ate some
food and we unboxed in Xbox one in the
24 hour restaurant in downtown Toronto
you guys enjoyed this please leave a
thumbs up down below and I'll catch you
on the next episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
