another video and today it's going to be
a fresh episode of does it suck not sure
what the hand movements were about in
front of me I have something that's a
little bit nondescript it says zone of
variety and excellence I you know to be
honest with you that's kind of what
unbox therapy is to zone a variety and
more importantly excellence of the
highest form I what the reason this is
nondescript might have something to do
with what's inside zv e multifunctional
cigar blue iphone 6 4.7 inch new this
look at the fancy foam cutout not
messing around get rid of that a micro
USB cable and what looks like a fairly
chunky iphone case well it's chunky for
a reason that's because this bad boy has
a built-in lighter now when i first
heard about this i was thinking to
myself this is one of the most bizarre
inclusions you could possibly imagine on
a phone case but that's not all it does
obviously protection and stuff as well
and a bottle opener too because well I
mean if you're smoking cigarettes you
probably want a beer to go with it
before we get started on testing this
out I do want to say I do not recommend
smoking it's not good for you let's
actually test this thing out so a
microUSB port here on the bottom there's
a lock here that'll stop you from
accidentally opening the lighter part
you probably wouldn't want that to
accidentally open in your pocket could
be a hot die the features do not end
there because I just noticed something I
was trying to figure out what this is
here but now because of the icon I'm
pretty sure that I know it looks like a
camera on a tripod does it not
that's grayed out right now
yes holy multifunction now why would you
have it there is a great point I suppose
if you have a head that moves you could
still figure it out we have a case
bottle opener tripod mount and most
interestingly the flame thrower
okay so let's at least make sure that an
iPhone fits in here properly which it
does cut out for the camera on the back
ready satisfying little clicks there but
actually seems kind of tough nonetheless
we do need to test this thing and so Don
Tomas finest quality handmade Honduran
cigars now as I said before I do not
condone smoking look at these things
individually wrapped wholly fancy town
whoo believe it or not I've never smoked
a cigarette in my entire life you slide
this guy down right here and you see
that coil there starts to heat up turn
orange let's try this out
okay that's definitely lit gee that
guy's so uh it can light a cigar maybe
you're one of these post-apocalyptic
Preppers that's ready for anything
well I suppose having an extra fire
source that's always on you might be
interesting so let's say that I had some
spare cardboard listen the apocalypse
happened we're starving I just caught
this rabbit cook the rabbit dad we got
this case we have a little bit of
cardboard let's see if this strategy I'm
thinking about is actually viable on
this case we have smoke yeah we have an
ember there oh yeah look it's going man
yeah totally viable okay nightmare again
Jack does what it says it's gonna do
does it suck
um no no it doesn't suck I mean maybe I
wish it wasn't quite so chunky and maybe
it would be cool if it had some other
tools built into it
a little mini screwdriver or yeah a
little blade little corkscrew I don't
know it's a weird case you probably
didn't know it existed I didn't know it
existed until it showed up here the CVE
multifunction case $13.99 on Amazon
it'll meet the expectations that you
have for it it actually feels pretty
sturdy doesn't suck it's not for
everybody so there you have it another
strange and wacky thing here in the
world of does it suck on unbox therapy
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did make sure to leave a thumbs up down
below to let me know that you liked it

catch you on the next episode later guys
