another video and in front of me I have
a scary looking box as you can tell
that's because it came from halfway
around the world and inside is
supposedly something very exciting and
dare I say exclusive this is supposedly
a case for the upcoming iPhone 7 that's
only five seven somebody got in touch
with me you may have heard of him his
name is Sonny Dixon he's made a name for
himself leaking out Apple components
this is no different well my
understanding is that these cases are
fabricated in advance based on mock-ups
of the upcoming devices so apparently
the iPhone 7 will be a little bit
different than the last one and
hopefully this case will give us some
insight into what those differences
might be as long as I don't break it now
with these boxes from China it's always
a bit of a mystery on how to get inside
found the right spot to cut all right so
7c the number seven that says it all oh
and 5s e Apple rumored to also put out a
smaller iPhone this time around
to go with the flagship product okay
whoo this to you probably looks kind of
anticlimactic it really it is this is
you know the initial stages of
fabrication the 5se on the other hand as
you see there that's a dinky little
iPhone you mind passing me the iPhone 5
loosely based on this device it looks
almost identical now granted the volume
rockers here don't quite line up we are
probably going to see some slightly
different curvature to the body of the
5s key the previous version this one
here kind of a block design what we're
probably going to see is something more
similar to the 6 and 6s
least just in this variation here of the
curvature around the side comparatively
speaking I do notice that the volume
buttons on this guy are still circular
now with the seven what we really want
to do here is kind of compare the layout
I also have an iPhone 6 case the
purposes of this evaluation one thing
stands out to me is the unusual shape of
this camera cutout this time around we
have a much larger opening which would
imply something interesting happening in
the camera department potentially a
bigger piece of glass potentially a
couple of lenses volume rockers appear
the same hold switch location very
similar power switch etc and even the
bottom of the devices though the bottom
of this device here looks to have a
pretty large cutout right in at location
they're a little bit larger than on the
other case let us take an iPhone 6s and
see just how it fits exactly this now is
sticking out to me along with the camera
look at the camera you see that so the
camera is not lining up at all I'm
fairly confident in saying we are going
to see some kind of overhaul in the
camera Department for the upcoming
iPhone the iPhone 7 can you get a look
at that right there
this cutout extends way up here onto the
actual aluminum material that makes up
the iPhone normally that's what you're
looking at you're looking at something
that frames the Lightning port itself a
little bit more obviously why maybe
something to do with that rumored
headphone change from the headphone jack
to the Lightning port exclusively maybe
some kind of adapter know what I think
I'm prepared to say something else as
well
this headphone jack here doesn't look
big the cutout doesn't look big enough
for it this is a standard earPod
headphone connector and I was right that
won't go in whoa no dice on standard ear
pods case itself doesn't allow for a set
of headphones to be installed into that
headphone jack
whoa I think you're just going to have
microphone here speaker here maybe maybe
two speakers and a lightning point
headphone jack might be dead Wow
leave a thumbs up down below if you like
this content and I will catch you on the
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
