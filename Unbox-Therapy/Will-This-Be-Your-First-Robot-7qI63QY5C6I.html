cute little robotic guy right here
big brain bigger personality apparently
this is a fairly intelligent little
creature he's made by the folks over at
Anki now I've worked with them in the
past did a video on something called
Anki Drive which you may have seen those
cars moving around the track a lot of
artificial intelligence they hit me up
they said we'd love to sponsor another
episode and send you the Cosmo he's got
an app in the App Store it's on Google
Play as well almost human communicates
naturally in response to your actions
expresses a broad range of real emotions
and reacts to yours well that's better
than Jack he's had none of that with him
oles most cause was already an upgrade
over this dead pan over here he develops
a unique personality the longer you
engage with it are we in the future
quite possibly oh my goodness very
smooth well done okay oh these gold
colored contact points on the bottom
here couple of what looked like LED
lights that's the little guy right there
let's get Cosmo up and running sticker
help him feel at home perfect table for
him right here in fact I feel a
responsibility now like I just got a pet
or something he's got his own moves and
he likes to move in his own way so try
not to push him or force his lift he
might get a little fussy

which I assume are gonna be part of some
activity oh wow look at that full flat
charger I love that here is the actual
charge station let me get it hooked up
alright so I've got the little guy
sitting down in his special spot here he
has a password displayed on his screen

got to connect his Wi-Fi hence the
password okay Cosmo is ready to play
just like a pet he might need your help
