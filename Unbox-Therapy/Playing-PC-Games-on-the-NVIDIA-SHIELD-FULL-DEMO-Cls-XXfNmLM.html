more coverage on the newly released
Nvidia shield this is a very exciting
device and as mentioned in the last
video it has some very unique
characteristics including the ability to
stream gameplay from a gaming computer
I've got one set up over there so let's
get into it and see what this can do so
in the last video we focused on the
basics after all it was the unboxing I
showed you guys the ports I showed you
guys the basic functionality and we
booted up a couple of mobile games but
that's not the major value proposition
in my opinion of the Nvidia shield
instead it's when you connect it when
you sync it up with a capable gaming PC
in this case we have one right here this
is a small form-factor system but it's
packing a punch it's got a gtx 780
inside which is more than capable of
pushing an HD stream of a pc game to the
Nvidia shield that being said you don't
necessarily need a gtx 780 as long as
you've got a 650 or higher you will be
good to go with this particular
functionality this is really easy to set
up I was incredibly surprised the first
thing you want to do is boot into the
NVIDIA GeForce experience which is
probably already installed on your
system if you have a capable card and
then as you move across the menus here
you will see eventually an option to
enable streaming to an Nvidia shield
after you check off that little box the
rest of the work really happens on the
shield itself in terms of setup but it's
hard to even call it setup because once
you've enabled this on your system it's
just a matter of moving over in the menu
system right on the Nvidia shield you
just go over to PC games launch the
computer that has been enabled with the
name of course you might have multiple
computers in your house where you have
this functionality enabled but anyways
you select that and then right away you
can see the games that are capable of
being streamed to your Nvidia shield
this was way easier than I expected it
to be I was sort of worried there'd be a
lot of configuration but this literally
just works I know that's a cliche but
this seriously just works there is no
lag this blew my mind and you can see
here if you watch the video clips
in saying there's no lag I don't know
how this is possible I don't know what
they're doing on the back end to make
this functionality possible but anyways
it is working whether you're sitting
right in front of the system or if
you've moved over to the couch like I
have here
it just keeps working it just keeps
streaming and you feel like you're
playing a local game even though of
course all the intense stuff all the
processing etc is happening in another
location so here you can see me playing
a little bit of Bioshock go easy on me
in the comments I'm a bit of a noob when
it comes to this particular title
but that's not the only game you can
stream we've got a little bit of a
selection here so the next one I want to
demonstrate is dirt three which is
actually really fun to play on a
controller type interface I've always
been a fan of racing games and I just I
don't know I feel a certain level of
connectivity when using a controller
because I grew up using controllers when
it came to racing games and this one
feels incredibly comfortable once again
right in sync with the actual gameplay
on the computer I'm just really
impressed this stuff literally just
works so as you guys can tell I did not
expect to be this blown away by this
particular product given the fact that
it's so new but as of right now this
thing is really exciting and I'm really
happy to have one in my possession so
that wraps up this demo of the PC
gameplay streaming on the brand-new
Nvidia shield there's going to be more
titles released shortly so this
capability is only going to expand as
time goes on but this video series isn't
over and if you're enjoying it make sure
to leave a thumbs up down below in the
next episode I'm going to be showing off
more of the Tegra zone and the mobile
games that are capable of taking
advantage of this brand-new device
anyway guys that wraps up this episode
if you haven't subscribed yet now is a
good time to do so and I will catch you
on the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
