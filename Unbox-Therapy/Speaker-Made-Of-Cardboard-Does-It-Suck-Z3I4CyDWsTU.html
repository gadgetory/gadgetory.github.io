weird stuff cuz I got your back in the
world of weird where else would you find
it and who would you trust
maybe the Ghostbusters or maybe us can I
give it this is a speaker made out of
cardboard why I have no idea probably
because they could combine recycled
pulp material and flat panel speaker
technology it's incredibly light I have
a hard time believing it's gonna sound
very good at all to be honest with you
USB to power it up and then it has a 3.5
millimeter jack to play the music made
in Taiwan let's check it out the pulp op
Pope speak the pulp pop-pop speaker huh
you know okay what duh what duh you know
what's weird when you've got a speaker
made out of cardboard you send it in a
car in some cardboard there's a manual
and then that cardboard gets recycled
and it probably turns into one of these
that beautiful one day you'll become
cardboard to do not disassemble do not
bend drop if the product produces an
odor immediately turn up the device you
have a USB as well as a mini Jack over
here and it looks like a power button on
the back here this is more like a
hipster type thing where people come
over and you're like you get that music
you're listening to dude speaker yeah
that's made out of cardboard paper it's
renewable my vegetables are raw are you
getting enough Jack's having a good time
today so we have power and we have mini
jack where am I going to put this so it
stays up here and you know today we will
find out why or why not
cardboard
has not been the standard material in
speakers everywhere oh here we go
this might be the worst thing that's
ever been on unbox therapy it sounds
terrible
is it ambitious I don't know is it like
an art piece is it only four of the
people with raw vegetables probably
you're not gonna lose yourself in the
music on this baby right here I'll tell
you what it ain't gonna happen you know
what the crazy part is that little tiny
cube that you can attach to any surface
sounded way better than this the rocket
speaker hears bones be good the vault
speaker sounds better than this giant
thing listen I made like a thousand
videos here on YouTube okay and you
order stuff up I gotta make the move so
you don't have to so you don't see this
Amazon page and wonder like what is what
is the world the cardboard speakers like
now you know it ain't that great and now
you have no need to dive into it cuz I
did it for you
I saw the hot lava and a dove headfirst
and I did it for you so you could stay
away god bless</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
