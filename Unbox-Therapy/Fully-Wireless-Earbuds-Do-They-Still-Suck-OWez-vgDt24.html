about them but what is this mumbo-jumbo
about fully wireless headphones or as
this company's calling it entirely
wireless headset no wire between each
one of the earbuds now this is not the
first time I have tackled a product
claiming to do this thing to be fully
wireless and to this point it's been an
absolute disaster pair the earbud to
that earbud pair it back to you get
yourself a pair to eat forced me to
re-evaluate my entire life in fact so
that's the kind of pressure I'm gonna
apply to this new company that says they
got it right what are they called cask
full Wireless full freedom 13 hours ante
fall rain proof look at these people on
the front I'm here to let you know if
something is good or if something sucks
let's jump inside the box and find out
look at this guy look at those little
guys tiny little things these things Oh
change the style it's all about your
tech lifestyle
some kind of some kind of some kind of
cool-looking charge case extra ear tips
depending on the size of your ear canal
very important to get a good seal how
does this little chart fold it's a
little home for your guys here you know
one goes there right
yeah and they're charging and this comes
out and that goes to obviously a USB
connection so it's easy to travel with
right all right guys it's time for the
moment of truth because the pairing
Fiasco begins press and hold the play
button on both earphones for six seconds
to turn them on all right here we go one
two three four five yeah there's a
little tiny it's a faint light but you
can see it there flashing blue and red
let me see if I can pick it up on my
phone yes got it okay
access to Bluetooth is that it is there
no weird pairing between each one if
that's true we might be on to something
here folks
if we are in business right now this
could be our entrance into the fully
wireless promised land they're not loud
I think they're maxed out the phone is
maxed out and these guys I mean I have
the plus button could it be that track
maybe let me try something else I mean
it's about freedom there's no wires
lifting weights
I'm shadowboxing I'm on the electric
skateboard
sibel freedom
who doesn't like freedom pros of course
these things are super easy to set up I
held the button they paired right away
sound quality eh I'm not jumping out of
my socks so to speak I don't know what
it is I feel like I want a little bit
more volume at least it's about
convenience as much as it's about sound
quality if you're looking for sound
quality I think for now go with
something wired if you need the ultimate
freedom if you're trying to do the body
pump if you're trying to benchpress 3000
pounds this might be the way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
