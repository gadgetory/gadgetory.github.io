therapy and today we're taking a look at
the zoom h1 handy recorder this is a
stereo recorder which also has a
microphone input if you want to use an
external mic with it it's become very
popular for youtubers and filmmakers
alike especially people who shoot with
digital SLRs that have terrible audio on
the top of them
it's powered by a double-a battery and
it's really portable really light you
could stick it in your pocket hook a lav
mic up to it and it would be a much
cheaper solution than a wireless lav
system now the device is mostly made out
of plastic but it's cheap so you can
understand why it will be made out of
plastic it's only about a hundred bucks
you got a line out for monitoring your
audio via headphones and a volume rocker
up at the top side of the left-hand side
below that you've got a micro SDHC slot
this comes preloaded with a 2 gigabyte
card on the other side of the unit we've
got a USB port a power and hold switch a
trash button we've got our play pause
fast-forward rewind an input level
rocker and a line in as I said before
you can use this to use an external mic
if you prefer the quality or attributes
of that particular mic on the top of the
unit we have the stereo mics these ones
are in an XY pattern below that we have
our LCD screen with some basic
information and a record button very
simple not too many buttons on the front
side on the back of the unit we have a
tripod mount for mounting a device you
can also mount it on a hot shoe with an
adapter a low-cut filter auto level and
a record format switch now we've got a
little bit of documentation included
which is to be expected and here's a
look at that micro sd I was talking
about comes with an adapter which is
always welcome we also get an SD card
usage precautions sheet so apparently
you do not want to bend or drop this SD
card I have never received a sheet like
that before
there is also an accessory kit that you
can buy for your zoom h1 it comes with a
tripod along with a wall power adapter a
microphone adapter to put it in a
microphone mount as well as a little
windscreen for it and a carrying case
anyway guys this has been the unboxing
I'll let you know how it sounds in a
later video if you haven't liked us on
Facebook yet go ahead and do so and also

giveaway coming up to celebrate 10,000
