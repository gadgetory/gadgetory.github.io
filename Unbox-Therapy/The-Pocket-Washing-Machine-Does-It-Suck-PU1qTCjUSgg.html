you well it's gonna get it but it
arrived just like this this is what it
looks like in this little bag what
exactly is that I did a little bit more
research and I found out that it's part
of an IndieGoGo campaign right now and
this little guy is your very own washing
machine that fits in your pocket the
pocket washing machine this thing is
supposed to travel with you clean your
clothes all you need is a bucket of
water or in in there IndieGoGo video
they're just using the sink this and a
little bit of soap and apparently your
washing away your sorrows they got a few
different things here there's some
mustard some ketchup and then I've got
some soap now in their IndieGoGo
campaign they sell their very own soap
but I'm gonna go ahead and use tide
because that's what I have available to
me now the idea here we've got a USB
cable and it plugs into a power source
and you dip this guy into the water
along with your clothing that you're
attempting to wash and supposedly
this thing rattles and somehow cleans
your clothes after about 20 minutes I
don't know I'm very skeptical very very
skeptical to be honest we're gonna find
out this little pocket washer is any
good so let's go ahead and stain a
t-shirt real quick so you see I got some
classic Hanes t-shirts over here white
as well which as you know is the most
unforgiving t-shirt color get a little
bit of mustard a little bit of ketchup
on there I guess you could get this on a
white shirt mean I don't know who wears
a plain white shirt but it's possible oh
it's already oh my goodness okay this
could be this could be trouble we're
about to find out some mustard there I'm
gonna shake this third you know what's
the worst with the ketchup when if you
don't do the shake and then you get the
weird almost ketchup juice that comes
out of there oh that's a lot okay well
obviously you're not gonna do this
unless you're some kind of barbarian I
don't know do we rub it in a little bit
Oh
let's see whoa that's no good that's not
gonna be good okay oh that's alright oh
okay getting soapy in here alright so I
put a little bit of liquid soap in here
I think the powder or the little tablets
probably work better I'm gonna drop it
in and maybe I just put a little more
soap just for good measure you got your
shirt in here you got the unit in there
oh I don't know if you guys can pick
that up what it's doing but it's like
some kind of micro vibrations there's
little tiny bubbles shooting out of this
unit it's vibrating really rapidly from
what I read online this now will be in
here for about 20 minutes I don't think
you're supposed to swish I think it's
supposed to do the job I mean if I look
really closely you can see movement like
little micro movements in the water all
over the place
emergency situation you need that
special shirt you messed it up throw it
in the sink along with this thing a
little bit of soap and magic
it's doing something
you
you
and I feel about all this well I don't
know what's there is whatever you left
there I don't know shall the various
shelves and the place I'm not sure that
we were fair to attract I just don't
know that we were fair how long
I gotta say this this shirt still looks
pretty horrendous to be fair I don't
think the real intent here is to deal
with a shirt that's been abused in such
a way just like a lot of things here on
unbox therapy we go to the extreme and
so I threw everything at it including my
makeshift kitchen sink don't want it to
everything but uh this is gonna be the
like freshen up a shirt or something
that you you know you need to wear while
you're traveling you didn't bring enough
clothes unexpectedly this thing's always
in your bag so I mean that smells like a
clean shirt so to speak and then you
just hang it up to dry I don't think I
could go so far as to say that it sucks
it is not a replacement for your
washer/dryer combo the full-size thing
all right I mean there's just not as
much movement happening this thing is is
it's like a it's like a vibrator for a
bucket you know if you think it's useful
in some way to you so long as you don't
want to drench yourself in ketchup and
mustard I'll have a link to it down in
the description but me personally I'm
gonna stick to the big boy units</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
