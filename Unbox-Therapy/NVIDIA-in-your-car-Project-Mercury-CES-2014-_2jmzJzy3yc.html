brought to you by Squarespace so this is
a demonstration of a project that we
call mercury right and mercury is
essentially a a graphic material
rendering system using a tool that we
call UI composer and it's running on
three K one devices here so we have a k1
tablet running Android with a UI
composer application that's allowing us
to take a three-dimensional geometry and
in this case it's a gauge for a vehicle
and apply different colors and types of
physically accurate materials on the
surface of that 3d geometry so what
we're doing in essence is basically
recreating the physicality of real
mechanical gauges for your vehicle and
the coolest part about it is that we're
giving you the ability through this
interface as the user of your vehicle to
customize the look and feel of what you
want that vehicle to be look at movies
we can actually rotate this gauge in in
3d space here we can have a look at the
the different materials that actually
comprise the gauge and then we can come
up here and we can make a selection and
then toggle to various different types
of materials and three
totally different looks and feels some
of which are really dramatic depending
upon what material we get to what's
really neat about these physical
accurate materials is that not only can
we create a material that actually has
reflection and refraction but we can
also give it texture so a metal a metal
surface like aluminum can now become
even bumpy aluminum as though it's like
a hammered aluminum type of finish and
again this is powered by a Tegra k1
processor right behind this display it's
1920 by 720 resolution so very very high
resolution very nice beautiful display
within the vehicle cool and this other
display over here is controlling
something different yeah so the other
the other thing that we're also showing
is the idea of having reconfigurable
options for an in vehicle importing
insistant so this is another display
that's powered by also a k1 processor
and we have three different sort of
vignettes if you will here we've got a
navigation scene we've got a multimedia
browser and we have our vehicle controls
for climate this is a 15.6 inch
capacitive touchscreen
in resolution so a nice high resolution
panel it's fully interactive so if I tap
on here we can then you know pick up
album art and you can just see like the
the power they keep on processor just
about how fast and we can flip around
remark yeah and on top of that you know
while that's all going on you're still
rendering this really really beautiful
3d navigation see it's not only 3d in
terms of the buildings then we're also
getting all this really really cool
lighting effect that's happening as well
so we're getting cast shadows off of the
3d geometries we're getting ambient
occlusion this project and the reason
why we call it a project is that it
becomes a reference design for our
automotive here.one partners so it kind
of gives both the design example and a
starting point for a lot of work that
might be done in automotive very cool
yeah I think most people agree that
there needs to be just some disruption
there a lot of the laggy systems that
currently exist are no fun to use this
this looks a lot more smooth well thank
you yeah we're really excited about you
know bringing this this level of
performance and capability to the
vehicle and for us at Nvidia I mean we
really look at the vehicle is probably
one of the largest and arguably maybe
one of the most expensive mobile
computers you'll ever own right it's
cool alright well thanks thanks so much
you have a good one I want to give a big
shout out to our official sponsor making
this coverage possible that is
Squarespace they are an amazing service
where you can go over and build your
very own sophisticated and
professional-looking website without any
kind of previous experience in web
development head over to Squarespace
right now all the information is down in
the description I built my website using
Squarespace and I have been a customer
for a very long time so I am incredibly
happy to have them on board as our
official sponsor for CES 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
