battery game the battery backup game is
everything from little tiny card like
battery banks that can fit in your
wallet there's disposable battery banks
out there and there are really large
ones which give you enormous capacity
and of course there's an expanding
variety of gadgets that we hope to
charge up using battery banks and what I
have today might be the ultimate in
battery banks Omni charge I think they
started out on Kickstarter now it's an
actual product you can get on Amazon
these guys have thought of everything
you could possibly want inside of a
backup battery so they have a big guy
and a little guy they've just tried to
pack everything in here known to man
it's got an ac/dc outlet
Qualcomm quick charge was going to
charge up your quick charge capable
devices it's got a direct DC out port
now this is interesting because you can
actually charge laptops PC laptops with
the right cable from this thing it's
also got wireless charging on the top of
it flow-through charging solar ready oh
my goodness got an OLED screen on it
20,000 milliamp hours inside of it this
is not cheap just understand there are
reasons for because of all the features
that are packed in here it's hard to
compare it to the other stuff that's out
there so here is the unit a rubberized
feel - it feels rugged it will switch
between the DC and AC couple of USB
ports and then on this side this is
where things get a little bit unusual a
full-size power port okay now look at
all the adapters they've included in
here USB - what is this this is DC
correct DC - DC oh they have included a
bunch of tips some headphones rarely
will use these type of tips oh and they
even went a step further look at this
that's for you jack that's a MagSafe
you're charging your laptop so now you
can pull straight off of this brick
without the need for the giant Apple
power brick as well they've even
included you know this one Jack for the
Microsoft Surface it's nice to have to
display as well you can see it tells you
how much battery you have it's at 11%
right now how much power is currently
being consumed 10
sure that's kind of nice this might be
the ultimate battery right there
this one has wireless charging on the
top of it right here so you could drop a
device that has Qi compatibility on here
I hate that there aren't more phones
with wireless charging this smaller
little guy here which is less expensive
you don't have the wireless charging on
this one if that matters to you same
finish on the outside this rugged
rubberized kind of feel to it you're
still getting a full-size power port on
this one you still get this nice display
the 2 5 volt outputs you could easily
travel with both this one could probably
fit in a pocket whereas this one you're
really stretching it let me see
sometimes when you're out and about and
you've got like a camera you're using or
something or you want to keep using your
phone and it's wired into your battery
bank you stick it in the back pocket
like this and in this unit you're
getting a lot less in the way of
universal cables this cable is if you
want to charge this off of USB so now
you can see that it's charging at its
max speed and you can actually see the
entire power input there somewhere
between 31 and 33 watts so that means
it's about an hour and a half to get
yourself 13,000 milliamp hours of juice
I've seen so many battery banks come
through here and whether or not they end
up getting utilized on a regular basis
has a lot to do with the slow speed by
which they actually charge themselves up
this guy's taken 45 watts of juice on
the input the estimate in this case is
around an hour 45 minutes so if you're
hoping to be charging up a laptop or
multiple devices on a regular basis you
might want to go for the extra juice and
the slightly faster rapid charging plus
the wireless charging but if portability
is the key then you might want to go for
this little guy right here which could
be considered pocketable if you've got a
decent sized pocket but there you have
it the omni charge not the most
affordable battery bank on the market
but definitely one of the most versatile
I think we're gonna put them into use
around the office definitely juice for
days doing it like as if there was a
t-shirt
why would you probably wouldn't want
that on t-shirt you know what people
have done in the past when I've done
battery related videos there's been a
counter like a ticker in the comments
section of how many times I said juice
this video right here might be the least
number of juice comments once you get
the juice drink the juice you got the
gadgets are taking the juice from you
you got to get them juiced up now I'm
blowing it out of the park give me the
juice counter</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
