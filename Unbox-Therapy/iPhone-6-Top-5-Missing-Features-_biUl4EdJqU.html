another video and today we're going to
be talking about the top 5 missing
features on the new iPhone 6 it's been
getting a lot of hype a lot of praise
but I'm going to talk about things that
aren't in the iPhone 6 that I wish were
but before we get into it I want to give
a shout out to Sony for sponsoring this
video more specifically the Sony action
cam if you're unfamiliar with it it's an
absolute beast shoots up to 240 FPS
super wide angle lens has image
stabilization you can really create some
amazing stuff with this tiny little
action camera head over to the link in
the description to learn more as well as
check out some samples of things that
people are shooting with the action cam
including one really cool clip that I
just finished watching featuring Tony
Hawk alright so let's go ahead and get
started with the top 5 missing features
on the iPhone 6 this also applies to the
6 plus I'm leaving no stone unturned
here to get it started let's go with
water resistance at this point there are
an incredible number of phones that
feature ip67 certification and who can
really argue with some extra durability
and water resistance no one it's just a
tougher more rugged phone and I know a
lot of people that would love to see
that certification in the new iPhone up
next we're going to talk about standards
or the lack thereof in the new iPhone
and the previous generation for that
matter and the one before that that's
proprietary connectors this one like all
the rest of them has its own connector
specific to Apple the Lightning port
which in my opinion is inferior to going
along with the standard even though you
can insert your cable either way and
from that standpoint it's a little bit
more sophisticated not fitting in with
the guidelines of the rest of the phone
marketplace the Weisse marketplace
tablet market place etc means that you
have to have these independent chargers
independent connection cables
independent docks etc and I'm just a big
fan of having standards especially for
somebody who owns so many different
devices big fan of microUSB right here
now this one is a little bit surprising
some of you may not know that the iPhone
6 and 6-plus doesn't have a fantastic
forward facing camera at least in terms
of resolution you're looking at a 1.3
megapixel camera jiz very low in the
spec Department when compared to some
other devices on the market for example
the upcoming Note 4 has a 3.7 megapixel
front facing camera capable of 1080p
video the LG g3 has a 2.1 megapixel
camera and the HTC One m8 has a 5
megapixel shooter on the front so kind
of unusual here you would expect that
Apple would want to occupy a spot in the
selfie universe with a high quality
forward facing cam but to my surprise to
your surprise they're actually lagging
behind in this department now granted
the megapixel count is not the only
thing that matters when it comes to
photography forward facing photography
selfie photography but 1.2 megapixels
that sounds pretty old-school next up we
have something that's been covered in
detail but it's impossible to leave it
off of a list like this and that is of
course the resolution of the new screens
that are being used in the iPhone 6 and
6-plus now they are fantastic screens
don't get me wrong there IPS displays
awesome to look at great color
representation very bright indoors and
outdoors but they have low resolution
compared to some of the Android
competitors the iPhone 6 standard model
has a resolution close to 720p the
larger plus-size iPhone is sitting at
1080p but devices like the upcoming Note
4 are going to have q HD 2560 by 1440
and the LG g3 already has that
resolution with an even smaller screen
so in 5.5 inches the same 5.5 inches
that the iPhone 6 plus occupies the LG
g3 has significantly more pixels for a
much higher PPI
so the last feature that I really wish
existed in both of these new iPhones is
wireless charging now this
might not matter to you you may have
never experienced it before but once you
get used to charging something
wirelessly it is very difficult to go
back it's the main reason that the Nexus
5 is still one of my go-to devices even
though it's been on the market for so
long when you have a nice little
charging pad set up beside your bed or
desk or around your house etc it is just
so easy to drop your phone on there and
not even think about the fact that
you're charging I'm one of these these
people that really hates charging
devices I think that's where our devices
let us down now granted there is no
perfect device that doesn't need to be
charged yet pretty much everything on
the market needs to be charged every day
or every other day so making that
process a little bit easier really does
go a long way it's something you end up
doing all the time so wireless charging
is one of my favorite features on phones
and unfortunately these two new iPhones
do not feature it maybe next time
alright guys that wraps up this top five
list of things that I wish were in the
new iPhones but aren't let me know in
the comments which features do you wish
were there and of this list which is the
most important feature to you that the
iPhone 6 is lacking thanks as always for
watching guys if you enjoyed this
content please remember to leave a
thumbs up down below and I will catch
you very shortly on the next episode
