headphones here on unbox therapy what do
I mean by I do I do that I don't do the
headphones a lot of headphones show up I
make a lot of videos about headphones
and this is something that I haven't
seen before these are design your own
headphones street art edition so they've
included some kind of like spray paint
some markers you walk around it like hey
hey who does those headphones like I did
those headphone isn't it eclectic so
it's from a company called seedling
design your own virtually I use a maze
app design your own marble maze I mean I
don't know how that ties in Oh a DIY
virtual reality viewer this is for
somebody who wants to get a little bit
crafty wants to be unique let's go ahead
jump inside here and see what I can see
what I can do got the headphones kind of
remind me of some Sony's I'm familiar
with so they're white for good reason
markers red orange green yellow and a
couple of spray paints as well now
that's cool what they did it's like a
pump spray cuz you can't put an aerosol
can in here you know what's up with
these this feels like a sticker material
well you cut out your own sticker
yeah that's stick cut out some shapes
stick that on there somewhere I don't
really know it's the beauty of it's up
to you all right fine I mean you could
do like a wu-tang that's why I asked you
one tang fo DIY Wu Tang headphones the
headline I just found a headline live in
front of all of you I'm doing Wu Tang
headphones if it helps sketch your ideas
on a piece of scratch paper before you
start you'll create reverse stencils to
use with your spray paint cut shapes out
of the adhesive paper in your kit and
peel the backing off look at us we're
like we're graffiti artists instantly
this is kind of the Wu Tang yellow but
I'm worried about the way the yellow
shows up against the white maybe we
should do the Wu Tang not in yellow
maybe it should be in red a red spray
spray it on there cover the whole thing
with the stencil in the middle and spray
the Wu Tang W right on each ear Cup okay
I got an idea I got an idea I got an
idea get a wu-tang logo on my phone and
trace it what do you think I probably
would show up better if there's less
light here yeah so I just kind of trace
it then transfer to the sticky paper and
I'm going to do the negative space so
color in the perimeter
so that the wu-tang logo is the white no
I'm saying look I'm getting artistic
over you right give you a break
ha ha ha that'll do the trick
okay so I do have the little precise
scissors somewhere on here world's most
giant Swiss Army knife I did a video on
this you should go check it out actually
now of course you could do this with
anything that gets you motivated I mean
you all saw how motivated I got when I
got the Wu Tang idea but it's completely
up to you whoa that's not bad
look at my little wu-tang W right there
that's really not bad ok cool next thing
to do is get it on the sticky paper to
make my stencil if only I could have
seen through this and then okay cool
where do I cut that out who would have
thought it's DIY with Lou I never
thought this day would come feel like a
kid right now
ha ha ha ok sweet
why is it so much fun this is more fun
than it alright alright you shake
it up I don't know about to find out oh
look at that splatter
are we gonna have to keep this off the
table jack
we're gonna have to leave that for a
while all right so I got crazy with the
paint as you can tell probably not what
you're gonna do maybe you'll get the
masking tape out and be a little more
precise but who cares we're going
graffiti style Tang is like a religion
jack a bomb atomically Socrates
philosophies and hypotheses can't define
how I'd be dropping these mockeries
lyrically performed on robberies flee
with the lottery possibly he spotted me
that's what I'm talking about I left it
to dry now I gotta try and peel that
wu-tang logo out of there you only live
once as the kids say
yeah listen all right there's a reason
this show is not called art class with
Lou right the spray cans that are
included my feeling on that is it's kind
of more of a distance deal you know
where you get this kind of spatter let
me just get some marker going a little
bit just see what happened here yeah I
mean like it's probably a terrible idea
oh dear god what have I done did you
really expect anything less from me
though let's be honest here and there's
kids out there in the audience you're
one of them that could have done a
better job for sure I want you to do a
much better job than this and send me a
picture this looks so much worse with
the green now you know let's disgust it
you know what I realize having listened
to these yet I mean the headphone they
don't sound that bad they work you know
what else Jack look at this you can pull
the ear cups up the off paint wise that
would have been nice
you know what Wu Tang I apologize
sincerely for this if you want to hit me
up we do a collab hire some
professionals and make the real Wu Tang
headphone as the world turns I spread
like germs bless the globe with the
pestilence
cuz the hard-headed never learned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
