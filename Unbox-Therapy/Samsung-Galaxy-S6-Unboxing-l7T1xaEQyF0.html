another video and today I have a long
anticipated unboxing for you this is the
samsung galaxy s6 and it's the beginning
of a few unboxings in the smartphone
space because i've also got the s6 edge
coming up and the HTC One m9 but today
it's all about the plain-jane
s6 which as you know from my previous
speculation video it's changed quite a
bit from the previous gen as5 so let's
go ahead look at the box then jump
inside and take a closer look at the
hardware on the back of the box you can
see this device features 4G LTE the
octa-core processor 5.1 inch quad HD
display 16 megapixel back facing camera
with image stabilization and a 5
megapixel forward facing camera which is
actually pretty decent boss got wireless
charging one of the most underrated
smartphone features in the world I'm a
huge fan of wireless charging so let's
go ahead and crack this bad boy open and
check out the device in all of its glory
so there you have it so there's the
front of the device as you can tell
pretty familiar if you're used to the
previous generation the front looks
pretty much the same but the materials
have been almost completely changed here
you're now dealing with glass and metal
in almost every touchable portion of the
phone that's right I said touchable
around the edge here is where you'll see
the metallic band and then on the back
you're greeted with glass one more time
so glass on the back and glass on the
front if you're a little bit concerned
with the durability of the glass on the
back of the device that can be easily
fixed using something like a skin or a
case I use skins from a company called D
brand here's what the s6 looks like
wearing a leather like texture from the
brand scans if you want to check them
out I'll drop a link down in the
description they have all kinds of
customization options so maybe it's not
even about protection for you maybe it's
about having a unique looking device
you'll also see the camera in this
section here once again 16 megapixel
with image stabilization you have your
flash just beside it and on
front of the device you'll find a
speaker of course you'll also have your
forward facing five megapixel camera a
couple of sensors capacitive buttons and
a physical button which feels pretty
clicky pretty nice actually I think
that's a step up actually from the s5
very satisfying on the side of the
device here you'll find your SIM card
tray as well as your lock switch hold
switch power switch whatever you want to
call it it's in a very nice location
here it lines up very well with my thumb
on the other side of the device you have
your volume buttons down and up big
props to Samsung here on building what
at this point looks like some quality
hardware that said this new quality
hardware comes at an expense when you're
using these materials that usually means
that you do not have a removable back so
therefore you're giving up your SD card
expansion as well as a removable battery
that the previous generation featured
but I think they're going to probably
impress a number of people that are into
the materials and into the design on the
bottom of the device you'll find your
headphone jack as well as a micro USB
port for charging and then of course
your speaker and a microphone on the top
you actually have something surprising
an IR blaster so you can control various
devices and use the s6 as a remote
control now let's go ahead and put the
s6 down for a moment and check out the
other items in the box first we have
some paperwork that's boring you don't
need to see it a little tool for your
SIM card so here is the adaptive fast
charging brick which you may have heard
of Samsung claims that this little brick
will be able to charge up your phone for
four hours of use in just 10 minutes of
charge time that seems pretty damn
ambitious I'm going to test that out and
see if that's true but if it is that's a
great little feature you've also got a
headset included thank goodness they are
still including headsets you have an
inline microphone / remote there are
little ear tips too on each of the
headphones plus some extras they've
included I think these are probably a
different size Wow you know what not a
bad fit you've also got a you
the microUSB cable that will plug in to
that very fancy charging brick that I
mentioned before and that's pretty much
it in the box so let's go ahead and boot
up the device and see what that screen
looks like so here we go let's boot it
up whoo now this is going to be pretty
hard for you to see in this video but
the display is beautiful I set up the
fingerprint sensor and my goodness is
this heavily improved over the previous
generation with the swipe in this
particular case we have something that's
a lot more similar to the iOS version of
fingerprint scanning or check this out
boom boom boom so that wraps up this
unboxing video my impressions here are
yes Samsung has definitely gone upmarket
with the materials I think for many many
users this is going to be an impressive
package that said there will be some
power users that are still upset that
they've lost some features like the
removable battery expandable storage and
some of the durability that came from
the previous construction my immediate
feedback is that this is a pretty
premium feeling device a fingerprint
sensor is much improved the display is
beautiful and I'm a big fan of the form
factor plus wireless charging if you
guys are interested in pricing and
availability on this device I'll drop a
link down in the description thanks as
always for watching and I'll catch you
on the next episode later guys</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
