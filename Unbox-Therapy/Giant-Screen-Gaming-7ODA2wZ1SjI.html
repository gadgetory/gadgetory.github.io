another video and as you can tell I'm in
an unusual location out here in the main
area of the new unbox therapy
headquarters where we have a gigantic
135 inch projection screen but this
video is actually about what's running
it and what we use it for up there on
the ceiling is the new Epson home cinema
3500 projector which is a bright
affordable 1080p solution that does both
2d and 3d and Epson sent it out and said
hey dude take a closer look
hook up your setup and see if you like
it so that's what we've been doing and
what we're gonna go a little more
in-depth on today and in this
installation I've actually gone ahead
and installed a motorized screen which
falls right in front of a flat panel
television now obviously like most
projectors this is gonna work better at
night or in the dark
that being said with 2500 lumens you can
actually get a fairly usable image and
pleasing image even with some ambient
lighting on so this is my first time
installing a projector and this one made
it pretty easy because it is equipped
with both horizontal and vertical lens
shift so even if you don't get it
straight on with the screen you still
have quite a bit of play to make sure
that your image lines up correctly it
also has built-in speakers which are
surprisingly decent obviously if you can
go with external sound you're going to
get an extra level of immersion so the
home cinema 3500 has plenty of different
interface options including the latest
connectivity that you'd expect there are
two HDMI with MHL compatibility so you
can hook up game consoles receivers
anything that takes HDMI you guys know
about HDMI I don't need to teach you
about HDMI
now some people are a little bit
concerned about
getting a projector for themselves
because they've heard rumors that you're
constantly changing bulbs lamps and it's
costing you money especially if you use
them consistently but there has been
major progress made in the efficiency of
these units this one for example can do
3,500 hours on regular standard mode or
up to 5,000 on Eco mode it also has a
number of other saving techniques so
probably the coolest thing about having
135 inches is the impact when people
come over they check it out they watch a
movie they watch some sports I put a UFC
fight up there the immersion is intense
even sort of beyond resolution just
having that lifelike size is incredibly
engaging you add the sound to it if you
can put a basic 5.1 set up with a
subwoofer it's really like no other
experience I've had plenty of large flat
panel displays that have a hard time
really replicating what this thing is
capable of in a much more affordable
package granted you will need the space
to install it and as mentioned earlier
it's going to perform better in dim
environments if you are in the market
for one of these projectors what you can
do is measure your space and figure out
how big of a display you'll be capable
of having because you do need some
distance from the projector to the
screen in order to get these really
large sizes you could go even bigger you
could go up to 150 one more thing to
remember the bigger you go the bigger
each individual pixel is so you're
probably going to want to sit a little
bit further back but at this range right
here it's kind of a sweet spot
especially when you're sitting right in
front of it with the proper
five-point-one the satellite speakers
it's just a really special experience
you're all invited for the next Super
Bowl alright guys so that wraps up this
video thanks as always for watching and
thanks to epson as well for letting me
check out this home cinema 3500 if
you're interested in pricing and
availability on that unit I'll drop a
link down in the description if you
enjoyed this content make sure to leave
a thumbs

later guys</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
