very excited in front of me right now I
have ten products it's a constant supply
of products over here there are so many
cool things that sometimes you just
gotta sit down and spread out the cool
so today I have ten cheap gadgets that
you can buy right now and you'll
probably want to each one of these
gadgets is listed down below in the
description section they're probably
gonna sell real quick where should I
start all right so first up we have
something called the moon dock 100's 19
bucks for 20 bucks what kind of wireless
portable speaker can you really get if
you look at the side here you'll see you
can dock your phone prop your phone up
watch something have better sound I
think that's the idea there you can see
it with a phone mounted up Bluetooth
compatible unique patented design with
three color options ten hours of play
time wirelessly and it also has a USB
port which plays in charges at the same
time let's check it out let's see how
good it is
remember it's $19.99 looking for value
oh my it's quite the design look at that
and it looks like capacitive touch
buttons it is an auxilary cable you
could plug in a traditional audio source
if you choose to or just not use
bluetooth and use this with your phone
so let me pull out my phone let's see of
course I do now you see it's flashing
there bluetooth where you at
very nice Oh
all right how about ghost notes with the
beats right there unbelievable
knock it up
the one on the left Aki Wireless arts
secure fit earbuds wireless blue now if
you admit if you missed that video you
should definitely check it out those are
$10 wireless earbuds two different pairs
that were compared this thing I mean I'm
kind of into it the sound on this will
crush your phone speaker obviously if
you like to listen to podcasts before
you go to sleep certainly when it comes
to the low enemy it's crushing whatever
your phone to do $19.99 that is a cool
cheap gadget look at this little package
right here okay you probably noticed
this on my phone inexpensive it's 15 or
16 bucks comes in a number of colors
it's a wallet case for the Galaxy S a so
it's got a couple of card slots on the
back you hardly notice the two cards
sitting on the back this allows you to
leave your wallet at home
I only need a couple cards so I'll put
it in here and have one less thing of
course you've still got your cutouts I
feel like this thing gives me maybe even
better grip they do it in a black as
well that's a cool little thing I think
they make it for a couple of different
devices fifteen or sixteen bucks
this guy here it's a car charger right
this is different okay so not only is it
rapid charging and not only can you see
there's a ton of ports here too on this
unit and then three more on the other
this is about backseat charging this is
the road trip extraordinaire a 5 foot
charging cable five passengers in the
vehicle
everybody's charging all the tech
addicted individual you see how I that
are going on the road trip they're
connected the whole way check out the
quality here whoo
soft touch plastic to it and you can see
this is the clip they were talking about
this part slides in and all of a sudden
now it's three USB ports for your
backseat that's why it's five feet long
it can reach everybody in the vehicle
look at that five total ports 24 bucks
that's a cool solution
this little guy right here the magnetic
organization system otherwise known as
mos this is a magnetic organizer this is
a thing that sits on your desk and keeps
your cables where you want them wherever
you want to set this thing up you can
even mount it on a wall as it says here
and it can help you keep track of cables
keys and other metal knickknacks three
magnetic cable ties inside so you can
you can turn cables that wouldn't
otherwise stick to it into stickable
cables this thing is 11 bucks I believe
it's got a sticky surface so it doesn't
move around when you stick it down
almost like a little design piece there
you hardly notice it these themselves
this will clip around your favorite
cables that you want to keep in one
place and then whoa did you see that how
cool are magnets by the way that cables
going nowhere like this look at that but
when you want to use it you just peel it
off charge up your device and then
kaboom it stays where you want it to
stay I mean you can turn any cable into
a magnetic sticky cable that's $11 I
think you guys are gonna like this one
so next up we have these guys here I've
always wanted to try them the new USB
world and the double-a world there's
still plenty of gadgets to take double-a
batteries but then it's like what are
you tossing them out after eating this
it feels kind of strange we want to
charge them back up so what about a
double-a battery that charges itself
this one's called USB cell and then this
one is a lighters battery the price
points are around 20 bucks 15 20 bucks
kind of wild you see the battery cell
here the full-size USB on this end
it's got like an elastic on it and it
pulls up over top of the port and then
back down and that's the finished
product right there and then you peel it
back like that and you just charge it up
and that'll go into any USB port now
this one also has an indicator on it so
if the light is on you know it's
charging these ones are a slightly
different take a microUSB port right on
the battery right there to this port
right here now you're charging your
double a battery a couple different
takes if you have to keep using them
rechargeable why not
we got this guy here the hybrid light
hybrid solar flashlights you probably
have a flashlight in your life but
chances are it's like an old-fashioned
flashlight that requires those batteries
that I mentioned before so who knows
does it have juice the ever-important
juice what you have here is a flashlight
that charges over solar and this thing
actually goes a step further the juice
that this accumulates can then charge up
a secondary device as well so it'll
charge your mobile devices with a USB
port on the bottom 12 hours of light on
a single charge it'll hold a charge for
years and it's waterproof and it floats
so this guy is about 28 bucks
feels pretty durable nice bright color
so if you're outdoors or whatever you
drop it you're gonna see it from a
distance it's got that like highlighter
yellow on it
solar panel on the top and where's this
USB port they're talking about oh whoa
the USB port is in the bottom here and
there's a gasket on here
that's where the water resistance comes
from yes of course it has juice setting
one setting - what do you think jack dim
setting whoa everybody should have one
of these this should be in your house
what are you doing with that old
fashioned flashlight that you bought at
Walmart and it's taking batteries and
the batteries are never good you know
that hybrid light bright thinking oh my
goodness we've got this guy here we have
a cable from vision tech but what makes
it smart it's not just that it has rapid
charging but it also has an LED on it to
let you know when your device is either
charging or fully charged so from a
distance you can essentially know if it
if it has juice if it has a charge or
not so this is a pretty heavy-duty cable
to begin with you're one of those people
you like to charge up and lie back in
your bed all right so we have the other
end plugged in and of course here is our
iPhone custom unbox therapy iPhone by
the way he didn't see the video on this
you're missing out and look at that you
see that Jack the red light there
glowing oh so you see this pulsating red
there which even in a dimly lit room
will let you know that your device is
actively charging and then that'll
switch to a solid green when it's fully
charged this just gives you a little bit
more info at
Lance maybe you just don't want to pick
up your phone until it's fully charged
you can see from a distance it's just
cooler it's just cooler than your
current cable bottom line I love this
thing I just think this thing is so cool
it's called the Gerber GBC money clip
this is a money clip which hides a
little pocket knife right in it it's
around 25 bucks in a pinch you need a
blade it's inside the money clip there
we go so this is the money clip you have
a metal clip on this end here you can
slide cards or cash underneath there and
then on the other side you have this
spring-loaded area at-a-glance doesn't
look special at all get a little grip on
there you never know when you might need
a blade just slide right in look at that
and it looks like a design element when
it's all together like that so your
money cash cards slid on the clip side
on the flip side clip side flip side you
push down this little button allows you
to remove now it's not gonna come out by
accident in your pocket because this
safety mechanism up here that's cool I
don't care who you are that's cool the
GDC money clip it's like 25 bucks
you gotta check this out by our very
last item the hideaway collapsible
bottle I've wanted to try one of these

be healthy Lou you gotta be drinking
water all the time look he's got the
water bottle right now what do you got

pocket-sized look at this thing reusable
watertight dishwasher safe try me out

whole thing apparently you grip on the
bottom and look at that Oh
21 ounces of liquid you screw this baby
on like this and it has a little cutout
here so you could clip it to something
if you want to and then a mouthpiece
that lifts up kinda like a sippy cup for
a kid it's your very own adult sippy cup
and
