bonus video for you today two-for-one
this is a tip a hack you might want to
call it for how to play YouTube in the
background on your smartphone so you can
go about your other business you know
messaging people browsing the web and so
on now why would you want a video in the
background doesn't make much sense Luke
the main reason here is for music plenty
of people use YouTube for the music
discovery for their playlists and so on
but also long-form spoken word content
podcasts you might want to have that on
in the background and the YouTube app
does not allow you to do that natively
but there is a workaround now this has
been out for a little while but if
you're like me maybe you missed it maybe
you hadn't seen it before so I thought I
was just gonna bring it to you let's get
started on iOS and then jump into
Android because they're different
workarounds for each platform now if I'm
just playing some audio hopefully you
guys can hear that now if I'm gonna
click out of that that audio is just
gonna stop right that's in the app okay
Lou yes I get it you close the app and
the song stops playing what's the deal
here alright real simple launch into
Safari go to youtube.com in the URL
section there search up the song you
want to play start playing it again okay
same song in this case no problem here
but what happens when you back out now
oh but it still stops okay here's the
trick lift up from the bottom you'll see
it still shows the media right there now
hit the play button again oh look at me
I'm in my phone doing whatever I want
while still listening to my music get it
okay recap you don't want to use the
YouTube app load up the mobile YouTube
site play the song back out of it and
then just hit play again down here in
your quick options don't want to leave
the Android users out same scenario here
if you go to the YouTube app you play
this song beautiful it's playing
but you back out and you're dead the
song stops so what do we do here
download Firefox real simple this is a
browser if you're unaware it's free in
the App Store go to the mobile site play
the song back out money in the bank the
inventory of music available on YouTube
and the playlists and everything that
you can do that it's very powerful so
being able to make that happen in the
background so you can still do your
other activities is a pretty compelling
feature in my opinion I wish it was
built in by default but it's not so
that's how you get it done
iOS iPhone and Android tell your friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
