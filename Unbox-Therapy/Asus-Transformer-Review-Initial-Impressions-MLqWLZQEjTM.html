therapy and I finally got a chance to
sit down and put together a little
review on the Asus Transformer that I
just picked up if you guys haven't
checked out the unboxing video
definitely do so I'll put a link up in
the annotations and also down in the
description I cover a few things like
the different ports available on the
unit and you also get some nice
close-ups so definitely check it out but
let's move on to the review and my first
impressions having used a device for a
couple of days now and believe it or not
I'm actually really impressed I actually
really enjoy using the device the thing
about these kinds of devices is that
they're really consumption based devices
the main focus here is sitting down and
consuming your content and this device
here is really one of the first that
says hey you could do a little bit of
production honey as well but it also
gives you the ability to consume content
in a couple of different form factors
sometimes I'm sitting down on a couch in
a certain position and I've been holding
up the tablet for a while and I'm really
wishing that I just had a little stand
or something for it now this Asus
Transformer is gonna give you not only a
stand but also all the extra
functionality built in to this keyboard
portion now I want to mention you can
buy the Asus Transformer just the tablet
portion of it without the keyboard dock
but I don't think you're really making
the best use out of the built-in
functionality that Asus put in there
when you do that especially considering
price wise like I picked this combo up
for $4.99 here in Canada now you look at
something like the Galaxy Tab 10 one
it's basically the same price without
all of that added functionality now
you're probably asking what is all the
added functionality he keeps talking
about and there's a few things there's
obviously some that you see right away
the keyboard the multi-touch trackpad
the side of the unit has got you know
your obviously your charging port here
you've got one USB on this side the
other side of the unit adds a full-size
SD card slot
another USB port now the tablet has got
a bunch more functionality over the
Galaxy Tab 10 one as well you've got a
microSD card slot an HDMI port a
headphone jack a headphone jack is
pretty obvious that's not really added
functionality and you've also got a five
megapixel camera on the back side of the
unit
I'm sure if you saw that there yeah
there you go maybe you can see it now
maybe not there it is right up there a 5
megapixel camera instead of a 3
megapixel camera which in my tests is a
significant improvement over the Galaxy
Tabs 3 megapixel camera in real world
usage now those are all very important
things but not really the most important
as far as I'm concerned the most
important thing for me about this
attachment is having the extra battery
this unit has its own battery in it and
it almost doubles the battery life of
your tablet now obviously there's an
extra weight and all that associated
with it so you're not really doubling
the life of your tablet your tab turning
your tablet into something else but
that's fine with me I sort of figure if
the environment calls for the tablet on
its own then I can just pop it out of
the transformer dock if the environment
calls for the whole unit or if you know
I have a table to rest it on or even if
I'm just sitting on my couch and I don't
feel like holding it anymore
and I need a few more minutes of juice
you know it's not really a question of
if you're going to use it in this way
all the time but having the option to me
is worth the money so I've given you
some of my opinions there it's obviously
not going to ring true for everyone if
you can't see yourself ever using that
added functionality then maybe you want
to take your money and buy something a
little bit more sleek and a little bit
lighter as well it's not really fair to
compare the Galaxy Tab 10 1 to the
transformer when it's docked in so let's
go ahead and remove it from the dock now
that's controlled via this mechanical
switch up here the way that that
functions is by unlocking to the left
and then you lift up on the tablet
portion and then
you've got your tablet on the bottom
side of the unit you have one two
different ports that allow the unit to
be locked in there as well as your
proprietary asus port now when you hold
the Galaxy Tab 10 1 up against the
transformer you can see it's not that
much thinner it's a little bit shorter
the tab 10:1 that is and it's
significantly lighter you know you can
definitely notice the weight difference
so like I said if you're looking for the
absolute lightest on the market right
now then you're probably looking at the
tab 10:1 but for me the weight
difference is not significant enough
that it would change my mind I'm I'm
totally on board with this this
transformer concept in fact I think
tablets should have gone this way a long
time ago instead of those crazy
swiveling screens even though you know
they may not have had the technology to
build this much functionality into a
removable slate in the past we have it
now so why not take advantage of it now
I've also got Believe It or Not an iPad
2 and I've also got a MacBook Air the
newest model 13-inch down here as well
and the reason that I've got this here
is because when you've got this
transformer completely hooked up in the
docking station it actually becomes very
close to the same way as the MacBook Air
now you're probably not considering
those two devices only because they're
two totally different price points but I
just wanted to give you an idea of what
to expect if you're going to be using
this in the laptop form factor more
often than not it is fairly hefty so I
just want to give you that warning not
hefty to the point where you're talking
about traditional laptop weight
but hefty to the point where you're
thinking damn I could be carrying a
MacBook Air if that's an option for you
but in the realm of Android tablets
there's really nothing else that's quite
doing what this one is doing so I
figured hey you know get the extra
functionality especially at the price
point that asus has it at so something
that I haven't mentioned yet is the
shortcut-keys that's another fantastic
feature on this device you've got keys
up top here
or you know toggling auto-brightness
you've got multimedia keys a very quick
settings key a HOME key to take you back
to home from wherever you are when
you're in an application say the browser
for example you've got a options key
which brings up you know your different
options within that application whether
it be the browser or something else
you've also got a multi-touch trackpad
which I don't actually use that much
only because I usually just reach up and
touch the screen for whatever it is that
I need performance wise this device is
very similar to the Tab 10 one basically
identical I mean a great way to stress
them out is to like throw some 1080p
video on there and they both handle it
perfectly well the web browsers are
close to identical as well and so if you
want to get a better idea of just how
speedy they are then definitely check
out my show down video where I can pair
the iPad here there's the iPad 2 the
Galaxy Tab 10 one as well as the HP
TouchPad that will give you a very good
idea of what kind of performance to
expect out of the transformer it's very
similar so anyway guys I probably
haven't covered everything but I've
definitely talked for a while this is a
new style of review you know usually I I
sort of sit down I have more edits and
you know I usually don't talk for so
long or about so much so definitely let
me know in the comments section if you
like this style or not maybe I could go
back to a different style but I really
wanted to cover a lot of things and also
just sort of get my opinion out there
because I really do like this device I'm
really impressed by it and I think if
you're in the market for an Android
Honeycomb tablet you've got to take a
long hard look at this device here
anyway guys until next time thanks for
watching and if you like this content

least visit the channel and check out
some more stuff I've got going on over
