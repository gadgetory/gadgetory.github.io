referenced frequently as the iPhone X I
really don't care what you call it
there's been some news developing and I
feel like we should discuss it I'm no
stranger to this device I used it for an
extended period of time and I came back
to you with some video content my
findings my feelings and so on and I
want to be clear about something at this
point right now this is a good phone the
camera is nice and so on and a lot of
people enjoy it and that's cool for me
it just ain't my choice and I don't
think it represents a great value given
its price point but today's video is
about an article that I read yesterday
on Forbes which was informed by an
article on Apple Insider essentially
stated that this phone right here in
front of me
might be getting canceled by Apple this
is not a TV show how do you cancel it
what do you what do you do here
well according to Ming Chi quo this
prolific information leaker who is
essentially I mean he's never wrong this
guy all right
his company KGI securities reported
recently that production was going to
shut down soon and that the reason for
it a lack of demand for this device
right here now he stated that one of the
reasons for this potential cancellation
is a lack of demand specifically in
China regarding the overall screen size
of this device it's not the biggest
screen in the world face ID where you
add there you go obviously there's
plenty of orders that are already put in
for this there's retailers and
telecommunications companies that are
gonna have these things on the Shelf it
just means that you're gonna shut down
the assembly line sooner than you
normally would and the current rumor
based on the information from this guy
is that that'll happen at some point in
the summer this would mark the first
time ever that Apple has shut down or
canceled a particular device before the
next one has actually launched like you
you buy an iPhone 7 right now you can
even buy a brand new iPhone 6s I believe
the idea here is not that the 10 would
be completely dead but a modified larger
version would take over for it and this
one would be buried forever but that's
not where the story ends all of a sudden
there was an update Ming Chi quo he kind
of backtrack
a little bit was like wait I phones
performing pretty good I'm not really
sure they're gonna shut it down I'm not
really sure what's going on and to me
that 48-hour backtrack is kind of
interesting on its own was the original
information bad did something change in
the face of the reporting I'm not really
certain the question still remains is
this phone going to be canceled or not
now of course you guys know where I
stand on this particular device I don't
think it's the greatest value for money
and I even anecdotally I know people in
my life I have chosen to upgrade to the
iPhone 8 or 8 plus instead of this and
so when I saw the report come out
stating that that's what people were
doing that they weren't gravitating
towards this model I could see some
reality in that at least in my own
personal experience so at a certain
point you have to wonder if that
influence has leaked out or if people
just in general haven't gravitated
towards this particular phone you might
think something is a great deal or a
great design and someone in China or
India or elsewhere might think other
ones but this development it certainly
lends itself to my intuition which is
that this marketplace has gotten
incredibly more competitive recently and
what you are able to get at lower price
points has improved substantially so the
question going forward probably not just
for Apple but also for Samsung and the
various other premium smartphone makers
how big is the demand for a $1,000 phone
and do they sort of need to reconfigure
a little bit in order to match the
demand that does exist now for the
record I don't imagine that the next
generation iPhone flagship will be less
than this one I think Apple is perfectly
happy playing in that premium space and
so is Samsung but the numbers once they
eventually become public well those
won't lie and we'll find out for certain
what the demand is for this particular
device compared to the others what do
you think is gonna happen do you think
that this will survive that the iPhone
10 will remain intact or will this one
go to bed somewhere you let me know down
in the comments also what do you think
is the perfect smartphone screen side
Tim Cook he's gonna be down in these
comments he's gonna be reading what
you're saying
so get your voice out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
