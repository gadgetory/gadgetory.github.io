Tom what would you say to Steven Seagal
she was here right now I'll take a
magnet hey man
behind this door is an incredibly hot
environment just under a hundred degrees
Celsius set in Fahrenheit 200 for those
of you south of the border that's
because we are testing the heat
resistance I spoke of three interesting
phone we have the iPhone 7 the note
seven that's right one of those rare
species and we also have a Google pixel
I need to show you how hot this is Oh oh
brother so I'm told that the surface of
this table somewhere in the neighborhood
of 100 degrees got a little thermometer
down there you can see the phone these
things have been sitting here cooking
for about an hour unable I guess I can't
open the camera app any more on that one
this one's trying to load to the Android
symbol on it and of course the iPhone
has the temperature warning on it it's
like I'm in the middle of desert or
something can't even open your eyes so
the light I wonder if we should take
them off the board and lay them flat oh
my hat oh my the brim of the Hat is more
pliable than usual oh that's all
Oh God holy Oh
a shaker table shake it off to shake
something so we moved on to the next
section now this room is incredible you
guys know that I've been combating
echoes and reverb for most of my life
this thing in here with all these shapes
and foam and the treatment and so on
creates this audio dense environment say
a few words run tell the people the
microphones here the microphones here
right sounds it on my body
sounds very streamlined like I was all
about any kind of echo in this
environment these things are really neat
though the shapes that are in here we've
got two different phones they're both
iPhone 7 one of them is strapped into
this atomic three extreme case for
iPhone 7 from ghost Tech now take a look
at that bin there this entire thing is
going to start shifting and shaking like
an earthquake and some of the objects
inside that bin are not so friendly to
phone fortunately unfortunately I don't
know so there's one naked iPhone 7 one
strapped into this and we're going to
test the difference here do they both
get smashed maybe it's possible does one
get smashed that's probably that's
likely well yeah Ryan's phone but then
again maybe there's some magical touch
you've got 20 G's of force ready set
record and let's check them in one each
who's going to win oh my goodness I'm
nervous about this it's a rugged world
out there and it's all happening right
here fired up
Oh baby
Oh
let's get it going
please getting cook it here
oh my this one got beat up look at that
kind of cool-looking actually the lens
kind of serves live yeah whoa it's still
kind of on a little bit now the one in
the case it's got some marks on it yeah
look Wow
just so you catch an idea of the amount
of force this metallic frame on here got
beat up also whoo and I'm going to quit
the recording the case did the trick
case versus no case who do you want to
be how do you want to live your life
also I don't recommend putting your
phone in here pretty cool
so let's head back in here now and see
what the state of those phones is
currently have they completely melted or
have they survived oh hello 102 look at
the starboard
alright let's just rescue all of them
right oh the Google pixel which is
rebooting constantly now what about the
note the iPhone might be the only one
that's smoked who the notes just Lupin
Wow these two are just Lupin temperature
take so Excel just booted up it's
working the note seven doesn't have much
battery on the 8% but it's working they
got to a certain point where it said the
battery is too hot to take a charge so
it stopped taking a charge got itself
down to 8% battery but did not explode
the iPhone still needs to cool down
before I can use it two and a half hours
under the Sun those solar lights it
seems maybe like the iPhone took this
the worst
oh there we're back now what the screen
is messed up see that okay so maybe I
take that back these buttons are not
functioning anymore maybe this note is
currently exploding clear winner here is
the pixel there the screen looks just as
good as it did when I put it in there it
stayed on the longest by far and
recovered the fastest certainly if there
was one of the three that you wanted to
leave on a dash and a super hot day in
the desert this would be the one to do
it with where are we today where are we
here at the east wind tunnel of the
University of Ontario Institute of
Technology boom</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
