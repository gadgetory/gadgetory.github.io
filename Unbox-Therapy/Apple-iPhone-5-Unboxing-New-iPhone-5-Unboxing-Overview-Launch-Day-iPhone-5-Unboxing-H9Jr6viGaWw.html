therapy and I'm very excited to bring to
you in unboxing in early unboxing of
Apple's latest creation the iPhone 5 so
go ahead and smash that like button down
below I went through hell and high water
to get this thing early so your support
is much appreciated but enough about
that let's get inside the box and see
what this baby looks like after all this
is an unboxing video so there it is
Apple's brand new iPhone 5 I'm going to
put it to the side for a moment we do
have to get through the more boring
components in this unboxing but trust me
I'll be getting back to the iPhone 5 and
giving you guys some really up-close
looks at the design and of course the
build quality etc so the first thing
you're going to notice in the paperwork
is actually a little tool for installing
your SIM card next you've got a little
Hello Guide which tells you how to get
the phone up and running just basic
information on operation you're also
going to get the ubiquitous Apple
stickers that are always included almost
forgot to mention those next you've got
Apple's brand new cable for connectivity
this of course is the lightning cable
and it can be inserted into the iPhone
either way so there's no like specific
way to put it in and pull it out I
suppose that it's that's its claim to
fame at the moment there's not too much
else to say about it we don't know
everything there is to know about it at
least at this point so that's about all
the information on that for now you've
of course got the familiar USB to wall
power adapter you'll be plugging your
lightning cable into that next you have
Apple's brand new earbud headphones I've
actually done it in unboxing and review
of these headphones independent of this
video so definitely go check that out
I'll put a link in the description to
that video if you want more information
on Apple's new headset but this is
really what this video is all about it
is of course the iPhone 5 and it is
beautiful to look at the industrial
design here is top notch I do have to
admit Apple sure knows how to put a
product together in terms of build
quality and construction you've got the
aluminum or metallic back here and it's
it's nice and subtle I do actually
prefer to the glass back that it had
previously it feels slightly more
durable and less fragile here you get a
better look at the camera as well as the
flash and
aside you've got basically your buttons
in all the same places as you've come to
know in the iPhone 4 and 4s you've also
got a forward facing camera which is
improved now and it also sits just above
the earpiece instead of off to the side
so that's a little bit of a cosmetic
change physical change on the bottom is
where you'll notice your speaker
microphone as well as that new dock
connector with the smaller lightning
dock and of course the headphone jack
has been moved to the bottom of the
device as well you're going to install
your SIM card in a familiar location and
then you've got of course your button
your standard iPhone button in the
center of the bottom portion now the
entire side of the unit is polished it's
got like this sort of bevel to it and
it's really really pretty to look at you
probably have to see it in person to
fully appreciate it but I did my best
through this video to give you a couple
of looks at it through those pictures so
there it is that is the fresh boot we
now have the brand new iPhone up and
running I'm going to go ahead and set it
up off camera I'm gonna bring you guys
all kinds of coverage on this particular
phone and I'm even going to give one
away so hit that subscribe button up
above do not forget I've got benchmarks
on the way it's going to be a review
eventually so remember to hit that like
button favorite this video subscribe to
everything you can and I'm gonna bring
you all the coverage I can alright guys
thanks as always catch in the next video
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
