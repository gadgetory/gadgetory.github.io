from Apple a response you could call it
it is of course a software update iOS 12
point 0.1 now before I even saw the
update I had a few people on Twitter
telling me hey Lou Apple has fixed the
charge issue you need to update the
world and your audience with this
development and truthfully I feel that
that is my responsibility considering I
was the one that amplified the original
signal on the original problem it's also
important to include this follow-up
because it's great that Apple has
responded here and fix this issue I
tested it on a few different phones this
is the update right here fixes an issue
where some iPhone 10s devices did not
immediately charge when connected to a
lightning cable now there's some other
fixes in there as well regarding
wireless networking some people are
having some issues there specifically
with Wi-Fi it looks like they addressed
that also all good news and I have to
commend Apple for getting to work pretty
immediately in order to fix these issues
this one on the left actually was the
worst of the bunch I couldn't get it to
charge when it was in idle and in some
cases even when it wasn't so as you'll
see here even from idle boom it starts
charging right away that's of course
what any user would want to see now a
lot of people on Twitter we're like Lou
will never do it he'll never post an
update saying that Apple fixed the issue
that's of course not true here we are
we're talking right now and the funny
thing is is it's like what do you think
is the goal is here like why wouldn't I
of course I don't want to completely
throw the phone out the window and say
that it's garbage never said that in
fact I've been using it for a while and
surprisingly I've been pretty okay with
it like I've been dare I say enjoying it
to a certain degree it's definitely a
great phone and my criticisms generally
with this device have to do with the
cost to performance ratio more than how
it behaves as an overall product but the
thing here that I can't understand is
why people would be upset at myself
amplifying a problem that real people
were having and why
to have fixed or addressed quickly after
all if you're a regular user you don't
really have a loud speaker like I do
here you could be in the Apple Support
Forums you could let them know but how
quickly or how slowly they address your
personal issue to a certain degree has
to depend on how widespread or even the
perception of how widespread that
particular issue happens to be when I
get a request from an audience member
saying hey I have this problem and so do
some other people and I see my
opportunity to amplify that signal and
address something that's probably of
interest to many of you the only thing
that could potentially happen is that
Apple would get to work on fixing it you
are the customer okay right you you're
the person buying the product and I had
a tweet recently where I said something
along these lines like careful defending
a brand at the end of the day that brand
works for you they're working for your
hard-earned money you're the boss in
this equation so when a person like me
makes you aware of a potential issue or
puts pressure on the brand to respond in
it in an efficient manner that's better
for you not worse it can't possibly be
worse unless you're just here to have
your perspective reinforced by mine but
that's not very useful to either me or
you it's far more useful for us to look
at this stuff in a granular fashion to
try to uncover things that might be
problematic and then maybe they can get
fixed I know the naysayers out there in
the audience are gonna be like what
Apple would have fixed this anyways and
sure that that's that's quite possible
in fact it's probable but you can't tell
me that me amplifying the signal on a
platform like this would in any way slow
them down if anything it would speed
them up so the whole Android Apple thing
honestly to a certain extent it's a bit
of a waste of time this particular issue
is fixed now you should be asking for
this kind of representation not the
opposite the opposite beating the person
down and said how dare you talk about my
dear Apple in this fashion it's only
gonna shut people up so I think we
should be careful about how we approach
these situations here's the update the
phone is working well it's my
responsibility to
this follow-up so that you know go
install 12-point 0.1 and your phone will
now charge charge gate is effectively
over we can celebrate that iPhone users
rejoice and honestly I feel like this
whole sequence is actually pretty great
it shows a couple of things we have a
voice here myself yourself included we
have a mechanism for getting directly to
a brand quickly let me know I'm leaving
it open-ended you want to tweet at me
you've got an issue with your device
I'll investigate I'm looking alright
this should be a good time to mention I
have now been using the iPhone tennis
max as my primary smartphone all my
smartphone uses my sim card is in here
I've been using it for like almost three
weeks at this point and I know a lot of
you have been waiting for the conclusion
the finale the follow-up what is it like
how does it compare for a guy who's been
using Android exclusively for a very
long time what is the iOS life like for
that kind of period of time for that
extended period of time that video is
coming up very soon so subscribe if you
haven't yet because I'm gonna wrap it
all up I'm gonna bring the realness
right here
we're unbox therapy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
