slightly different video where I'll
explain how to modify the way that you
watch YouTube videos and hopefully make
it a little easier for you to keep up
with all of your subscriptions as most
of you know YouTube recently changed
their design they changed the layout of
the homepage and it now requires a
couple of extra clicks or a couple
clicks one extra click anyway to get to
your uploads from your subscriptions and
as a result some people are missing
videos especially those that don't log
into YouTube every single day what
happened was I was looking for a
workaround and at the same time someone
reached out to me a developer from a
website called whips calm WIPs calm and
what they do is they build the browser
extensions and he said listen you know
we'll put together a custom extension
for unbox therapy so your users can try
out this new way of interacting with
your YouTube videos and new fresh
youtube uploads
so he built me a browser extension for
unbox therapy and it'll work on either
Firefox or Chrome which you should
probably be using one of those anyways
chrome is my own personal recommendation
and I've got a link in the description
so you can go install this thing now the
way it works if you're wondering right
now I'll quickly give you a demo is in
your browser right over here I'll try
and zoom in on this there'll be a button
with the unbox therapy logo and that
button when you click on it there'll be
a drop down a scrollable drop down of
all of my recent uploads you can also
search all of my uploads here it's
really fast really easy and as you
scroll it'll load all the way down I
think until the very beginning of the
channel which is actually pretty crazy I
haven't actually done that before yeah
so it's really fast and when you launch
a video it'll actually open in a new
window so it won't close whatever it is
you're doing and wherever it is that
you're reading or ever you are on the
web at any given time it's really nice
that it opens in another window another
cool thing that it does is when there
are new uploads that you may not have
watched yet or you definitely haven't
watched yet those will show up in red so
kind of like an inbox for your email
you'll see the number one or the number
two or three depending on how many new
uploads there are from unbox therapy
that you haven't seen yet so a very cool
little plugin or
Chinn that you can install into your
browser it's a big download button it's
completely free and I'll link it down in
the description so do me a favor go over
check it out at least try it out see if
you like it let me know in the comments
how it works out for you and show whips
some love for putting this together for
me if there are other channels that you
want to live in your browser as well so
you don't miss any of their content you
can actually create these extensions as
well for pretty much any channel out
there that you want to keep tabs on and
you want to avoid having to always go to
your YouTube homepage to see fresh
uploads so a very cool a little feature
that I thought I would share with you
guys and also just to help out this new
site here that's putting together some
pretty cool products and actually put me
in touch with the concept in general and
put it together for me so anyways click
the link down below try out the
extension and let me know how it goes
for you both in the comments and also on
my Twitter Facebook I'll put those links
down below as well that's just been a
quick little update let me know how it
works for you check out some videos
using the brown brand new unbox therapy
extension browser extension Chrome and
Firefox alright thanks for watching guys
hope it works out for you later</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
