another video and today we're checking
out something that is big this is
probably definitely the biggest
Bluetooth speaker setup that I have ever
unboxed it's called the diamond box you
see the diamond right there now I know
that it is pretty premium other than
that I don't know much let's get right
to it
and discover the diamond box unboxing
this is going to be a little bit tricky
in this space but I'm gonna try my best
ok the first thing I'm noticing here a
cable mini jack cable oh this thing is
no joke got like a leather handle on the
top kind of like a suitcase this that's
a party glossy white finish I know it
does come in different colors all your
controls are on the front here nice
volume knob in the center some LED
indicators here you can see the woofers
at the bottom tweeters at the top a
power switch looks like it has some
power in auxilary in and then USB power
I believe that you can charge your
devices from here so if you're streaming
from a phone or something you can power
it up using the internal battery inside
the diamond box now in the back is where
you're going to find some connectivity
here a quarter inch audio out and a
quarter inch audio in as well and then a
port for the charger it's meant to sort
of be like the modern boom box to
improve on the capabilities of a
standard portable bluetooth speaker can
imagine having this thing at a function
a picnic I know you want to go on a
picnic those cartoons of picnics where
the
would come along and pick up the food
and walk off with it and there would be
no picnic ants are very strong relative
to their physique I'm going to check
what else is in the box really quick
this is a power brick for it how long
does the battery life last AJ so 20
hours on a full charge we have a little
little manual here apparently right
there is a 2 carat cz diamond how about
the a for effort right there instead of
being a standard LED in this case the
light is shining through a cz diamond
happy listening from Tony de Moura sub
Tony alright so I'm gonna go ahead and
plug it in and I guess listen to some
music hopefully be blown away size is
kind of important size matters as they
say you have a bigger cabinet here you
can have bigger physical components to
create a bigger sound and this is
especially true in the lower frequencies
or as the youngsters like to say bass so
it came up right away diamond box
obviously this diamond box is beyond the
sound levels you'd expect that a much
standard Bluetooth speaker it's much
more in that kind of like boombox realm
lisanna kai was right this is it right
here like that thing right there I used
to have one of those back in the day
with a cassette player on it
I don't think I'm recognizing just how
loud it is until I talk and then I
realized whoa my volume is way up here
it's boombox volume you know where this
would be sick jack is in the in the
hockey change room getting ready for
games I mean that's that's next level if
I if I if I'm coming up on a basketball
game as a few people playing there and
they got this over on the sidelines like
well you know listen
I'm trying to compare it in my head to
like other Bluetooth speaker experiences
this is a boombox
straight up that's what it is it's all
compact it's in one it has a handle it
has a built-in battery that's what's
different
got the auxiliary in you got USB power
you got bluetooth I think I like it
thanks very much for watching guys
thanks to diamond box for sending this
out for me to check out yeah I'm happy
all right I guess that wraps it up I'll
catch you guys on the next episode later
I should actually go out on some music
nobody to pepper
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
