video that I made about switching from
Apple laptops from Mac books of all
sorts to this guy right here this is the
ThinkPad x1 carbon look at that it's
thin it's light I'm enjoying it it's all
about the keyboard in fact look at that
keyboard you see that Jack that's a nice
keyboard it's lived up to all of my
expectations and then beyond but there's
one thing that's kind of been nagging me
a little bit about it and that's the
charge brick not that there's anything
wrong with the charge brick it's a
typical laptop brick I'm happy that it's
type-c on this version of course it's
like that proprietary connector on the
extreme version that's convenient
because then you can charge other things
up with this brick in your bag but
inevitably when you throw one of these
into your laptop bag you got a kind of
rat's nest situation going on and of
course coming from Apple laptops you're
used to a more condensed power brick
scenario now I'm not the biggest fan of
the Apple power bricks either because
those ones tend to hang off the wall in
a weird way because all the weight is
plugging directly into the wall and
they're also fairly large maybe you're
in a coffee shop and you need to plug in
or something like that you don't really
feel confident having the Apple power
brick hanging out of the wall either now
this is a 65 watt adapter this is
similar to what you would get on like a
MacBook Air or something like that and
various other Ultrabook thin and light
laptops this product right here showed
up on Amazon good reviews and it claims
to be the most compact world's most
compact 60 watt power adapter and if
you're looking at the scale of that even
sitting in the box you're like whoa that
thing is small universal compatibility
over USB type-c USB PD fast charge
capable and 92 percent efficiency
three-year warranty this is not cheap
but I'm this kind of guy where I'm
always trying to get the ultimate kind
of travel setup where you only have in
your bag the things that you need and
the optimal versions of those things
that you need so if this can be the one
power brick to rule them all to charge
all the devices that's valuable to me
and I'll pay a premium so if you want to
see the price you can check the link in
the description but be warned it
a pricey power brick could charge a
12-inch MacBook in 1.8 hours now this is
also going to charge up certain devices
faster than the stock charger for
example if you purchased an iPhone and
you have that tiny little power brick
with the low wattage that thing is not
actually utilizing the quick charge
capability of your iPhone so in that
case you could pick up one of these
along with a type seats a lightning
connector for now until Apple finally
switches the phones over to type C and
you could get a much quicker charge with
this guy as well so it's going to
improve all of your charging scenarios
from laptop to smartphone to tablet oh
my goodness that's the power brick that
is your laptop power brick how do they
fit a 60 watt capable charger into a
package like that of course it's PD
capable USB type-c connector and then
fold up prongs over here now they do
make another version of this non u.s.
North America style connector with
interchangeable international tips it's
going to be a tiny bit larger to
accommodate the universal tip
configuration but this one you get the
benefit of the fold up so that is just
that's wonderful honestly can charge a
device like that or you go with this
your choice okay they give you a course
a type C cable so everything you need to
get up and running so this connects over
here fairly simple the prongs flip out
that's your connection in like that and
we're charging a jack right there we're
charging them okay 60 watts of juice
road warrior types that are on and off
of airplanes those little incremental
improvements make a difference over time
if you're constantly accessing this
thing now as I said the point here is
you skip bringing the smartphone adapter
as well in this case you're gonna use
the same charge brick type C like most
things these days you pop it on to the
phone as well and you're juicing up just
as well and your quick charging let's
bring in Willie do let's see what he
thinks about it
really I don't you had to introduce him
anymore that's the type of reputation
that he walks around with what you were
at footlocker and they say that's Willie
do right there yeah you're taking photos
you take photos with people it's a
wonderful time to be alive in the unbox
therapy universe if your name is Willie
do ya decent name it's not too bad one
of my favorites ever in fact so this is
what we got energy is the company they
have somehow shrunk down the charging
components necessary for a 60 watt
adapter into a package like that let's
hear it man what do you have to say it's
expensive you pay a premium yeah you're
a man of the people
break it down for them so it is very
light I use a lot of MacBook Chargers
for my MacBook Pro and this thing's like
maybe two and a half times smaller but
it is really expensive like you said
1:09 the price of a macbook charger is
69 bucks and that's that 60 watts I like
where you're going here so what Will's
trying to say is there's a lot of people
who have the dual charger setup anyway
yeah at work at home yeah exactly
and so if you were gonna go spend 69 on
another macbook charger or in this case
ThinkPad charger you could go this route
pay a little more and you end up with
the the most portable power brick on
planet earth for 60 watts
right which is good for you know at home
use at work but mainly for traveling I
guess it's really portable in that sense
I also find that MacBook Chargers you
know that they're so heavy that
sometimes they fall off though yeah I
know you know just like a little tug
yeah and doesn't seem like this this
would be a problem yeah it's not as
heavy to begin with so there's not as
much weight kind of pulling it down on
the outlet exactly you know when you get
those power bars or you get limited
options and spaces to fit it in the big
guy is problematic you can't fit into
certain if there's other people have
things plugged in the ones on the floor
and
port yep yeah this is as narrow as the
outlet itself I think you're a fan of
this
I am the price but the price
yeah it's $109 and I got I got to be
with you on that it's expensive I think
a lot of that has to do with the fact
they it's not a high volume product
right I don't think they're gonna sell a
million of these
but I'm saying just like you were if
you're a dual power adapter human being
which there's a lot of them out there
and 60 watts is good enough for you now
I'm saying maybe go up maybe spend the
extra 30 40 and and get something really
cool like this now I have a question
you have the MacBook Pro right there now
that uses a higher wattage adapter yes
what happens if we hit it with the 60
will they charge at all it might charge
slower they'll definitely charge I would
think put a lot slower oh yeah charging
it would be a slow charge on a MacBook
Pro cos of course and then if you were
trying to use the MacBook Pro and
stressing it out at all this may not be
enough yeah exactly
yeah who woulda thought charger tech
there are improvements to be had out
there if you want to spend the money
this is according to this company the
smallest 60 watt power adapter in the
world if you're a serious tech head and
you're trying to put together the
ultimate kind of travel setup it's hard
to beat something like this at 60 watts
that said you're gonna have to pay the
price if you want that luxury life as
usual will he do thank you very much
