smartphone today it is the honor 10 let
me tell you this one it has a unique
appearance I think you're gonna be
interested in I don't just have one I
got four of them that's because I'm
gonna show you every single color
variation they're gonna have for this
particular model but the first one I
want to show you is the color combo that
I'm most excited about this one is
called phantom green 128 gigabytes of
storage 4 gigabytes of RAM of course
there's gonna be different variations
available remember this color phantom
green show them that when they do look
at this the holy smokes so it almost
looks blue in this overhead camera if I
tip a dare you catch a little purple for
a second and then over there its
greenish see the teal starts to pick up
it's crazy this thing is almost 4 colors
at once you get like a teal ish blueish
purple-ish depending on the angle now
let's do a quick peek around the device
you can see the dual camera set up here
a 24 megapixel and 16 megapixel shooter
on the back bottom of the device thank
goodness we still have a headphone jack
I keep talking about headphone jacks I
think they should still be there you
have USB type-c to keep it charged up
the speaker unit is in that location
right there
power switch here volume rocker above
that SIM tray over here and you will see
it is a dual sim situation there as
expected what else is in the box they've
included a case this is always nice to
have this included now of course you
could buy something after the fact but
having something in the box is useful
quick charge power brick as well as USB
type-c cable so I'm already fairly
certain that this color combo is gonna
be my favorite but since we have the
others we might as well do a quick
comparison next up is midnight black so
as you can see it still got the
reflective back on it this one is called
glacier grey there it is now this one
holy smokes that reflection it almost
makes it look whitish in certain spots
and blueish elsewhere okay last but not
least we have phantom blue now this one
is a lot like the
first one but the shift is more of a
two-color situation from a dark rich
blue to a purple it's like two colors
that it's gonna shift between as opposed
to with the green one I feel like it's
really four anyhow there you have the
three options phantom blue glacier gray
midnight black and of course my favorite
phantom green okay let's get back to
this guy let's take a look at the
display here this is a five point eight
four inch display fhd plus and there's
something interesting you're gonna
notice right away down here hopefully
you can pick that up that is the
fingerprint scanner which is inside of
the bezel but it's not a dedicated
button with a raised edge like you would
normally have it's actually under the
glass so the glass is completely flush
there now this is fairly unusual this
type of implementation and it's another
thing that makes this device a little
different than some of the others that
are on the market so I'm gonna register
a fingerprint real quick ready well not
bad it's actually quite strange because
that you're not used to it obviously
some people out there in the audience
are addicted to the idea of a
fingerprint sensor on the front now the
motivation airlie the reason I think
some people are into it is you can just
have the phone on the table and unlock
it without picking it up I know some
people I guess like to read like that or
like to use their device like that so in
that sense I guess it's a little bit
more versatile phones locked boom and
then from completely locked boom that's
an interesting implementation and it's
the first one I've seen quite like it
it's not under the display itself but it
is under the glass inside it's got the
cure 970 processor that's an octa-core
processor that's powering it alright now
I know you guys are gonna be interested
in the camera so let's go ahead and boot
that up so here's a little explanation
about the built in AI photography you
can see here it brings out the color and
the photos intelligently making
adjustments and so on and this thing it
actually works surprisingly well on
devices that I've tested it previously
somehow it knows the difference between
a plant or food or dog we're going to
test out the orange see if you can see
this here see up there in the corner
the
i mode is selected and you can see down
here that it knows that this orange is
food and what you'll see is that the
camera it can kind of bring up the
vibrancy the saturation in knowing what
the object is this again is just a
convenience thing like of course you
could go into some pro mode and make the
adjustments yourself but most people
don't do that they just kind of rapidly
want to fire off some photos and if the
camera can do some of the work in the
background then you can save time and
still get decent results food logo
showed up again right away you look at a
texture on there couple of megapixels
there or what well alright last one
let's see if it can get the plant right
away it actually probably got the plant
the fastest
all right let's flip over to video mode
here and see what's available we can go
up to UHD 4k that's good to know
alright let's use this camera here to
pick up the color shift this particular
model this one is the phantom blue that
you're checking a look at that whoa now
I know it's well you guys are always
waiting for the selfie mode you want to
see this whole beard in maximum detail
in three two one
oh my that's your boy right there if you
can count the beard hairs that's always
a good sign alright some other specs
here it has a 3400 mill amp hour battery
which for a phone of this size is
actually quite large okay so there's a
really interesting mode in this device
called party mode and this will allow
you to link multiple phones in order to
amplify one particular song so that
they're all contributing using the phone
speaker to get four times the pal I have
four phones here but you could link up
even more than that's I'm gonna attempt
to do this right now they are all ready
to go at least I hope so I'm gonna go
ahead over here and start a party boom
got it oh it's already playing on to now
I'm gonna connect manually on this one
we can look at my Wi-Fi oh man
it's happening right now each one
occupies a different location so you can
see front left front right center and
left so you can actually like a surround
sound scenario okay hang on
turn these up
if I try to switch tracks let's see what
happens if I switch tracks instantly so
let's see if I skip forward in a song
instantly
kind of like Sonos it's like pairing
your speakers together but with your
smartphone's so if you didn't have
access to like a larger Bluetooth
speaker but you had a few friends around
you'd be like let's amp it up a little
bit it is four times louder obviously a
max volume for each one well I
definitely haven't seen a feature like
that before
it's interesting of course you could
have a Bluetooth speaker or some other
type of setup in your house but this is
more Fonte Gnaeus like in the spur of
the moment a bunch of people with phones
and all of a sudden you have louder
music now you can also dive into your
own music like it doesn't have to be
these tracks specifically you can see I
just have those three on these devices
out of the box alright so there it is
the honor 10 you're probably wondering
about pricing it's not completely
official at the time that I am shooting
this video
this is an early unboxing video which is
the reason I can't give you a full
evaluation of the device as well but I
do know this is gonna be somewhere
around 500 bucks in that range maybe 450
euros in that region so that price point
there puts it somewhere in the mid range
I think it's competitive price point
definitely worth paying attention to so
stick around for more coverage when I
can dive into it a little deeper when
it's officially launched when it's
shipping when retail units are out there
there you have it phantom green the
honor 10 possibly the most ambitious
color ever on a smartphone I don't know
you tell me it's like four colors in one
you are gonna turn some heads certainly
with that thing oh and you guys probably
noticed there was some extra devices
featured in this video four total now
obviously I can't use them all so I
think we should probably do a giveaway
maybe you think that's a good idea if
you do leave a thumbs up down below and
we'll probably do it over on my Twitter
I'll have a link to that in the
description and maybe you guys can get
some of these fresh looks with these uh
these color shifts you can turn some
heads for yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
