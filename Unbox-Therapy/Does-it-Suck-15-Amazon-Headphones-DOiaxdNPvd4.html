with another video and it is another
installment in the new hot new series
does it suck hot off the presses hot
like pizza
the amazonbasics on ear headphones
they're about 14 dollars and they come
in this frustration-free packaging
certified frustration-free I'm already
frustrated reading that guys know the
whole purpose of this show is to look at
items that are a little bit less
expensive are reviewed well on Amazon
that that you might have questions about
you might be sitting there looking at
the product page and wondering are these
things any good for $14 I know I'm a
little bit skeptical you probably are
too but that's what this series is for
so let's do it as you can tell this is
uh Amazon basics basic so I suppose the
idea here with $14 headphones you just
need something simple to replace
possibly a pair that you lost or maybe
the free included headphones like say
these earbuds
maybe you got $14 to buy a gift for
somebody or $14 to buy a gift for
yourself inside the box it is super
simple couple of plastic bags they are
recyclable little bit of protective
stuff here they look okay 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack no microphone or anything
hey listen that's okay this big sticker
here not a huge fan of it came off
pretty easily alright good for you
Amazon I'm not frustrated yet you don't
want to see me frustrated it's such a
puny little knife headphones little
neoprene padding on the top matte black
fairly cushiony ear pads here and let's
go ahead and try them on
so it's an on-ear style oh there's also
a carrying case pretty sure you guys saw
that without even plugging in any music
the isolation is pretty good but the
proof is in the pudding as they say
let's find out
exactly what kind of noise these make
$14 all right most surprising part the
low-end I think you guys can hear it
there I hope so
coming up close to the microphone okay
now I'm not usually a huge fan of on ear
style headphones I would normally take
and around the ear style instead but for
what they are this is surprising these
are legit this is a legit headset
they're simple listen this is plastic
this sound is certainly an improvement
over standard little ear pods like this
I'm gonna just refresh my memory right
now real quick now it might not be a
fair comparison these are free
headphones in there in-ear style
it's a harsher kind of crunchiness I'm
going to switch back right now just to
keep it fresh it's night and day
it's night and day really if you're
looking for I don't know the most basic
Amazon basic upgrade to your audio these
are a good value for 14 bucks these are
certainly not throwaway headphones check
them out I don't know they don't suck no
way they do not suck I like being
surprised here on does it suck and I
really had low expectations for $14
headphones but they're legit there you
have it I'll drop a link in the
description if you want check out
pricing and availability on them thank
you very much for watching if you guys
enjoyed this content make sure to leave
a thumbs up down below and if you're
living in earbud purgatory you want to
step the game up but just a little bit
this is we're trying basic stuff not so
basic sound all right later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
