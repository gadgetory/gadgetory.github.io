therapy in the call of duty modern
warfare 3 content continues this is the
limited edition Xbox 360 with the
special design the 320 gig hard drive of
course it's also got a copy of call of
duty modern warfare 3 and a very cheesy
straightforward headset to get you
started with Xbox Live if you don't have
a different headset it's a very
straightforward and basic but let's get
inside the box and see what everything
looks like and see if it's worthwhile
for you guys so of course we got a
little bit of paperwork here I'm gonna
go ahead and remove all the different
items from the Box get the box out of
the way so we can get a much better look
at each independent item there should
also be some DLC love in here at least
that's what I'm hoping having paid this
much money for a limited edition console
you want a little bit of DLC whatever it
might be so first thing to get out of
the way let's get this this cheesy
little heads out of the way the airline
style headset with the flexible boom on
it I don't know why I always hate on
this headset when you get it at me is
better than getting nothing but it's
funny because it just feels so ancient
so archaic here's those real nice
controllers I actually really like the
look of these you've got that rotating
d-pad just like on the Gears of War 3
controller difference is these ones have
a matte finish of course the color is
different too but they have a matte
finish nothing glossy about them and
they're only two-tone one color on the
front one color on the back I pulled out
my Gears of War 3 controller give you
guys a comparison as you can see the
gears one has a little bit busier I mean
it's got the red and the black and a
little bit of gloss on it I prefer the
modern warfare 3 controller but again
that's personal preference and you've
also got a composite cable I keep on
complaining about this why can't these
manufacturers just blow my mind one day
and throw a friggin HDMI cable in you
got the legendary Xbox 360 power brick
and here is the modern warfare 3 game
it's in a regular plastic case no
steelbook he
unfortunately you got to get the
hardened addition for that I recently
unboxed a hardened edition of modern
warfare 3 check out that video if you
haven't yet it's over on my channel and
as you get look inside pretty basic
stuff you've got the game disk and a
manual on the other side these manuals
keep shrinking but that's not really
such a big deal not too many people read
them to begin with you can get all that
stuff in game now so as you see on the
back cover this is the best-selling
franchise in Xbox 360 history Wow
that's a big statement and you can see
it's not for resale that's because this
game is just meant to be bundled and yes
there is some DLC you get an exclusive
modern warfare 3 avatar item we'll have
to wait and see exactly what that is but
you gotta love a little bit of DLC love
so here it is the main attraction the
main thing in the box that we've all
been waiting for it is the console
itself and the very first thing you guys
are going to notice is this really
spiffy paint job once again just like
the controllers it's got a matte finish
unlike the glossy deal that was going on
with the Gears of War 3 console you get
the modern warfare 3 insignia along the
top of course the Xbox 360 logo in the
center a game modern warfare 3 on the
front of the unit
you're just below your disc drive you've
also got a little flap panel to cover a
couple of your ports on the front as
well as the power button of course got
to turn this thing on the fan is going
to blow out the top side and as you look
at the back you've got power you've got
spit if HDMI AV you got Ethernet 3 USBs
and you got that auxiliary port for
connect if you're going to use it with
that and once again in the bottom left
corner you've got more call of duty
modern warfare 3 branding here's an even
closer look at that ping job that nice
matte abstract finish this is a nice
looking console guys I personally think
it looks nicer than the stock console
but again it's personal preference you
can decide for yourselves you got the
chrome Xbox 360 logo on there as well
give you a closer look at that anyway
