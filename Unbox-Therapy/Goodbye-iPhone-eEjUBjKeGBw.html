brand new video and today we're going to
be talking about this the previous
generation iPhone now in this case it's
a 5s but there were many versions before
this and you might still be using one so
this video really applies to you as well
and it even applies to individuals that
aren't on an iPhone at all Android users
etc I'm going to go through a couple of
different options for selling your
previous generation device to prepare
for the shipment of the brand-new one
and as you know in this particular case
the iPhone 6 was recently announced in
two separate variations and they're set
to hit the street on the 19th of
September that means that the value of
your current generation device is set to
plummet fairly significantly over the
next week or so so if you are interested
at all in upgrading to the next gen I
phone now is a great time to think about
selling your current generation device
or previous generation device so there
are a few different ways to sell your
device both online and in person and in
this video I'll be going over three
popular options including my favorite so
we'll be looking at Craigslist we'll be
looking at the retailers such as AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon the Apple Store etc and then
we'll also be looking at eBay we'll kick
it off with Craigslist which if you're
unfamiliar is a site for posting
classifieds about pretty much anything I
mean anything even your old device that
you're looking to sell there are
benefits and drawbacks to Craigslist
it's very easy to create a post and most
of the sales are local but then you need
to meet somebody in person who you don't
know very much about and there's no real
reputation built into their account so
Craigslist isn't perfect also generally
speaking most listings lead to some kind
of negotiation usually people on
Craigslist want to throw a few low balls
out there to figure out if they can get
your device for less than you're asking
next up we have the physical stores
places like Verizon AT&amp;amp;T in the Apple
Store generally speaking they'll give
you a little bit of value for your
previous generation device but it's
usually not very
much money because they realized they've
already got you in the store you already
want the next generation device so
they'll just you know throw you a few
bucks the drawback here is the fact that
you're not going to get very much money
I suppose it could be convenient for
some to go to a physical location last
up we've got my personal favorite the og
of online sales I am of course speaking
of eBay I've been using eBay for as long
as I've been using the Internet at least
it feels that way I've been selling
stuff there since long before I ever
posted a video here on YouTube and that
just breaks down to the way that eBay
works you're going to reach a gigantic
audience you get to set your own price
you never need to meet anybody you just
ship out the product after the sale is
finished you can use an auction you can
use a Buy It Now price just really
convenient and there's a gigantic
audience there which generally means
more cash for your current generation
device in fact you could be looking at
$200 more based on some of the numbers
that I've seen on eBay compared to
places like Verizon AT&amp;amp;T and of course
the Apple Store up to $400 in fact for
your previous generation device which is
going to make the upgrade cost of that
new iPhone 6 or other device that much
easier to swallow because we all know
staying upgraded is a fairly expensive
thing to do so getting some value back
for your current generation device makes
it all that much easier
eBay is even offering up $100 coupon in
conjunction with the launch of the next
generation iPhone so if you list your
old device and for some crazy reason it
doesn't sell they'll give you $100
coupon you can head over to the link in
the description it's eBay for the wind
calm and all the details are over there
so you've got a little bit of extra
security as well so the pros when it
comes to selling something on eBay are
pretty obvious you don't need to meet
some creepy person for Craigslist you
don't need to go to Verizon AT&amp;amp;T or the
Apple Store and get low-balled then get
angry start an argument when then a
video will end up on YouTube of you in
that argument alright guys that wraps up
this video thanks as always for watching
I hope that you found it useful
you did make sure to leave a thumbs up
down below all of the details and things
that I talked about are going to be in
the description of this video so be sure
to check it out
that wraps this up I already said that
I'll catch you guys on the next episode
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
