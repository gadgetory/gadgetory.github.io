therapy and today we're taking a look at
BioShock Infinite the premium edition
this one is for the Xbox 360 it also
launched for the ps3 as well as the PC
and it just came out today so it's the
perfect time for an unboxing I was just
saying on Twitter that I haven't done a
game unboxing in a while so it's about
damn time that I got back around to it
and what better time to do it then on a
great game or at least what I've heard
so far what will be a great game in
terms of BioShock Infinite if you guys
are interested in picking up a copy of
this game whether it be the premium
edition or the regular edition or
otherwise I will drop a link down in the
description so you can check out pricing
and availability as of recording this
video it is still available in this
premium edition that you are watching
right now so hurry on up and see if it's
still in stock over at the link down
below as you guys can tell there are a
number of things included in this
edition including a limited edition art
book a handyman figure you got the devil
kisses lithograph among other things and
you'll find out what each and every item
is as we move through this unboxing
video after all this is unbox therapy
where products get naked as most you
guys know so let's go ahead and jump
into the unboxing portion of this video
I will pull out my trusty blade so we
can get inside and take a closer look at
everything that is included as well as
of course the ever important game disc
because I can't wait to try out this
game actually this is a good time to ask
you guys would you like to see a little
bit of gameplay like I do a lot of game
unboxings and I want to do more and I'm
curious if you guys would be interested
in you know watching me play and maybe
do a commentary over like the first 10
minutes or first 5 minutes of a game you
know sort of to improve on the unboxing
experience so you get to see the product
as well as get a little sample of what
it's like to be played I've been
thinking about doing it for a while so
definitely hit the thumbs up button down
below if that's something you guys would
be interested in seeing in the near
future so anyways in terms of the
unboxing the first thing you'll notice
was a bunch of DLC I'll show that in
more detail towards the end of the video
you've also got a little bit of artwork
here this is actually what they're
calling the devil's kiss lithograph kind
of looks like a postcard and on the top
you can see that it says light the way
we've also got the art book included and
I always appreciate the
artbooks because they give you the
inside scoop they let you see behind the
scenes how some of the concepts were
developed for the game that you're
actually playing sometimes we forget
just how much work and effort and
imagination goes into these things and
allows them to be playable next we have
the handyman miniature and this thing is
actually as it sounds incredibly
miniature I'll bring it closer to the
camera so you can actually experience
some of the detail but this thing is
damn tiny it's got to be the tiniest
little figure that I've ever received in
a collector's or special edition you
also get this CRO keychain and this
thing's actually pretty robust pretty
heavy it's a little bit freaky though I
was mentioning earlier to Kirk in the
office that some people might think
you're into some witchcraft or something
if you're rocking this thing on your
keychain or with your keys and people
don't understand or know anything about
BioShock Infinite
anyways that's a closer look at the
detail actually quite detailed pretty
nice you have a brass ring on there so
it's got that old-school weathered and
aged look like a number of things in the
game speaking of the game let's go ahead
and jump inside the case the game case
you can appreciate some of the artwork
on the front and of course this is the
Xbox 360 edition as I mentioned earlier
so you have these standard Xbox 360 game
case although if you purchase this
particular version at Future Shop you
will also receive a steelbook case which
I'll show you in detail one more time
before the video closes out as you just
noticed on the back the case this game
is rated mature so here's a closer look
at the game disc you've got similar
artwork to what you saw on the front
cover of the case you can see here
you've got an advertisement for the
season pass three DLC packs for $19.99
as well as a little user manual of
course as I mentioned earlier in this
video there is more DLC to be looked at
here's a closer look at the inside of
the game case you'll notice a profound
and thought-provoking quote here and
hopefully you'll find out more about
what that means as you progress through
the game as I said earlier you will
receive a steelbook case if you purchase
this game at future shop regardless of
which Edition you purchase so if you're
interested in checking that out be sure
to click the future shop link down in
the description here's a look at the
inside of that case along with some of
that artwork and here's a better look
the outside of the standard edition game
case and that particular artwork as well
as I mentioned before there is dlc
included that comes with this premium
edition likely the most compelling
aspect of that DLC for you is going to
be the upgrade pack which allows you to
start the game with three exclusive gear
power-ups the first is called the bull
rush which is essentially an improved
melee strike which will actually knock
your enemy back in a fashion that the
standard melee won't you've also got
something called extra extra which
allows for you to get some extra cash
for collecting audio logs and then
there's something called the betrayer
which if you kill your possessed enemies
it will cause them to explode damaging
other nearby enemies so a couple of
extra in-game things to hopefully
improve your experience you're also
going to get BioShock Infinite avatar
items via the Marketplace on Xbox 360
those of course are downloadable like
everything else and then lastly you have
the soundtrack which once again is
downloadable so anyways as you guys can
tell there is some compelling DLC within
there you have a very beautiful art book
as you are starting to appreciate here
so a number of different things included
in this premium edition that I think
definitely help to add value to the
overall experience the other nice thing
about this edition is it's significantly
less expensive than the songbird Edition
this one should retail around 79 bucks
whereas the songbird Edition is I
believe 130 so if you're looking for
something in-between something that's
still commemorative something you can
collect but isn't going to really hurt
your bank quite as much this might be
the Edition to go for I will link all
the editions down below and I still
might be getting my hands on that
songbird Edition that I mentioned so
maybe you'll be able to compare the two
if I can get you guys an unboxing of
that one to go with this particular
unboxing anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
this content if you did please make sure
to leave a thumbs up down below and also
consider what I said earlier do you guys
think you might be interested in seeing
a little bit of gameplay to go with the
game unboxing videos you know maybe like
the first 5 or 10 minutes if that's
something you want to see let me know in
the comments as well as you use your
thumbs to do so as I said before thanks
as always for your viewership if you're
not a subscriber now is a great time to
become one
other than that I will catch guys on the
next video Thanks later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
