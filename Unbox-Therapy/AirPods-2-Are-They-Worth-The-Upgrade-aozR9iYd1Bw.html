they're releasing all kinds of new
products quietly on their website
without the need for a big event granted
none of these products are huge changes
you had the new IMAX the other day there
were some new iPads in the form of the
new iPad Mini new iPad air and then
today they come out with some brand new
air pods which were rumored I talked
about I thought they need to make this
video in fact because I did a video a
comparison of the previous version the
original air pods up against the new
Samsung Galaxy buds and in that video I
kind of hinted at the fact that Apple
was likely to refresh the air pods soon
and now they've done it like a couple
days after my video so I kind of need to
update you they've changed some things
the new products a bit more competitive
and it actually implements a feature
that the galaxy buds have probably the
biggest difference from the new ones to
the old ones is the fact that the new
ones now can charge wirelessly via a
wireless charging case now you can still
purchase the new version of air pods
without that case for a cheaper price so
you are paying a premium for the
wireless charge case putting the
difference between the Galaxy buds from
Samsung and the air pods price-wise even
further apart so the wireless case
version of the air pods to will be $200
u.s. and then the original charge case
with the new air pods the type that you
have to plug in via the proprietary
lightning cable those will be the same
price as the old air pods at 1:59
they'll just replace that old product
now on top of that if you just want to
upgrade the case on your current air
pods to the wireless case you can
purchase that for 79 bucks so these are
some some pretty hefty price tags for
these types of products of course it's a
$40 premium just to get the wireless
charging it would have been nice to see
Apple give you wireless charging at the
same price point as the original air
pods and just get rid of the charge case
that doesn't support
I was charging so the other difference
is here you have a new chip they're
calling it the h1 chip a new brain
inside of the air pods which is gonna
improve the performance of the air pods
in various ways it's gonna allow them to
connect more quickly to your devices
it's gonna allow them to switch between
devices more quickly and let you answer
phone calls more quickly and it will
extend the battery life on talktime it's
just a more efficient more advanced chip
the other thing it's going to be able to
do is allow you to launch Siri just via
voice by saying hey Siri
now the other weird piece about this
announcement is the fact that Apple
still doesn't make a wireless charger of
their own of course there's been this
rumor around this air power product
which it does seem like Apple is going
to make they've had this charge pad
floating around they even had it on
their website at one point that
supposedly can charge an iPhone your air
pods and an Apple watch all-in-one
device now granted these devices all
support the wireless Qi standard so you
could drop them onto a third party
wireless charger you could even charge
these new air pods on a Samsung or
Google charger if you want to just rub
it in a little bit more but anyhow in
the meantime we're waiting for an
official Apple solution for wireless
charging on all these new wireless
charge capable devices the other
difference on the new air pods
particularly on the wireless charge
cases there's now an LED on the front in
order to tell you that you're actively
charging when you are on a wireless
charge pad now we don't know anything
about the sound yet whether that will
change at all I highly doubt it they
look as far as the earbud is concerned
very similar if not identical to the
previous version so I expect them to
sound the same as well but I put into
order I've got the the retail version on
the way so I'll update accordingly as I
find out more I know a lot of people out
there we're expecting a bigger change
here they wanted something more
substantial or significant there was
talk of black air pods which I know got
a lot of people excited they didn't want
the typical white look they wanted
something more stealth there were
renders floating around so no black air
pods as of right now no product red
air pods as of right now they look
identical you just get the new chip the
wireless charge case and some
performance improvements with a price
tag to match I still think they're a bit
expensive for what they are compared to
the competitors on the market as I
mentioned in the galaxy buds video those
were delivering wireless charging in a
fully wireless earbud device for 129
bucks now the air pods with the wireless
charge case are at 200 bucks almost
double the price but hey that's what
Apple does you pay a premium for the
convenience as far as upgrading if your
Gen 1 user of air pausing if you just
recently spent 160 bucks on ear pods
version 1 I don't think there's really
any reason here to rush out and get the
new pair you can get the wireless charge
case if you really want it in fact you
could also get the wireless charge case
adapter that I showcased from a
third-party company what was the name of
that well East Brooklyn Labs it's like a
rubber case that you put on the outside
of the current air pods charging case
and that gives it wireless charging it's
a lot cheaper than 80 bucks I think it's
like 30 bucks or something to go out and
spend a fresh 200 when for all intents
and purposes the functionality is gonna
be pretty similar beyond a slim
improvement and wireless charging it's
not really enough from my perspective
that said the the original product was
super convenient as I said in the Galaxy
buds versus air pods video so maybe it's
one of those situations where you
shouldn't change too much when you have
a wildly popular product to begin with
if you want them you can buy them though
the shipping dates are already starting
to slip it's crazy how popular these
things are people are already buying
them I saw I saw the report on Mac
rumors they're saying that the ship
dates already slipping on the air pods
people are savages they're out there
they love their Apple products you can't
deny it for better for worse air pods
for sale version 2 people are buying
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
