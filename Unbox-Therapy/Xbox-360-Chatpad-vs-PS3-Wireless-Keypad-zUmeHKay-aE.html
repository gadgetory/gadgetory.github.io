therapy this is a very quick comparison
because you asked for it it's the Xbox
360 chat pad up against the ps3 keypad
now this is kind of a funny comparison
because you know they're not really
competing products but it is interesting
to see how each manufacturer has tackled
the concept of text-entry on their
consoles I do have to say that I like
typing on the 360 chat pad because the
buttons are a little bit larger and I
like the location of the keyboard being
below rather than above but there is a
major trade-off this solution here is
quite hefty quite chubby it's a lot
heavier than the PlayStation solution
and I think a lot of that has to do with
the Xbox 360 controller being a little
bit heavier to begin with
now you have chat pass-through on the
bottom of this one because obviously the
Xbox 360 system uses on controller chat
functionality and as I mentioned before
the unit is using the onboard batteries
I just have a couple of Duracell double
a's and they're got to get some
rechargeables but we'll wait and see
exactly which one has better battery
life but as as i said before this is
going to rely on your controllers
battery unlike the sony solution which
isn't now the sony solution is very
light light in comparison to the other
one but it puts the keyboard up in this
funky location up above and the keys are
substantially smaller so there's your
trade-off you can go for thin and light
but smaller keys or big chunky and
bigger ones that's usually the way it
goes isn't it
I don't mind typing on it I mean it's
effective it's obviously way better than
the on-screen keyboard some people have
mentioned that getting to your shoulder
buttons is affected but I don't really
feel that it's okay for me and again the
main focus here is that this device is
actually usable off of the controller
because it has its own battery so if you
pull it off of here and take a look at
it it can completely function this way
you could actually keep it beside the
controller if you really wanted to and
it just sort of mechanically clips on
there but there is no actual interaction
between the controller and this device
it charges on its own as I just pointed
out it's got that mini USB port along
the top now that might be a headache
for you because now it's to devices to
charge instead of one but a game that's
preference that may actually be better
for you now the keyboard itself is
typable but as I mentioned if you have
larger larger sized hands you probably
would prefer something a little bigger
if it was even possible on a controller
like this and once it clips on here a
number of buttons are remapped
mechanically below - like the power
button start select and whatnot now this
is a special function that the Sony has
that the Xbox version doesn't is the
whole unit is a trackpad itself now the
results of using this are hit and miss I
mean it's not very smooth it's not like
a laptop trackpad as you'd imagine
you're going over top of the keys the
keys themselves become the trackpad so
it's kind of an afterthought I think it
works in the web browser but it is in
the prettiest thing so anyway guys each
one of these devices has its benefits
and drawbacks and it's kind of a funny
comparison because it's not like you
really have a choice whichever console
you have you have to deal with The
Associated accessory but as I mentioned
earlier in the video it is interesting
to see how each manufacturer tackled the
concept of text-entry on their console
I'm going to give you guys a closer look
at each of the keyboards as you can see
there are a number of special function
keys on each these keys on the Xbox
version are a little bit larger than
what you get on the PlayStation version
of course these ones are round so
they're a little bit smaller and you've
also got a number of special characters
on this one I think a few more so if you
want to mess with people and put some
crazy characters in your username you
could definitely go for it anyway guys
