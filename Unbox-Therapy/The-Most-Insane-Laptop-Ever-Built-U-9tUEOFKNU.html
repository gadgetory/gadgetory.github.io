package as you could probably tell I
mean it's like it is the largest gaming
laptop ever inside I can't believe I
haven't checked out this laptop sooner
the Acer predator 21 X it's hard to even
call this thing a laptop it comes in a
suitcase it retails for nine thousand
bucks
table and parties are you having I don't
know I want to be there send me an
invite is there popcorn at land parties
I don't know but there should be here we
go oh my goodness this is the predator
21 X and as you probably guessed Oh
underneath this all the accessories to
giant power bricks to separate power
cables a wrist rest a trackpad which
flips over into a number pads I'm
replaceable key taps oh yes it's a
laptop technically you could put it on
your lap but really what it is is it's
like a portable game station after all
this thing has two gtx 1080s in it it's
like a mobile gaming PC obviously you're
gonna need double the juice and that's
what you've got here now you can insert
these things into this holder here like
that and that is your power setup now
obviously you're gonna have a ton of
ports on here because it is really a
desktop replacement 2 USB 3 's Dolby
audio badge over here some giant grills
here to get rid of heat from the inside
HDMI to display ports Thunderbolt 3
wired Ethernet and then of course the 2
power ports for those power bricks two
more USB threes it looks like some gold
plated audio connectors for both
microphone and headphones here we go
that's insane 2560 by 1080 ultra wide
and yes it's curved there's the curve
this thing has five fans in it it's got
two subwoofers on it as you can see down
here in the corners also these laptops
are numbered you can see I have number 6
Steen out of 300 300 out in the world so
it's a pretty exclusive club that is a
crazy place to sit oh my goodness
I mentioned this numberpad here before
on the other side is a trackpad it just
slots in right here it's magnetic you
can put the number pad in like that as
well
now the keyboard let's talk about the
keyboard this thing is mechanical
beneath each one of these key caps is a
Cherry MX brown switch which is insane
for a laptop although again calling this
thing a laptop doesn't really do it
justice now this also has a cool feature
called killer doubleshot pro essentially
it allows this port right here to work
in conjunction with your Wi-Fi to
prioritize gaming via this port and then
all the other web-based functions over
Wi-Fi what do you say folks should we
power it up that was a pretty quick boot
up as it should be you can see the
temperature of the CPU the two GPUs and
of course the system as well now I'm
gonna go ahead and hit the max fan speed
bowl beat of a jet engine bit of a jet
engine you have two gtx 1080s so stop
complaining okay today I think we've
done that so in a previous video I
showed you a set up with a really
special chair so there's a couple
different settings on there through the
Dolby menu dynamic movie music game
voice and then personalized where you
can set the EQ yourself for my videos
voice soundness what you're allowed to
say here Jack
for a laptop it sounds good but it ain't
gonna rival like a dedicated setup
chances are with a system like this
probably gonna want to use a headset
into one of these jacks on the sides
team time we need to find those sinners
ahead for the lumber bill I'm sorry I
thought they got you come on come on
there's a road out there we're gonna
take it with a head northeast
also has a hundred and twenty Hertz
refresh rate that's gonna be really
important obviously to gamers it's got
the i7 78 20 HK processor the two GTX
1080s are in sli so they're working
together
it's got 64 gigabytes of ddr4 memory and
then it's got a couple of 512 gigabyte
SSDs nvme SSDs in raid 0 and a 1
terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive
so yeah that's far cry 5 and ultra
everything very graphics intensive game
as you could tell from the gameplay
fills out the ultra wide aspect ratio at
2560 by 1080 you can see we still have
plenty of VRAM left over holy smokes
seven point eight gigabytes what I
really think this thing aims to do is
recreate a desktop experience in
something that is sorta portable I'm
happy that something like this exists if
I walked into somebody's house and they
just had this thing set up how am I not
gonna ask some questions
$9,000 dual GTX 1080s ultra wide display
2560 by 1080i seven minute
we first will trackpad a dragon
