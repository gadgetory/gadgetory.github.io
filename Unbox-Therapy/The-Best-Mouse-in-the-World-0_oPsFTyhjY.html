with another video and today we are
checking out something that I have been
very excited for but unfortunately it's
been sitting here in the box for far too
long this is the MX master mouse from
Logitech now I've been a big fan of
these top tier Logitech mice for a while
you've probably seen the performance MX
that sits on my desk in various
Instagram photos and even videos this is
the new iteration with a number of
improvements so I'm really excited to
get it out of the box and finally start
using it as you'll see the package has
this flap here flap or back on the flap
back on the flap this package has a flap
on the front and it exposes the actual
Mouse as well as a few steps here for
getting it up and running you see it has
an on switch connects via bluetooth or
with a receiver and it can even connect
to multiple devices at once if you have
a laptop and a desktop or multiple
laptops on the back we can see it has a
smart speed adaptive scroll wheel the
performance MX had that as well it's
also got a unique thumb wheel and it has
advanced power management with up to 40
days of battery life on a single charge
so let's go ahead jump inside the box
and take a closer look at this new
state-of-the-art Mouse from Logitech
state-of-the-art that's the best if the
artform is building mice computer mice
and this is the state-of-the-art always
liked that same alright so here we have
it the actual MX master along with some
paperwork that you don't care about oh
my goodness Wow ok this might seem weird
to hear me get this excited about a
mouse but that feels beautiful the
texture here is unreal
I mean unreal in a good way very smooth
with a tiny bit of grit a lot more
pleasing than the previous generation
and then on the thumb portion you have
this kind of mosaic pattern so you can
sense the difference in texture from
where your thumb rests versus the rest
of your hand also a little bit taller
than the performance MX which is nice
really shapes around your hand very
nicely
Wow I'm gushing over this thing I
apologize guys on the front here or top
I should say you have the scroll wheel
you can hear what it sounds like you can
also I believe have it free scrolling I
know that on the performance MX if you
spin it a certain speed it'll start free
spinning you also have your standard
mouse buttons on the other side here we
have our new horizontal scroll wheel
this one doesn't make any kind of clicky
sound very smooth there are also back
and forward buttons in this location
here and then this entire thumb rest is
also a button you also have some LED
indicators here three
I assume that those will be used for
indicating battery life on the bottom of
the mouse you have a power switch a
connect button your sensor and then one
two three with a button underneath it
this is going to be used for pairing
with multiple computers as I mentioned
now if you don't have Bluetooth or for
whatever reason you want to use RF you
do still get a standard little dongle
here dongle everyone loves the word
dongle some people have interference
issues with RF if they're using the
mouse near a router for example others
might have issues with bluetooth if they
have a number of Bluetooth devices
connected so regardless having both
options is a positive thing the last
thing inside the box a standard USB
cable this will be used of course to
charge up the mouse let's see how long
it is how long is that uh what do you
think that is 4 feet 4 feet it's about a
4 foot Gator now since this is a mouse
there's really little need for a
demonstration you probably all know
exactly what it does but what I can tell
you in this unboxing and first
impression video is that the materials
here are very very nice it is an
expensive Mouse if you want to check out
current pricing and availability I'll
put a link down in the description but
the result of that expensiveness is a
very quality feeling product for anyone
looking for the most premium of mice
upgrade your mousing now the mouse will
work with both
and PC so regardless of which platform
you're on you can fully utilize the MX
master and all of its features all right
so there you have it the MX master from
Logitech possibly the greatest mouse on
the planet let me know down in the
comments which Mouse you are currently
using if you enjoyed this content make
sure to leave a thumbs up down below
thanks as always for watching and I'll
catch you on the next episode later
