another video and today I've got some
New Age stuff you may have heard the
rumor that the next generation of iPhone
the iPhone 7 or Beyond may be ditching
the traditional headphone jack now calm
down I know there's a lot of people with
high-end audio gear that uses that Jack
and I feel your pain there is an upside
which is the fact that generally
speaking those little headphone
amplifiers on your phones are not that
great and this company Odyssey has come
out with what might be the first
high-end pair of headphones to bypass
the mini jack connector they have a
lightning connector so it goes straight
into the Lightning port what can happen
is the amp and DAC can be in the actual
headphone rather than the phone a way to
think about this is essentially in
bypassing that tiny little headphone
jack you can experience higher quality
audio from the source these are on
airplane are magnetic headphones this is
what that DAC / amp that I'm talking
about looks like our drivers are three
times larger for better bass and wide
frequency response interesting
handcrafted in Costa Mesa California
designed and built in the USA you don't
see that very often Jack okay so the
first thing you see this connector
presented to you that is an interesting
the way they've designed these little
guys to fit into each ear cup
here's your inline remote with
microphone and all the advanced
electronics the DAC the amp it's all
right in there here oh wow
those feel incredible that is some of
the softest leather I have ever felt on
a headphone in my entire life Wow
smooth mechanism no clicks what feels
like a suede carrying case Wow
handwritten certificate of authenticity
burned in as well headphones generally
get better as you listen to them longer
they've done that in advance for you so
they're good to go right out of the box
so we've also got an adapter and look at
this okay so you have the old-fashioned
mini jack
let's first test out this cable they
connect but then they kind of curve
around to follow the design line of the
actual headphone whoo so the app is now
open holy smokes
we got an equaliser straight away if you
don't like the signature of the
headphones so what simply go ahead and
switch it up
oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
sorry I'm just I'm enjoying I'm sure
like myself I would say detail the word
I want to use this detail I was trying
to think up the word as I was listening
there what was the word its detail punch
and detail that's how I want to describe
them you've still got the mini jack so
here's what we do now I need to blind
test it okay quickly change me to the
other the other connection okay this
this is the lightning yeah yeah there's
just a little more to it I don't know I
don't know how to describe it it's a
it's a little bit better but that said I
mean they say it sounds great on either
connector plus the genuine materials to
build construction I'm in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
