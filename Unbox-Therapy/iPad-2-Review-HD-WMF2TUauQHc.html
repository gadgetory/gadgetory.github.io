and today I'm gonna take a look at the
iPad 2 in depth I took my time I wanted
to play with it
before I came back to YouTube with my
review and that's just because it
wouldn't be responsible to do a review
without having used a device for a
number of days I'm gonna go over the
differences between this one in the
first one because you already know
enough about the first rather than
covering everything there is to cover
about the iPad I'm gonna cover the
differences so first and foremost this
one is supposed to be twice as fast is
it twice as fast I don't know it seems
like at this point there aren't any
applications that can really take
advantage of that dual-core processor
and that makes sense considering this
hasn't been available to developers
until now one thing I can tell you is
that in the web browser when launching
super heavy pages this one does seem
substantially quicker than the first one
that being said the first one was no
slouch and loading web pages is not
necessarily a scientific way of
determining just how fast a CPU is it
does tell you something but it's not
like a benchmark or anything like that
so as far as speed goes I don't think
we're going to be able to get an
accurate gauge on just how important it
is until we see some new applications
designed from the ground up to take
advantage of the dual core that being
said there is GarageBand in the new
iMovie and those might be as close as
we're gonna get for the time being as
far as being able to stress out this
dual core processor the next thing I
want to talk about is battery life and
as you'd imagine brightness has a huge
part to play on what to expect that
being said if I knock the brightness
down in half which is more than usable
I'm getting easy 10 hours out of it so
super impressed with the battery life at
the moment other than that the physical
design is what's seen the biggest
changes it's lighter its thinner as you
all know and one of the improvements
I've noticed because of the thinner
enclosure is the speed and accuracy that
I'm getting when doing portrait therm
typing because it's just that little bit
lighter and a little bit thinner my
thumb's are reaching to the center keys
on the keyboard substantially better I'm
going to take a look at a few
in this review there's some stuff that's
new out there and some stuff I'm just
impressed with this first one that
you've been looking at is called site
and it's a customized newsreader they
want to call it a magazine and what it
does is learn from what you like and
dislike so you can set it up with some
guidelines in the first place say you're
into tech or gadgets and then from there
as you like or dislike articles that
have been designated for you it starts
to improve its results based on your
history so I haven't used this for too
long but the concept seems incredible
and hopefully it does what it says it's
going to do so I think you should all
give it a try and report back and let me
know just how smart it is the next app
I'm gonna look at is called app start
and this is for all of you who haven't
had an iPad before and you want a crash
course as far as figuring it out this
app is going to teach you all the basics
from running your email client to
browsing the web to playing games etc so
if you haven't had an iPad before
definitely check this one out next thing
I'm gonna check out is the camera on the
device this is also one of the new
features to me not a super important
feature but it's there nonetheless
you've got a forward facing camera and a
backward facing camera and the purpose
of these is for FaceTime other than that
they don't serve much of a purpose I
guess the back camera could take quick
shots that you want to post to your
social networks or things like that but
this is going to be mostly used for
FaceTime or people who just want to
screw around in photobooth like I'm
doing right now the next thing I want to
cover is garage bed and I'm not really
going to do a full review I might do a
full review of GarageBand in the future
but this is one of those applications
that seems like it should have the
ability to stress out it's a new
dual-core processor since it's a
multitrack recorder you can set up a
bunch of tracks with different plugins
and effects on them that seems like
something that might stress out this
little baby but I'll report back on that
I think I'm gonna do a full GarageBand
review and I'm probably even going to
produce a whole beat just using
GarageBand in the iPad so so
right to the channel and stay tuned for
that you'll see what this little piece
of software is capable of at this point
I'm really impressed with it there's
nothing out there in this form factor
that's going to give you the production
tools that GarageBand gives you so for
whoever's out there that program this I
want to give them huge props that's a
real step forward as far as usability in
music production next we're going to
take a look at Google Earth and if
there's any app in the store from a
third party that could take advantage of
this new processing power this might be
it
as we all know it's a fairly resource
intensive application so let's take a
look when we type in a city here it
seems about the same at this point but
let's go ahead and try some multi-touch
gestures and see how it behaves so when
we zoom in we're getting immediate
feedback yeah that's really nice really
smooth in fact it actually does seem a
little bit snappier than on the previous
generation that being said there have
been a bunch of revisions to improve the
usability on the iPad for this
particular application but it feels
super smooth and I'm assuming that it
can benefit from the improved RAM and as
I've said a million times already in
this review the dual-core processor but
remember this app still runs good on the
original iPad you know it's gonna be
optimized to work with less processing
power so that's not gonna be a
deal-breaker I just wanted to give you
guys an idea of what to expect in some
of the core applications and
applications that you are likely going
to install as we all know we can run
Netflix on the iPad we're gonna be able
to stream you know some HD video on here
again we've got some improved graphics
performance you can see that it's no
match for the new processor streaming is
smooth the frame rate looks good so at
this point I'm impressed with this
device it's what I expected and then
some as everybody's been saying it's not
really a
revolution but more of an evolution now
I'm gonna go over some of my pros and
cons having used a device first and
foremost I'm impressed with it the iPad
is still easily the most smooth of all
the tablets available on the market
first the pros it's thinner lighter
faster as you all know it's got dual
cameras they're not the greatest but
they're there you have the option to buy
this model in white and black which may
not matter to some but having the option
is better than not the portrait thumb
typing is improved mostly because of the
thinness and lightness the battery life
is just as good as it used to be with
the improved power and the screen is
bright especially for an IPS display not
so great where the screen resolution
which is the same as the previous model
although it had been rumored that we
could expect to see a better resolution
on this model the Wi-Fi which is kind of
weird actually works better upside down
when using it in portrait mode apps
don't currently take advantage of the
dual-core processor and the camera
quality leaves a lot to be desired
especially when super tiny smartphones
can shoot decent pictures these days do
me a favor and visit the channel there's
a lot of cool stuff to take a look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
