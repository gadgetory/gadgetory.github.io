therapy and today we're taking a look at
the new airport time capsule from Apple
this is the 3 terabyte version but it's
also available in a 2 terabyte model if
you're interested in pricing and
availability the links will be in the
description as usual what you're looking
at is an all-in-one device that acts as
your wireless router featuring dual band
802 11 AC which offers up greater
performance and extended range over the
previous version time capsule or airport
extreme for that matter but that's not
the whole story the reason you will
likely purchase a time capsule is
because you're looking for a backup
device in this case you get three
terabytes of storage in order to backup
all of these systems on your network
whether that be laptops desktops or
otherwise so that's a really nice
feature especially for people who
constantly forget to backup locally this
will happen in the background wirelessly
and you can schedule it to happen
whenever you please it's a very unique
looking device in terms of networking
equipment it's changed quite a bit from
the previous version it is now taller
and slightly more slender hopefully this
has something to do with the improved
performance I don't know I'd like to
think that's the reason it's shaped this
way on the back you have three Ethernet
ports as well as a LAN port for
inputting your modem into this device
and then you have a USB port now that's
going to be used for sharing USB devices
whether that's more storage USB thumb
drive or a printer a USB printer that
isn't otherwise networkable you can also
share that inside the box there's not
too much else you have your power cable
as well as a little bit of paperwork
from Apple you don't have any Apple
stickers in this particular case but
that's not such a big deal I've got
enough of those anyways so there's your
device the brand-new time capsule from
Apple as I said before available in
three terabyte and two terabyte version
if you by the airport extreme it looks
very very similar but of course it won't
include that internal storage for that
wireless backup now myself I'm sort of
you know backing up to a number of
different devices in order to be
incredibly redundant because I do a lot
of work on my systems so likely I will
have dual backups I'll have a wireless
backup going to the time capsule and
then I'll also keep a wire
back up going to a wired USB Drive or
something along those lines in order to
make sure that I've got my data in a
couple of different locations anyway
