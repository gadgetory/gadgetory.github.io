therapy and today we're taking a look at
the shure SRH 750 DJ headphones quick
disclaimer I am NOT a DJ nor have I ever
claimed to be but hopefully these sure
headphones can find some good use with
my iPad and my macbook pro anyhow we've
got a fairly straightforward package
here regular cardboard box and some
instructions it looks like a basic
manual hard to believe you need a manual
in order to figure out how to listen to
headphones but it can't hurt next we've
got the headphones themselves along with
all of the cables and adapter and some
other accessories looks like we get some
extra ear pieces I guess that's for the
potential breakdown of the original ones
at the wear these things a lot and of
course we got our quarter inch adapter
hooking this thing up to audio
interfaces or mixing boards or however
you want to use it so first things first
these have some good weight to them and
what looks like some decent build
quality for sure of course I haven't
heard them yet but from here they look
pretty decent the cups obviously twists
just like on all DJ style headphones so
next we've got the cable and you can see
it's the bungee style which is nice and
you got gold connectors and I noticed
that one of these connectors here has a
thread on it and that's probably for
that adapter now I've had adapters in
the past but rather than screw on they
just clip on and the screw on is going
to be more secure assuming that you want
to use that quarter inch adapter more
often than the mini jack next we've got
our extra ear pieces here I guess
they're not ear pieces ear cushions and
like I said I assume those are just for
replacement at some point of the
originals we've also got a little vinyl
bag I suppose if you want to travel with
these
so so far they look pretty good another
thing they've got a locking mechanism
here for the cable which is cool anyway
