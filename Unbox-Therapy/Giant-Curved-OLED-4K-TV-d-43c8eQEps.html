TV so let's get into it what's up guys
Lew here back with another video and
this is a big thing you can tell it's an
OLED TV if you don't know about OLED I
feel bad for you you get the deepest
blacks in say no contrast and color
saturation and whatnot this is a 65 inch
it's got a little curve to it it's
incredibly slim and because it's OLED
you can check it out from any angle and
you have no color shift LG sent this out
to me they're like Lou we want you to
check it out we want you to share it
with your people 4k as well you guys
know I upload all my videos in 4k so
maybe we should check out what unbox
therapy looks like on this beast anyhow
let's get inside the box that's what
you're here for
something about opening a new TV trying
do this as elegant as possible
it is amazing how thin this thing is I
mean as as thin as I could see a display
getting a I'm not sure this next part is
the one is a one-man job thanks to the
help of Jack it's now resting here
here's the remote
along with batteries and it looks like a
standard remote that's what's cool about
it if you want to pick it up and use it
as a standard remote or maybe your
grandma wants to pick it up you know
watch some unsolved mysteries you guys
know one time but you remember that oh
you're a new age type dude you want to
zoom around the web you want to do all
those multimedia things you could do
that too hardware as I guessed little
breakout cable for component input I'll
be using HDMI breakout for composite
input some glasses as well let me open
this up this TV features passive 3d so
you don't need power glasses so they're
gonna be super light some clip-ons
bouncing Hardware I'm gonna mount the
base now and actually give birth while
LG gave birth to the TV not me but okay
so I've got the TV set up now and to be
honest it's striking like once you've
got it in front of you on the stand with
the curve it's um I don't know the both
of us were kind of like wow look at this
so as I mentioned before this is kind of
like a mouse to move around the screen
and this little sleeping dude here needs
to be woken up apparently whoa Ethernet
or Wi-Fi built right in so I'll use
Wi-Fi so you got this LG content store
here here you can see some of the apps
YouTube Netflix important Cineplex of
course if you go back to your home here
you can navigate down here which is
pretty cool Spotify live TV as I said
there's a built-in web browser smart
share this allows you to share to this
display from your
why not let me go ahead and I'm gonna
log into YouTube really quick this video
I'm about to show you is one of my
favorites recently what do you about the
black levels Jack Fuu let's let's let's
check out the volume here
it's amazing that this is YouTube this
is streaming off you YouTube right now
there's something about OLED where it's
almost like your brain is telling you oh
this is the way it's always supposed to
it should have always looked I do want
to see the 4k that was provided to me
actually on a USB key which I know is 60
megabit per second bitrate
so this is a good way I mean this is
obviously why they've included it on a
USB Drive to sort of check out the range
the potential range of what this display
is capable of
we should talk real quick about the
ports on this thing because that's going
to be of interest to I assume so over
here on the side we've got all of our
ports an audio output standard mini Jack
output there's a few USB s including one
USB 3.0 a few HDMI s as well three in
this location and then on the bottom is
the rest of your i/o you have an antenna
/ cable in there's a digital optical out
for audio again and then there are the
two breakout sections if you want to use
component or composite and then lastly
there's a land port if you don't want to
use Wi-Fi if you prefer to use a wired
internet connection for a little unbox
therapy up there good call
unbox therapy that was fast
it is it good it's incredible right
unboxing that's the best I've ever seen
in one of our videos what that's the
best for somebody like me to be shooting
in 4k where it can't be enjoyed in 4k
now you can turn this on and without too
much effort at all we enjoying true 4k
content what's the weather you see the
weather network YouTube videos you
should probably get out there take a
look at this thing and have the
experience for yourself
so before I take off LG is actually
hosting a sweepstakes so you might be
able to win one of these I definitely
check out the link in the description so
you can participate so there you have it
a 65 inch OLED TV from LG
my first OLED TV as you can tell I'm
excited to throw different sources at it
and see exactly how it handles them but
so far it's been pretty damn impressive
