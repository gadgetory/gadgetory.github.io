another video and once again it is three
cool tech deals I've got some
interesting ones for you today and I've
also got an honorable mention which
means four items four items on three
cool tech deals not a math problem just
a little extra so to get it started off
it's a cable yes not the most exciting
thing in the world but this one is a
little bit different to micro USB cable
you can see it's braided at 6.6 feet
long but it's reversible the USB
connector itself as you can see here in
this image has both side available the
next image you'll see reversible USB
port both sides can be cert in not
insert cert in so you guys know how much
I love these translations sorry it does
support quick charge 2.0 amps it's $7 a
reversible micro USB cable you probably
need an extra one anyways so why not
move forward move up in the world
reverse it next we're gonna move up in
price a little bit
this one is $26 it's pretty cool though
it looks fairly unassuming at first this
is called the stream bot which is a
two-in-one
wireless Bluetooth audio music streaming
switchable transmitter and receiver
that's a lot of words essentially this
will take your audio gear and turn it
into a wireless Bluetooth capable what's
special about this one is it can work as
a receiver or a transmitter now let me
give you a couple of scenarios say
you've got a car that doesn't have
bluetooth but you have an auxilary in
all of a sudden now you use this little
dangler with an e 3.5 milk and now you
have Bluetooth in your stereo simply
switch to your auxiliary port stream
from your phone to this device just
upgraded your car and it cost you twenty
five dollars
so it'll run off its own rechargeable
battery but of course you could leave
this plugged in depending on your
application think of it as taking your
old-school audio tech and moving it
forward into the new decade century I
don't know transmitting and receiving 26
bucks stream bot that's what you're here
for
next up a little bit more expensive than
usual coming in at five hundred and
fifty dollars and right now you're
saying Lou this this isn't right for
three cool tech deals you know you're
getting a little too intense on us here
but this is a good deal this is a 4k
television 49 inch for 550 bucks list
price way higher I looked around other
places on the web it's tough to find a
50 inch or close to it
4k television for 550 bucks so
discounted fairly heavily thought that I
needed to bring it to you it's an lg tv
you can see it has the smart features
built-in as well probably thin maybe
it's time you started watching unbox
therapy videos in 4k because yes we do
produce them in 4k as some of you know
could be enjoyed on a panel like this
maybe you've been holding off now might
be the time 550 bucks so there you have
it big 4k panel now for the honorable
mention this is a rocket I know why a
rocket because it's cool it certainly
satisfies the cool part of the cool
deals and it's only 20 bucks and who
doesn't want to launch a rocket this is
gonna be fun for a moment for an hour
for two who knows you could get refills
for it and maybe you can become a an
astronaut if you were a youngster this
is how you get started it's two
high-flying model rockets the crossfire
flies to over eleven hundred and fifty
feet the other one which looks a little
bit larger the Amazon it looks like yeah
this guy over here that will go to about
600 feet with the launch system included
20 bucks could be a cool little
experiment you can't get refills for it
after the fact so I figured I just throw
it in there the s des
1469 tandem X launch set yeah it's a
rocket three cool tech deals thumbs up
