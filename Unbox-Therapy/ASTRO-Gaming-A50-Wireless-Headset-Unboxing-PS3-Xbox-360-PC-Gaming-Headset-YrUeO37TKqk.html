therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Astro a50 wireless gaming headset
and mix amp this headset builds on the
success that Astro had with the previous
generation the a40 it's still for sale
as well if you're interested in pricing
and availability on this model I've got
links down in the description so you can
go check that out the a 50 is a new
incarnation it features 5.8 gigahertz
wireless technology which is operating
at a higher frequency than most wireless
devices this means you get better range
then you could previously get on other
headsets on the marketplace you've also
got dolby digital 7.1 so you're going to
have full surround sound emulation
that's achieved by sending digital
signals from your console or PC to the
mix amp which then sends that signal out
to the wireless headset so unlike the a
40s the module can live right near your
console instead of having to come with
you to the couch here is the mix amp
that I was talking about earlier and as
you can see it's fairly simple there's
only two buttons on the device you have
power followed by a headphone sync
button and as I flip around the device
to the back you'll notice all the inputs
and outputs so since this does feature
Dolby Digital 7.1 you're going to rely
on digital connectors or digital
connections in order to feed that signal
in on the back you've also got a couple
of USBs the reason being is that the
headset actually charges through this
module so you're not going to need to
use a separate power brick and then this
module just plugs right into your
console very simple very straightforward
a nice design feature in my opinion now
moving forward with the unboxing we get
to see a little bit of paperwork from
Astro including a QuickStart guide and
some artwork the guide is pretty
straightforward it mostly explains how
to set up the stand that your headset is
going to live on yes it does include a
stand which is a nice touch especially
for a headset at this price point the
stand also functions as a home for your
mix amp it lives down on the base so the
idea here is that you put your stand
beside your console you put your headset
up there when you're not using it and
that way you always know where it is
you're not going to leave it lying
somewhere that you won't be able to find
it in terms of cables they've really
included everything here that you need
to get started you have an auxilary
cable which is a standard 3.5 mill
connecter you've also got a couple of
USB cables that's because the module
features both USB connection to the
console as well as a USB connection to
the headset to charge it I believe I
said that earlier you've also got an
optical cable a digital cable this is
going to be used for pumping that
beautiful 7.1 Dolby signal from your
console to the module so there are a
couple more components included in the
unboxing I'm going to jump off camera
and build the actual stand and then I'll
come back after putting the headset on
so you get a better idea of how it looks
once it's completed so here it is as you
can see a pretty good look all around a
nice thing to have standing beside your
console and as I said earlier a nice way
to make sure your headset is always in
one place and you're not going to
misplace it something to mention about
the boom mic is when you lift it up it
will automatically mute so it
understands that if you lift it up and
out of the way you probably don't want
to use it so you don't require a
separate mute button for that
functionality as you guys can see the
headset has a very unique design and you
can tell that it's probably top end in
terms of performance just looking at the
design here they are very lightweight
adjustable and that means you're going
to be able to wear them for long gaming
sessions there are controls on the side
of the ear cup you have adjustment for
voice volume as well as game volume so
you can find the perfect mix that you
like to play with anyway guys as you can
tell this is a pretty exciting pretty
cool headset can't wait to actually use
it and test it out if you guys enjoyed
