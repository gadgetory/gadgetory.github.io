another video and today as you can tell
I'm out of the usual setting I'm out
here in the bigger space because we're
looking at a bigger thing now this box
is not huge but the thing that came
inside of it is it's actually four feet
tall
his name is mechanoid now this is not
for the faint of heart this is for real
enthusiasts that want to dig in and
build something you can program him to
say different things do different
movements he can mimic your movements
there's an app that allows for you to
take it to the next level to take your
relationship to the next level he speaks
a number of different languages so you
can plug them in via USB and pick the
language that's right for you you can
build him using these components into a
number of different things including
this little dinosaur here or a little
droid that moves around and picks up
various object and sometimes he sneaks
up on you as well not creepy at all okay
a little bit creepy
I can't wait so here he is and as you
can tell he's made up of a number of
different parts and components once he's
built there's a number of different ways
that you can use it you can interact
using these buttons here to put him in a
number of different modes this is where
you would put a phone for example if you
want to use the app and have him mimic
your movement in the shoulder here this
will pivot a couple ways and in the
elbow down below he's actually got
wheels so he can move around pretty
quickly his head also moves another
couple motors here that allow his eyes
his head to sort of pivot a couple
different ways and on the back this
allows you to switch him between robot
and drone mode
you get the idea as I mentioned you can
interact with him a couple of different
ways either be a voice for the
microphone here these buttons or the app
if I launch into this section here you
can see there's various controls you can
basically just grab hold of these
control points like that whoops and have
him do something specifically and then
it records that as a programmed sequence
okay so it's now in motion capture mode
there's got me there now I'll do a
countdown and then he'll try to mimic my
movement see there you go hands up and
down all the way down ah he's doing
better with me standing that makes sense
- arms up and then back down I'm gonna
disconnect him from the app and show you
what he does in the absence of the app
unbox therapy you have him roll up on
your friends and say something funny you
know where I'm going with that you know
I'm going dead tell me a joke
forward forward forward forward forward
dance
high-five hashtag best day ever
okay don't go to see yet walk with me
so there you have it
mechanoid a personal four-foot robot
dude this thing is as much about the
project and building it building
something that actually interacts as it
is about the experience of that
interaction I don't maybe you're looking
for a project to do with your kid and
your kid is showing an interest in this
kind of you know this kind of project
then that that that might make sense for
you you know the one thing that we
didn't show them jack was him doing the
tango with my favorite dance
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
