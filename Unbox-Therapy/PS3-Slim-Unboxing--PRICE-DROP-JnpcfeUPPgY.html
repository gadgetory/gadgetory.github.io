therapy and today we're looking at the
ps3 slim the 160 gigabyte model at the
new lower price point of course 249 now
at least where I'm at and it represents
a real nice value if you're holding on
to one of those classics with that tiny
harddrive this this is a lot nicer with
a lot more Headroom now I'm actually
rocking an old-school 20 gigabyte model
the very first ps3 that hit the market
the fad model as people like to call it
in a door I'm not going to toss that one
out this one's going to live elsewhere
in the house and I'm going to upgrade
the hard drive on that one I picked up a
one terabyte laptop size drive for that
old model so I'm never gonna have to
worry about game saves and game data
ever again I got sick of the leading old
stuff every time so definitely stick
around for that
there's actually a very special Western
Digital Drive you've got to pick up
because the original 1tb laptop drive
that they manufactured was 12
millimeters this one is less I'll talk
about it in the next video I'll cover
everything you need to know but let's
talk about this unboxing because it's
happening right in front of you mom
let's get through the paperwork I mean
you don't care about dead anyways right
the other items we've got a DualShock 3
controller I'm pretty sure everybody on
a planet has seen one of these by this
point and I mean it's very
straightforward you got your button
layout on the front mini USB on the top
for charging it and of course the
DualShock 3 designation I've got a bunch
of these things lying around and then
we've got our cables to get to get this
baby connected we got a nice little
power cable not a big gigantic power
brick not looking at you Xbox and this
pieces we have all we ever get are
composite cables yellow white and red
classic cables throw in an HDMI for us
bite the bullet it's a few dollars for
you I'm not going to buy your official
accessory goddammit sorry
and then there's a USB cable for
charging that single DualShock 3
controller now the unit on the front has
2 USBS that's one downside the fat model
as we like to call it had 4 on it and on
the front you get a couple of touch
sensitive buttons for control
that blu-ray drive of course now the
back of unions where everything else
connects we've got an Ethernet port
followed by HDMI we've got optical audio
if you so desire to use it we've got
regular standard AV and of course the
power connection the rest of the unit is
pretty basic now here is that one
terabyte drive that I talked about the
one that you need to get if you want to
throw it in your ps3 but I shouldn't
speak too soon I'm gonna throw that in
in the next video you guys can follow
along with me and hopefully we'll see if
everything works out anyway guys if you
