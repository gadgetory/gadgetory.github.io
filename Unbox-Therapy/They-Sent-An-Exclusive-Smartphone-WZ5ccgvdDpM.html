leagues now brother you're behind the
lens we got big calm on the camera today
all right you got to give this guy some
love Jack's gonna be so mad so what do
we have today I'm told it's a new and
special smartphone from Huawei but
beyond that I don't know why the box is
so big I don't know what's so special I
know in the past we've done some pretty
cool unboxing experiences there was that
briefcase they said it was like a secret
agent style briefcase for the p9 maybe
they're trying to step it up a notch I
know that Tom knows what's going on here
but I was like don't show me keep it a
secret let's find out exactly what's
happening on camera with the audience so
let's crack this open and see what's
happening here
like I said a box this large for a
smartphone you know something's up you
know something's going on hopeful four
four four
unbox therapy carved into a wooden crate
oh that smell is fresh real fresh what
is that
cedar I don't know I don't know much
about wood but wood is good there's
buttons on the front Golding buttons oh
man it's about to be a pulp fiction
moment right here that's the way I
prefer I don't want to know Jimmy does
give me this flash three two one oh whoa
the way that thing jumped up I think I
could do that all day but I draw oh
there's a brand new Huawei p10 in there
this is one of a kind a one of a kind
unboxing experience ah the Huawei p10 I
don't know am I like the first person in
the world to have this right now quite
possibly and just like the p9 we've got
the like affiliation on the door
camera system as well let's hit this
baby open this one is like oh oh that's
cool on its own with magnets oh I get
excited about the weirdest thing well
you know that that's why you're watching
it whoo oh I got it in the blue again
you love the sound effect here whoa what
is this finish on the back can you tell
it's almost like that kind of
holographic is that the right
terminology holographic that is cool
now the entire body feels metallic to me
but it's like polished it almost feels
like ceramic or something as you look
around the device you'll notice here you
have a USB type-c connector traditional
headphone jack some people are looking
for something I like to see done here
with the power switch the lock switch
it's got a kind of texture to it so you
can tell the difference in your pocket
between the volume rocker and that
switch I also noticed it's got a red
accent on there hopefully Tom can pick
that up
do you see that red there listen to this
you hear that so they add back the grip
on the very back of the device where
you're going to be holding it all right
let's put this to the side for a moment
look at the other items inside the box a
sim tool once again you have dual SIM
tray you can have either two SIM cards
for different regions different carriers
whatever you want or you can have one
SIM card and a micro SD card in there to
expand your storage
I really wish every manufacturer just
has this tray right here
oh they included a case interesting so
you don't see that all the time and it
keeps the pattern on the back let's try
it on you don't have to go out and buy a
case if you're the type of person we
like to keep the case on it they've got
one in the box it's a nice little touch
dual lens secondary microphone dual tone
flash laser sensor and they've also
included a headset it's kind of a pod
style you know what I'm saying you have
a USB type-c cable supercharged power
brick so that's going to be a quick
charge compatible
to get used to your phone more quickly I
just notices his SwiftKey installed to
the keyboard I don't know if I've seen
that before not pre-installed at least
so this is the fingerprint scanner now
ok so here we go I'm going to just
enroll it here alright let's test out
that scanner whoa wait a sec whoa whoa
I'm gonna be the fastest it's like it's
there zero lag it just Oh as you can see
here we have a very unique look it's
kind of in line with the design of the
device especially with this color now
let's go ahead and launch the camera
there's a number of options in here you
swipe over to this side there's the
photo mode the monochrome mode course
video night shot light painting there's
a lot that you can do in here regardless
of what you're trying to do creatively
like there's a few different ways of
doing that within this particular app
obviously we're going to do a perfect
selfie I always wonder how they're going
to make this look beautiful I'm always a
little bit concerned oh my goodness calm
look at this man right here you are we
still able to hang out after this if
that's the guy right there okay so
obviously with these features the
intention is not to go overboard
alright manage your beauty mode
accordingly maybe a couple notches I
know you guys tech head and so on are
going to be far more interested in the
main camera so this camera is where
things get interesting if I click this
little button and enable the wide
aperture you might be wondering like why
what is this area that's InFocus
out-of-focus why would I want some kind
of feature like that well the goal for a
lot of people in working with depth of
fields is to concentrate your focus when
you look at an image at a particular
section of that image so controlling
depth of field allows you to do that
says oh here's what I want you to look
at it's the camera right here as opposed
to all the clutter and other things that
exist out here you can kind of like just
just narrow in the person's focus on
where you want them to look again it's a
subjective thing like how much of it is
too much too little but the goal with
these dual lens systems is to
essentially give you a feature that was
previously only available on law
urghhh cameras you know digital SLRs
where you have to install a giant
aperture big piece of glass on the end
of it in order to create those kinds of
effects now obviously you're not going
to stick that in your pocket so
manufacturers have found a way with
these dual lens systems to create a
similar effect adding features like this
just changes the way that people think
about photos it's not just like pull it
out and snap it like all of a sudden now
you're out in nature you're like looking
at some tree bark you're you're a
professional you're an instant
professional guy like Tom could do it
okay maybe not
this is pretty cool you can you can go
into a pro video mode a couple of
different autofocus modes and you can
even go into manual focus on video on a
phone which is pretty cool in camera
automatic video and I'm going to move in
here ever so slightly alright so what
are the takeaways here you got a cool
camera system dual lens system building
on top of what happened with the p9 now
in the p10 with a slightly different
look to it as well some of those same
cool features protected in this device
including the shallow depth of field
that you can create and now you have
this completely different texture that
I've never seen before on a smartphone
it's got an octa-core processor in it
which is also going to make it snappy er
than the previous version and when it
comes to quickness I mean the
fingerprint thing that's like it's
instantaneous look at this
ding-ding-ding-ding so they have it the
p10 unveiled on unbox therapy shout out
to wall way not just for letting me look
at this early but also sending it out in
such a cool look at this thing you
kidding me this step in the game up
everybody else did you want to send me
something I want fresh wood there's
still maple syrup dripping off of you
the key to my heart and they know it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
