therapy and today we're taking a look at
Batman Arkham City this is the
collector's edition because that's just
how we roll here on unbox therapy picked
it up at the midnight launch so it is
227 a.m. Eastern Time at the time of
this filming yes another late night for
Lou from unbox therapy doing it for you
guys want to get this content out as
soon as the products come out and I want
to get this baby naked for you because
that's what we do here you guys know the
drill you know the slogan it's unbox
therapy where products get what put it
down in the comments you know exactly
how it goes anyway guys let's talk about
the unboxing here real nice-looking box
on the interior this little deal flaps
open and you get a quick look at what's
inside the first thing we had was what
looks like an art book and then we've
got the figurine got this little drawer
on the front which reveals all of the
DLC love we got our manual in a couple
of different languages or a few
different languages I should say first
DLC piece here is the iceberg lounge
challenge map you've also got the
ability to play as Catwoman that's a
download you get the Gotham City
Impostors beta free online beta trial as
well as the Dark Knight Returns skin so
lots of DLC in there you've also got the
music from the game the album Arkham
City the album that's downloadable so
was just a piece of cardboard and then
you've got an animated original movie
Batman Gotham Knight pretty cool so lots
of nice stuff in here you get some stuff
for your hard earned cash here's just a
warning caution sharp points on the
figurine stay away from the sharp points
don't hurt yourself so I noticed
something else on the box when I got a
closer look at the back side you've also
got to face on there to go with the
Joker and Batman of course now let me
see if I can wrangle this figurine out
of here it's always quite the headache
to do so they got those little twist
ties and whatnot but I actually really
like this one it's not too complicated
there's not as many things going on and
say the Gears of War figurine that I
recently unboxed but it's nice you know
it's
it's a more basic you know just
straightforward it's Batman you know
Batman is badass on his own he's need a
gun or anything like that so here's a
closer look at the details I'm really
impressed and I believe I'll give you a
look at the manufacturer down on the
bottom here you can see it's the Arkham
City collector's edition statue
Rocksteady the developer and it's
manufactured by let me see kotobukiya
right Kotobukiya yeah let's go with that
so obviously a Japanese company Japanese
name made in China of course regardless
of where it was designed so here's a
look at the artwork you guys know I like
these our books helps you to appreciate
the amount of work that goes into these
games and this one is special because it
actually houses your game discs too so
it's doing double duty and it's a cool
way to keep your game you know it makes
you want to look through this every so
often so definitely some impressive
stuff in here some real nice colors I'm
really liking the art direction that
this game is taking I've heard a lot of
good things about this series I'm
actually new to it believe it or not
anyway guys it's time for me to go to
bed it's time for Liu to hit the sack if
