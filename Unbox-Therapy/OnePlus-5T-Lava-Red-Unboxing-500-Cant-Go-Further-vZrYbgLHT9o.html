I'm sure many of you know that follow me
on social media follow lungs over here
he's over there in Vegas I filmed one of
my favorite videos I got together a
bunch of prominent people in the tech
community here on YouTube put them on
the spot I said what phone is in your
pocket what ensued was just a lot of fun
it was interesting it got me thinking
all of us in that video I mean it really
wasn't there wasn't a lot of variants
right there were two phones that were
selected as the pocket phones for that
group of people for three pixel to excel
to the iPhone 10 I guess I just spoiled
the video but I don't I don't I don't I
don't in that space we are not
representative of the entire globe and
as I've said in past videos we certainly
are not representative of the value
choices that exist in smartphones
because for the most part we get
incredible access to this stuff it's
hard to fully understand the mindset of
different parts of the world or people
who are restricted in that sense and
simply aren't looking at $1000 phones
and so that brings me to today's video
it brings me to what is likely my
favorite phone at about half the price
point of other flagships and that's this
one right here the 1 + 5 t world's first
the exclusive unboxing video of this
color let's take a look from the front
looks a lot like any other but when you
pop it out of here
the vibrance of the very first red phone
from oneplus this is called lava red in
conjunction with the sandstone white and
of course the original black color also
in the box you're pretty used to this by
this point a case that they include
which is great you have the - charge
brick and then of course one plus USB
type-c cable to charge it up which in
this case look at that it's a little
it's matching its the red on red action
now I know what you're thinking all
right you say Lou I don't get it it's
just another color what's the big deal
and you're right like that's completely
fair but because of this new color this
new release I thought it'd be an
interesting opportunity to sort of recap
some of my thoughts on the value
smartphone space especially as a
follow-up to the last video that we
published and yes of course I remember
the iPhone video where they came out
with a red version and I was like what's
the big deal well
we doing but because this one is coming
out relatively close to the launch of
the original I feel like it's a little
bit more prominent so it's the lava red
it's the sandstone white the dedicated
red button and then the other buttons
done in black this one is a little bit
more grippy whereas this version here a
little bit more polished and then don't
forget Star Wars version which I made a
video one really cool unboxing
experience of course if you're powered
on you're getting the Star Wars branding
you're getting some wallpapers as well
as a slightly different interface here
to match the color scheme then of course
the original midnight black depending on
the lighting it kind of turns a little
more grey a couple of sandstone and a
couple of anodized finishes so that's
the 5 T in lava red the latest addition
to the 5 T family and as I said earlier
in this video I think this is a great
opportunity for me to recap some of my
feelings about this device going into
2018 so this device here in my last
video I mentioned I've been using it
it's the pixel 2 XL fantastic camera
stock Android experience and so on while
this device is not $1,000 it's still
relatively expensive at 850 know that
the 5 T comes in at $4.99 so a question
that should probably be asked more often
is which is the value point is this
thing worth almost twice as much as this
one and just like I did in my iPhone 10
video I had to really think about now
granted this one doesn't go all the way
to a thousand so it's a slightly
different evaluation for me personally I
think the takeaway here is that at least
with these two devices I'd have no
problem recommending either and having
switched over and used the pixel to
excel for an extensive period now there
are actually a few things that I miss
from the 5t the face on lock on a 5 T is
unbelievable it is rapid it is seamless
there's no gesture no swipe like there
is on the iPhone 10 now I understand you
can't compare those two devices one to
one because the technology they're using
for face unlock is different but
ultimately for me I feel like it comes
back to user experience and when
technology is seamless and invisible
that's when it's at its best so the face
unlock is incredible under but if you're
not into that guess what options are
good you still have the finger
sensor here which is incredibly quick as
well add on to that and experience is
very similar to stop Android and now you
can start to understand why even at 499
this is one of my favorite phones out
there now the color here with the lava
red that really shouldn't be the
motivating factor of course choices are
good and generally speaking multiple
options is something we only see or at
least frequently see in the premium
space it's actually kind of nice to see
options emerging at the $4.99 price
point color wise style wise and so on
and even limited editions like the Star
Wars one another thing I'm missing about
the 5c having used the pixel 2 XL now
the headphone jack I'm on an airplane
sure I got the wireless ones but then
you know the adapter remember the
adapter you switch the adapter you
switch phones frequently and so on I
mean I don't need to tell you we've had
this conversation about headphone jacks
in the past but the 5 T has it that's
that's the bottom line
pixel to Excel doesn't iPhone 10 doesn't
think about it it's there and then the
last thing that I missed from this
device having switched over is of course
this dedicated switch the textured
switch on the side to allow you to
quickly switch between three different
notification modes from do-not-disturb
to silent to the audio ring and so on
that's convenient it's added
functionality in the pixel choo XL
doesn't have so as you can tell my love
for the 5c has not shifted even though
in the last video I said the pixel to
excel was the one that's in my pocket I
think I'd be a perfectly happy man using
either of these 2 devices although for
my taste I would probably stick to the
midnight black listen no camera on the
planet on a smartphone can touch the
pixel 2 XL right now all right you heard
that from me you've heard that from
others but if you're on a budget and you
want something close and you want
something that actually has some
functionality that the pixel 2 XL does
it I mean you need to be looking real
hard real long and hard at the 5 T now
available in some extra colors there it
is revisited the 5 T possibly probably
the best $500 phone on the planet right
now think about it
this episode of unbox the P has been
brought to you by this chair yes that's
right the Novo xt
from human touch I don't know is it the
world's greatest massage chair probably
I'm somewhere in outer space right now
have I ever felt this good before this
young probably not the lower back the
calf muscle
you know this unboxing life it takes its
toll on something like this well it's a
game changer
it's certainly around here now if the
Novo x key is a little out of your price
range you can also check out the I joy
massage anywhere or the I joy active 2.0
massage chair these are more affordable
options that will still leave you
feeling like a new man or woman
thanks again a human touch for
sponsoring this episode and making me
feel at least 10 years younger I might
not look it but I feel it
I'll have the relevant links down in the
description you need to you need to
think real serious about this one good
luck and so well</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
