aficionado in the Lenovo laptop
department cuz I've been analyzing
inspecting all of them the latest ones
the older ones I've been kind of
sticking to one category which is the x1
carbon I mean I just
Iza it was what I wanted then light but
alongside that this one launched as well
and I was like maybe this could be
interesting as well maybe even more
interesting I'm not really sure so this
is the yoga version and it's the 4th
generation it essentially takes
everything you like about the x1 carbon
and then gives you a rotating display so
it sort of becomes a tablet because it
has to house that extra capability in
there it's a bit heavier so this is like
3 pounds that one's like 2 and a half I
think that trade-off might be worthwhile
to a number of people the other thing
that happens here the construction
materials are different again to support
that slightly different behavior let's
check it out for ourselves what's an
aside uh not much one thing I appreciate
is they they continued to kind of zero
in on these like slight improvements
that people find a like these series of
laptops they just go in and mod them as
much as they need to oh they got the
adapter cables as well in your power
brick looks exactly the same yes 65 watt
there's a pen included so like I said
that's your preferred input method or
maybe even just from time to time
actually closer to typical pen category
than it may look at first glance drawing
sketching productivity documents
circling HDMI to VGA what I like about
this is this color this kind of dark
grey a lot of people sort of think that
aluminium and laptops corresponds with
quality I don't disagree to some that
don't know exactly what they're touching
the carbon weave and so on it could feel
like plastic there's no mistaking this
construction it's cool to the touch you
know you're dealing with metal I can
tell right away it is a bit heavier
though as a consequence of that
immediately you can tell the hinges are
different that's because it can fold all
the way back the power switch is moved
over to this side you have a USB a port
there's a lockdown section over here
this is where the pen goes I might as
well
oh that's too easy okay nice little spot
for for the pen so to pop it out what do
you do you just that's it
simple this it's out of the way but it's
there when you want it so that's kind of
a nice implementation headphone jack a
full-sized HDMI port another USB a port
and then you have to type C for its
supporting Thunderbolt 3 pretty cool so
far
I don't know am I converting it's quite
possible can I open it up without the
thing tilting back that's what the old
laptops did hopefully this one doesn't
ooh jack it almost does it it's so close
it's a two-handed operation you got a
hold here okay open it up let's be clear
hi and look at that you're bending you
can't bend like that Jack you see you
see you got no flexibility I'm
converting to this one now I'm
converting laptops too frequently
laptops are turning their smartphones
for me the meme factory is out here
producing we have a speaker grille along
the top right in this location here I
hope it sounds good it does have the
Dolby Atmos badge it's my favorite thing
about the newest version of the carbon
version of this laptop is it sounds so
much better I think one of the benefits
of having a slightly heavier laptop
using aluminum here is this baby feels
planted and I'm telling you right now
the quick brown fox never felt so good
because I feel like this construction
might actually take this keyboard to
another level
it feels very high quality and you know
I'm just gonna say something right now I
feel like this trackpad material might
be a bit different cuz this is very
smooth
look at this ready goes all the way boom
alright now that's what you're paying
for you see that right there I'm not
even joking me if you're tight for space
you your watching the video you're
trying to eat your breakfast cereal Jack
you see you put that there you got
nothing in front it is the 4k display
mr. Willie do that's 417 it's so it's a
slight toggle back on the Nick counter
from the car because that was 500 nits
right but still touchscreen pretty
responsive there touch scroll it's the
pen is so much better obviously for
touchscreen I'm kind of a fan of it it's
the wobble might get to you though
it's quite this quite a wobble pen input
is probably gonna happen more like this
and I'm gonna have it I'm gonna have it
flipped around like this and I'm gonna
be you know tapping like this in which
case wobble is gone
I believe this used to be called inking
once upon a time so like if I did on box
box I think a lot of people can be cross
shopping this versus the regular x1
carbon as you would write your like
specs are the same the same chipset
you're looking at the same options for
RAM for storage now you're gonna notice
it's got a chin on it you see like right
here you've got a fairly significant
chin on it oh wow
you can block the you can block the
front-facing camera with this little
tiny barely there switch here we go full
volume
we're so aware of it now sort of started
the knotch trend or at least was was
there at the forefront popularized it I
would say it's body pretty terrible I
don't know it's usable it's not blowing
me away maybe I think I think part of
the reason I had such a reaction on the
regular x1 carbon was because of how bad
the 6th generation and before that were
from a sound perspective this is in your
typical region in the right range for
this sound you would expect out of a
laptop I've heard louder what can I say
about this device what's already great
about the laptop I've been using for a
while now the standard x1 carbon it adds
to it a slightly nicer trackpad in my
opinion different materials you go the
aluminum route you get the flipping
screen you get the pen input maybe you
can't see yourself using that very much
but you want to have it you want to have
the option the potential to go that
direction this one gives it to you the
displays for me are comparable the sound
is comparable performance is gonna be
comparable I'm gonna see I'm gonna try
I'm gonna see but right now I'm feeling
like this particular model could
displace even as much as I liked the
current carbon it's my first experience
with the yoga
I am gonna switch it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
