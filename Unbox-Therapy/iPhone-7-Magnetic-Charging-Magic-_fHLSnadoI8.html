that brand name they do battery stuff
probably most famously iPhone related
batteries and battery cases but they've
been a little bit m.i.a on the iPhone 7
stuff my opinion what I liked about
their last case they had a battery case
to increase the juice on your device but
also it featured wireless charging I'm a
big fan of Wireless try to put those two
things together that's a nice little
combination well today I received this
box right here I'm thinking it might be
something iPhone 7 related so we are
going to jump into it whoa I knew it I
knew that's what it was gonna be the
juice pack err iPhone 7 this is what the
fame is for the battery case you love
but now with wireless power whoa look at
the unboxing experience over here the
iPhone 7 the 7 plus Wow 27 hours of
battery with the iPhone 7 version the 7
plus 33 hours wireless charging with the
Qi standard so any wireless charger you
have that's Qi compatible will charge
this up but they have their own versions
as well and one of them has the magnetic
attachment so it's the perfect charge
every time you don't have to like wonder
if it's lined up that's a smart move
comes in a few different colors as you
can see over here 27 hours talktime 23
hours web browsing 25 hours video
playback and 77 hours for music this is
the wireless charge base nice weight to
it I think it's metal see these guys
they just know I love Wireless charge
like we got to get it to loop a microUSB
cable to connect the wireless charge
base for the seven plus it's not too
sticky it's like a smooth kind of finish
on it microUSB on this side so you don't
have to charge wirelessly you can charge
with the wire if you like the top just
pops off and the phone slides in we'll
do that in a moment over here we have
the same thing but for the smaller
iPhone 7 now what's interesting is when
you're talking about the 7 it's a little
more compact but it gets also slightly
fatter least it appears that way to me
with the battery expansion you've got a
slightly smaller footprint there
to get a similar impact well done all
right so let's just see how this
magnetic charge base actually works
for the purpose of this video use the
seven-plus case I'm gonna just slide
this in real quick that is super easy
look at that I mean that that's what was
easy enough to do what you do is you
hold this button here you'll see the
indication that it is now charging
you're catching juice from the case now
this is what I'm most interested in
though which is the magnetic charge base
so there's also other accessories as
well for the car I think there's a
desktop stand as well one of the
drawbacks of wireless charging is lining
it up one coil to coil how many call it
three coil charger so by Mophie creating
the case and the charger you would
assume there's going to be a match may
hear a marriage of this sort a match
made in heaven you come home it's dark
you know you're always fiddling with the
I talked about this scenario often all
right you don't want to be fiddling
that's never a good idea to fiddle get
right to the main attraction get into
the action well that's how this is gonna
oh it just finds the spot look at that
magnet at work now that's the move as
far as I'm concerned let's just check
this out plug that in oh that is nice
charging instantly don't even think
about it it's just second nature you get
one of these chargers on your desk one
of them on your bedside table and with
the extra juice added from the case
that's it you're never gonna need to be
thinking about charging elsewhere the
seven-plus already has a big battery to
begin with you extend it with this bad
boy and you have these chargers that are
super convenient a super convenient
place to put your phone I mean that's
just a win and it's it's it's it's
finding the charge spot every time if
during the vicinity it's grabbing it
even like this this might be the coolest
implementation of wireless charging I've
ever seen and it certainly addresses
those drawbacks that a lot of people
have with it now keep in mind when I
drop the case and phone down on the
wireless charger there's a
prioritization that happens so if the
phone needs juice the juice will go to
the phone first beef
or charging up the case next so the
speakers get mapped out this way and
this is something where I feel like this
case specifically actually improves the
speaker performance on the phone and the
reason I say that is because by default
they're firing down and you know you you
might be holding it like this and your
hand might be blocking the down firing
speaker ports so by having them kind of
reconfigured to fire out the front it's
actually a superior experience this guy
is always so damn loud guys screaming it
who is this guy it's part of an
IndieGoGo campaign right now and this
little guy it actually improves the
performance a little bit in my opinion I
want them to make this for every single
phone on the market you see you hear me
Mophie here's my pixel excel give me
this I want wireless charging all right
magnets and the extra battery light are
they in stock I don't know it's a hell
of a gift</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
