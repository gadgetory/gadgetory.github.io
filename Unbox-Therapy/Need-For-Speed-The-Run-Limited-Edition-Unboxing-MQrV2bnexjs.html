therapy and today we're gonna look at
Need for Speed the run this is the
limited edition and that means you're
gonna get some extra in-game content
nothing in the way of physical objects
so it's gonna be a pretty quick unboxing
nonetheless let's talk about what you
get you're gonna get the Bugatti Veyron
Super Sport obviously a ridiculous car
plus six additional supercars that are
outlined on the back or at least a few
more outlined on the back including a
Lambo a Porsche 911 and a Chevy Camaro
zl1 here's a better look at those
vehicles first to the Bugatti and this
is obviously a ridiculous car let me
know down in the comments which of these
four is your favorite either in real
life or in the game this is the Lambo
followed by the American Muscle
the Camaro zl1 and then lastly we've got
the Porsche 911 Carrera as all beautiful
cars but I'm sure that one of them is
probably your favorite let me know and
then now we got to get into the game of
course it's still called unbox therapy
this is an unboxing video so we got to
take a look even though I'm not
expecting any surprises it's just gonna
be the game disc and maybe a code for
EA's online pass and yes I am correct to
get your blu-ray on the right and then
I'm gonna go ahead and hide this online
passcode from you guys so you don't
snatch it off me there you go
a lot of people say why don't you just
register the game and then upload the
video no I go right to editing and
uploading there's the first thing I do
guys come on now I don't waste any time
so as you know manuals these days are
mostly on disking and this is the case
in this particular game as well you just
get this little tiny pamphlet otherwise
all the major stuff is on the disc so
this has been a very quick unboxing
obviously this is just a game so I got
through it pretty quickly but I am gonna
get some footage off of this game
through my avermedia Game Capture HD and
that's why I couldn't wait to get this
open first because I want to give you
guys some sample footage in my review of
that capture device so stay tuned for
that I got a lot more planned today I'm
even going so far as to call it an
upload marathon so stay tuned to the
channel if you haven't subscribed yet
please go ahead and do so I will see you
guys in a quick minute all right later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
