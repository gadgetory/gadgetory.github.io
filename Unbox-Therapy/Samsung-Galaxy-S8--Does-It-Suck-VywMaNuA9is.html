are pretty looking things you probably
already knew that though I was lucky
enough to get my hands on these
pre-release models before the actual
retail version is available and I
figured hey you guys are going to want
to know about these devices the the ups
and downs the things I like the things I
don't like and so on so that's why we've
got the video the way that we do today
it's a bit of a bit of a hot take if you
will I've been using the s8 plus for
somewhere in the neighborhood of 24
hours so I have some thoughts one of the
things you're going to notice right away
the footprint is very similar to the
pixel XL what ends up happening here
through the elimination of the bezels on
the right and left side and these
extremely thin bezels on the top and
bottom is you end up with more display
and less body less foam body so once
again as a comparison I think a lot of
people are going to pick up this phone
and go man it's such a big screen but it
feels so thin well there's certain
applications like video for example in
which this aspect ratio is a bit bizarre
so if I go ahead and launch you to the
entire interface I'm you know you're
taking up top to bottom it's all usable
space but then you notice those things
that you were trying to avoid those
bezels they come right back one of the
reasons that a lot of people go for a
bigger display in the first place is to
have a bigger video viewing experience
but since nothing truly fits this aspect
ratio natively you end up with these
black bars now granted within the app
there's the opportunity to punch in but
what you notice there is the top of my
head for example starts to get chopped
up a little bit because video makers
like myself
we're not framing or creating for this
bizarre aspect ratio it sounds like I'm
I'm hating on this decision I'm really
not it's just something that you should
probably know now talking about the
screen a little bit more this is uh it's
a nicer screen ever put on a smartphone
it's OLED now a weird thing about the
brightness if you scale it up to full
blast it kind of gives you a warning
experience the highest quality display
with maximum brightness and screen
resolution this may reduce your battery
life the weird thing is the way I'm
looking at this is in the in
wake of the note seven of course that
whole fiasco with batteries expanding
and exploding and so on it's not the
most confidence-inspiring thing to have
to manufacture tell you to not use your
device at maximum capacity it's blue all
the way up and you get to the very end
and it turns orange to me there's a
strange kind of subconscious implication
that I'm not using the device properly
or that I'm pushing it to the extreme
there's also this performance mode but
dedicated button which will push your
brightness up 10% it's that last 10%
represented by the orange color on the
bar and then it'll also give you the
actual screen resolution that you were
buying the wqhd plus this is where
things get super weird by default out of
the box you're not getting the full res
of the display which by the way the most
beautiful display ever you would think
hey
Samsung you've innovated here you've
created this incredibly beautiful
display wouldn't you want people to have
all the pixels out of the box by default
it's an F HD plus so to-220 by 1080 so a
little bit beyond 1080p but of course
not nearly as groundbreaking as this
wqhd plus 20 960 by 1440 this is where
that resolution is going to run in the
center and you've got to decide to go up
to the next one once again for me not
the most confidence-inspiring thing
maybe this is about giving you option
but this note 7 thing is looming it's
looming over a lot of customers heads
and if you don't believe me go watch the
90 million views that they're buying on
that commercial about quality assurance
I think it should be full res out of the
box with the option to toggle it down if
you want increase battery performance
going with this incredibly beautiful
design has the consequence of not having
huge batteries in the first place so
this is 3500 milliamp power 3000 no real
increase there from the previous models
and that's something I think a lot of
customers would have liked something
worth mentioning is that the s7 edge had
a tiny bit more battery than this bigger
footprint device the s8 plus it's worth
noting but you have the ability to set
up edge panels so you could hide some
apps in there if you
like it my issue with having this thing
over here is inevitably what ends up
happening is in a particular app where
I'm grabbing from the side of the
display to scroll especially if you're
using the device in landscape mode and
you're kind of scrolling up and down
sometimes you can toggle that
accidentally so the device I've been
using I just turn that off another big
thing worth mentioning is what Samsung
has done with the software here it seems
weird to say but it's probably my
favorite development I like the kind of
stripped-down clean version of Android
as it was intended now Samsung has made
their own tweaks to this skin this thing
in no way reflects what TouchWiz used to
look like in fact it's a lot closer to
the way the pixel looks and stock
Android behaves by default you have no
apps natively in the display section
here like you would on an iPhone for
example they're all hidden in this
little drawer which you pull up on look
at this way cleaner for the first time
ever I've got the back button in the
right location you can swap the back
button to the other side which is the
way that it's been another thing to
mention in the absence of a physical
button this home button here on the si
plus NSA has a little haptic feedback to
it similar to what the iPhone has but I
like that they're not taking up too much
real estate with that section either
these are nice little buttons these two
phones actually have the same resolution
the same resolution potential there is
absolutely no pixel breakup at all I
don't know that the human eye is capable
of picking up that variance in pixel
density at this scale here but it's an
interesting thing to note one of the
things I appreciate about these displays
is the fact that they have just cool
color temperature you can toggle this
blue light filter to warm up the tone
and if I click down here another nice
thing is you can kind of toggle how much
of it you want so you might like a
really warm tone or something a little
bit cooler does this whole thing about
using warmer tones at night help you go
to sleep I wouldn't know about it 3:00
a.m. I'm trying to go to bed you know
how to go so there's been a little bit
of talk a little bit of chatter about
the speaker situation on these devices
which is a little bit strange to me
because it seems pretty obvious there's
a single speaker grille even though
there were rumors that we were going to
have stereo speakers on here not so much
the case you have a similar speaker
layout to the
old stuff you see of course we have USB
type-c at it now and still a traditional
headphone jack which I know a lot of
people are going to be happy about
they're going to include some pretty
high-end AKG headphones with a retail
version of this device chances are
they're going to be a huge step up on
what you're used to receiving included

I heard McDonald's is hiring you ever
flip a burger so the front-facing camera
got an improvement in terms of number of
pixels so it's an 8 megapixel
front-facing camera now on the back
though you still have 12 megapixels from
what I can tell though from what Samsung
is saying there are some software
differences in how these images are
being handled theoretically maybe
there's a slim improvement I think
you're going to see images very close to
what the s7 was doing is really amazing
the quality of images we're making right
now we now have two HD available on the
front-facing camera when we switch to
the back facing camera of course we go
all the way up to UHD you can see the
default setting is F HD 1920 by 1080
plenty of options above that which you
have to select yourself including a 60
frames per second option at 1080p this
might be a huge consideration this might
oh my goodness might be the deal-breaker
for you it's hard to take a bad photo on
this camera I'm not like condemning the
device as a whole here when I talk about
the fingerprint scanner when I pick this
up look look where my hand falls boom I
mean it's just so natural for it to fall
there but the issue here is that the
fingerprint sensor is right beside it
maybe this was the only place they could
put it but maybe they could change the
shape I don't know what ends up
happening you end up putting your finger
in many cases on the camera lens and
smudging it up this gets even funnier
when you first launch the camera app in
which the app prompts you to wipe your
lens there's also a couple of other
options for unlocking the device the
iris scanner which takes way too long so
I'm not going to use that and it's a
little odd because sometimes you want to
unlock your device without looking
clearly added like lining up like as if
you're taking a selfie your other option
is this face on lock in which case you
hold it up to your face
it's incredibly quick and so on but that
one makes me nervous
because I'm like this face is out there
I just don't feel secure with it so I'll
be using this fingerprint sensor even
though it's a little bit odd oh this is
kind of cool the adaptive display this
again allows you to optimize the color
range saturation and so on select from
these options here AMOLED cinema which
is a slightly warmer tone AMOLED photo
this dedicated button for this assistant
called Bixby this could be useful in the
same way that Google assistant is you
can still launch Google assistant if I
hold down here on the home button you'll
see but they've given it this dedicated
button so for most users they're gonna
click on the side over here now I looked
around the settings menu I can't find
any kind of way of remapping that button
to something else which would have been
nice if I click this little button in
the corner here it brings up this thing
called big speed vision which is
probably the coolest part of Bixby right
now after I pop off a photo of the
camera it'll bring up similar things
that that it searched for on the web I
don't know immediately how that's useful
you take a picture of a banana what do
you see more bananas okay
how you gonna compete with Google so the
big question remain Galaxy s8 s8 plus
does it suck you can probably tell no
not at all alright it's a beautiful
thing you'll be happy if you buy it you
just got to figure out if you could have
spent that extra money on something else
go with a cheaper phone all of a sudden
maybe you take a vacation you meet the
love of your life now you're on a
sailboat or you can just spend alone
time with your si your pervert Dollar
Shave Club you heard that name kicking
around in the past you're probably
spending a boatload of cash on your
razors right now because you want to
look clean you want to look slick like
Tom it's important in life to protect
your most valuable resource do you know
what that resource is Tom face wrong
time that resource is time it's the one
thing you'll never get more of these
guys right here what do they do they
send you package in the mail so you
don't even need to think about sharp
razors what does that dull one doing for
you two messing all this up
well you you think this comes cheap
right here how long does this take
not long sure bud you get a package in
the mail they take care you once a month
now you're thinking wow once a month
that must be expensive it's not in fact
right now it's one dollar one dollar
that should take care of the terrible
smell coming out of you right now it's
got the shaved butter in here this is a
deluxe kind of setup we have the razor
blades the body bar so maybe you're more
this kind of guy I don't know you know
in the store something like that with
the metal in the grip you're paying
something for that certainly not a
dollar for the first time ever Tom will
be shaving for you
why did you leave now tom was telling me
earlier what he likes is he likes to
kind of trim up a little bit he likes to
leave a little bit of something going on
there everything you need to get cleaned
up so you can lead a better life one
dollar to get started
dollarshaveclub.com slash unbox therapy
how can they look like you Tom Dollar
