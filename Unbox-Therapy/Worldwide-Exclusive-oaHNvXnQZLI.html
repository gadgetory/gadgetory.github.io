another video and today I've got
something that I think is going to be
exciting but at this point as you can
tell it's a bit of a mystery all I know
is that this is a world exclusive
now obviously many different packages
show up here at the unbox therapy
headquarters but this one has no
instructions no logos no labels other
than the fact that I've been told it's a
world exclusive so without any more
hesitation let's jump inside the box and
see what this thing is all about it's
heavy too that's the first thing that I
noticed there's no obvious way though to
get inside I think I'll just attempt no
that's not to see them hang on a second
this'll do it so this is gonna be cool
to see we've actually got inside here
once we once we get inside okay one
second do it this time it's really
amazing the quality of packaging they've
gone with here few more get into this
exclusive mystery box long as I hit the
right spot here go ahead and move on
this unboxing</div></body></html>
