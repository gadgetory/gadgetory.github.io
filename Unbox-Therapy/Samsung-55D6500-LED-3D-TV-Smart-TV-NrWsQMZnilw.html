therapy and today we're taking a look at
my new television the Samsung 6500 from
the sixth series of their new LEDs and I
went ahead and took it out of the box I
took the liberty because I didn't want
to have to make you guys suffer watching
me trying to remove the beast from the
cardboard I've also gone ahead and
installed a custom LED ambient light
system I'll show you more about that
towards the end of the video so don't go
leaving now why did I pick this TV well
a couple of reasons first and foremost
the super slim bezel I had limited space
where I wanted to mount it and most 55
inch TVs would not have fit seriously
the difference is significant it's also
really slim that you can see like it
infringes already on my trim and the
doorway so any other 55 inch that I
really looked at was was just a little
bit too wide because of those bezels
being more significant but you know
that's not the only reason I'm happy
about this TV for other reasons too I
think the Smart Hub system that Samsung
has here is one of the best on the
market the first thing we're gonna look
at is the YouTube app here and let me
tell you something the video quality
blew me away
like I totally did not expect to see
video quality like this up on a 55 inch
TV I expected you know was gonna be kind
of pixelated etc no not at all now one
of the only drawbacks is you know
searching you know using text input that
you get it like sort of search around
via your d-pad on your regular remote
control that's not too much fun to do
within the app but there are ways around
it Samsung manufactures a QWERTY remote
which is pretty cool and you know I
might pick that up you can buy it for 99
bucks it's included with the 7000 series
but not this one or you can use your
smartphone via a samsung app for Android
or iPhone to control text input and
other remote functions I'll show you
that in a second
because I have installed it on my phone
and it is a big improvement but the
video quality I mean the video quality
is unreal in YouTube it sits
it's a really awesome experience next
we're gonna look at Netflix and Netflix
it's sort of the same on a lot of these
devices it's pretty much installed on
everything these days and you know it's
it's a standard experience it's pretty
quick for a Netflix app but again one of
the one of the drawbacks is if you end
up using the stock remote you're gonna
be putting in text left right and center
on this TV with all these smart
functions it's gonna be a headache so
you're definitely gonna want to look at
one of those alternatives that I
mentioned the next thing we're gonna
talk about is your video this is a
strange application that Samsung pre
installs it allows you to look through a
selection of movies and it sort of feels
like you're gonna be able to watch them
but then when you click on them you
can't really do very much except like
rate them and share the fact that you
rated rated them on Twitter and Facebook
kind of weird but anyway I guess I guess
it doesn't hurt maybe some people are
into that I'm not sure that name for me
though so the next thing we're gonna
talk about is the Samsung App Store now
as you guys know everybody's got their
own app store these days and your TV has
apps in it now too and you got
everything on here from videos to games
to sports lifestyle so on and so forth
this will help you customize your
experience you can basically lay out
your front page on your television
however you want with whichever you know
apps you want so the next thing to look
at is this search feature this is one of
my favorite features and what it does is
it allows you to have a search of all
the different connections that you've
got coming into your Smart TV so YouTube
Facebook so on and so forth
and when you get results you can
actually click on those results and
it'll take you right to the page where
those results exist so this is
especially useful for YouTube because if
you're looking for a YouTube video you
can actually be a little quicker going
that route than going into the YouTube
app because the YouTube app reloads a
standard video that's obviously not what
you're looking for and that preload
takes extra time so you're gonna want to
go that way if you know what you're
looking for this is called social TV now
if I had cable hooked up to the left you
would see a cable image instead
got that garbled noise and it allows you
to look at your Twitter stream your
Facebook stream and also use Google Talk
while watching TV that's pretty cool but
I ain't going near cable I don't need it
so I probably won't end up using that
now this is one of the drawbacks as far
as I'm concerned you get a super basic
remote with a TV that ain't super basic
and I mean I can't fault it it does
what old remotes did but on a TV that's
this sophisticated you really expect
something more substantial and that
QWERTY remote that Samsung manufactures
would have been real nice to have it
included instead of paying 99 bucks but
you can go this route here and most of
us have one of these in our pocket it's
a smart phone of course mine is Android
but an iPhone will work as well and you
can download this app from Samsung that
gives you a lot more control than the
regular remote and it'll let you scroll
through the different functions here
there's a couple of different ways to
interface with it you've also got this
touch sensitive interface which you
basically use the touchscreen to
navigate around now there's also this
smart input method which basically
allows you to have a QWERTY keyboard for
input and as I mentioned before that
it's a huge improvement when you're
using all those apps that require text
entry for search functions etc now you
can also select any app from the main
page right on here without having to you
know move around with the d-pad which
can take forever so a really cool
feature now another another mini
drawback is that this TV uses breakout
cables I wish it didn't but to be so
slim you have to expect it it uses
breakout cable for composite and for
component now another feature on here
which it's totally useful is the ability
to hook up a USB device either a thumb
drive or a card reader and just bring
your media files over here and it'll
play them back natively you can bring
MOV zem cavies AV eyes whatever you
please this is one of my unboxings in an
MOV format
I also brought over the dark night on
MKV and it played back beautifully so a
really cool feature you can either do
over USB or
also over your network via AllShare this
is one of my favorite apps that's
pre-installed it's the BBC app and since
I don't watch much cable it's a good way
to get a little bit of news yes you can
game on as well let's see what I can do
here in Gears of War let me see if I can
click Y real quick on this guy yes I can
there you go a beauty beautiful kill
there but if you're gonna play games on
this on this television I have to tell
you you must use game mode without game
mode installed or turned on I should say
you're gonna have an input lag of almost
100 milliseconds or more with game mode
on you're gonna take that down to about
34 milliseconds on the newest firmware
so a huge improvement
I can't notice it at that rate so listen
if you buy this TV don't be afraid just
find the game mode it's in the general
settings now let's talk about my cool
LED lighting system now you can have it
stall on any color you want and stay
there or you can have a transition
through the different colors like this
and I just installed it I've always
wanted to do something like this ever
since I saw Philips Ambilight system
from a long time ago and basically what
this does is if you're looking at your
screen for a long time in a dark room it
sort of allows for a better transition
between the darkness of the wall and the
brightness of the screen so it's
supposed to reduce strain a little bit
but it also looks badass
so this is the nerve center this is
where all the gear hangs out behind the
wall there's some shelves in there and
yes I know cables are going everywhere
I'm gonna clean that up but right now
I'm gonna show you how it all operates I
put a little plate on the wall to bring
all the cables through I pre ran
everything through here and I'll give
you a better look at my LED system this
controller here will allow you to pick a
very specific color you can get real
specific with how they mix and it'll
also allow you to put it on the rotator
like I had on when I showed you earlier
and you can also power it off from here
so real cool but I don't have to use
that to power it off because I have this
special surge protector with a master
and a bunch of slave ports so I got my
leds plugged in
the slaves when the master goes off the
television the LEDs go off too so it
just just goes on and off with my TV
real cool I ran some USB extenders so I
don't have to get behind the TV to plug
in USB devices and I've also got the
skype HD camera this was included in a
bundle with the TV and I'm gonna be
unboxing that real soon on the channel
so stick around for that I'll do a test
and tell you about the quality and I
also got the 3d starter kit with two
active 3d glasses and the for Shrek 3d
blu-rays so real cool I'm gonna unbox
that to do a test let you guys know what
that's all about as well so as you guys
can tell I'm real excited about my new
TV here I really enjoy playing with it
I haven't had a TV this big before and
you know it's really immersive for
gaming movies everything you can throw
at it and that super slim bezel means
you're just looking at picture that's it
so anyway guys if you liked this content
then hopefully you can click that like
and favorite button as it does help me
out a bunch and if you haven't checked
out the channel yet then please go ahead
and do so I got a lot more content over
there and otherwise until next time
thanks for watching and I'll see you
around later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
