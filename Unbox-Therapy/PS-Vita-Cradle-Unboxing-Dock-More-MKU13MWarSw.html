therapy and today we're taking a look at
a couple of PS Vita extras now from left
to right we're gonna get you started on
uncharted golden abyss and this is not
really an extra because if you pick up
this console you definitely should pick
up this game you're going to need to
pick up a game anyways and this in my
opinion is the top notch title out there
I think most would agree with me
the graphics are unbelievable especially
for a handheld if you're an uncharted
fan from before you will not be
disappointed
the next item I've got here is the
official Sony PS Vita cradle or docking
station whatever you want to call it now
you're going to want to pick one of
these up if you want to sort of leave
your PlayStation dock to watch movies or
maybe you want to place this on your
nightstand to make sure that your Vita
is always charged now this is a pretty
low tech dock it doesn't do too many
fancy things it's very lightweight as
well mostly made of plastic as you can
see here even though the front of the
dock has the appearance of like a
brushed metal it's likely just a plastic
as well now you've got your docking port
on the top side and then your
pass-through for that same port on the
back as well as an audio output if you
want to go to a sound system or
something along those lines now that's
using Sony's proprietary connection that
they've chosen for the Vita
unfortunately but most manufacturers are
going with proprietary connections these
days so we've come to expect it and
here's a better look at that connection
on the back you can either go out to
your wall outlet or to your console
depending on you know what your Vita
hooks up to it inserts fairly easily and
there you go you've got a nice little
viewing angle there if you so choose to
pick up the dock yourself next I've got
a very straightforward official PS Vita
card case this is going to be used to
carry your game cards as well as your
memory cards I believe two memory cards
and eight games get a better look here
when I pop it open very simple very
straightforward a way of you know
keeping your games with you and
organized you slide them in pop them in
pretty self-explanatory now
unfortunately you know Sony's gone with
proprietary games
Dietary memory cards it would be nice if
they chose some sort of format that was
more common but you know Sony they love
their proprietary formats now next is
the protective film for the front screen
which is a big beautiful screen you're
probably going to want to think about
protecting it now this is a very thick
protector and along with the guides it's
very easy to install I'm not going to
install it in this video but take my
word for it it's one of the easiest
screen protectors I've ever installed
now lastly I've got a 32 gigabyte memory
card this is good for 8 to 16 full games
because after using the 4 gigabyte
memory card I found out real fast if you
want to be downloading games from the
the PSN PlayStation Network store
anything along those lines you're going
to run out of space real quick so this
32 gig should give me a little bit more
Headroom in terms of downloading games
and keeping them stored on the memory
card now anyway guys I also picked up
the u.s. or North American version of
the Vita you guys know I previously
unboxed a Japanese version this one came
with little deviants as well as a 4 gig
card and a few other things I'll be
unboxing that next that'll be the next
video on the channel if you want to
compare this particular addition to the
original Japanese Edition which I
unboxed you can do that in my next video
