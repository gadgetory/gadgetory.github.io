I've never seen something quite like
this before I know at first glance right
now you're looking at this you're like
it looks like some kind of old school
watch actually with this little display
on it and the boxy design I believe it's
the first watch that is also a power
bank for your smartphone it's called the
Wat
actually the company here they
manufacture one of those 3d printing
pens I did a video on it a while back
power bank in a watch is this the future
there it is that was a simple unboxing
experience like they said it's got a
kind of old-school look to it it reminds
me of like those calculator watches that
were super foxy from Casio that's even
boxier look at that thing it also says
on the back designed in Belgium made in
China
Gorilla Glass an aluminum body and an
1800 milliamp hour battery so to put
that in perspective that's a similar
battery capacity to like an iPhone or
something like that
also in the box we have a little user
manual here a flat micro USB cable to
charge this up and then a couple of
other universal adapters here this is
like a tube style AC lightning for the
iPhone also type-c okay so that's the
one I use alright let's see what they
say here quick charge discharge rate of
2 amps that's decent I should mention
the strap looks to be interchangeable by
pulling on these pins here let's see if
this has any power out of the box here
oh it does cool on video you're gonna
see this display as sort of refreshing
in real life you don't see that it's
just a static image to be clear really
tight fit in there I feel like I should
mention that see how the connector is
not exactly lined up with the cutouts a
little finesse necessary here to get
this in there you've got to kind of
angle it I mean it will go in eventually
but I can't imagine that that is what
the finished product will be like
apparently they're shipping mid February
I guess I'm one of the first people who
has this so once you get it in there now
we'll connect the pixel to excel oh wow
instantly yeah see that right up there
we are now charging I mean that's pretty
simple although somehow my battery life
on here went to 0 right away
it could be since it just ship that
needs like a full charge up but not
it is currently charging in the pixel to
excel right from the watch now it is
kind of strange again I'm not sure how
much of a prototype this particular unit
is but the only way to identify the two
ends of the cable and the direction it
has to go in is this white sticker is
there gonna be some other kind of
indicator on the cable hopefully Lix can
address that all right so that's what it
looks like when you're charging
something from the watch like a
smartphone if we plug in a power source
to the watch then let's check out what
happens we see a charge meter here
sitting at 25% so you will know when
it's fully charged now I might as well
try it on well that that is a that's a
look I mean it's not crazy you know what
it kind of reminds me of like one of
those Dick Tracy watches back you know
you know Dick Tracy is he's a detective
with a bunch of gadgets and he had a
watch with a microphone and a speaker on
it that he could talk into this is pre
cell phone guys this was so cool I'm not
so sold on it just yet maybe in future
versions of this particular device it
can kind of be rounded off a little bit
more on these edges just slightly less
boxy and listen if you are constantly
running out of battery it is kind of
amazing to have 1800 milliamp hours
sitting there on your wrist I think
overall it's a cool idea cool concept it
seems kind of beta right now if you look
at my G shot here the volume of it is
similar but this one is just super comfy
because of the way that they've
engineered the wristband and so on maybe
this is an idea for Casio they're all
about these crazy rugged utilitarian
watches put a battery in their small one
charge up your devices I don't know guys
you still gotta carry the cable around
it this is a tough one for me to figure
out baby one day it's all Wireless and
maybe you just I don't know what do you
do if you put your phone it's all is
this kind of it's a little crazy for me
I think I'll be heading back to the
trusty old g-shock and probably still
carrying the battery bank cuz I got to
keep it real with you guys and that's
the truth of the matter jack on the
other hand I can't speak for him
or can I
this episode of unbox the era P has been
brought to you by nest now you know
these guys because you've seen their
crazy popular thermostat I recently
installed one here at the office thing
is unbelievable it learns it knows what
you like but today it's all about the
nest secure the new product this is an
alarm system in a box we have the nest
guard main unit to nest detect sensors
and to nest tags the guard is a simple
keypad with a built in motion sensor and
a loud alarm the detect knows when a
door or window opens or when someone
enters a room and the tag is so that you
can arm and disarm the entire system
without the need for a code you can just
tap on your keychain and boom you've
disarmed it or armed it on your way out
that's what it looks like nice and
simple and of course a keypad on the top
look at that little guy right there
wireless set-up stick this to the door
and boom you have a door and motion
sensor and then this little guy goes on
your keychain you can see the QR code
for easy setup this will now show up in
my nest products I have the cameras the
thermostat and now the guard so there's
three different settings you can have
the alarm off completely you can have it
set to home and guarding it knows you're
inside the house so the motion detection
is off but the window or door sensors
are on or fully armed so that everything
is active I can see that the alarm is
currently off and the motion detection
is off I can turn it on gives me one
minute to exit the space I'm gonna get
out of the way and then come back and
trigger the motion we'll see this thing
go up
in the entryway I see everything that
happened there alarm went off and so on
and the time associated with it this is
cool you can do a cellular backup for
some reason there's an issue with the
Wi-Fi integrates real nice with the
other nest products so if you have nest
cameras and that's the thermostat this
thing plugs right in it's all in the
same app and you end up getting more out
of each of those devices when they're
combined thanks again to nest for
