the lights blaring it's a Willie do pick
this is you're responsible for this sort
of yeah he is he's fully responsible
don't let him shake the responsibility
he somehow got us in touch with another
super crazy luxury phone what the
industry really needs is an even more
expensive bone for the point one point
zero zero zero one percent of
individuals what who are they
you know who's buying anyway let's just
look at the thing and you can see for
yourself what makes this so bananas so
crazy so luxury so wonderful Fodor oh
look at the box first of all what is
this wood yes that is wood what is good
let's do it
that's wood oh that is godly look at the
offset cut so you can reach you can lift
its thought that's what's going in there
that's what dollars get you thought
Maduro by Feldon Volk this is your
service center you can call them any
time look at the document jack that is
money you pay money for a document with
pen on it I've said it before I'll say
it again you paid cash a lot of it
Maduro paris labelled that's kind of
fresh look at that boom Maduro paris you
are not using just any other iPhone 10s
no can make that mistake earpods
included this could be Apple's Savior in
China this could be what they need to be
doing Jack oh here he comes
Jack's coming around there is Jack here
is leave this in how much does this
retail for well before I open the box
what are we talking about 5,600 USD
remember
what is good okay here we go oh it's got
the skeleton dude with gold teeth what
course this is what this company does
they give you this custom look this one
is just straight bananas whoa look at
his teeth up close jack you need to come
in there it says u t on his teeth you in
white and t in red that is an unbox
therapy skeleton ladies and gentlemen
look at the pattern in the carbon fiber
whoa you're rockin something like that
that's a statement Holy Smoke who is
that dude
Maduro mm DXL I believe refers to this
particular model otherwise you're
looking at knife own 10s let's see if
has any juice of course it's dead though
oh look at that he's charging up right
now look at the eyes change colors whoa
this is like a villain like a gangster
in a movie or something you know
the kingpin kingpin is actually like a
villain like it's a Marvel guy right
there was a bowling thing with him
kingpin he's a kingpin he's the king of
the pins are you the like superhero like
expert well amongst his group you're the
guy to talk to
hmm are you in the x-men as well or if
you were an x-men an x-man which one
would you be how dare you I like magneto
as well though got some juice got some
power here and I thought it was just
gonna be standard but it looks like we
have a custom unbox therapy ish
wallpaper going on
so unbox therapy lines and something
that looks like the brushed carbon fiber
that's on the back you see how that
carries through and look at him he's
happier than ever this is for you if
you're a comic book villain if you're if
you're magneto or kingpin or you're bad
to the bone
see what I did there with the bones you
can fend off anything the SWAT team and
what am I
I'm not wrecking this is not Grand Theft
Auto but if it was Grand Theft Auto this
is the phone that you would have as the
top villain will wants to be magneto by
the way if he has to be a superhero
villain that's who he chooses
to be honest it's a pretty good pick I
mean that's a powerful dude picking up
cars and floating seems kind of smart
the weird thing is and we talked about
this in the past I always felt like
Professor X it's not just metal objects
but he's like overall he can do stuff
move some objects yes yes he can
wrong he showed in early x-men comics he
actually was telekinetic as well but in
a small scale because it's way cooler to
float around how does the thing move
let the people talk about this will you
can look it up Tucker Keyes wrong
because this dispute happened in our
comment section years ago you remember
this and people don't know the truth
about Professor X okay so like will said
it's crazy expensive but you can you can
be certain that there's not going to be
other people out there doing what you're
doing or live in like you're living if
you have the adoro
Paris Feld in bulk custom skull carbon
fiber gangster to the bone there it is
spend some cash five g's get it together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
