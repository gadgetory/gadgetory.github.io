possibly not there's been a development
here in the unbox therapy HQ we have a
new show a new format a podcast some
would call it I mean it's definitely a
podcast it's this long form show that
we've been doing for a little bit now it
takes place downstairs in the new set
its conversational its casual we talk
about the news a lot of Technology it's
always there but it's other things as
well they st. gonna last come on now
is this a just some type of viral story
what's going on here are you gonna click
that get out of here with this picture
sometimes it goes for like half an hour
sometimes it's like an hour-long show
but the the point of it is sort of a
more in-depth discussion on some of
these topics that matter to you
you through the lens of a tech
enthusiast or a tech fan and
increasingly these types of issues and
developments that are having a
far-reaching impact on our lives culture
and so forth so that show I mean we
published like maybe a dozen episodes
now so if you haven't heard about it
where have you been well no I mean it's
probably my fault at this point because
I never came on here and even told you
it was happening oh I should probably
say as well look at that we got a plaque
to already Lou later there you go that's
the name of the channel it's called Lou
later and it just passed a hundred
thousand subscribers so you're obviously
late to the party at first we started
publishing these really long form videos
these discussions and then that was it
and then the next thing that happened
was that people said hey this should be
in the audio format as well I want to
listen to this passively listen to this
on my commute while I'm driving
while I'm doing chores around the house
so then we also release the audio
version so I'm gonna have link down in
the description here of this video all
the different places you can subscribe
and get this new content and participate
in this new channel I'm personally
pretty proud of it to be honest I've
been doing unbox therapy now for a
number of years and it's nice to branch
out and extend the conversation and to
just kind of have a chat in a more human
way than the edited version that comes
through here on this channel not that
there's anything wrong with it but this
is very singular product-focused it's
like okay we have a smartphone laptop
Bluetooth speaker let's talk about that
specifically there's plenty of other
things that that I like to talk about
and to be honest part of the motivation
in the first place was the conversations
that we were having here in the studio
anyways the team
Kirk Jack will sometimes Ryan it was
like hey we should broadcast some of
this and see what people think so anyway
so far the people that are participating
as subscribers on the Lu later channels
seem to be enjoying what's going on I
think you should probably check it out
too but I should I should give you a
breakdown of how you can interact with
the new show so there's the main YouTube
channel it's called glue later I'll link
it in the description and that's where
the the fresh uncut uploads go after
that the audio format it goes out to
Apple podcasts iTunes Google podcasts it
goes out to Spotify pocket casts
everywhere you get your podcasts so I'll
link some of those in the description
also and then third by request by user
request
there's also eclipse channel it's called
later clips also linked in the
description and that aims to chop up the
long-form episodes into their different
segments I know there's a lot of you
that haven't found this channel yet
because I haven't really mentioned it
but that was probably the most requested
thing when we first launched the podcast
was like I want to be able to watch it
in the segments that matter to me most
so there's a clips channel as well you
can subscribe to that one if you prefer
to consume content in that manner or you
can subscribe to both and depending on
how much time you have you can pick and
choose where you want to watch or listen
so anyway it's been a blast I'm enjoying
it so much I hope you'll come over and
join as well and participate we do
audience questions as well so you can
you can ask you know whatever it is
you're concerned about wondering about
you have a product related question or
some other tech related or or I mean
anything you can ask anything Willy do
is actually taking questions you can
email him directly it's will at Lou
later dot-com and your question may end
up in the show it could be about
anything I promise so please go ahead
check the links down below and I mean
thanks
for thanks for making it possible it's
it's been a blast continues to be and
I'll see you over on Lu later later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
