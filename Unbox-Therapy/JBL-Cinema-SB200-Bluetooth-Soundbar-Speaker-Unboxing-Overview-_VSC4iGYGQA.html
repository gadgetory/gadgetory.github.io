see behind me we finally got the flat
panel set up with some gaming consoles
and stuff what that means is we need
better sound we need better audio
unfortunately one of the problems with
flat panel displays is that the sound is
not all that great so what I've got
right here is the JBL SB 200 this is to
improve the audio performance of our
gaming setup without having too many
wires you know surround sound speakers
everywhere a big subwoofer we need this
thing to be you know portable mobile
that's why it's actually on wheels
because we're going to stick it in a
bunch of different locations in the new
office space it's not 100% complete but
this video is about the SB 200 so what
is this it's a sound bar and if you
haven't heard of sound bars before what
they do is sort of virtualize a surround
sound experience with only one single
unit what's special about this one it's
also got bluetooth that means you can
connect mobile devices to the speaker
without the need to physically connect
them so if you want to hook up your
smart phone play some tunes through the
speaker very easy to do so anyways
without further ado let's go ahead and
jump inside the box let's do an unboxing
now with any product that comes in a
large box we obviously have a slightly
different unboxing environment than
usual because we can't fit it into the
normal unboxing space so please bear
with me here as we attempt to do the
live style unboxing that I am NOT famous
for but still gets the job done so on
the inside this looks like some kind of
bracket that's probably for mounting it
if you want to mount it on the wall this
is wall mountable actually in my case
since the TV's not on the wall it won't
be wall mounted you've got your
paperwork you've also got all your
cables Wow a lot of cables here so we've
got a little tiny remote control that's
pretty cool this is a standard analog
audio cable mini jack to RCA got a power
cable and of course for that surround
sound emulation you have a Toslink this
is a digital cable so that's going to be
able to transmit your Dolby so you get
that surround sound emulation that you
paid for so here is the actual speaker
which I'll try and remove here in the
the elegant fashion possible there we go
there it is actually it's really light
so there it is as a closer look at it
as you can tell it's probably going to
look pretty cool when we find a way to
get it underneath the TV
you've got your controls on the top
let's go ahead and get a closer look at
this so the SB 200 features a very sleek
design meaning that it's going to look
right at home underneath your flat panel
even if your flat panel happens to be
wall-mounted the controls for the SB 200
or on the top you're going to get volume
up and down a power button and input
selector there's also a surround sound
ambulation button and a Bluetooth button
because as I said earlier you can
actually hook this up to your different
Bluetooth devices smart phones media
players I've actually even hooked it up
to my macbook pro I'm streaming music to
the office through this speaker right
now so it's really convenient especially
from a Bluetooth perspective it's an
unexpected use case scenario but very
nice for the setup that we've got here
in the office on the back is where
you'll find all of your different ports
that you need to interface with in order
to get the speaker up and running this
is where you're going to insert the
power cable there's also an on and off
switch here you've also got an input for
auxilary so you can put a standard 3.5
millimeter cable in here if you're using
analog you can also use an optical
connection to get that Dolby surround
sound emulation there's also a selector
switch that you can identify whether the
speaker is wall-mounted or if it's
laying flat on a desk or table top or
anything like a flat surface and that's
useful because it'll actually change the
tune of the speaker so that it's going
to give you a better sound better bass
reproduction etc depending on the
environment you're using it in you've
also got all the cables you need to get
up and running as well as this mini
little remote which I actually like
quite a bit for controlling the volume
as well as the other features that I
mentioned earlier anyway guys that's
been a quick look at the SB 200 sound
bar from JPL as I said earlier when I
get to the official room tour full-on
setup tour video where I show you guys
our new gaming setup our working space
everything there is to see in the new
office I'll give you guys a demo of this
sound bar and show you just how much
better it is then the built-in speakers
on a flat panel on our planet or any
flat panel so if that's something you
guys want to see if you can't wait for
that room
our video office to her video leave a
thumbs up down below and I'll catch guys
on the next one thanks as always for
watching
alright later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
