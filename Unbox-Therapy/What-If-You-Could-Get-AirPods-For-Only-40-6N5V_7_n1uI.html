the Apple earpods they might be the most
popular fully wireless earbuds on the
planet apparently Apple can't keep them
in stock people love them but here's the
thing they're kind of pricey 159 bucks
they're not gonna be for everyone and so
you might still want the almost air pod
experience for a lot less money and
that's where this comes in this is the
mini HP Q - I ate tws a fully wireless
earbud that looks like denticles of
apples air pods I ordered this from one
of those Chinese e-commerce sites I
don't remember it might have been DHgate
or Aliexpress
I paid somewhere in the neighborhood of
about 40 bucks for these we'll see if
this is any good or not could be a
complete nightmare but if you're looking
for air pods on the cheap this might be
the way to do it what does it say in the
back hbq with charging case immediately
this is bigger that's quite a bit I have
some legit air pods here you can see
they are not identical this one still
pocketable still smaller than the pixel
buds container the other difference that
you can see right away I can show Willie
do over here the air pots of course they
use the proprietary lightning connector
this hbq mini I ate situation is micro
USB and also there's a difference on the
back here would be shape of the
container what else is in the pack let's
see micro USB cable to charge it up a
user manual what else do you want do not
overuse all right well you get 10
minutes a day it's enough music for you
okay I don't know I don't know what they
mean by that keep away from Wi-Fi no
Wi-Fi anymore throw your router out the
window
you got the CheapOair pods now who needs
a router to stream the music cool I mean
yeah regular Apple earpods and the
knockoff version from China over here so
this is magnetic on the air pods very
satisfying of course you've probably
seen these before comes out slips in
it's charging now once it's in there
this version there's a click - it's not
magnetic not quite as satisfying now I
see some LED lights that I'm assuming
implicate charging look at that I see
red I see blue and
is something else in the bottom here you
can see these two little prongs that's
how the charging takes place you can see
the other contact points on here
official airpot on that side and there's
the hbq on the other quite quite similar
now obviously if you know what you're
looking for you can tell the difference
immediately
nonetheless they're pretty much the same
let's check out the fit you know if
anything I would say the hbq has a
slightly better fit for my ear that is
bizarre it's isolating sound more the
air pod is a little bit loose for me so
I can still really hear my surroundings
so far so good now I notice that this
earbud it has a button on the side of it
in fact both of them do I'm guessing we
have to manually power these outlets
let's test this out oh there it is HB q
i8 tws connected battery 100% that's
good why do I feel like it's only gonna
be the right ear bud right now I only
connect to one or the other pairing with
one ear bud why would you want to pair
with one ear bud
double click either side to enter
pairing mode okay so long as you power
them up at the same time you're all good
this button here it acts as a play/pause
button or an answer phone call button
both of them are working right now not
terrible I mean maybe let's just connect
the airport's do an a/b test right here
oh there we go okay cool the official
air pod sound a little bit better I mean
not that I expected anything different I
mean these are quite a bit more
expensive than these you could get four
pairs of these instead of these these do
work granted pairing situation let me
give it one more test here okay so I'm
gonna disconnect says it's connected to
the old ones okay let's go yeah yeah so
the button works for play pause these
get the job done they really do they
sound better or at least as good as
whatever earbuds like we're included
with your phone but of course fully
wireless and they have stayed connected
they've maintained this dual connection
I haven't had the one earbud thing
happen anymore no this I mean this is
obviously a copy right I mean they took
this they try to make something close to
it so you have to treat it as such it's
functioning maybe a little bit beyond
what my expectation was from a sound
quality perspective I just at Loic
patience to begin with now when it comes
to charging it back up drop it in here
the light turns blue just like the air
pods the battery inside of the case will
be responsible for charging the ear
button now the battery they're saying is
60 ml amp hours and the DA is another
950 that's substantial maybe it's not so
bad maybe this is a little beyond my
expectations you know sometimes you look
at a product some sort of a knockoff
what was the last one we did we had the
impostor version of the galaxy s 9 the
clone thing was a nightmare but in this
range you're getting nothing close to an
air pot for 40 bucks you're dead set on
that look but you just can't put the
bill on the real deal maybe the knockoff
versions for you I can't speak to the
reliability I mean it's amazing what you
can find out there including this right
here you decide let me know in the
comments would you take a chance or
something like that are you steering
