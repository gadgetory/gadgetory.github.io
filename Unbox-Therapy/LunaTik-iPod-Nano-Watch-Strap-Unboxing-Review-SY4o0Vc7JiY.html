therapy and today we're taking a look at
the lunatic a high-end watch strap for
your six generation Nano with a high-end
price tag to match eighty four ninety
five is what I paid at the Apple store
that's a lot more than some of the other
watch bands that I've unboxed and
reviewed for the Nano I'll put links to
those down in the description as well as
up in the annotations they're from a
different brand of course I watches but
you know you hope that with this one
you're going to get some extra quality
for your extra money let's unbox it and
find out if that's the case I've heard
really good things about this lunatic
and we'll see if they're true now the
first thing I notice is it's a little
bit different unboxing experience
because there's a couple of extras in
here not just the strap and the reason
for that is because you've got to do a
little work that's the trade-off you
want a high end secure strap where the
Nano is locked in place and you got to
lock it in place with a couple of tools
not to worry that's easy to do then
you've got some instructions here take
it out of the box throw in your nano and
step three show all your friends thank
you
Captain Obvious for that but you know
I'm not going to hate on them because
this thing is damn nice I mean that's my
first impression this looks beautiful I
mean this is the only one I've ever
pulled out that looks like a watch from
the get-go without even having a nano in
there it just feels right you know what
I'm saying it's got a slightly wider
band a more athletic style I would say
compared to the last one I unboxed and
that's really what I was looking for is
looking for durability I didn't want to
have the Nano out there on its own all
cold all alone I wanted to have it
locked in place and that's what this
watch band offers as far as I know it's
the only one out there that does that
because I'm going to use this as a watch
exclusively and you know this is kind of
the misconception is is it really a
watch or is it just an iPod Nano in a
convenient location I mean that's that's
really what needs to be considered here
because a lot of people get angry saying
why don't you just get a regular watch
you know but that's not I don't know
that that's really the argument I think
that there are enough people don't even
wear watches so maybe this is just a
very convenient way to wear your Nano
maybe that's what we should start saying
anyway guys let's talk about what's
going on in the video here we got a fake
iPod Nano anybody want a fake iPod Nano
didn't think so
you got to slide your iPod Nano in this
way if you're going to wear it on your
left wrist you want the power button and
the volume buttons on the top side
that's because you want your headphone
cable to run up your arm
and that's something else that I notice
guys is is that if you use these with a
long-sleeve shirt it reaches perfectly a
lot of people say well I'm gonna have
cords everywhere now if you've got a
long sleeve shirt and you use your
regular headphones I have reasonably
long arms I think then you're not gonna
have any problems at all if there's
enough slack there you can do whatever
you want anyways this thing is totally
impressive I didn't expect to be this
impressed to be honest with you
everything is super tight super
well-thought-out I mean this is solid
aluminum here and I I'm really impressed
I don't know what else to say here you
know you guys could tell I'm excited my
expectations were that it was going to
be good but I got it in my hands and I'm
like this is one of my favorite watches
now or one of my favorite things to put
on my wrist I should say because that's
that's some important real estate on
your wrist there let's be honest now
this is the last thing you have to do in
the configuration is move this little
this little part here to the notch
that's suitable for your wrist and I
actually ended up with it in the in the
largest position which is crazy because
one thing I'm noticing with all these
straps it's either I have gigantic
wrists or these things were designed for
children you have a lot of adjustability
on the small end but on the large end I
mean not very much this is the maximum
as I mentioned before if you've got big
wrists big hands you're going to want to
consider that but I don't want to
complain because I am so happy with this
device I really really met my
expectations I suppose I should say you
think about it you can easily spend a
couple hundred bucks on a watch that
doesn't do very much or you can use that
real estate for something a little bit
more interesting and as I said before my
previous videos I am going to do a video
after this one to talk about the
practicality of putting this on your
wrist and and as I mentioned earlier in
this video I don't think it's so much
competing with watches as it's just a
convenient and cool place to keep an
extra iPod sometimes you don't want to
you know kill the battery on your
smartphone or I mean there are a number
of reasons and I'm going to go through
them in the next video after
is so definitely subscribe if you
haven't yet also make sure to LIKE and
favorite this content if you appreciate
the work that went into it and
definitely stick around the channel
because like I said more cool content
iPhone 4s coming up that's going to be
on the channel anyway guys I could go on
and on and on so as always thank you for
watching and until next time I'll see
you around
alright later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
