the new iPhones the iPhone 8 and of
course the upcoming iPhone 10 and then
various other devices that have launched
recently but of course there are many
Samsung fans starting to imagine what
the s9 might look like in the current
landscape of smartphones so I did what I
could by teaming up with concept creator
to imagine to build a concept of the
next s9 and s9 plus from Samsung now
I've done this in the past I did this
for the iPhone 8 where him and I teamed
up previously and we came up with a kind
of a radical redesign if you will you
should go check out that video if you
haven't yet it was kind of like my dream
iPhone 8 it was more angular it was just
different now he and I came together to
do something similar for the galaxy s 9
if that's even what it ends up being
called and we really wanted to make sure
that it was going to be something
different so we decided to go with a
modular design the s9 and s9 + modular
now of course you've seen modular
devices from other manufacturers
probably the most popular being Motorola
MOTO with the moto mods so the whole
goal here was to imagine what an s9 with
modular functionality might look like
and of course we went ahead and improved
the camera the screen to body ratio and
various other aspects that you will see
in the clip that I'll be showing you in
a moment now the key thing to remember
here is that this is a concept it is not
officially authorized by Samsung in any
way the purpose of it is to get your
wheels turning about what the ultimate s
9 &amp;amp; s 9 plus might look like so I do
want you to get involved as well make
sure to leave a comment down below with
your perfect specifications the features
that are most important to you what you
think the next-generation Galaxy S
device should look like now one more
thing before I unveil this beautiful
concept video make sure you go and check
out subscribe to concept creator on
YouTube and who knows maybe some of the
stuff we drum up actually ends up in
physical devices so make sure you go
support him as well all right that's
enough
I've blabbered on for too long jack
please go ahead and roll the clip
