went to the outskirts of LA deep deep
deep LA deep la I'm familiar with deep
LA it's actually not LA at all no
oftentimes when you meet up with a
person and buy something privately
they're totally cool this guy was great
unfortunately is there's a few weirdos
who screw it up for everyone jack is one
of them have you ever bought a basket of
apples no okay
the main function of this is to get
greater precision than what your finger
offers touch an individual pixel touch a
pixel touch a pixel sounds perverted oh

just say something yeah that's it okay I
like this pencil it's a good size mm-hmm
and it's got a sleek finish to it it is
a hundred dollars mhm
I like the weight the way that was the
immediate like you can weight it good do
that when I get half feeling sexual
he'll a sec she will he and so we're
gonna do something a little bit fun in
order to come to some sort of conclusion
about the value proposition of this
product and what better way
than a drawing challenge what are we
drawing a landscape we're gonna put a
time limit on the drawing in order to
encourage speed and humor you got five
minutes starting now
and whatever he's doing is happening
very fast John's gonna finish his
drawing then it will be my turn I'm not
gonna see what he's drawing he won't see
what I'm drawing until we're both
completed at which point there will be a
revealed then you the audience will vote
