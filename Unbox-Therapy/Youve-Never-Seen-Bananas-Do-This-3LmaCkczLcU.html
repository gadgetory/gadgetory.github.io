because I've got something in front of
me called the makey makey if that
doesn't sound fun
not sure what does this right here lets
you turn everyday object into touch pad
wait blue break it down for us
what does that even mean these bananas
over here can turn into T's sake
returning to button
this could be left click right click on
your computer I'm saying you could make
all kinds of unusual contraptions
triggered by everyday objects using
something like this we are going to do
something very exciting I will be making
a very quick little beep using nothing
but these bananas as my touch pad just
plug it clip and play you can see on the
top they have a layout here showing you
how you'll flip them to the bananas I
don't know what to expect but let's
crack it open and have some fun there we
go ok gonna keep those that's it it all
fits in this little guy right here who
would have thought a cool-looking little
tin to keep everything in you can show
your makey makey pride right there the
very important connection wires these
are called alligator clips because they
bite down and so these will clip to my
independent instruments like this you
can see that the top part of it is in
the shape of the gamepad space and click
if I were to connect this clip right
here now my spacebar is all of a sudden
a banana a banana space lock and then if
you want to get a little more intense on
the back of the unit I want to go for
the WASD F G because I'll use musical
typing in GarageBand and attempt to play
some instruments connect yourself to
earth banana bomb goes maybe we should
just go with that we've got a laptop
over here oh and getting light
you stay here not supposed to be
familiar and then I need to connect
myself to earth now let me see something
oh if I take another clip connect it to
this other those are some groovy bananas

level the medium of my first album the
banana beatmakers could be the start of
something fresh no get it with the fresh
these bananas aren't that fresh there we
go all right so now those guys are in
there oh why does that feel so
satisfying yep

few more going
