with another look here at the new Google
pixel you may have caught the previous
broadcast there was some sort of
compression issue on the video I think
it had to do with the Wi-Fi we switch
networks should be golden now so let's
dive into it I've got the hot new phones
right here that these are the smaller of
the two this is the 5-inch pixel is of
course the XL also over here which is
5.5 inches slightly higher resolution
display as you can tell both of them
manageable form factors but the real
story here is the design the aesthetic
and the camera as well you take a look
around you see aluminum construction as
well as some glass at the top now this
isn't strictly for looks this also
serves a purpose which you end up with
here is slightly better performance for
your wireless antennas for your cell
reception and so on because it can
transmit well through this glass surface
it also allows for you to avoid the
camera hump the dreaded camera hump that
nobody wants so when you place this down
on a table as you'll see here I can push
on every edge and that not have that
like wobble the wobble nobody wants to
wobble I'm sure you're aware now the
camera a lot of hype around this camera
if you watch the presentation you know
that the DxO rating on this camera is
unprecedented it scored an 89 which is
higher than any other camera that's been
tested in the smartphone universe
including the latest iPhone now that's a
tough thing for me to show you here in
this live broadcast trying to bring this
to you real quick here but what I can
say on the sort of preliminary test with
this camera is it's super quick and it
has some cool functions so for example
if I snap a photo of this right here I
could just sort of hold down and you see
that was 15 photos
in in a couple of seconds so the
processing is very fast here there's
also this cool lens blur feature where I
can snap I'm going to try to give
slightly more depth of field here put
this back here if I snap a photo of this
case and then slowly elevate the camera
up I'll get a checkmark now it's
processing the lens blur and what that
does is it emulates a shallow depth of
field that you would get from a camera
with a very large aperture you can see
it blurred out the background there and
now the foreground is in significantly
more focus that can be modified after
the fact as well if you decide that you
want to change the composition at a
later point so two different colors this
is very silver and this is quite black
kind of funny names they're essentially
this kind of looks like a dark a very
dark charcoal and then up on the glass
portion it's super black as well around
the device you'll notice it does have a
headphone jack I know a lot of people
were kind of upset that this is being
removed from some other devices on the
market you do have it here but you've
also got a USBC connector so
theoretically that could be used for
audio in the future as well if you want
to keep it strictly digital but that's
also quick charge so Google is saying
that this port here can provide you with
seven hours of battery life on a 15
minute charge over USB see that's pretty
impressive another thing I'm going to
want to check out when I get a more
comprehensive look at these devices
holding it in the head you really kind
of get a flashback to like the Nexus 4 I
was a huge fan of the various Nexus
devices of course no longer called Nexus
here it's now Google pixel moving into a
more premium realm but I'm reminded of
the Nexus 4 and how this feels in the
head of course that one had the
completely glass book glass back this
one is a dual material but around the
edges it's just got that same kind of
comfy feel another nice little touch
here on the power switch you've got this
textured finish so when you reach down
without even looking at the device
you're aware
of whether or not you're on the
power/lock switch or if you're on the
volume rocker speakers are located on
the bottom down here as you can see we
can probably we can probably give those
a test real quick couldn't we let's see
here can I load up some youtube let's
give that a quick test
well that loads I just want to show you
the difference in form factor between
the two so this one it's kind of is
probably going to be more popular
amongst one-handed users I can easily
reach across the display this one though
probably a better choice for multimedia
not only is the display bigger at 5.5
inches but it's also slightly higher
pixel density qHD versus Full HD on this
device over here once again Wi-Fi issues
ensued can't bring up the youtubes on
that one let's try it on this one oh we
did
or this one I've got multiple
opportunities for YouTube loading here
there we go something tells me this
one's going to do the trick there we go
all right so if I load up some video
here maybe I'll do a quick search for
unbox therapy and of course the famous
video from yesterday featuring right and
if you didn't believe I was sick here's
all the evidence in the world so here
you get a sense for audio
so they fire out of the bottom like this
and essentially when you're you know
when you're holding the device in a
landscape fashion that's going to bounce
off your hand and kind of project more
forward from that perspective so this is
I mean what are we talking about here
we're talking about a move into the more
premium space availability of more
carriers you can now get this thing on
Verizon various other popular Canadian
care carriers potentially it'll be
subsidized which would be interesting to
a lot of people maybe you can pick this
up for less than the sticker price I
think that's exciting
pair that with what's being called the
best camera in the business and all of a
sudden you have a compelling package but
that's not all that happened here today
we also had this the daydream headset
which is it's tough for me to really
portray this to you through video but
this thing is incredibly comfortable and
incredibly light and it's something I've
been hoping for in a vr space for awhile
I've tried all the various universal VR
headsets that are on the market and they
all have their drawbacks nothing has
been put out that's perfect and one of
the biggest drawbacks is the weight of
those things they're all quite heavy now
this one on the other hand super
lightweight there you go fashion show
for you and made out of soft materials
so extended viewing sessions in theory
should be a lot more comfy using
something like this also getting your
device in and out and working with
multiple devices so what they decided to
do here is simply have this flip down
and one latch now on the inside you're
going to notice the new control as well
this could be your input method for the
device and what's nice is you don't need
to look at it to understand where your
finger is you have this recessed touch
pad on the top and these buttons are
also well identified by the fact that
one protrudes and the other is recessed
down here it's going to use a gyroscope
type of input method so for pointing in
your VR it's going to track where you're
pointing at and it's got
place the store of course when you're
using it this is where your phone is
going to go it's going to fit right in
there flip up and then it's going to
know that it's been inserted into a VR
environment and launch you into the area
you would hope to go into so even with
the device in it's still super
lightweight and comfy comes in a couple
of different colors this is exciting
maybe VR is set to take on the planet
and become far more popular with a more
accessible Universal headset this will
work with this will work with devices
beyond just the pixel as well if it can
fit in here then theoretically would
work as long as it supports daydream so
there you have it guys a quick look a
first look at the new pixel I think it's
pretty damn pretty you'll probably agree
with me available in two colors very
silver quite black I think you're
probably going to be interested in this
and definitely stick around because I'll
be diving more in depth as this becomes
available in the retail form I'll do a
full unboxing video give you guys some
more camera tests and something I'm
especially excited for the video mode
you will see the 4k video mode with this
sophisticated image stabilization that I
saw in the presentation it's like it's
like doing all these intense
calculations for stabilizing shaky hands
like the ones that Jack uses thanks for
watching guys
