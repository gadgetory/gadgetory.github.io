fairly recently we the unbox therapy
team moved in to a new studio a bigger
studio in this space is somewhere in the
neighborhood of 7,000 square feet and
for any of you that have been in a large
space or even just a regular house you
know there are challenges on the Wi-Fi
front there are challenges on the
internet speed front so when we moved
into this space I'm gonna get something
nice working in there I'm gonna get a
good connection for also we can upload
videos at maximum capacity who do I
reach out to I remember I did this video
at the old place you see there an
averaged out to 113 by 20 with a 19
millisecond ping and I was able to get
incredible speeds okay of course it's
got to be ubiquity it's got to be the
amplify system but this time it goes a
step further I want to thank you bik
woody for sponsoring this video
improving our Wi-Fi so we can bring
better faster uploads to you the amplifi
HD home Wi-Fi mesh system this system is
said to travel 20,000 square feet so
these two could be upstairs in this
setup could be downstairs a total of
four mesh points and a central unit who
knows maybe we can beat the record in
the last studio I hope very high quality
whoa check out that presentation right
there look at that there's no cables at
all power prong and a magnetic connector
to the mesh point itself this is the
head unit I'm gonna go set all this up
would be extra mesh points we're gonna
do some speed tests are we gonna break
some records that's the question I sure
hope so I think so that's fine yeah okay
so I have the system set up now it's
plugged in match points are plugged in
as mesh points everywhere I'm in the
mesh right now you are - because you're
watching this there is an app that comes
with that system that makes it crazy
easy to set up like even Jack could do
it before mesh points look at all those
bars
super simple the speed test this is the
moment of truth this what it's all about
we're gonna upload videos anymore is
this thing over here we go
Oh baby
what do you got look at that that's
juicy right there that's what you want
and then some that's - OH - down by 254
up that makes me happy
warm fuzzy uploads downloads the weird
stuff that we'll wants to watch and the
videos that I need to get to you faster
what's your connection speed do the test
yourself right now on your Wi-Fi network
put your results in the comment I want
to see you as the fastest connection out
of all of you okay so thank you so much
to amplify for upgrading our system in
here it's actually it's gonna make a
real impact they do have a new product
out as well called the teleport this
little box right here it gives you your
at-home connection when you're on the
road you plug this thing in and you can
connect to your router at home behaving
like a hardware based VPN but without
the subscription fee or the potential to
have that VPN address banned when you
are travelling in a foreign country
maybe you go to China or something you
want to load up YouTube kaboom oh you
use the teleport kaboom oh is that a
word I've never said it before global
connectivity long-range parental control
remote management much like the system I
just set up set this up via your mobile
device provides a secure and convenient
way to access resources at home even
when you're not let's say you want to
watch us Netflix but you're in Germany
you're just one touch connect to this
baby and you have Netflix the way you're
used to seeing it not the regional
version of it serving as a personal
Wi-Fi hotspot the teleport creates an
encrypted connection between you and
your devices at home expanding your home
Wi-Fi coverage wherever you go oh my
goodness it's very portable that's the
unit right there got an Ethernet
connector this one comes with the main
unit so these two guys are gonna speak
together no matter where you are in the
world plug your modem into this router
and then take this with you on the go
anything that's connected to this router
at home is now accessible to you
wirelessly wherever you happen to be
it's like a VPN with benefits that's
pretty cool teleport there
is amplify ubiquity cool stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
