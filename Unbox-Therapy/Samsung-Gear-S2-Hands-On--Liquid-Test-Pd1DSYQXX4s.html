another video and today we're going to
be taking an exclusive first look
hands-on with the new gear s2 you have
this brand new user interface which for
me is probably the coolest part this
bezel around the outside actually spins
kind of like those old-school watches
that your dad probably used to wear
maybe he still does so starting from the
watch face here you can move it to the
left hand side to look at your
notifications we can then take action on
those notifications from that location
now one thing to mention before I get
into that you can still navigate through
touch like this by swiping back and
forth but the whole concept here to keep
your hands to keep your fingers off the
screen okay so here you can see the
message and I can take action on it by
tapping at which point I can see the
entire conversation thread then at the
very bottom I can click reply from here
there's a couple of different options
what's up I'll talk to you soon there's
a plus button down at the bottom so if
you're like me and you like to use a lot
of slang with your friends and whatnot
you can put it all in here I'm assuming
it's going to be appropriate slang okay
keep it clean kids but that's not the
only option you can also use your voice
you can see there's a microphone icon
there so you can dictate the message
back or if you want to have a little bit
more fun to pick a thumbs down because
I'm just a downer that day no never mind
thumbs up so we're all about then I can
just select it boom now if you're
old-school
there's even an option using this t9
style input this for me is probably not
the most practical way to interact with
it at this point but hey it's there
maybe you're in some kind of top-secret
environment and you can't get to your
phone you've got this under the table
you know some James Bond type stuff so
here you'll be able to see that there
are tons of different watch faces to
choose from in fact there's over 20
right now there'll be an open SDK so
people can make their own watch faces by
clicking on the stylize button you can
get even more variations even
in one particular watch face and another
cool thing here is that there are custom
watch faces for different functions you
can see there's a Nike watch face and
that brings me it's actually one of my
favorite watch faces here activity
bubbles there's two independent bubbles
unfortunately right now you can tell
that I've been sitting a little bit too
much daily competition with yourself
we've seen as before on other activity
trackers and whatnot but I just thought
this was kind of a cool implementation
you see a guy sitting down you see the
actual image of it and it makes you feel
terrible about yourself get up
stop feeling terrible let's make a
change the bands are interchangeable
it's kind of just click remove and go
from there so rounding out the hardware
on the device here on the right hand
side you'll notice two buttons this
one's going to be used for back to go
back within the interface we've also got
a home button to skip all the way back
to the main page and then a microphone
in this location here on the back of the
device you'll notice a sensor this is
going to be used to read your heart rate
now there are other sensors inside as
well not just heart rate you've also got
a gyroscope accelerometer it's going to
take a little bit to get used to the
idea of interacting with the bezel
itself this here is for tracking your
liquid intake whether that's water or
coffee you can see there's well that
could be tea as well
maybe you're in England anybody can like
tea simply by tapping the plus button
here maybe you'll be able to have a
better idea of just how over caffeinated
you are sixteen cups of coffee a day
that would probably kill you right guys
the research team has weighed in
I don't know how accurate this is but
apparently you can have more coffee than
water let's say the number again how
much coffee 31 litres of coffee before
you die apparently don't try that at
home and Samsung is claiming that this
device is going to get between two and
three days of battery life that's true
that's a major leap in the right
direction as I think battery life is one
of the major drawbacks smartwatches now
when you do go to charge the device
you'll be using this little dot put that
on your side table it has four gigabytes
of internal storage that means you're
going to be able to take a little bit of
music with you locally right on the
watch now something that's really
exciting and I'm personally quite happy
about with this device is it's no longer
going to be Samsung exclusive operation
this will now work with other Android
devices so that gives you a rough idea
of the immediate UI but by going to the
home screen tapping it twice you'll
bring this up these are your apps
here's voice memo you also have maps you
can use it for navigation as I keep
scrolling around you'll see there's this
cool animation that happens there so
once I get past the first group of apps
now you might be thinking that the app
icons on a device this size are
incredibly tough to select but with this
new UI you can actually sort of just
hover over music player in this
particular case and then rather than
trying to tap right on that icon you can
hit in the middle of the display and
this functionality works throughout
various menus and different apps so I
showed you some of the software
functionality also gave you an overview
of the hardware but there's something I
haven't covered yet and that's
durability since this gadget is a watch
it lives on your wrist and it goes where
your wrist goes it's kind of important
that the thing is tough and this one
features something called ip68
certification that number refers to its
durability both from a dust protection
standpoint but also liquid
so there you have it completely
submerged to make sure it's still
working
yeah no problem perfect
all right IP 68 as promised that's
pretty impressive your watch will not
die if you drop it in the toilet
there you have it a quick look a first
look a hands-on with the new gear s2 if
