Jack can play
the the cheering the colorful colors
options cheap iPhone we've all been
waiting for it it's the budget friendly
friendly to your wallet they're
practically giving it away for free it's
the iPhone 10 arts every color is
unboxing every single iPhone 10 are now
if you've been following the channel of
course you've been following the channel
then you saw I made a video I said the
iPhone 10 are it's a bit to fit the
pressing to me okay in the sense that
you look up and down the spec list at
the announcement and you're like okay
okay I see that I see what it's got
inside and then I see the price tag 750
bucks and you know me I've been diving
more deeply into the budget phones and
just the wide variety of things that are
happening in a smartphone global
marketplace and you save yourself okay
you don't have the OLED display all
right you have a single lens camera set
up okay you change the construction from
the iPhone 10 in 10 s it's a little bit
more lightweight maybe you hoped for
more like myself but that is us there's
a subset a group of individuals in the
comments they're there they're rabid
they're angry they have their own
perspective and I appreciate all the
perspectives in the world for some this
represents a new affordable shiny
colorful iPhone and I can appreciate
that now because of my last video I'm
coming into this with some
preconceptions with some feelings
sometimes you got to get out of your own
way
you got to work harder to see the
alternative perspectives it's to go in
with a genuine attitude to really try to
see the positive why it might be good
for you and why it might not be great
for somebody else I mean that's the
agenda so before I open any one of these
boxes I want to tell you right now then
I'm gonna bring that attitude to this
phone I will be attempting to love the
iPhone 10 are to fall in love with the
iPhone 10 I will take that mission upon
myself I will
myself let's open them all up I guess
this is the product red no inside the
box by the way real quick power brick no
quick charge
Emily look I'm looking at the positive
side so the positive twist on the no
quick charge since I'm being optimistic
right now is very portable
okay that's tiny fits in your pocket up
side a what is that a cherry is that a
cherry red
have you seen product red products in
the past then you're probably familiar
with this tone of red you can see the
single lens setup that's different than
the tennis tennis max also this device
different construction of course as you
can tell you have an aluminum frame and
there may be there may be kind of an
unintended consequence of this
construction of these materials in that
the antenna layout on the 10r may in
certain circumstances outperform the one
on the 10s 10 s max I may have a video
to follow up on this double your
lightning port on the bottom over here
speaker layout on this one it's
symmetrical product red vibrant yellow
another thing I'm noticing right away
since this one happened to be powered up
the bezel is a bit fatter that's a
consequence of using an LCD screen as
opposed to an OLED display yellow meets
vibrant Lamborghini yellow it's
somewhere in between the two but it's a
combo yellow on the back there's gold on
the side whoo there it is coral it sort
of got some orange in there depending on
the lighting and it's got its very own
frame color as well with kind of blends
that's coral black it's black but if you
get a reflection on it and get some gray
tones in there vibrant clean fresh like
the driven snow
very nice and last up blue oh it's like
a light blue Kabam kablammo there you
have it your lineup ladies and gentlemen
we have one two three four five six
color options this is the point at which
you tell me down in the comments which
one you're going for or none at all I'm
open all right you can say whatever you
want
now if that's not enough for you you
could take it a step further and you
could actually customize one of these
iPhone 10 ours or any phone for that
matter using AD brand skin of course how
about a little marble maybe you even
want to cover up the Apple logo because
you want to keep it a little bit more
low-key plus you're gonna see these
other colors everywhere
how many marbled iPhones are you gonna
see or here's another example if you
want to go super stealth you get the
matte black finish
skip the fingerprints maybe you don't
want to live this finger print life over
here but you still want to have the
black dial phone and go with this of
course your wireless charging still
works there it is deep red skins you
heard about them go check them out not
just the iPhone 10 or any phone and the
site is 15% off so go check that out
here we have the yellow device booted up
and as you can tell it's a very similar
experience to the various other iPhone
10 series devices you have the notch
layout which is identical the bezel on
this model is a bit wider as a
consequence of using LCD technology as
opposed to OLED in order to pack it in
there and extend up into these regions
you have to kind of have this bezel now
another interesting thing about this
device is that Apple has stated that it
will actually be best in terms of
battery performance out of the entire
bunch which may be meaningful to you if
battery is at the top of your list of
criteria battery performance that has a
lot to do with the screen resolution
this is a lower resolution display than
the top two models so battery
performance should be a bit better since
it's pumping out less pixels my initial
impressions with the resolution you know
that was a big topic of conversation
it's the main differentiating factor
between this and the iPhone 10s and 10's
Max or even the 10 for that matter if
you hold it close enough to your face
you can see some pixels in the text but
you really have to be looking for them
in regular everyday use this may or may
not be something that bothers you you
would have to be a screen junkie a
person like myself who's always
interested in pixels I mean I'm looking
for pixels of course I want the best
display possible the most resolution
possible and also another thing that
comes along with Oh
is contrast and viewing angles when you
start to tip it or go off access that's
where you start to notice generally a
difference between LCD and OLED to have
a single lens unit it should perform in
a similar fashion to the higher-end
model without having the optical zoom
function through the secondary lens
portrait mode is going to be supported
through the single lens here which will
be a little bit wider than the zoomed in
portrait that you get on the 10s and
10's max okay so there you have it that
is a quick unboxing my first impressions
of the iPhone 10 are I know you guys are
gonna have a bunch of questions and I'm
actually wondering myself do you guys
want me to switch over to this thing do
you want me to dive a little bit deeper
do an extended take use it as my daily
driver of course you know I'm willing if
that's what you guys want to see the
thing is there's so many smart phones to
switch to and many others coming out
here's the thing I'm sure that this is a
capable phone I'm sure that the user
experience is going to be very similar
to the iPhone 10s Mac's that I used in
my previous switch before the pixel so I
feel like there's gonna be a little bit
of overlap there of course the big
difference the display the camera
possibly the battery life so we'll see
either way whether I switch completely I
do want to use it a bit more extensively
and possibly compare it in a more
granular fashion to the bigger brother
iPhone 10s and 10's max so definitely
stick around for that and we'll see you
guys vote right now in the comments a my
switching to the iPhone 10 our next is
that is that what's gonna happen it's
gonna be a yellow iPhone in my pocket oh
my goodness time will tell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
