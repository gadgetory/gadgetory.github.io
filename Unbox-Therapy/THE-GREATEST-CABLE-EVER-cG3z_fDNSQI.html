another video and today I'm gonna show
you something that relates to the past
video so recently I unboxed what I think
might be the ultimate backup battery the
ultimate portable battery brick now in
that video I had cables flying
everywhere now thank goodness they've
included the cables that you need but
the cables they were so I went on a
search for what might be the ultimate
cable to go with the ultimate battery
backup or anything else for that matter
and I found this guy right
chiffon greeting you warmly with a wish
that's sincere for a healthy happy and
wonderful day well I appreciate that
now I ran into this thing on Amazon call
me weird but I'm a little bit of a cable
junky and this thing is unlike anything
I've ever seen before you see all these
nice little flat cables coming out and
you know what this means for me this
means no tangle I'm a tangle free kind
of guy regular USB this will go into
your power source for charging or
syncing if you want to go into a laptop
then check this out Micro USB ii micro
USB mini USB Lightning USB see what you
have this is normally in your bag I mean
and this is only three of the cables
nevermind if I added a mini USB there's
no lightning cable eat in there gimme
you say these aren't even the right
cables but you get the idea like who am
i right now what am i doing what am I
trying to prove the ladies big this is
not what they're looking for
alright if given the choice you tell me
huh what are you gonna go for
not this I get excited about strange
things this is one of them let's say
you're using one of these bad boys if
you saw the last video then you know
what this is this is a backup battery
it's kind of a giant one might be my
favorite one right now look at that
pretty little package right there you
might you know you might be on a road
trip and you brought your Nexus with you
so oh guess what
charging different phone same cable
here's an iPhone lightning you heard the
noise a galaxy s7 microUSB got that
lightning bolt that's a good sign of
course this guy also supports I mean if
you got some really old school equipment
I was looking around for many USB
equipment couldn't find a single thing
now let's say I want to bring everything
with I want to bring all my gadgets
because my gadgets are my friends
they've replaced the real life version
humans these are your new humans you
happen to have a big power brick lying
around like this guy I mean this one is
from a UE boom Bluetooth speaker I
believe now let's say we go into this
guy can we supply juice to all of them
at once think Shakespeare said something
similar
give me some micro love give me some
more micro love I know it's not a race
turning it into one
give me some Lightning love give me some
USB see 100 did we just do the
impossible charging charging charging
charging can you see all that
oh no matter which gadget you choose to
bring with you as long as it's
relatively modern this cable is going to
do what you want to do
I think I have found the Holy Grail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
