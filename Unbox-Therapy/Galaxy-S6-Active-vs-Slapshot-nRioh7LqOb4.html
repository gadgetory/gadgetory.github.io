another video for awesome stuff week and
today we're going to be talking about
this my Galaxy s6 active you've probably
seen this on the channel previously it's
the phone that's been in my pocket ever
since I got my hands on it so today I
wanted to step things up a little bit
and do a durability test to find out
just how tough it is I think I've got
the perfect idea
we're out here on the ice testing out
the Galaxy s6 active finding out just
how active it is I'm gonna beat it up a
little bit start by passing it around
so right looks good
test one right passing no problem really
we're gonna take it a step further give
it a bath water no problem
let's move on to shoes
got a lot more plan for this guy so
let's pick it up a notch
oh it's completely fine did not expect
that
no way twice twice in a row to slide
shots off the blade then off the board's
and not a mark on it alright I guess
it's time to move on to a proper
scrimmage
as you see this phone has seen better
days this one hit a post select to ask
your smartphone of course we wouldn't
expect it to survive in case you're
wondering what a smartphone might look
like after hitting a hockey post you got
it right
so there you have it the results hard to
say I'm surprised about the devices that
ended up smashed after all we were
playing full-on hockey they were a
substitute for a puck they hit posts
they got smashed but the one in the
middle I am impressed with this is the
one that dealt with the passing test and
maybe more impressively the slap shot
test twice full blast didn't expect that
to happen
anyways there you have it hope you
enjoyed it don't try this at home thanks
very much for watching check out
youtube.com slash awesome stuff week for
more awesome videos and also big thanks
to the entire squad out here later guys
