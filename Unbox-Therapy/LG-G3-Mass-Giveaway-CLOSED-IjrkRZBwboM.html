another video and today it's a special
one this is probably the largest single
tech giveaway video to ever grace the
pages of YouTube and you are lucky
enough to be watching it through a
collaboration with myself marques
Brownlee from mkbhd and the good folks
over at LG we're going to be giving away
an enormous sum of LG g3 super phones
not one not five not ten not twenty
seventy five freaking phones 75 of the
latest and greatest Android smartphones

people in North America to go and buy
yet so these are gonna be Korean
versions but you're gonna be the coolest
kid on the block to be rockin a g3

dead simple we're gonna run it like
previous collaboration giveaways we've
done together all you need to do is make
sure you're subscribed to myself here on

description of this video and all the
other rules will be down there as well

fashion so you'll know that you're
