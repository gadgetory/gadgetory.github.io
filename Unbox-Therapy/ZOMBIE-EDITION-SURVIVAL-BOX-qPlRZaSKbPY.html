another video and it's another surprise
type deal
it's a battle box so it's going to be
survival type gear and this one's a
little bit different because it says
special zombie Edition on it before I
jump inside this box I want to give a
shout out shout out to a special event a
live event that's happening in Los
Angeles on February the 6th Jack is that
right February the 6th it's called team
crispy live anyway you got myself
you got mkbhd you got Jon from TLD you
got Austin Evans and you got judge nerd
from your average consumer we're gonna
be on stage I don't know what we're
doing

and you're gonna be there we're gonna
shake hands we're gonna try to entertain

description so you can buy a ticket

you're interested click the link come
check it out and come say what's up or
hello or how you doing or how she going
or but this is an unboxing video because
you are watching unbox the repeat so
let's do the damn thing and as usual we
are greeted with the dry grass fire
starter when you're talking about
survival you're talking about fire huge
component the best thing about unboxing
these boxes is just like so many things
whoo more kniv more knife without the e
probably because it has something to do
with Sweden this is made in Sweden by
appointment - HM the King of Sweden this
message approved by the king of Sweden
this video sponsored Jack put it in here
somewhere
sponsored by King of Sweden
I'll bill you later Swedish king blade
of high-carbon steel with an
anti-corrosive black coating robust
sheath and a firestarter broccoli with a
side of coriander and finished with
cayenne pepper whoa
carbon steel made in Sweden can you see
that jack oh I gotta say I think the
king of Sweden he's not messing around
goes in there like that this is the fire
steel kind of clips in there and comes
out what do you say should we should we
create a couple sparks whoa whoa whoa
do-it-yourself zombie bracelet King this
Walking Dead approves right here this is
obviously for putting the bracelet on oh
wow
right inside there that looks like
another little fire steel but they say
there's 12 feet of paracord in here you
can use this for everything what do we
have here it's another blade this again
we've got the paracord you can see the
skull on there oh this is just a patch
velcro patch so you can that's gonna
live there for the rest of the video
zombie outbreak response team okay I'm
like a legit I'm a general right now so
I'll be apocalypse kit inside a sardine
can
compass whistle matches first-aid razor
blade pencil non-aspirin pain reliever
not sure why it's important that it's
non aspirin reflective signal surface
fish hook fishing line duct tape no
paper sugar salt gum reclosable bag
antibiotic ointment tea safety pin and
alcohol prep pad seems really light for
all that stuff a hundred foot seven
strand Corps paracord that's just a huge
hunk
of paracord zombie survival can in case
of a zombie apocalypse drink entire
contents to ensure speedy escape then
fill the can with rocks and throw the
can at a zombie we're having a little
fun with this one
this is obviously a energy drink of some
kind if I do it you have to do it here

sheath I believe Jack ketch is a poster
well zombie head of some kind it's a
pretty pretty fellow right there
zombie tinder waterproof all-weather
fire never expires can be lit with a
spark okay it looks kind of weird -
looks like zombie guts look at that
should we try and light some of this
