therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime
widely regarded as the top-of-the-line
Android tablet on the marketplace at the
moment here's the changes so quickly but
what you're getting here is a quad-core
tablet in a very thin and light package
and you're also gonna get the latest
version of the Android operating system
which is of course ICS or Ice Cream
Sandwich for those of you that are into
desserts and as with any unboxing you've
also got your paperwork associated
obviously the most boring part of any
unboxing but it must be covered
nonetheless you've got your warranty
card outlining your one-year limited
warranty that comes with the tablet and
then you've also got a very basic user
manual slash product guide which you
probably will not need to read because
this thing is dead simple to operate
like most tablets now underneath as far
as other inclusions you've got a
microfiber cleaning cloth which believe
it or not is a little bit different from
some of the other ones I've seen
slightly more texture to it and then on
top of that you've got your power brick
to power up the device this is obviously
very important these things are
ubiquitous they all look the same these
days you've got a USB on one end to
power prongs on the other and
unfortunately Asus uses a proprietary
cable here but I mean you can't really
blame them most manufacturers are using
proprietary cables so here you can see
you've got the Tegra 3 quad core power
586 grams light it's got a super IPS
panel promising decent reading out doors
an 8 megapixel camera and of course
Android 4.0 ICS so lots of stuff packed
into this small little package this
thing is actually quite reminiscent in
the hands of the iPad 2 as you probably
can already tell there's a little block
or a little stopper here in the bottom
port that kind of caught my attention
right away and there's also these rubber
stoppers on the portions that are used
to connect to the other aspects of the
transformer series that I'm obviously
talking about the dock there the
keyboard dock that this thing can clip
into now the back of the device has a
brushed sort of aluminum
metal finish to it and it's done in this
spiral pattern very nice to look at
you've got your 8 megapixel camera and
also an LED flash up along top on the
back and I here's a better look at that
you've also got your microphone in that
location and let's get you even closer
to that camera gets you up close and
personal so here's a better look at the
tablet now comparing it to my Galaxy Tab
10 1 the bezel is slightly larger so it
is quite a bit thinner but the footprint
is slightly larger there you get a
better look at the headphone jack which
is located on the side of the device the
right-hand side when you are facing it
here's the left-hand side of the device
you've actually got a reset button
that's that little pin the first one you
see and you've also got a micro SD card
slot which I know a lot of people enjoy
having for memory expandability etc
you've also got HDMI out and then you've
got your volume rocker which is actually
in a pretty good location where your
hand will be resting along top as you
move around the corners well you'll find
the power button it also has a little
miniature LED indicator on there now the
speaker is kind of in a strange location
it's sort of right where your hand rests
on the right hand side there it is a
fairly large grill so you might be able
to move your hand out of the way but it
is a strange location for this speaker
now this thing is quick guys I basically
booted it up here and just started using
it straight away which is the beauty of
Android just plug in you know your Gmail
account and credentials and you're ready
to go you're up and running just like
your old tablet and as you can see here
it has rendered unbox therapy calm very
quickly even though there's some rich
multimedia on the site including an
embedded YouTube video and some flash
ads etc so lots going on and it still
managed to render it very quickly one
thing I noticed straight away on the
side is this little scroll bar here that
you can grab hold of which is actually a
nice addition I assume that that is
built in to ICS and here is a button
that controls the super IPS function of
the display making it significantly
brighter than anything I've seen on the
market and that's what they're claiming
is gonna make this thing easy to read
outdoors that incredible brightness
obviously I'm indoors right now so I
can't tell you for certain but it does
seem incredibly bright and crisp and the
resolution the pixel density so on and
so forth is also very very nice so here
the YouTube app just giving you guys a
quick feel around the device get an idea
for the speed and whatnot we're gonna
boot up some unbox therapy videos of
course here let's look at my latest
unboxing the NES deluxe set if you guys
haven't checked that out you definitely
should do so it was one of my favorite
unboxings that I've done so far
definitely different from some of the
other stuff on the channel up until this
point but as you can see the device is
incredibly snappy quite surprising in
fact I didn't expect that big of an
improvement over the Galaxy Tab 10 one
but it is noticeable at least to me
maybe it won't be for everyone but but
it is for me and then when you package
in the fact that this tablet is
versatile enough to go into the
transformer dock and have a keyboard
associated with it including the extra
battery etc it's really hard to
recommend any other Android tablet on
the market right now this thing is sort
of set the precedent for what an Android
Ice Cream Sandwich tablet should look
like so here's a quick comparison up
against my tab 10:1 which I thought was
super thin and like this one
his thinner believe it or not I mean
it's not a huge difference but it's it
is thinner and when you have that sort
of I guess it's like a beveled finish
there on the exterior edge it ends up
feeling even thinner than it actually is
if that makes any sense at all so
anyways if you have a tab 10:1 I don't
know if it's necessarily worth the
upgrade it's not like a gigantic leap or
anything but if you're in the market
it's gonna be your first Android tablet
then I guarantee you're gonna be looking
at the transformer prime and you
probably shouldn't look anywhere else
