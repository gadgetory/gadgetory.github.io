my hands there but I've never started a
video like that ever before what's up
guys Lew here back with another video
and today I've got something I am very
excited about I think you will be too
it's the new MacBook incredibly thin
incredibly light but this one has been
outfitted a little bit differently it is
currently wearing a D brand skin of the
carbon fiber like variety I don't think
there's another new MacBook on the
planet that looks like this right now or
just yet this is a two pound laptop no
internal fans you've got the lower
powered CPU of course as a result of
being as thin as it is as light as it is
and the thermal performance necessary
got Intel graphics and of course the
controversial USB type-c port this is
the new-age USB it has some benefits it
has some drawbacks benefits drawbacks
alright enough with the outside of the
box let's jump inside and see what this
MacBook is all about Wow
as I told you guys this baby is special
with the carbon fiber like finish and
this goes really really well with the
space grey interior my goodness check
that baby out you've even got the carbon
fiber finish right on the trackpad so
let's go ahead and look at the other
items inside the box besides the pretty
laptop we have our USB C cable right
here that's tiny that is a tiny little
connector you also have some paperwork
from Apple that's to be expected along
with some stickers probably hopefully
the classic Apple stickers a little bit
darker than usual is that to go with the
Space Gray possibly a tiny little power
brick as well now a couple more things
about USB see before checking out the
inside of this laptop it'll charge your
device but it'll also be very quick
throughput with the USB 3.1 protocol
capable of up to five gigabit per second
connections
it also features native DisplayPort 1.2
output for video as well as H
my or traditional connections like VGA
through some of those adapter cables
that I was talking about earlier now as
you can tell this new MacBook is
incredibly thin it's less than half a
centimeter thin in fact at its thinnest
point on this side of the device you'll
find your headphone jack as well as
microphone and that's pretty much it for
ports so opening up the new MacBook the
first thing you'll notice is this
completely redesigned keyboard it
features these very shallow keys not a
ton of travel so if you're coming from a
previous generation MacBook this is
going to take a little while to get used
to again this is a consequence of the
laptop being so thin the trackpad has
also been changed in order to
accommodate this incredibly thin form
factor it now features something called
force touch I know
terrible name you get the sense of a
physical click without actually having a
physical clip that sounds very weird but
it's a haptic kind of feedback there so
you get a little buzz that makes you
think you click down even when you
didn't it's quite bizarre the speaker
has also been redesigned along the top
here it seems to be shooting more up at
you instead of bouncing down off the
table but probably the biggest
development is this screen we now have a
high resolution display in a very thin
enlight laptop coming from the previous
generation MacBook Air that was one of
the most requested things and so Apple
has finally achieved it albeit at a very
expensive price point now there is a
standout missing feature on the new
MacBook does not include an HD webcam
instead it's got a 480p front-facing
camera here which doesn't really make a
lot of sense every other MacBook has at
least a 720p camera because 480p it's
not cutting it
nobody likes 480p you work so hard to
fit in this really high resolution panel
and then you got to look at your own
face on it in 480p it's just weird
as far as I'm concerned
all that said I still believe that this
device is quite the achievement I can't
believe how thin and light laptops are
these days and this display is really
amazing it's essentially as tight a
pixel density as you're gonna find
versus the MacBook Air there's no doubt
that this is a significant improvement
all right so that wraps up this unboxing
and first look at the brand-new MacBook
with Retina display and USB see and of
course this really cool skin from D
brand skins if you guys like this look
you want to check it out or try it out
for yourselves I'll drop a link down in
the description as I mentioned earlier I
think it's really slick and it allows
for you to customize put some extra
personality into your device whether
it's a laptop phone or whatever
big props 2d brand skins look at this
precision it's pretty wild alright guys
that officially wraps up this video
