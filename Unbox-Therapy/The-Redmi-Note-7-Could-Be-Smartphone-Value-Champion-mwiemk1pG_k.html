they announced a hundred and fifty
dollar redmi note 7 with a 48 megapixel
camera okay so recently we did a video
about some upcoming Samsung devices
targeting this part of the market this
sub $200 price point they were calling
their series Galaxy M but setting right
in their crosshairs the redmi brand from
xiaomi so i think it's probably not a
coincidence that we end up hearing about
this shortly after that news came out
now this looks equally compelling to go
up against those Galaxy em products and
it kind of fits the narrative of what
we've been talking about regarding this
innovation and unusual specifications
and features popping up in devices that
are nowhere near flagship level for
example a 48 megapixel camera on a
hundred and fifty dollar phone and we
talked about it before where these
smartphone manufacturers are willing to
experiment with different types of
features they can take bigger risks at
that end of the market now there's
something interesting about this 48
megapixel sensor because I know a lot of
people watching this or sitting there
thinking look it's not all about pixels
all right you can have a camera with
tons of megapixels and have a terrible
image come out of it but the way that
this sensor is going to be implemented
into the camera from what I understand
is that it will be capable of taking
super-high resolution 48 megapixel
pictures in good lighting conditions but
then you can actually pair the pixels
together so you get a bigger pixel for
shooting in low-light so you get greater
sensitivity and it'll just knock back
the megapixel count a little bit for a
low-light style mode so there's the rest
of the specs now keep in mind 150
dollars is the starting price there will
be some different versions just like
there was for the Galaxy M stuff em 10 M
20 and so on the note 7 here it says a
6.3 inch display with a 1080
P screen snapdragon 616 so mid-range
snapdragon nothing wrong with that at
150 bucks the selfie camera will be 13
megapixels of 4,000 milliamp hour
battery will be in there that's one of
the best things happening at this end of
the marketplace where everyone's
clamoring at the top end on the
thousand-dollar phones for batteries
like this for four thousand milliamp
hours it turns out the better selection
of big battery phones is actually at the
bottom of the marketplace it seems
insane it seems surprising it seems
unusual it seems weird you pair a 4000
milliamp hour battery with a Snapdragon
660 then you've got a phone that's gonna
last for a very long time now if you
remember in the Samsung announcement it
was sort of more of a rumor we didn't
find out in the article that we were
citing or any that we could find at the
time what the processor was going to be
in that Samsung device so it's tough to
stack them up head-to-head at this point
we know what a snapdragon 616 we know
it's a great choice but we don't know
what Samsung is going to use in their
devices to compete directly with this
one also Xiaomi we know has operated
really well in this marketplace this
low-end mid to low ed marketplace 150
$200 price point so we know they can
deliver value at that price point
whereas Samsung is a bit more untested
in this space at least with their new
brand the Galaxy M ok so here we go the
starting price around 150 bucks will be
a three gigabyte model with 32 gigs of
storage that goes up to 200 for 6 gigs
by 64 gigs of storage I want to mention
it has a headphone jack it has a
headphone jack it's sticking around I
think I have phone jacks actually
important especially at this end of the
market place if you think about like a
hundred and fifty dollar phone you have
a lot of Bluetooth headphones that are
150 bucks or a hundred bucks or 50 bucks
right the ratio there the difference
between the cost of the device itself
and the headphones are gonna pair with
it I mean it seems kind of crazy that if
your headphones cost as much as your
phone so having a headphone jack for the
target audience that's going to be in
the market for this phone I think is a
big deal it has to be there
now does say here at the bottom this
device will actually be available in
China first but
or it makes its way to India and the
other regions that Xiaomi would normally
sell the red meat brand so we're gonna
have to keep an eye out for it maybe
we'll get our hands on it but it's
exciting stuff well we continue to be
amazed at what's happening at this end
of the market and what it's doing the
kind of disruption it's applying to the
entire market to the brands like Samsung
and Apple we've seen Samsung's play
we're waiting to see what Apple is going
to do about this but it's obvious
there's a giant market at this price
point and it's becoming increasingly
important especially for the low-end I
mean you have like the honor of u-20 the
huawei Nova for the view 20 is in the
mix so it's a little pricier but you're
right the view 20 with the pinhole
display you're seeing a lot of
experimentation at this end and that's
why it's important for us to talk about
it to give it some coverage even though
it might not necessarily be on the radar
for some of our viewers North American
viewers and so on it's actually become
the place where we're seeing the most
interesting stuff happen in the
smartphone space so $150 redmi note 7
6.3 1080p screen 3 gigabytes of RAM
4,000 milliamp battery do you think this
is a worthy competitor don't forget to
48 megapixel camera oh yes I I don't
know it's really hard to criticize any
device at this price point like a
hundred and fifty dollars not too long
ago would get you nothing or get you
some kind of long contract and you'd be
paying something off over a period of
time I'm still so amazed at what they're
able to deliver at these price points in
general I would find it hard to imagine
that this could be a bad buy with that
spec list I think we're seeing some
great competition happen here I think
this is going to be something worth
checking out and evaluating just like
the galaxy M stuff and maybe we can ask
people in the comments now if you were
forced to choose between this upcoming
redmi note 7 or the rumored galaxy M
devices we covered in the previous
episode which one would you pick and why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
