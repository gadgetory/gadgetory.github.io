another video and this is the third
installment in the new series called
does it suck and today I'm excited to
present to you a $40 Android tablet
letdown Lu
I mentioned it in a3 tech deals video
when I think it was around $35 and a
bunch of you commented asking for
further analysis so I ordered it bought
it threw it in the cart at Amazon to
bring you this video and to find out
what a $40 Android tablet is exactly
like a cardboard box for the unboxing
experience nothing too frilly here and
inside a user manual oh this might be
fun thank you for your irulu purchase
welcome to your tablet you have made a
good decision to use an irulu product
alright here is the tablet wrapped up
pretty nicely little bubble wrap here in
another sleeve this one is orange
connecting my world good to know it has
passed it equality control QC 1 TF cards
that's got to be SD micro SD anyway glue
on here think there were some stickers
there that have been peeled off ok
charging port which is DC 5 volt micro
USB microphone rear-facing camera
speaker well-placed
serial number sticker volume up and down
satisfying click right there forward
facing camera power button headphone
jack
irulu also in the box charging cable not
proprietary but really wish that was
just micro USB though I don't know maybe
you can charge this thing over micro USB
maybe it's both that's it
look at that $40.00 later not getting
power right now is there a screen
protector on this discreetly feels a
little odd please charge using the
supplied AC adapter Bizzaro charging
okay so off camera I've plugged this in
I've got
the cable going to a USB charger over
here also I can't decide if this has a
screen protector pre-installed or if I'm
supposed to remove it there's no tab so
it says that we're supposed to charge it
for 10 hours for the initial charge
caution please charge the battery fully
when you use the unit for the first time
and then you can charge for seven hours
otherwise you may got problem with
charging battery life you don't want to
got problem you may got problem okay so
this thing's been charging for a little
bit and I think it's gonna boot up now
at least I hope so
yeah it's emotional right there wow I
can barely see this screen right now Oh
Oh hand this screen is come on there's
gotta be more brightness here that's
full brightness the reflection is so
intense right I mean I you guys can't
even I can barely even see the icons in
this lighting can you see oh my god it's
faint I have a feeling this is only
gonna get better
well that's quicker than I expected try
and play back a video here weird aspect
ratio the full screen doesn't quite fill
the frame there's black bars on each
side
so it's 1020 by 600 resolution Wow
listen I I know I sound like a jerk
right now it might seem weird but I feel
like my expectations were higher for
this okay so we have a point three
megapixel camera on the front let's flip
around to that it kind of looks like I'm
underwater here we go oh yeah now I'm
gonna flip it back around it's having so
much trouble determining what the hell
is going on here quite washed out having
just looked at a very inexpensive
Android phone this thing feels
incredibly unpolished there you can see
my fingers in the back of the display
the display is terrible the display is
terrible the construction it feels sort
of like a toy so for some reason it
happens right in the tray here two
different sound toggles doesn't have
stereo speakers that's bizarre
irulu game different game collections
satisfy different players you can find a
friend and your interest gets tart or
hit probably not gonna sign up for that
I can't see why you would want to buy
this I don't know who needs this to
straight-up night I'm gonna have
nightmares about this screen does it
suck
it sucks it sucks this it sucks I
believe there's something better out
there for not too much more I'm gonna go
searching for it on an upcoming episode
of does it suck so stay tuned for that
but this one sucks
stay away does have microSD card
expansion alright that's it that's all I
can say about this thank you very much
for watching if you guys enjoy this new
series on the channel called does it

below and I'll catch you on the next
episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
