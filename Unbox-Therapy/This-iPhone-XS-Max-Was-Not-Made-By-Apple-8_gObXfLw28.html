the very first iPhone 10's max to me
because he's such a big fan of unbox
that no of course he didn't even invite
me to the event how to take matters into
my own hands how to reach out to China I
need an iPhone 10 s max what can you do
and then this came out this my friends
is an exact replica the 10 s max you
look at the description it's crazy what
they're able to do here they even tell
you to go to apple.com slash iphone
slash specs to see the spec list
infinite loop
Cupertino they have the address and so
on it's pretty wild they claim it's
Space Gray 256 gigabytes of storage if
you're unfamiliar these phones have been
pumped out every single iPhone release
and it will launch in many cases before
the actual version because I guess
they've got the specs and dimensions
available to them and they're like boom
let's put it into production this goes a
step further in the sense that the OS
even though it's Android in the
background it's gonna look like iOS
maybe you're gonna be able to fool some
people into thinking it's an actual
iPhone we'll find out this is a bit of a
giveaway obviously in the Apple box
you're not gonna have this bubble wrap
you definitely won't have this sticker
on the back oh look at this also
stickers over top of the logos I notice
another difference on the iPhone section
here normally you would have some text
underneath the word iPhone not in this
case here so it's bigger than the iPhone
10 this is me 10 over here quick
comparison of course Apple will still be
making this form factor but this is the
new guy the purpose of this video is to
see how close this replica really is
especially once I booted up the charge
brick can I say something can I just be
a little critical right now of Apple
because I really I feel that I have to
be a lot of people don't know but on the
next version those phones are capable of
quick charge but they're not giving you
a quick charge of brick in the box but
you would really expect Apple I mean
you're spending like a grand please put
the quick charge brick in the box please
it just seems like the right thing to do
no you will have to buy that as an extra
otherwise you're charging slow with the
little mini adapter
little screen protector there I mean it
really feels like an iPhone 10 to be
honest these buttons feel pretty good I
think the Apple logo might be a little
off-center ever so slightly plus is that
chin a bit bigger I think so
oh yeah definitely a much bigger chin
it's a dead giveaway
oh I don't know kind of convinced are
you convinced Jack look at that
is it snappy it's okay I don't know it's
not quite as fast now there's no way
that's OLED viewing angles not quite
there
it doesn't look terrible though
comparatively speaking let me see if I
can change the region here you can see
the settings menu very similar kind of
convincing the display like I said it's
a bit of a giveaway it's nowhere near as
vibrant as the actual one but usable ah
the multitasking actually working like
an iPhone it's incredible it's usable oh
yeah the camera must be terrible yeah
it's a terrible it's a cheapo camera
this is how you're gonna figure this out
ladies and gentlemen not a very sharp
image it has a zoom I don't know if it's
legit or not it's definitely not 2x look
how small that do this it's a crop what
about the front-facing camera huh it's
just grabbing focus on my eyeball for
some reason I don't know I guess the
front one's a bit better than the rear
one it's not good though it's not
comparable with anything that I would
recommend you buy right now let's put it
that way
what about the speaker of course we
should check that this keyboard is
another giveaway happy thought an Apple
advertisement perfect it doesn't sound
good
it does not say look I don't know why
these kind of phones exist I don't know
who wants this I can you fool someone
yeah maybe at a distance but what are
you doing there's so many great Android
phones that are gonna cost a similar
amount to this maybe you just you really
wanna you really need that logo in your
life this video with Tim Cook's fault
because I could have the real 10s max
sitting here right now with a proper
evaluation for you guys but I'm stuck
with this knockoff because he won't
answer my phone calls
otherwise I gotta wait till the device
actually comes out in the meantime this
is as close as you're gonna get as far
as an unboxing experience is concerned
straight from China to the unbox therapy
headquarters Tim Cook open invite get in
touch send the real deal we'll see if
it's any better than this one it's
definitely more expensive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
