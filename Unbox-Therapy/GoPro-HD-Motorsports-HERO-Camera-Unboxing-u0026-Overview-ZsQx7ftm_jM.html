unbox therapy today we've got the GoPro
for all you hardcore mofos this is a
rugged camera maybe the most rugged
that's out there it's waterproof guitar
sit around its intended for extreme
environments which I'm sure you could
put it through after we review the
outside portion of the box we see that
we have a traditional box underneath
that's taped to this museum quality
enclosure on the top side which is quite
the ambitious endeavor getting inside
this box as you can see there is a bit
of knife work involved it's kind of like
the West Side Story getting in here
anyway
inside the box here we're going to find
our accessories and first to come is our
paperwork which shares some packaging
with the battery and an extra door for
the waterproof enclosure that the GoPro
lives in next we have a bag of adhesive
mounts each one unique in its way of
mounting the GoPro as you can see there
are lots to choose from
next this is sort of the key to the
motorsports edition of this camera this
is the suction cup and it's incredibly
strong suction cup which allows for
mounting to the outside of any vehicle
get mounted on your windshield on the
hood of your car some gnarly looking
shots there's a USB cable sure you all
know that's about here we have our AV
cable in case you want to check out your
footage in standard definition not sure
why you'd want to this is more useful
the component cable to do the same thing
but in HD which this camera shoots so
you might as well lastly we have the
camera itself to look into and as you
can see it's quite impressive if you
look at the size in comparison to the
quality you're going to expect to get
out of this again we got to get our
knife skills involved I think it takes
me almost a dozen slashes to get inside
this box here I mean it's not such a bad
thing at least it's secure for shipping
but it might not be quite as good for
unboxing see I consider myself I would
be pretty decent unboxing knife -
there's some new one that my girlfriend
got but geez this package is resilient
look at that I thought I was in I'm not
even in there we go come on one more
slash let's get in bingo
salvation finished Wow we look at this
puppy you could just tell he'll be
mounted anywhere I mean it feels tough
and the size is crazy yeah I can't I
can't wait to get out hook this baby up
and get some footage I would never get
with any other kid
stay tuned I'll probably show some of it
on this channel and check out some of
our other unboxings peace and love peace
and love</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
