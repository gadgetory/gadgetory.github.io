always on the hunt for unusual gadgets
this falls into that category
it's called numbs but that's a weird
kind of name it's got a weird kind of
package
apparently you take this product put it
on your MacBook Pro trackpad and now you
have a digital number pad that lives
right on the trackpad that's kind of the
extent of my research so all you
accountant types number crunchers you've
been missing out what I'm more
interested in is the tech the idea of
some sort of overlay for your trackpad
which completely reimagines how you
would use it we're going to try it out
that's what we're here for
what does it say design for MacBook Pro
MacBook Air red dot design award best of
the best let's see what's going on here
let's see if this thing is any good what
okay
alcohol prep pad you know that's the
start of something fun here is the
device I mean it's kind of strange to
even call it a device whoa it is glass
or plastic I don't know it's see-through
it's clear look at this thing that's
what it looks like you can see there's a
few little toggle switches on there now
I don't know how you turn this thing on
and off and I'm not sure how you go back
to your traditional trackpad or if it
just functions that way on its own all
right anyway here we go MacBook Pro
would you like me to use the alcohol
prep pad here jack give er a once-over
it's a nice little freshen up God knows
Jack needs it okay here we go
this is like when you're putting on a
screen protector you got to be so
careful so here we go fits perfectly to
be honest so right now the trackpad it
feels absolutely normal working
perfectly fine to ask me an app okay
let's look this up oh yeah download the
driver here we go
the app is not really translated for
English Oh slide in word to start the
number pad Wow that's how easy it is now
it's in number mode and then it goes
back to Mouse mode normal trackpad
but if I grab from the top here and just
slide down
you see it tells you you're now in
number mode now all of a sudden just
like that
whoo look at the speed on that oh man I
think people might actually like this
what is it
whoo this little button down here brings
up a custom mode setup drag a URL or
file whoa
so each one of these buttons can be a
shortcut for whatever you want that's
cool
all right now what does this one do up
here Oh from up there you just launch
the keyboard straight away if you want
to use the calculator app you could do
that there I mean the thing here is
about speed right accountants banking
traders day traders and things like this
I also like how it's using gestures when
you move back to Mouse mode there's no
turning it off you just go back to using
it as a mouse okay I figured out the hot
key thing I could see this being
utilized for certain games that have key
combinations that you would use
frequently that are complicated and you
don't always want to type in so you're
in the bottom here you swipe up from the
corner to set up the custom keys command
C command B you can drag URLs so like
your bookmarks essentially the places
you like to visit frequently for example
we have YouTube set up as the number 4
you pull in from the side like this
watch see that and then it just picks up
where you want to go or what you want to
trigger so let's say it happens to be
YouTube I just let go on top of YouTube
and boom it takes me that place so I
mean I could see myself using that for
the frequent websites that I visit or as
I said before frequent key combinations
or things that you would normally have
to hack into a keyboard that you could
just have a swipe away I don't know
maybe it's even cooler just a quick
launch space on your macbook I'm not
really sure you get the audio feedback
as well which is helpful so I benefit it
protects your trackpad as well it's
super thin it doesn't affect the
trackpad usage I mean if you were gonna
get an external number pad for a MacBook
Pro this is definitely a more sleek
implementation you open this thing up on
an airplane and there's nothing to hook
up that could be you in some kind of
Excel spreadsheet just getting wild
because I know I know you number people
you like to get what you got to get wild
to at a certain point this is now your
you're crunching baby today's episode of
unboxed RP is brought to you by 23andme
