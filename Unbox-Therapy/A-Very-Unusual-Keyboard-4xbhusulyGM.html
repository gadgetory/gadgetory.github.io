product recently a mechanical keyboard
designed specifically for Mac you should
definitely go check it out because that
keyboard is actually on my desk right
now and I've really been enjoying using
it in my main setup today I've got an
alternative today I've got a brand new
product in fact you can't even buy it
yet it's a Kickstarter or an IndieGoGo
I'll have a link in the description but
it's a mechanical keyboard which also
offers a solution for Mac among other
operating systems as well this thing is
even capable of being used on mobile
devices like iOS Android and so on and
it's wireless no wire plus it's got a
really cool design where the key caps
are circular still mechanical but
circular kind of like on a typewriter so
from a design perspective an aesthetic
perspective it's catching a lot of
attention a lot of people are talking
about this particular keyboard so it's
called the low free it comes in a number
of different colors to suit your
particular setup and they're backlit
also so Wireless backlit mechanical good
looking pretty compelling stuff so
anyhow I figured since I recently
switched keyboards to a mechanical one
and here's one that adds wireless
functionality and apparently it's
low-power bluetooth definitely beyond
six months of battery life whoo all
right very nice the black key caps whoa
that is slick this is a completely
different take so you have this glossy
white finish here the black key caps
which also happen to be backlit again as
I said before ton of different color
combinations available certainly from an
appearance perspective this is very
nice-looking the Mac specific keys for
brightness expose the illuminated
backlight on the keyboard the multimedia
Keys volume and so on micro USB to
charge it up bluetooth on and off switch
a Windows Android or Mac slash iOS
switch if you have it switched to this
side it will work with both Mac and iOS
over Bluetooth and then on the other
side either window
or Android so tablets phones laptops
desktops it'll work with everything you
have these really solid rubber feet to
give it a little bit of an incline it
also has some some weight to it which
you might think hey I don't want it to
be too heavy but this is a thing that
you physically interact with so having a
weight they're kind of ensures that it
stays in the correct position this is so
unusual one thing that stands out to me
immediately though is this little
scenario over in the bottom corner
having the shift key here and then your
up arrow down arrow kind of off-kilter a
little bit that might take some getting
used to let slide in right here and as
you can see it would go straight back
that's a nice little touch you still
have your Windows key so the Windows key
and then the command key on the top you
have the identifier instead of one or
the other why is nobody ever thought of
this before that's genius a little bit
of love for everybody I'm going to try
it with my phone so I'll put it in
Android now if you look up here on key
one two and three you can see a
Bluetooth icon you hold the function
button and then the Bluetooth button
there it is dot low free look at that it
requires a little more precision from
you though I'm getting used to it now
another thing to mention these are the
the classy style of switches right like
who is this for will this displace the
keyboard that's on my desk right now in
my main setup probably not but in a home
office setting for a particular type of
setup at on the versatility of being
capable of transitioning to mobile
devices and desktop devices and laptops
and Windows and Mac and so on knows
where that could come into into use if
you've got like a big iPad or something
now you have something that kind of
slides right in there without being too
huge without needing to be wired in if
aesthetics are less important to you
then go watch my other video which was
published a little while ago that one
gives you a more traditional layout with
the square key caps and not such a
classy feedback if that's not what
you're looking for maybe that is this
almost looks better now a really cool
look with the
black keycaps and the deck underneath
being the glossy white that might be my
favorite aspect so far
it even illuminates a little low free
logo on the bottom of the spacebar and
these option window keys a little bit
that are on the side of the key cap if
you haven't gone out and upgraded your
keyboard here's an option that's going
to look a little bit better than a lot
of the other mechanical stuff on the
market now granted when it comes to
looks its kind of subjective some people
want the big transformer multicolored
flashing screaming at you party on deck
type scenario this ain't that but if
you're looking for something a little
different slightly different design
aesthetic a bit of a throwback to a
retro styling I don't know of any other
one out there like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
