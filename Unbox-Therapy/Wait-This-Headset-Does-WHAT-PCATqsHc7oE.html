concept infused with a new feature a new
take a new idea this is the very first
gaming headset computer PC gaming
headset I've ever seen in my life that
has air conditioning in the ear cups was
this a Willie dude situation
no it was me I can take full credit for
this when I heard about this I was like
I need to try that it can get hot in
there especially if it's the summer or
you live in a hot climate or something
it's the omen brand by HP that actually
makes these 7.1 virtual surround sound
breathable moisture wicking fabric ear
cup they claim is the world's first
active ear cup cooling technology so I
was assuming this was the first ever
we've seen this graphic here Jack look
at that that's gonna be us ice-cold ears
perfect for Jack assuming this will fit
over top of whatever he's got going on
look at that you got the road rage keep
them in the car you know cool off a
little bit I get hot you want to see me
when I'm hot that's a comfy situation
there I love the spring loaded headband
as well now the microphone over here
flips down got a little light on it if
you're a guy like Kirk you would try to
wear this on the bus on the airplane on
the subway train in the car how Kirk
drives to work mmm a nice textured
volume wheel there which has some weight
to it
lift it up you're muted bring it down
have a chat there we go now of course
you know I had to bring out the enormous
21 X probably the biggest craziest
gaming laptop known to mankind one of
the few gaming laptops I mean is it a
laptop let's be honest here you maniacs
we had to bring this out test out what
might be the coolest coolest coolest
how's this for a typing experience
though hey from the last video we're
talking about the iPad pro keyboard man
tell me you don't mean what you're
saying that's at the end of your email
I'm voting for you well come here for a
second sitting over there
demanding Oh Lou I'm gonna be he likes
the keyboard on the MacBook that's a
tough that's a tough one to defend some
people hate it
listen for the mechanical switches I
love green and blues there's a very
satisfying click to it kind of the same
thing for the MacBook with the butterfly
keys and that's that's the reason why I
like it how much did Apple pay you to
say that
why's Tim Cook's phone number in your
phone contacts why are you looking at my
phone it's part of the job are you want
to try use headphones out sure you don't
sound excited at all these things are
pretty affordable you're like doing it
bugs that easy money for you there Willy
do huh
we get those Apple dollars I want Tim
Cook hits you with that after the
keyboard comment yeah yeah okay we're in
are you feeling cooling yet no nothing
Jack give him a shot let the people see
the red lighting I will switch that to
blue for example boom blue love it we
got a color shift going on for Jack a
nice little light show there on the
cooling tab it says it it's high right
now you don't feel it no tell me if you
feel anything
oh there's cooling dude are you sure
absolutely
dude you're nuts really even if it's
like a subtle amount of cooling it's
gonna have an impact right it's cold
it's working right now squeeze it like
that yeah yeah if it's closer to nature
it's a fridge in there man you feel it
radiating from the metallic component
but no turbine effect of like having a
fan it's getting colder right now as I
wear it okay I love this feeling right
now it's not overwhelming it's honestly
just like as if I had an open back
headphone Kirk ooh yeah it's gotten
colder the longer it's been plugged in
we should probably listen to it right
now as well
Digital 7.1 surround test that's a good
time that's do you want to give it a go
sure it's a great time in there Haley's
in another world right now
he left this planet man's gone yeah it's
nice it's a good time in there yeah I
think oh here we go
no no I think it's actually more
immersive with the cooling more
immersive with the cooling yeah I mean
like if you're gaming and you have like
a hot head it's just like it doesn't
work like yeah you're frustrated yeah he
just gets a text message right now it's
like well insert the air pod comment
right it's like will are the
what's going on here I think if you're a
serious gamer you spend a lot of time
inside of a headset Wow
it's comfortable to be in there if
you're in Guadalajara yeah
there's no fan it's not interfering with
the audio at all I think this is a hit
right here and I think some people are
gonna like it not over that you said
they're around 200 bucks
yup and they get them on Amazon what can
they do on Amazon look at that
Willy do ladies and gentlemen bringing
you the coolest new gadgets even though
I brought you this one he did did ya no
wonder it's pretty good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
