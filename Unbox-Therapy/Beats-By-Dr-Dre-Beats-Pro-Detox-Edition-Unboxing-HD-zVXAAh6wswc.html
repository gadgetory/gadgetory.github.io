therapy and today we're taking a look at
the beats by dr. dre beats Pro limited
detox Edition that was a mouthful but
these are basically just a new
incarnation of the original beats Pro
with a slightly different color scheme
and that designation that I talked about
you can say you get to detox models now
that's worth an extra hundred bucks to
you well then I guess it's worth it but
a lot of people are going to make the
argument that you should just go for a
standard version of the beats Pro but
who cares money ain't a thing right so
we got some boring documentation I'm
going to get that out of your way next
we've got our monster clean cloth which
for the rest of us is just a microfiber
cloth we have our mini jack cable which
has a nice right angle gold-plated
connector along with a screw on quarter
inch adapter next we've got a little
carrying pouch whether you're going to
be storing these or taking them with you
you want to make sure that you're going
to keep on protected after all they are
$500 headphones so that's nice to have
as you can see we have a lot of metallic
surfaces here as well as what feels like
a leather headband that has that dr. Dre
detox designation along the surface on
the interior we have some metallic
identifying plates there's our connector
for our cable really high quality
materials at first glance now these
headphones they fold up whether it be
for DJing or just for travel into a much
smaller package so that's a useful
design for sure here's an even closer
look at that surface material and even
better look at that dr. Dre detox
designation and here's a look at the
super tight adjustment band anyway guys
