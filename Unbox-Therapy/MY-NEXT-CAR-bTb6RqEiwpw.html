I'll fall off it a little bit be up here
absolute mayhem but I'm gonna bring it
off to you that's my job the
unbelievable technology what's up guys
Lew here and as you can tell I am on the
show floor at CES 2016
it's incredible there are human beings
everywhere they all want to see what is
hot what is new what is fresh like pizza
I'm gonna for booth right now and there
is a lot happening in here from a tech
perspective but there's something that
catches your attention
the moment that you step into this booth
and it's over there it's bright it's
yellow that my friends is the new Ford
GT I want to I want to share some of
this really sophisticated stuff with you
real quick just before we talk about
that behind me this is obviously an
autonomous driving setup and you can see
on the top those fancy things spinning
around there those babies are shooting
lasers out millions in fact this car can
map space 3d as you'll see on the
displays up there they can see all those
human beings so you can tell how tall
they are starting with green down at
their feet level and then all the way up
to pink at their head so the car is
interpreting exactly what that object is
and it's doing so in real time by
driving around a space first and
building a layer let's call it a layer
and then within that layer you've got
sort of the the baseline for what that
Street looks like when you come back
around the next time it can then create
this new layer in real time for objects
in that path that weren't there before
this is where all the magic happens or
at least some of the magic painting this
picture it's building this map and
essentially it's learning how to become
a better driver than you are I know
that's the future you're not driving
anymore you're going to be in the
backseat sleeping if you're like Jack
you might be doing other things the next
thing I want to show you is a little bit
different this is something that's
available now and I'm pretty sure you're
all going to want so let's head over
there tell me when you got it locked
Tommy when monopolies look
beautiful let's get a profile we looked
at autonomous vehicles over there it's
not something you can buy right now
unfortunately but here we finally have
apple carplay and android auto living in
harmony with sync three I think you can
tell that I'm excited can you tell that
I'm excited no reason to be glancing at
your device while you're trying to drive
please eyes on the road people just like
that oh my goodness that is my phone in
my vehicle on my nice big display but
the whole idea here is to take all of
those things that you do on your device
that you shouldn't be doing while you're
driving and pairing it down to a nice
easy to use interface say I go back to
sing I can still use sync and I can boot
into Android auto when I want to use it
but what it remembers is my preference
it remembers that I want to use Google
Maps so even though I'm in sync if I
click on maps which now took over that
icon I'm going to Google Maps choice
it's about choice
who doesn't want choice I want choice
Jack you want choice Mike you want
choice Christian choice there we go
everyone agrees it's time to talk a
little bit about that thing the brand
new Ford GT unbelievable that thing is
made completely of carbon fiber it's a
legitimate race car this thing will be
on the track in a configuration very
similar to what you're looking at this
vehicle has Gorilla Glass for a
windshield never mind your phone Gorilla
Glass front of your eyeballs when you're
driving super limited write a little
letter to Ford and tell them why this
belongs in your driveway and your little
trips to Starbucks they're not going to
cut it everything on this design is
about air flow sending it through the
various channels you get a car like this
I think you I don't know you might
instantly become a superhero I'm not
sure I think that's the way it works
I mean I think I feel like I could just
stare at it look at this see how the
rear lights there they're actually
carved out for airflow you see that
every car is gonna basically be custom
configured for you
this seat inside actually doesn't move
so the driving dynamics remain the same
no matter who the driver is
instead the steering wheel and other
components come towards you all right
there you have it guys a quick little
look around the Ford booth here at CES
2016 some future tech we showed you
Android auto or apple carplay and sync 3
in all 2017 models and then we showed
you the vehicle that I want to leave
this place with we showed you four GT
hope you guys liked it if you did make
sure to leave a thumbs up down below and
I'll catch you very shortly more stuff
from here the show floor CES 2016 don't
miss it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
