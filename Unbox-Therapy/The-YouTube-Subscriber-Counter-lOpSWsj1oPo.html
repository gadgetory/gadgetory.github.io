were closed the shop doors
I heard McDonald's is hiring so you may
have heard of this thing maybe not I
don't know it's it's called lumetri time
and you're looking at it right now and
you're like that's probably a clock well
it is but it isn't because it's really
so much more I don't even think I'm
gonna use this thing as a clock at all
I'm gonna use it as a kind of social
digital metric counter a gigantic
YouTube button with a real-time
subscriber count so I can keep Jack
motivated because he's starting to get
concerned he's over there like this I
don't know what that means he doesn't
even wear a watch
that's like universally known as the
movement of hey or maybe this one too
let's get her going get her moving you
can even map out your own image you can
make your own image and have it all nice
and pixelated here it can run back
real-time news thermometer can let you
know when you wake up in the morning you
can even have this thing playing
animation when your taxi arrives or when
your package is delivered now one thing
I want to mention right now this thing
is not cheap this is for people who want
the most advanced kind of clock possible
it's even got a speaker built-in like
you can playback music on it but that's
kind of an afterthought it's not really
a greatest speaker ever at least that's
where my expectation is currently just a
nice little black brick there look at
that thing over here you have a speaker
grille a USB port that's gonna be for
the power adapter and a headphone jack
which is kind of funny the international
adapters Europe UK here in the office
will put in a public spot maybe on a
little side table over there
like I said morale for Jack for Tom we
still have subscribers would you look at
that people are still watching I know
it's hard to believe there's you you're
there I'm here I don't believe it it's
kind of cool looking for the web it's
looking for the app looking for
something you guys are seeing these scan
lines on the video feed that's just a
refresh rate like you don't see that in
real life in real life it just looks
solid make sure it's switched on and
you'll see the following image yes that
I'm seeing that right now now I'm going
to connect this to the Wi-Fi in here
so it's constantly connected it doesn't
need to be connected to my phone to
display stuff there we go now Jack
should we try to hit you at a shutter
speed where it's not there you go
there's a few apps that are in there by
default clock Weather Radio stopwatch
and timer but then you can add more apps
to it as well I can do a 15 minute
countdown whatever I want
Jack you want one of these in the
kitchen nope and in the bedroom ding
ding ding message board stock quotes
news email notifications google
analytics philips hue youtube channel
subscriber let's try this out alright
here we go
zero subscribers oh my goodness jack
we're closed the shop doors
I heard McDonald's is hiring you ever
flip a burger I can log into my channel
here alright Jack don't show them any of
this you can get a sound effect
every time somebody subscribes let's go
with cash maybe you have an online
business and every time an order comes
in the whole team is like boom I don't
know what it's saying right now oh
that's nice wow there's so many sound
effects oh look at that number there
Jack
I wonder how frequently this thing is
updated oh we need something more
pleasant than that sound there you go
then go back to the clock back to the
weather radio and whichever apps I have
installed I want to try out the Twitter
app are you feeling motivated yet Jack
Wow look at this so you could track
followers tweets mentions or search so
we'll do followers first it still notify
us of every subscriber on Twitter it'll
show you the follower name that seems
crazy when it comes to the social
metrics I think this is more for like a
team environment somewhere where you're
looking for motivation you're like hey
the morning we had 18 followers and look
at now we're getting we're getting more
so that's max volume nothing that's not
it's it's it's an alarm clock it's not
if you want a better speaker for it it
has the headphone jack you could put it
into any Bluetooth speaker you have or
whatever there's like there's a ton of
stations here let's try BBC news here
we'll add that but I mean as if you're
gonna use this for headlines I just
don't see that we think it's time square
or something okay that's not the way it
looks in real life though that's insane
I'm having a seizure right now okay no
that's we're not using it like that get
out of here but I think the social
counter is kind of cool the pixelated
design of it is kind of got a good look
in my opinion there's a design aspect
that you're paying for here I told you
this thing is not cheap a gadget head
who has every gadget and want something
to excite themselves with the rest of
you trust me I know who even uses a
clock you got a clock on your phone but
the most exciting thing for us in the
studio we're gonna have this little baby
flashing motivation can you put a price
on motivation look at these people
they're counting on you Tom they want
your candy and they're coming for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
