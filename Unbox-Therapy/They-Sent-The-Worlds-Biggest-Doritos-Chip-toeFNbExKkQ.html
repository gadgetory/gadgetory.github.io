in fact will sliced the cardboard box
and was like Lou I think you're gonna
need to take a look at this and I was
like you're probably right and take a
look at it I will this is what it was
Jurassic Doritos a giant metal crate
seeming to imply some type of gigantic
Dorito chip no it's not a new smartphone
it's not a new laptop it is a giant
Dorito chip I'm gonna take a bite of it
on the side of the container you can see
Jurassic world fallen Kingdom a couple
of giant clamps on the front here we go
like it's some sort of top-secret very
sensitive material inside hmm
congratulations you're now the lucky
owner of the biggest and boldest Doritos
chip ever created only 100 Doritos chips
will be released into the wild so take
good care of it or just eat it of course
that's what I'm doing you think I'm
gonna look at a giant Dorito chip and
not eat it Jack what do you even know me
certificate of authenticity all right
that ain't no fake that ain't a fake
giant Doritos chip it's a real one
number thirty nine out of a hundred okay
I'm gonna be very careful here oh man
it's like a giant dinosaur egg oh oh do
you see that Jack it's a giant chip an
official giant Doritos chip R&amp;amp;D test
sample not for sale
doritos nacho cheese flavored now see I
knew it was gonna be nacho cheese but
there was a few people disagree with me
for example Kirk chops over there goes
by the name Kirk chops and his choice
not mine if they're gonna do it big
they're gonna go oh gee it's gonna be
nacho cheese and that of course is what
it is like this is art if you put this
on the back wall and people pay money
just to weep in front of the world's
largest Dorito I'd weep in front of that
but of course I got
I don't know if I've ever been so
careful opening anything before the
Illuminati confirmed guys you have to
understand I did not know this was
showing up all right this is unplanned I
don't know very surgical procedure
I smell nacho cheese it's one of the
more limited edition things I've ever
opened up if you think about it there's
a hundred of these I mean where do you
go from here where do you go from the
world's largest Dorito I don't know
let's try the chip why don't we try the
chip okay here we go
man holy moly that's nacho cheese many
important moments in history you have
moon landing Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock
you got the pyramids in Egypt feats of
engineering but now you have this
they didn't just scale up the chip this
way it's thicker and must be thicker to
maintain its shape see that bite I took
right there that might have been three
Doritos in one bite sometimes life
surprises you with the giant Dorito in
today's that day for me will you do good
over here take a bite now get in here
Willy do you deserve it you've been so
upset recently that's too rough I'm all
the crying behind the scenes I just want
to make it right do me proud it's up to
you easy there
geez aggressive that's good I feel like
there's a lot more seasoning on this one
that's what I thought that's the biggest
three dough in the world and that's
Willy dude please gentlemen
and that's what we do all right close
the show thanks for watching it's all I
got
do you guys want to try I ended it I'm
good early this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
