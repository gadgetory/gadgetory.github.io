called the store candle charger you're
using a candle that they've included
which you can burn indoors I don't know
if it says that I should or shouldn't in
the event of a power outage or some sort
of storm or emergency this could be one
of the few ways to get juice back to
your device I could see this being
popular amongst those survival-type
dudes or just your average person so
essentially the way it works you've got
this candle that's lit on the bottom it
heats up this water on the top which
then in turn somehow charges up
whichever device you connect to it could
be a phone could be a flashlight there
you get a better at you exactly how it
works also says one minute of charge
time can provide two minutes a cellphone
talk time which in an emergency could be
the difference between life and death by
zombie apocalypse I'm guessing the water
is going to evaporate that evaporation
Steve steam is different from
evaporation right this ain't science
class kids but you already knew that
this is the candle okay so that's not
your average candle six hour burn time
that is a serious candle soaked in fuel
there ethylene glycol and diethylene
glycol stove slash charge portion while
you're charging I guess you could make
some noodles or something why not right
double use so this is kind of cool no
like this
what am I doing wrong here oh oh that
moves like that that's actually a handle
right there so this is where your heat
is gonna touch your water will boil in
there you're gonna have juice coming to
this USB port right here so that will
stay up there like that and then your
candle slides in right here once you've
got it lit I should get some water
whew
it's lit and hot that's cool you cannot
see that flame it burns completely clean
you can't see it at all that water's
gonna have to heat up significantly
before we're getting any juice over here
oh my goodness we're already green
though into my device charging right
away the water is not even boiling yet
78% charging on AC as far as its
concerned is connected to an AC outlet
right now let's let that charge for a
little bit
and
Dannan men
no denna dun-dun-dun think we got 1% yet
78 still I mean this is a nice little
kit keep it in your truck keep it in
your closet maybe a power outage that's
a thing that actually happens someone
cuts your power lines like special ops
some high-tech thief they cut your power
lines
you got your 9-1-1 back hey imagine
Macaulay Culkin had this we all set what
I like about this is it starts charging
right away before the water even starts
boiling so the water boiling is like a
little bonus all of a sudden we could be
making macaroni and cheese on here you
could have you know some noodles or
something some soup all right let's
check if we got a percentage point on
here 79 with the phone on the entire
time and obviously apps running and
whatever else now let's take this iPhone
over here so far I'm saying my
expectations have been exceeded all
right we're going to stick it into the 7
plus instantly charging so it's 3
percent charge right now I'm going to do
the same thing see how long it takes us
to get a percentage point getting some
substantial heat here so long as you can
continue to find a way to heat this
thing you're charging forever in a pinch
you put a wax candle under there like
one of those fancy candles that uh with
the scent and you're probably still
getting juice for we just went up for
four one percent charge this thing is
legit too bad we didn't have some
noodles or something hey the peak power
is three point three watts 650 milliamp
sat 5 volts and this container is 150
milliliters capable of sterilizing water
at 1 liter per hour this is that 5% now
as well all right time for the moment of
truth though we've got some tofu miso
soup here and the question is can the
stove cook the soup this is a
multitasking here not just charging with
cooking at the same time
little bit of miso soup while I'm
charging here just cooking away oh my
goodness look at that it looks like the
real stuff right there
mmm not bad I like this thing burns
clean comes with the little pot solid
connection to the device seven percent
it's been charging the whole time
it hasn't kicked off once what do you
need in an emergency
little miso soup and your smartphone and
who's better than you you're not even
going to notice the power's out you're
not even going to notice the zombies
banging on your door you'll be playing
candy crush</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
