business this is the beats Edition
including the beats solo headphones not
too many of these left around anymore
they're trying to push the new env
versions that don't include the
headphones you gotta buy those
separately
I believe they give you a little bit of
a kickback on a price but this is the
package that everybody wants this is the
package it's going to have your laptop
and your matching headphones so you
could beat it cool this kid in school
you understand anyway as we open it up
here had a little trouble at first but
we can see the reason the box is so big
is because we got some high quality
amazing headphones beats by dre solos
everybody knows and those are just the
appetizer because the main course is the
HP Envy itself might I say this baby is
packaged beautifully I don't even think
I've ever opened a laptop packaged as
beautifully at this I mean it's some
high quality cardboard of high quality
foam is nothing else in this box let's
get rid of that one now let's get into
the let's get into the meat so as you
can see get a little sleeve here on the
outside of the box that has to be
removed first that signifies it's the
beats Edition we lift up the box here
we're greeted immediately by some
paperwork but it's nice looking paint
working meaning it ain't every day
paperwork next we got the laptop itself
and it's a you know being packaged
already in this microfiber sleeve feel
soft to the touch and you know you can
use that
on a day-to-day basis as a sleeve when
you you know put it into your bag and
whatnot
here is a SD card that includes all your
manuals and whatnot from HP don't no
need for more paper there try and get in
here and show you everything that comes
with it here we have half of the power
cord sure you see knows before it's
fairly straightforward stuff next we
have the other half the power cord you
know these these things come in three
pieces now and lastly we got the power
brick I believe that's right and look
how then that baby is that is like the
thinnest power adapter I think I've ever
seen and it's also got a usb on it a USB
connector so you can charge your USB
devices without the need for an extra
power brick on the wall just your USB
cable so we got everything out of there
let's push this to the side and take a
look at the laptop I know that's why
everybody's here so we slide it out of
this beautiful protective sleeve here
the first thing I notice the top of this
laptop is cold cold aluminum god damn
that's beautiful you see that you get
the beats logo up top along with the HP
logo flip that puppy open my goodness
you get the red light keyboard stick
around we got some beautiful macro shots
of this baby
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
