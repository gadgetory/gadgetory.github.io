haunted haunted bike the jack reveal
guys I think Jack's still up there are
we making a video then it's a big crate
zai Dex these guys in the past they sent
us a crazy system the most expensive and
outlandish custom PC that we had ever
featured here on the channel but of
course it wasn't enough
Willie do told me that what's inside of
this crate is worth around 40,000
dollars that's what you said right
you said $40,000 see how he just nods
over there
he's a sick man it's got a bunch of
NVIDIA Quadro cards in it because we
have to run a tremendous number of
pixels off of this system I know it's
custom water-cooled it's just it's
bananas we're gonna open it that's step
one ah the spec list of course you care
about this we're grateful to be able to
provide you with one of the most insane
pcs ever made oh also deal for unbox
therapy fans 5% off if you buy one of
these bad boys those are the specs
absolutely nuts especially right in here
three times Nvidia GV 100 32 GB strictly
bananas basically a fruit salad melons
strawberries raspberries blueberries
little granola yogurt if you're into it
it's in there it's a grocery store in
there
well what's the custom water-cooling is
by Carlos controller I know this is
gonna have some serious lighting look at
that
hand sign handcrafted in the USA using
only the best components that doesn't
get your juices flowing
oh okay whoa
like some kind of item in the Museum of
Modern Art we are powering that
incredible wall of television so for
those of you that have seen that set up
in other videos when we're sitting on
the couch and whatnot you're like Lou I
just see all I'm seeing up there are
these fancy backgrounds well you didn't
know that the horsepower was there to do
a lot more including stitched together
those TVs to play video games of course
what do you say shall we play a little
willy-nilly willy-nilly willy-nilly with
a healer will a hill a hill a wheelie
Hill a wheeler wheeler healing healing
healing really oh I was nice I was I had
that baby lined up oh okay Oh
is that calling gentlemen set off the
knows word angle there's a 1g one for
all marbles all right so obviously this
all came together because of zai Dex and
their amazing custom building skills
specifically on the water cooling side
as you can see there's like a custom
reservoir and all kinds of tubing
heading in every direction but the other
big player that put this thing together
and really made it possible was Nvidia
with these GV 132 gigabyte Quadro cards
these things are capable of syncing up
tremendous amounts of data you have an
Intel Core i nine in there which is
overclocked to 4.2 gigahertz we got the
crazy light up ram from g.skill there's
a couple of super fast SSDs in a form of
Samsung 860 pros and then the majority
of the other accessories are from
Corsair you've got the fans power supply
unit and the case is the obsidian series
1000d wow that was a good save
he was so up the line again off the
crossbar it's full they call that bar
down oh that was so close
oldest comes with me now he put all this
on the line for that game say bye-bye
No Deal
No Deal oh you're sorry let's go
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
