another video and today I have something
slightly insane to share with you this
is crazy
at least the craziest iPhone case I've
ever seen it is the task lab task 122
tools in one eye phone case let's go
ahead jump inside the box and see what
this thing can do as far as an iPhone
case is concerned usually a case just
does one thing which is protect your
phone from drops and scratches etc this
is on another level 22 tools in one case
wow it looks like some of the different
tools are already expanding ah that is a
sharp blade sticking out of this iPhone
case that's no joke and you can control
all of the different items from the back
here Wow
ok on the back here you can see you've
got pliers a kickstand you can remove
the knife there's a knife release button
bottle opener Universal blade mount
allen wrench and screwdrivers so the
instructions for this thing are
underneath this little covering you can
see there's an assembly wrench
I'm not overtighten it's never a good
idea to over tighten I don't care what
you're doing ok if you're swapping your
tires out don't over tighten don't under
tighten either don't over tighten Wow
look at this massive user manual whoa
task 1 your multi-tool conquer your life
ok so I have installed the task 1 on to
my iPhone pretty simple procedure you've
got these two bolts on the bottom that
need to be loosened and then tighten
back up after you have the phone
inserted once you've got this primary
lock in the central location you can
start to test out the different
functionality of the case the first
thing I want to test is the bottle
opener which is on the bottom side of
the knife portion so it actually has two
locks on it it has any primary lock and
then it's also got this auto lock
probably because it
the most dangerous item in this case so
what you're going to want to do is slide
over the auto lock and then you can go
ahead and extend the bottle opener let's
test it out
Oh convenient beer in the house perfect
okay the moment of truth it looks like
it's gonna function I hope we don't have
too much foam here oh we definitely do
for some reason you got a love live
television okay so there we go
it worked the phone didn't get drenched
the floor did a little bit well that was
worth it then I get anything on the
table no we're good we're good all right
so there you have it the bottle opener
functions and in order to put it back in
you just pull the auto lock back over
and then you're locked back into place
and again if you were going to put this
in your pocket you slide over the
primary lock and then it's definitely
not going anywhere you have two separate
locking mechanisms that are holding it
together and not allowing it to pop out
in your pocket and stab you in the leg
the next one the most gruesome is the
knife blade and you'll see that you see
how it just slides down there when you
don't have that secondary lock on so you
push it up and push the primary lock
over and then it's locked into place and
dangerous look at that thing that's
nasty oh my goodness so you have a saw
blade on one side and then you have a
knife blade on the other side there
that's pretty crazy looking now what's
the action gonna be like I don't know
not the best obviously it's it's not
going to be as good as a real knife but
in a sticky situation when you need a
blade you've got one and it's attached
to your phone
I guess that's badass don't take this to
school or anything like that okay people
so putting it back down again slide the
primary lock over slide it down and
you'll see the auto lock boom snaps into
place so you can see there's a little
trend here going
now this also controls the screwdrivers
which are housed over here so if you
want to use those you just push this all
the way over you please shot them out to
little screwdriver attachments they fit
into the top here actually pretty nice
so you know if you're going to do some
screw driving you're all set
on the bottom there's another
interesting tool we have tweezers this
is the toughest one to get out there we
go so again kind of tight right now but
that will loosen up over time as you you
know loosen the spring and you can see
look at that
little tweezers little pliers wonder
what that grips like that's that's legit
that's squeezing my finger so anyways
there you can see it in action there we
go okay so it's an allen key wire
stripper type situation if you have
fasteners or something in your in a
tough spot where you don't have your
tool kit with you you have an
alternative so that's really how it goes
that's all the different tools in the
task one obviously this is not for
everyone isn't it it's for a very
specific type of person that doesn't
want to be caught off guard
without their tools if you guys are
interested in finding out more
information checking out the price for
this thing I will have a link down in
the description as I said before maybe
this would be a cool gift for someone
who always wants to have a tiny little
set of tools on them at all times and
it's carrying an iPhone anyways so I
should test this out I don't know let me
know in the comments what you guys want
me to do with this case eat with it

steak cut an apple I don't know we
