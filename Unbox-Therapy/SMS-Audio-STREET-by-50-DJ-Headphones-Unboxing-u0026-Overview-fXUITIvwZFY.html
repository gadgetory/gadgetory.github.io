therapy and today we're taking a look at
the SMS audio Street by 50 DJ pro
performance headphones now don't confuse
these with the original Street by 50
headphones those have also been featured
on my channel and I'll link the video
down in the description so you can
actually do the comparison and see the
differences of course the main
difference here is the fact that these
are called DJ headphones and while you
might not know what that means it breaks
down pretty simply most DJ's have to
monitor two different tracks of audio at
any given time so you got to monitor
what you're playing to the audience as
well as what you're queuing up to play
next that means you only want to have
one ear cup on and these make that a
very easy function in a very comfortable
thing to do like other DJ headphones
have done in the past so each ear cup
twists up above your ear I'll show you
more about that in a quick moment just
like other SMS audio products this is a
beautiful unboxing experience you have a
very high quality box along with some
paperwork you have a carrying case on
the headphones I'll get to that in a
moment
but first of course the boring stuff the
paperwork we do have to get through it
so you have the warranty information as
well as the Quick Start Guide and then
there's a pamphlet which outlines the
different SMS audio products that are
currently available right now including
the sync wireless headphones I've also
featured those I've featured a lot of
SMS audio products these being the
newest now you do have a nice little
carrying case and you'll notice it's
smaller than the carrying case that came
with the street and sync models that's
because these headphones not only do
they twist when you want to use them as
a DJ but they also fold up nice and
small so there also may be a better
choice for people who travel often and
try and keep the size of what they're
traveling with down to a minimum so as
you guys can see here other than that at
first glance they look a lot like the
street by 50 headphones they don't have
the blue accents these ones are a little
bit more stealth a little bit more
understated actually this is a good time
to mention if you guys are interested in
pricing and availability on these
headphones I'm gonna have a link right
down below in the descriptions
definitely go and check that out if you
are interested in pricing and
availability but here's what I'm talking
about you can twist the ear cups so that
you can wear them in a comfortable
fashion while keeping one ear free I've
also seen people use DJ style headphones
just in the street you know
when they're talking to their friends or
if you just want to be aware of your
surroundings that also makes sense they
only have one ear cup on and one ear cup
off something else that's really cool in
this package is that you get a couple of
different cable options the first of the
two is the more professional more
durable DJ style cable it's pretty thick
it's also coiled which means it's not
going to pull out inadvertently
from whichever device it's plugged into
it also features a locking adapter for
quarter-inch connection to pro audio
equipment whether that be a mixer or
otherwise the second cable is sort of a
more standard cable that you see with
headphones this one is for your portable
audio devices it features mini jack
connectors on each end as well as a
inline microphone for answering phone
calls if you're using it with your
smartphone it's also a very thick and
pretty durable looking cable so I'm
impressed with both cables I know it's
tough to get excited about cables but I
see so many of them and some are cheap
some are better these are some of the
best that I've seen you might not think
that it matters to have a thick cable on
your cable or to have a thick cable
rather than a narrow cable or a thin
cable but the reason I get excited about
it because it means they're going to be
less prone to twists to Nick's etc so
it's just a little added bonus that I'm
personally happy about so here's a
closer look at the actual headphones and
what you're going to notice here is they
look very similar like I said before to
the street by 50 headphones as you can
see you've got female connectors for
your audio cable on each ear cup so once
again as a preference thing you can use
whichever side you want and prefer to
have the cable running down each of the
two ear cups will twist up in the DJ
fashion that I mentioned earlier so once
again another preference aspect if you
prefer to have your right ear open left
ear open you can do either one of those
things they have the understated SMS
logo here so it isn't in blue or
anything it's just a nice little gray so
you know these are like I said a little
bit more stealth than the standard
Street by 50 or even the sync by 50 for
that matter you've got beautiful plush
leather ear cups as well as a nice
leather headband with some beautiful
stitching so overall a pretty nice
looking package anyway guys that's been
a quick look at the brand new DJ pro
performance headphones from SMS audio if
you guys are interested in pricing and
availability link is down in the
description thanks as always for
watching catch on the next one</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
