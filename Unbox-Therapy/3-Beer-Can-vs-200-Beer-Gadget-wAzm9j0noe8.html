seriously literally and figuratively
pumped up we got something called the
physics I'm not sure what it came from
if it was like a Kickstarter or what I
know it's on Amazon launchpad now though
this thing takes normal beer that comes
in a can or a bottle and turns it into
draught beer or draught like beer which
is shocking to me I mean generally
speaking with a draught beer you're
gonna you're gonna get a little bit more
carbonation now they claim here freemium
ization the physics behind great beer a
fresh from the top flavor and taste they
dig the science runs on a battery and
it's compatible with all styles of
carbonated beer that's what they say you
can achieve with the physics beer will I
be able to tell the difference we're
gonna find out we'll do a blind test
maybe this thing's a scam maybe it sucks
now if you're not a beer drinker I
understand what happens if you put a
coca-cola in here jack what do you get
more carbonation maybe that's a test for
another day anyway this is exciting this
is real exciting instruction manual
little handle there that's you pulled on
the top just like you would if you had a
keg kind of looks like one of those
Keurig machines it kind of looks like a
coffee machine or something now the
reason it is this size is because it
could do a can bottle and those bigger
things like the large bottle you might
get from a craft brewery called a a
growler are they called a growler just a
lot yeah okay flick up the locks on
either side lift it up and that's it you
have an empty chamber in there and then
this little straw goes into your beer
source whatever that happens to be the
other package here contains a base this
is to keep the unit stable as well as
give you a platform to put your beverage
that's a good look this guy just kind of
there it is that is a good look to it I
mean you have this thing at a party
you're hosting a party of this on the
counter alright now this little guy
that's him
you pull down they said its battery
operated but where there it is okay
so it takes four double A batteries
hopefully they have juice in them put
your hose into your beverage
close the lid block the clasp pull to
tap and push the top
whoa now I have no bartending experience
here so but apparently you pull it down
when you're pouring the tap and then you
push it up to top for the fizz I have a
couple cans of beer here right in there
now truthfully I probably wouldn't use
this with at all can i think the growler
concept is kind of nicer because then
you can pour a few beers out of it and
that just slides in there lock it down
got our mighty mug Beer Cup remember
yeah go check that video if you're
wondering what magic that just was so
this goes over here pull to pour and
push to top:0 bartender experience at
play okay here we go
coming in hot and then you get to the
top and you can what happens if I push
the other way it's just full Oh really
thick did you see that it's like a very
dense foam it kind of looks like a
Guinness or something oh man the
difference between the beers on foam and
the physics foam can you see that very
interesting now my poor probably could
have been a little bit better but I'm
gonna give it a taste test nonetheless
hmm does it taste like draught maybe
yeah when you push this thing in the
opposite direction let's check it out I
just wanna I just want to show you look
at the thickness of that foam that is
draft style foam the density is
completely different than what you get
with the bubbles just pouring a can into
a into a glass if I could tell the
difference other than I think that sells
the thing on its own
okay so jack has set up these glasses in
front of me here I don't know which one
is which same can appear one came
through the physics machine and one came
straight out of the can
it's actually quite different okay I'm
ready to I'm ready to meet my take my
guess I think the left hand was the
physics one and the right hand was out
of the can it was right you can tell the
difference it's like a creaminess you
can sense the carbonation in your mouth
but it's like you could tell the bubbles
are smaller a more full more balanced
kind of flavor it just tastes a little
bit more special
both people the preference would lean
towards a draught beer so the entire
concept here is to bring that experience
onto your countertop and I mean I think
they've done it now I don't have a third
beer here that's actually straight out
of the draft I would I guess I would
need to be at a bar for something like
that but certainly this tastes closer to
draught beer as they've intended for
double-a batteries this theme it's not a
complicated device I don't know what's
going on how they're creating that
scenario inside here what science is at
play you can let me know in the comments
but put this on your countertop host a
party be the coolest kid in town and I'd
be surprised if you took anything I said
seriously over the past couple of
minutes because I got the special look
going on whatever
let's get festive much love</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
