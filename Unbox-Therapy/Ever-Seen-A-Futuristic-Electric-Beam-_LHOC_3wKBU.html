world that's the claim the plasmatic ex
from a company called Elementium lighter
they say the most badass lighter in the
world now right about now you're
wondering what makes a badass lighter I
don't get it doesn't it just light or
not light not so much it's more
complicated than that like many things
in life and many things that you see
here on unbox therapy this is step up
this lighter is USB rechargeable that
doesn't even seem right like how is a
lighter
there's no butane in here flameless and
windproof 100 plus lights per charge and
beard friendly although I didn't know
that regular lighters weren't beard
friendly let's find out
geez now you're thinking with a lighter
that must only be for people who want to
smoke cigarettes no you might want to
start a fire you might be a survivalist
type dude and you don't want to rely on
the traditional medium for starting a
flame or you just like cool stuff like
me and you want to check it out well
look at that right there if that ain't
cool I don't know what is look at the
bottom there micro USB to charge it up
I'm gonna put that down from I feel so
fancy oh my goodness
here is the micro USB cable for charging
it up I hope it has a little bit of a
charge on it they also sent me this one
over here slightly different design look
at that got the like wood grain
appearance to it so Dixie's we're about
to have a magic moment together look at
this lift that up it looks kind of like
a taser you see that there and then you
hit the button oh can you are you that's
insane it's like a purple
it's like a purple electric I can't even
blow it are you kidding me right now
that's futuristic right there look at
this who wants come on what kind of
losers gonna pull that thing out oh by
the way in the wind you oh you are
lighting stuff if what you need to do is
light it would not be an unbox therapy
video without a demonstration we are
bringing back the Don Tomas from a
previous video I don't even remember
what that video was where did these come
from it was the case in the iPhone case
with a built in lighter go watch that
video that's a crazy one I told you in
that video I don't smoke I don't
recommend you to either but for the
purpose of demonstration sometimes it's
just your job to do so it's like a movie
actor you know Tom Cruise if the role
calls for a cigarette
the man grabs a cigarette right now my
role is demanding a Don Tomas so out of
personal sacrifice for all of you
watching we are going to test this
lighter with one of the toughest things
in the world to light and that of course
is a Don Tomas classic
that's unbelievable did you see that
when you Wow
this thing is not playing around
unbelievable we're gonna set the lock
we're going to set the</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
