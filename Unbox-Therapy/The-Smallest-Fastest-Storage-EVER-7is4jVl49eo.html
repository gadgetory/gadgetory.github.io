another video and as you can tell I've
got a number of products in front of me
here from a company called vision tech
they sent me a box of stuff goodies
treats if you will to check out the most
interesting thing though is actually
sitting over there but before I grab
that I do want to mention what these
guys do right here these are USB
charging hubs and sync syncing hubs
charge and sync or just charge depending
on which one you go for this one has a
car charger included high power up to 40
watts more juice in your vehicle this
one is a standard but with a few ports
at 5 volt 1 amp this one up here is
actually kind of cool it adds 7 ports to
your Mac or PC so it works as a hub so
this is going to charge as well as sync
or just enable you to use more devices
than the number of USB ports you
currently have I will link this stuff
down in the description of the video but
today it's about this guy here it's a
new product that they have it is a
pocket SSD you're probably familiar with
the idea of SSDs course the superfast
drives that for the most part live
inside of modern laptops this is a
little twist on the idea it is the size
of a USB thumb drive look at this little
guy right here with the speeds of an SSD
up to I believe 470 megabytes per second
for the read speed solid metal bill this
is actually made in the USA you have a
cap on the top there it looks like your
standard USB Drive but inside is
substantially more speed also I was
speaking to Jack about this earlier a
place to edit video this is fast enough
to do with a 4k stream of video why not
throw it on there when you're traveling
no need to carry around an external
drive so I've got my laptop here what
I'm gonna aim to do is to show you guys
just how fast it is umm just go ahead
and plug it in like you would any USB
thumb drive so I've got a little
application here called black magic disk
speed test and what you'll see here is
we're getting somewhere in the
neighborhood of 152 megabytes per second
on the right
and on the read we're getting a
substantially faster speed of four
hundred and thirty two point seven
megabytes per second now this is a
variance that you see in a lot of
external drives storage and whatnot
you're going to get a faster read than
write for the most part that essentially
means that when you're accessing that
drive and whatever stored on it it's
going to come off faster than when
you're writing to it but this is all
very fast for something of this form
factor so what does that mean for you
basically fast your storage faster
access faster everything plus you could
theoretically partition this put
operating systems on it to boot from
that's the kind of speed we're talking
about which is which is pretty amazing
for something that size I remember when
these units were like 256 megabytes not
gigabytes I'm gonna give you like a
practical version of that as well just
to show you how long it takes to drag
over a large file so eighteen point
eight nine gigabytes this is the prong
battery case I don't know if you've seen
that video yet it's on the channel so
let's go ahead and drag this over to
pocket and let's get an estimate here
this is 18 0.89 gigabytes that's two
minutes to transfer it the current
estimate if time is money as they say in
the business world okay so here we go
I'll drop this on the desktop and less
than a minute so again now we're
engaging the read speed which as you saw
was somewhere around 450 megabytes and
that whole process I mean that's way
under a minute you can see it moving in
real time here it may be right around a
minute for just under 20 gigs you do the
math on that that's serious business
right there what did they look they're
calling it jack the fastest smallest SSD
dot dot
20 gigs in less than a minute get your
gig on alright that wraps it up this
little guys fast I am sure it will find
a very happy home here at unbox therapy
HQ and that feels solid I bet you could
sit on that thing okay fine I'm gonna
sit on it easily oh yeah
comfy I actually feel better now
straighten out that vertebra all right
later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
