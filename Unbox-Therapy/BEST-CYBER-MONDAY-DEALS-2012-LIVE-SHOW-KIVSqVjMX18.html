cyber monday which means that the
technology and consumer electronics
deals are continuing the momentum from
Black Friday's is moving forward and
this is probably your last day to get
some of these killer deals on stuff that
you want so i went ahead and laid out a
couple of the deals that i think are
interesting in order to help you guys
weed through some of the noise that's
out there in terms of sales and
promotions etc one more thing i want to
mention before we get into those deals
today i will be doing a live show to
make up for missing yesterday which was
sunday it'll be happening at four pm
eastern time which is only a few hours
from now and we'll be talking all about
cyber monday the best gadgets
electronics and technology that you
should be looking for today to make a
purchase and i'll also be asking you
guys to submit your deals the best deals
you can find and who knows we might do a
contest maybe some of the best links
will get rewarded with prizes I don't
know yet but you don't want to miss it 4
p.m. eastern time a link to that is down
in the description but i'll also be
tweeting about it so more importantly
you probably want to follow me on
twitter at unbox therapy that's going to
make sure that you don't miss any of my
updates leading up to that live show as
well as the deals i'll be tweeting out
etc ok enough about that let's get into
some of these preliminary deals that i
found by noon on monday so the first one
is an item that wouldn't normally go on
sale which is the kindle fire from
amazon and it's at 129 today down from
159 now you're probably thinking that's
only 30 bucks but it is a very cheap
tablet to begin with so if you have been
waiting to get into an Android tablet
and you just haven't been able to afford
one 129 is a really awesome entry point
and it's actually amazing to see that
there's any kind of Android tablet that
you can give for 129 so at that price
point I think it's a relatively decent
value so definitely check that out you
will need to use promo code fire deal
when you check out if you want to get
the 129 deal all the details and links
are going to be down in the description
of this video so if you're not following
me a hundred percent just look down in
the description for more detailed
information and be important links so
the next deal or deals i should say
they're they're calling it the gold box
deal in a day but it refers to a number
of different deals on headphones and
some of these are up to 75 percent off
but the one deal that I really think is
interesting is on the v-moda crossfade
LP headphones which have sort of got a
reputation in the headphone community
especially on ped Phi the head five
forums as being a great value in the
world of headphones what you get for
your money and that was at their regular
price of 199 now they've dropped for
today only once again all the way down
to 74 99 so that's sixty-three percent
savings below half price and available
in a number of different colors and as
of this video all those colors are in
stock so you can get gunmetal black
phantom chrome you get them in red and
black they've even got white ones so
definitely check that link down in the
description so you can look at the
v-moda crossfade LP over-ear headphone
for 7499 a crazy value I'm probably
going to pick up a pair of myself
something else to mention there are some
clips headphones with amazing reviews as
well both of these headphones on Amazon
itself have amazing reviews the v-moda
crossfade four and a half stars out of
five on 419 reviews the clips x10
another pair of headphones in ear style
earphones i should say have a great
great reviews as well four to five stars
on almost 250 reviews and clips has also
a reputation for fantastic in-ear
headphones and these the x 10's are
regular three hundred and fifty dollars
which is nuts i know it sounds crazy but
the better news is that today they're
only 84 99 which is seventy-six percent
savings so some great deals these are
some of the best i've seen actually even
going back to black friday on amazon so
definitely check out this link down in
the description i'll probably call it
headphones seventy-five percent off
headphones and then they'll be a link
beside this you definitely need to check
out especially if you're in the market
for headphones or even if you're not you
can get a significant upgrade at an
incredible price now the next deals I
want to talk about our relating to ipad
cases I mean it sort of seems like every
single ipad case that amazon carries is
on sale right now most of them for
around fifty percent off or close to it
so whether you're in the market
for a keyboard style case or an otterbox
defender see the defender for example is
regular 90 bucks and now it's on sale
for 48 so as you can tell some
significant improvements in pricing the
defender if you haven't seen it yet I
threw an iPad in a defender series out
my second story window onto my concrete
slabs in the backyard my little patio
and it survives have a fan of the
defender series for sure especially if
you're going to be using your iPad in
any kind of environment where it might
get beat up in some manner but there's
also more conservative cases as well but
the bottom line here is that pretty much
every iPad K's in the world at least
that amazon has which is pretty much
every case in the world is almost fifty
percent off today so if you've been
holding off on a case you want to check
that out as well the next thing worth
mentioning you know these are on sale
more commonly than the other items these
are SSDs and if you don't know what that
is that's a solid state drive probably
the single easiest way to heavily
improve the performance of your computer
at the moment whether it's a laptop or a
desktop SSDs make everything snappier
now there are a lot on sale today I do
have to mention you've got beyond fifty
percent in savings on a number of
different brands including Kingston
HyperX the sandisk extreme stuff some of
the ocz stuff as well so if you're in
the market for an SSD definitely head
over to the SSD link below and check out
some of the sales over there definitely
worth looking at the next items to
mention our memory cards and some of my
favorites are in here on sale today
which are the sandisk extreme series
sdhc class 10 cards I have some 32 gig
models I have some 16 game models I got
a lot of these cards sitting around for
obvious reasons but today you can get
some great deals you basically get the
highest end card on the market which is
45 megabytes a second in terms of data
transfer its overall speed at least at a
maximum and you can get a 16 gig today
for 18 bucks get a 32 gig today for
around 31 bucks so some significant
savings there as well if you've got a
DSLR or any kind of camera that's
shooting really big files you probably
want to improve the not only the size of
your memory card but also the
performance because it's writing such a
significant amount of data
I got another deal here which is the
logitech g27 racing wheel it's a hundred
dollars off so thirty-three percent
regular 299 for 199 once again a high
quality product that's pretty much
regarded as you know the best value in
the space of racing wheels and today
you've got it on sale it's got some
fantastic reviews and ratings on amazon
250 customer reviews are just under
there and around four and a half stars
so a fantastic way to improve your
engagement level in some of your
favorite racing games whether it be you
know Gran Turismo or whatever whatever
it is that you like to play I know a lot
of individuals who use this particular
wheel for Gran Turismo now lastly we
have some more gaming deals here there's
really too many to go through
independently so I decided to just sort
of cover is there's onra altogether
first of all there are lightning deals
which throughout the day there's going
to be limited quantities of you can see
those at the top and then underneath are
more long-standing deals which will last
for the entire day one of the
interesting ones for me that I might
pick up is dishonored for 2999 regular
$60 a relatively recent game madden is
35 bucks not as highly rated as
dishonored you've got fifa on sale
there's a bunch of a mere actually that
you can look through but as you guys can
tell some great deals to be had they've
got LA noire for 10 bucks an older game
but ten bucks is ten bucks right you can
also check out some of the deals on
consoles and things here as well so i'll
put the amazon gaming link down in the
description as well so anyways i hope
