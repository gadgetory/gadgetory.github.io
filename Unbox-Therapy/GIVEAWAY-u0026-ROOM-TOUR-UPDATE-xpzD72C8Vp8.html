for this video is to give you an update
as far as what's going on with the two
contests that are currently running
course one contest is running here on
unbox therapy and the second one is
running on my second channel the beast
feed there's obviously the Amazon Kindle
Fire package and then there's the PS
Vita package you should definitely
submit your entries into each contest as
soon as possible I'm going to put links
down in the description to each contest
video as well as in the video responses
but the question that I'm really aiming
to address here is the one that I'm
getting asked very often which is when
will the contest and I'm anxious I want
to know if I one etc etc and I know I
had originally not put a date on it I
was kind of up in the air was it going
to be a couple weeks three weeks a month
I don't know I didn't say and I just
sort of was looking at the statistics on
the channel and I realized that we're
coming up on a very monumental event
we're going to be hitting 50,000
subscribers very soon and I've been
tracking the statistics and it turns out
we should do so in roughly a week so I
decided hey why not announce the winner
to each contest at that moment when we
hit 50,000 subscribers now obviously if
we go along at the same rate that will
take about a week like I just mentioned
but you can help accelerate that by
sharing my channel unboxtherapy with
your friends family teachers with
everyone because the more people that
jump on board the sooner we're going to
be able to announce the winner and it
just makes sense because you know most
channels like to celebrate something
when they hit 50,000 or when they hit
any sort of big round and number and I
thought hey why not do this at that time
that way it sort of becomes part of that
celebration so anyway guys it's going to
be coming up real soon stay tuned to the
channel share the channel let's get to
50,000 as quick as possible there
therefore I can come up with winners for
each giveaway on both channels and
somebody can be very very happy to be
receiving either the Kindle Fire package
or the PlayStation Vita package or maybe
there's some some off chance that the
same person wins both know that
it happen you're only allowed to win one
of the two but anyways and as i said
earlier in the video if you haven't
submitted your entries yet it's simple
it's just a comment on each video I'm
going to put links down in the
description once again to each of those
videos the last thing I want to talk
about this is kind of getting long windy
here one more thing to talk about is a
the requests for the room tour desk tour
gaming setup video etc the only reason
that I haven't done it yet is because
I'm waiting on two items a couple of
items to complete the setup and the
reason I've been waiting so long is
because I haven't had the budget to buy
them yet but really they are going to
become a permanent fixture in the setup
I will be getting those items very soon
either this week or at the very start of
next week so trust me this video is
coming up i am not going to disappoint
you i guarantee it ok you got to trust
me on this one give me a little bit more
time to make it a little bit more epic
and i want to thank you guys as always i
want to thank you for participating in
the giveaway and i also want to thank
you for being a subscriber and watching
my videos in general you guys make this
content possible and until next time
until 50,000 subscribers i'll see you
guys on the next one alright later</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
