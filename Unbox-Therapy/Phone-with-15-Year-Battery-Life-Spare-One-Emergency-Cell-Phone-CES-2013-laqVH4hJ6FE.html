coverage what's up guys Lew here and
we're looking at yet another cool device
here at CES 2013 it's called the spare
one and at first glance it looks like a
cell phone from about 10 years ago but
this one serves a very specific purpose
it is an emergency mobile phone with a
15 year battery life on one double-a
battery so what this means is you're
gonna have the ability to store this
thing in your basement in your vehicle
on your boat in your bunker preparing
for the zombie apocalypse or anything
like that because you can pick this
thing up without the need for a wall
outlet charger etc and you can just use
it straight away now you can put a SIM
card in here if you want to actually use
it to call other individuals so the idea
would be like a prepaid SIM card so
you're not obviously paying a monthly
fee but even without a SIM card this
device will call 911 911 built-in even
without a SIM card another cool function
is it has GPS in it or location tracking
which means that if you give this to a
child or an elderly person or something
along those lines and you want to keep
tabs on where they are located or if
they get lost or anything like that you
can open up a web browser and actually
see the location of this device as well
as whoever is carrying it so it serves a
couple of kind of interesting and unique
functions I personally haven't looked at
a phone that serves these functions
before so this is the kind of thing that
is new to the market and maybe
eventually one day we'll all have
emergency phones sitting around the
other cool thing is a lot of people
don't have landlines anymore a lot of
people only have cell phones so in this
case you know this might be a nice
backup if you don't have a landline at
least you always have a device that's
going to have power that is a backup to
your smart phone anyway guys if you
enjoyed this video please leave a thumbs
up down below and make sure to subscribe
for the rest of my CES 2013 coverage
there's a ton more to come trust me all
right later powered by the 2013 C max
