Google i/o back with another video in
front of me is a bit of a surprise
didn't expect to take a look at this
it's the Android TV developer's kit and
apparently some individuals here were
able to acquire these kits as you can
tell there is what looks like a gaming
controller as well as this set-top box
which isn't really a box at all it's
tiny super slim reminds me a little bit
of the PlayStation TV but if I flip it
over you'll see it has this really cool
design on the bottom I also notice an
LED which is likely going to put a
little bit of color down on the surface
wherever you put this on the back is
where all all of your inputs are you
have a power switch as well as your
power port for connecting the power
adapter you have a hard wired Ethernet
for connectivity I would assume this
would also have Wi-Fi as well a USB port
which we're a little bit uncertain if
that will be used for expanding storage
or potentially just for recharging the
controller and then an HDMI port of
course for your video output so a very
slim sleek little box and then there's
the controller which to me looks a lot
like the on live controller if any you
guys remember that web-based console
you'll notice some some things have
changed in here
I believe this center center button
looks a little bit different you still
have two joysticks trigger buttons on
the back you can see here this device is
uh not necessarily ready for resell yet
this is not a retail package it's a
developer kit so but you're probably
going to install batteries in the back
there it's a lot like your at your
standard Xbox controller so if you've
held one of those before it's going to
be familiar a little bit of paperwork
and then you have a power adapter
they've also included batteries in here
which is always a good thing so you're
ready to get up and running immediately
after booting up the device so anyways
there you have it
the Android TV developer's kit here at
Google IO I'm pretty sure this is the
first unboxing probably the only
unboxing so if that's what you guys are
into make sure to leave a thumbs up down
below subscribe if you haven't yet leave
a comment if you have a question thanks
as always for watching guys I'll catch
you on the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
