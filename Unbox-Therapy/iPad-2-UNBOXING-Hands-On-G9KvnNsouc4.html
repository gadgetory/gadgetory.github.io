and I'm super excited right now because
I'm doing an on-the-fly unboxing I just
couldn't wait to get into this it's the
iPad 2 and you all know today is the
special day when it comes out and the
lineups are crazy everywhere and I
finally got my hands on one and I just
had to come to the local Starbucks and
get it unboxed immediately so that
nobody on my channel or on YouTube has
to wait to see this this is the white
model it's a 16 gigabyte flavor and it
feels super thin in the hands totally
different from the original model as far
as the feel it feels about 1/3 as thin
maybe the other thing too is that even
though it's not that much lighter the
weight feels distributed differently so
that's about all I can say
if you've held the original model then
you kind of know what's going on here
I'll see if I can power it on it either
has no battery or I'm not pushing hard
enough let's see here I'll let it load
up for a second I'm obviously just going
to get the iTunes logo for now but I'll
show you guys that anyways here's the
little baby power brick like we all know
about I'll go ahead and unwrap this
regular two-prong North American just
like we'd expect we've got a little
package here with some literature it's
just some quick information to get you
up and running and of course the
ubiquitous Apple stickers lastly we're
going to take a look at the USB sync
cable with apples proprietary connector
on it now as soon as I get home I'm
going to do a more inclusive overview of
the device I'll give you those macro
close-ups you're used to so do me a
favor and subscribe do yourself a favor
and subscribe and you're going to get
some crazy great visuals as soon as I
get back home but this is what you get
for now and I stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
