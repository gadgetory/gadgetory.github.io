therapy and today we're taking a look at
the sony personal 3d viewer now this is
obviously an unusual device
it's a headset slash cyborg helmet you
wear this thing and basically you get a
3d perspective equivalent to what it
would be like to sit in front of a like
say for example 150 inch TV now there
are a couple of different ways to set it
up you can either put your HDMI source
straight into the HMC t1p that's the
code name for this device or you can set
a pass through so you can still send
video to your flat panel display and
have it come through the headset as well
now this is actually HD o LED technology
with 3d as well and it's even got 5.1
channel surround sound emulation to make
you feel even more like you're there
whether you're watching a blu-ray or
playing a game or anything along those
lines now I tried this thing out in the
store and it is absolutely crazy it's
impressive you can configure the
distance between each eye which gives
you incredible 3d separation visual
separation that you can't get out of a
traditional pair of safe 3d glasses when
you're using your flat panel I'll give
you guys more information on that in a
quick second but first let's get all the
items out of the box we had the headset
first followed by a little bit of
paperwork and there's actually a lot of
cabling included that's because this is
not a fully portable unit you have to be
near this module down here on the bottom
so it is wired you're gonna need to be
close to your HDMI source but that makes
sense anyways because who's gonna carry
a you know a ps3 when they're when
they're jumping on the subway or the bus
or something it's just not gonna make
much sense so anyways you are going to
have to be tethered to your console so
the first thing we're gonna look at is
the paperwork that's gonna tell you how
to get this thing set up and running now
it is fairly configurable from a fit
standpoint after all you're gonna want
it to be comfortable so that's the very
first thing you're gonna want to do
after looking at the guide here is
adjust the headset so that you get a
comfortable fit it is pretty heavy but
once you get that comfortable fit it
actually feels pretty good especially if
you're sitting with your head tilted
backwards lying down on a lounge chair
something along those lines you're going
to want to get comfortable because as we
all know when
get that video game booted up you might
play for a couple of hours a few hours
who the hell knows
so let's get a closer look at what
cabling is included I was actually very
surprised to find out that there is an
HDMI cable I love it when manufacturers
put the HDMI cables in the original
packaging it's always a headache to have
to go out and purchase one it's like
it's like when your device ships without
batteries say for example it needs
double-a batteries and they aren't there
and you can't get it up and running
especially if it's late at night which
is when I usually do my unboxings so
having the HDMI cable included is a big
bonus these little contraptions here are
all about fit these things you can apply
to the actual headset and those those
particular ones fit around your ears to
give you a softer touch there's that
HDMI cable that I mentioned a quick
second ago other than that you've also
got power and this is the module here
that makes everything possible it makes
everything happen on the front side of
the module is where you're going to see
your port to connect your actual headset
it looks proprietary to me at least I
haven't seen this particular port before
you've also got what will be some LED
indicators represented probably under
the pass-through designation there as
well as the power designation and then
on the back you've got your HDMI in and
out that's obviously important for that
pass-through feature and then your AC in
you also see this baby was made in Japan
lastly we've got the actual headset
including a really long cable which is
nice you might want to be a little bit
further away from your HDMI device or
gaming console etc and then there are
some head pieces included they're
labeled a B and C each one has a
different depth to it now that's
important again for getting that correct
fit because after all this device is
gonna live on your head on your face so
here's a better look at each one
obviously C being the largest in terms
of head pads be fitting somewhere in the
middle and a being the smallest the a is
pre-installed at the moment but you're
gonna want to try each one out to get
the optimum fit the optimal fit because
as I mentioned earlier this thing is not
light and the only problem I foresee
here is if your friends come over want
to try it out it's gonna be tough to get
them all set up and running you gotta go
tell them to buy their own
so here is the headset I'm gonna call it
a headset and you can see that even this
even the speakers on the side the
headphone portion is very adjustable you
can move it in out anything to fit your
needs
the head strap on the back here is also
adjustable there's a button on top that
loosens it up otherwise it's locked into
place I mean this thing is very
configurable to make sure you get the
right fit so just don't strap it on and
start playing mess around with it
get it right that way you're gonna get
the best experience out of it on the
bottom side you can see the actual
visual portion what it looks like a
couple of glasses you've got some
different buttons down here for
controlling the configuration which
actually takes a while to get used to
because you can't see what you're
configuring
and then lastly we've got this
proprietary cable which I said is pretty
long I think it's probably between 10
and maybe 12 feet so you can be a fair
distance from that console here's what I
talked about earlier you can get the
optimum what is it separation for the 3d
stereoscopic video because you can
adjust the distance between each
eyepiece to represent the distance
between your actual eyes so that's
that's a really cool thing an important
thing and then you've also got your
controls your d-pad okay button menu
button etc those are also accessible
down in that location and anyway guys
this is a really interesting item I
can't wait to really test it out use it
and see what it's all about
it's obviously not for everyone it's a
pretty high price tag etc but definitely
a cool device for any geek any nerd any
cyborg whatever anyway guys if you
enjoyed this content hopefully you can
like and favorite this video as it does
help me out a bunch if you haven't
subscribed yet please go ahead and do so
