we want to see unique and unusual things
that's why we come to unbox therapy
we're counting on you my goodness guys I
dug deep for this one we're not in
Kansas anymore nor eating a yard in
Kansas anymore
the otamatone automat own otamatone you
know when you got the Japanese writing
you got the wah wah wah
I was asking Willy do earlier if I could
blame him for this he said no way he was
not willing to be blamed for such a
thing it's incredible they're sliding
vibrato wah wah wah get the on/off
switch and you got this man
so if you got here okay you're
definitely in business what is in autumn
atone we're about to find out what is
the pricing well 30 bucks such a
weird-looking thing yes and what Jack's
been waiting for he's like is it another
smartphone Lou I'm like no obviously you
can tell what this one is I think it
also comes in white blue pink medium
volume high volume low mid high that
must be the tone in case you haven't
figured out yet this is some sort of New
Age instrument this is not a ukulele
apparently it takes triple-a batteries
is this a screwdriver situation this
could be this could be a dud like this
could be a huge letdown we put a lot of
pressure on this poor little guy
it's always the sign of a good time when
you got to insert and bring your own
batteries to the party here we go okay
and let's see the magic happen in real
time
