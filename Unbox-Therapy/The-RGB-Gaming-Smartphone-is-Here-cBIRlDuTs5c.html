makes it that I seem like I am line well
so you guys know I've been talking about
this idea of gaming smart phones now I
did this video talking about this Xiaomi
phone the black shark why would you need
a dedicated gaming phone first off
differentiation is becoming harder and
harder for different brands to stand out
more difficult to encourage a customer
to upgrade without changing certain
aspects of the device Pub G Mobile
reached out to me and he said hey man
we'd love to sponsor an episode and I
said well I have the perfect unboxing
for you to sponsor because I need a game
to test out with this gaming phone this
one in front of me is called the red
magic so we saw the razor phone it had
120 Hertz display and probably the best
speakers that had ever tried on a smart
phone but that was at a much different
price point than the one that I've got
in front of me now at 399 dollars specs
on the back here designed for power
sounds good
six inch full HD display powered by the
last generation Snapdragon 835 but it's
got a dedicated game mode and an ability
to boost performance and actually
overclock that chip 3800 milliamp hour
battery also got RGB lighting because
well it's got a flash every color in the
universe but this of course is the
magical part of the red magic phone the
appearance you imagine the gaming phone
in your mind you'd be like yeah that's
to be clear you see this angular design
on the back aggressive masculine unusual
shapes for the fingerprint scanner as
well as the camera cut out the RGB LED
light configurable it can sync to your
games and then this dedicated switch
which will take you into the game mode
USB type-c on the bottom a headphone
jack which i think is necessary for a
gaming phone some red magic stickers
quick charge power brick sim tool type-c
USB cable you can see here on the
interface this thing has a
serious gaming skin to it you could
change that that's up to you it is
Android not at the moment this unit in
front of me is a prototype as I said
this device is on IndieGoGo right now
some things within the software could
change you ready jet you still want to
take pictures so even though it's not
the main focus it's actually pretty
decent 24 megapixels a game mode and you
can add apps specifically to game mode
it restricts the networking activities
of other things your phone might be
doing to prioritize gameplay so you're
gonna have less latency and more of the
resources dedicated to that game it will
block functions such as the fingerprint
reader now the switch on the side is
called the compete button that's the red
switch up here and that's going to
increase the power consumption and the
heat generation but the reason for doing
so is to also enhance the performance
block incoming calls app notifications
you can't get disrupted there's no pause
button alright let's give this a try
oh I got one of the better guns I think
I don't know would like some body armor
all right let's go see if we can find
someone
to kill let's go good Oh red zone go get
my truck how about those three kills
though the phone I told you there has to
be a differentiation factor we need
different spec lists for different types
of users I'm more interested in like the
3800 milliamp hour battery the reason
I'm showing you this phone and I'm
talking about phones like this in
general I think it's interesting how
this marketplace is maturing and I do
see a place for these more specific
phones in the future it's gonna continue
to go on and I'm excited to see where it
goes so there you have it Pub G mobile
full graphics it's on the high setting
on this phone you can play it on most
mobile devices and it's really quite the
accomplishment when you think about it
this is the kind of thing that once upon
a time on a console you would have been
like all right yeah that's what I expect
and now it's on a smart phone these are
now the types of games that we can play
on mobile now if you haven't tried pub G
mobile yet there's more than just the
classic mode that you just saw me
playing there's also a new arcade mode
which has only 28 players and one of the
six following variations shotguns sniper
rifles all weapons melee only pistols or
item heaven and they've even got voice
chat built-in so you can get a real sort
of console or PC gaming like experience
right on your smartphone so shout out to
pub G Mobile for sponsoring this video I
definitely think you guys should check
it out the links down in the description
super easy to download give it a shot
see if you can outperform me I should
say that eight kills in the game before
but it happened off camera I'm not lying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
