the studio everybody wants to be on
unbox therapy this is no exception you
can see I even got like a little sticky
note here hey unbox therapy here are
some mighty wallets to check out if you
have any questions let us know maybe I
will what is a mighty wallet mighty thin
mighty strong mighty green touch me I'm
tae Baek based on my understanding here
this is a super thin material somehow
you can't tear and it expands as you
fill it look at the image on the back
incredible strength of the mighty wallet
comes from its super strong material
unique folder design super thin
lightweight Tyvek it's incredibly strong
and resistant to tears and stains also a
true conversation starter or at least
that's what they'd have you believe
alright let's crack one of these open e
here there way to do this correct what I
do all right is there a way too am I
missing something here do I ditional I
might be completely out of my mind oh so
that part is meant to do that alright
alright what do we have here dare to
tear take the challenge ask someone to
tear this card in one minute or less
this cards I don't even that's super
thin it just feels like paper why one
minute they're only giving me a minute
to do it Hey
okay fine yeah yeah they got something
going on there
dare to tear I don't know
artist collection you can print your own
whatever you want on to the wallet oh
and there's a code there you go five
dollars off all right so it's a super
thin wallet that expands as you put
stuff in it but have any money yes I
have so this is obviously not gonna
expand it too much but you just slide
that baby in there
that is weird money in a money money on
money action and then this thing is made
out of the same material but super thin
I suppose that's kind of the point
because it's made out of this type egg
material you can throw some people off
you pull that baby out they're like what
what magic is this what's this guy up to
look at that that looks like a paper
envelope same material dare to tear oh
yeah what if it is so weird because it
feels exactly like paper until you try
to do it magic look at this like the
comic book version apparently they've
got many versions of these plus there's
a couple jokes they add it on there look
at this little kid with the hat on
whizzes some kind of Illuminati thing
the face with the skull then taking it
to another level couple of cards here go
ahead and throw them in there you go
you got your super thin strange what
looks like a paper wallet until you give
it to someone you're like hey why don't
you tear it then tough guy you got one
minute ah how about this how's your tie
back holding up now how about this yes
what do you say now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
