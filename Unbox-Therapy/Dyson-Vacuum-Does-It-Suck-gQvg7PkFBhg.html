vacuum this is the dyson v-6 animal and
it I mean it looks serious I got to be
honest taking a look at this box here
got all these different valves and
whatnot to be honest I could probably
put this thing to good use the v6 animal
no clumsy cord yet better overall
performance than the top five
best-selling full-size vacuums they said
it I didn't
I'm here to test it that's my job first
things first the usual paperwork
I sense a trend and oh my goodness we
have various components here check out
that purple what else this looks
important okay what's cool about this is
it's a hand help that's oddly satisfying
concept here is you know in the kitchen
in the car you got to get some place
real quick you don't have to plug it in
you just grab it and go and it's small
enough to fit into all those little
nooks and crannies but then when you
need to get more serious and you need to
show the floor what's up then you plug
in the rest of the components and it
turns into an upright here's the charger
pretty standard stuff this looks like
your average gadget charger this looks
like a the main floor unit well that's
that's where the magic happens right
there let's get this all set up and
clean some stuff up all right so this is
what the unit looks like in floor mode
it is of course if you wanted to do your
regular cleanup but what's more
interesting to me personally is when you
remove this part and you put on an
attachment like this and it sort of goes
into desktop mode or vehicle mode this
is really portable at this point but
still powerful so let's go ahead and and
get some desk dirt and see exactly how
it performs desk dirt
love it on the back here there's a max
button you'll see when I pull the
trigger Full Tilt but if I hit that
button it has essentially two power
settings if you can hear what I'm saying
at all
no problemo it's time to test this out
on the floor let's get some dirt over
there
right in that corner time to reload
Oh
that I mean that with that floor unit
right there well I had no problem with
that at all so there you have it for a
portable unit that's versatile and can
switch between modes that's pretty cool
not too bad I don't know I think this
thing could be pretty pretty convenient
so there you have it dyson v-6 animal
