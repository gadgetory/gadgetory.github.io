Pro this device right here this crazy
three camera setup I've been using it
for a while now
man what like two weeks maybe it's the
longest period of time that I've spent
on any Huawei device as my exclusive
daily driver smartphone this video is
all about me taking a bit of a deeper
dive in a personal way
I said personal jack you know I had a
lot of thoughts going into it and
apprehension it's just a little
different than the type of evaluation
you normally would get to do in a short
form video here on YouTube you get to
learn it a little bit more to live with
it and that's why I kind of like this
concept of switching over trying as many
phones as I possibly can since I'm
wrapping up this video here talking
about the p20 Pro I mean I'm gonna let
you know all my thoughts if it's if it's
a good purchase how good is it etc a
good way to manage these switch videos
should be to ask you guys which
smartphone you're most interested in and
think that can be the phone that I then
go on to switch to and report back after
a serious usage session longer period of
time so leave a comment down below and
let me know which phone you want me to
switch to after this one because I'm
switching immediately anyhow this video
is about the p20 pro the form factor is
super comfy it's not quite as big as
some of the other flagship devices which
I like it makes it easy to hold and
reach it does have the notch on it it
was one of the early knotch adopters
though you can turn that off a unique
thing on this device is this front
fingerprint scanner I think I have
become so accustomed to the rear scanner
that this actually felt a bit awkward
for me after using this for three weeks
or however long has been I still think I
feel more comfy with the rear one now
this is a personal taste kind of thing
my index finger lands there anyways it's
kind of a thoughtless process it's
automatic versus this one where it's
just a little bit more of a reach this
is not a huge thing it's not gonna be a
deal-breaker for someone it's it's a
minor little thing either way but if I
had to choose I would choose the
fingerprint scanner on the rear let's
talk about the display since we're on
the front I have it currently in the eye
firk mode i'm actually really impressed
with this mode the color and iComfort
stuff is just bananas you can go in and
and really toggle in the color that you
like and and that's a positive thing
especially since I made that video
recently about how the blue light coming
out of our smartphones might be
affecting us since I have put a custom
launcher on this device the settings
menu remains the one area that I had to
adapt to of course it's much different
than on stock Android some things are
buried in menus a little differently and
it will take some getting used to I
talked in a recent video about how much
I like stock Android but part of the
reason for that is because I switch
between phones so frequently I don't
really necessarily have the time to
become super comfortable with all these
variations in skins and so on this will
probably affect you less than me because
you're switching phones presumably less
frequently these little nuances in the
settings menu and so on you'll get used
to that battery life has been good it
never ran out on me at any point
throughout the day I can make it through
a workday no problem get home at night
charge it up quick charge
the display is OLED which for me if
you're spending this kind of money on a
smartphone it's really a must the
viewing angles are substantially better
as I've shown off it's sort of in the
same realm as what you'd expect in OLED
from the other major manufacturers one
thing that I do miss from this device is
the lack of wireless charging this is
not for everyone some people hate the
fact that I'm constantly talking about
wireless charging like glue it's not as
fast there are benefits and drawbacks
yes of course we could have that
argument forever but I personally have a
number of wireless charging accessories
laid out around my house and when I am
using a foam that features wireless
charging I do take advantage of those
you just wish you had it it's like a lot
of features on a smartphone you don't
need it all the time but when you do
need it it can be kind of nice to have
it this doesn't have wireless charging
wouldn't be a deal-breaker for me but I
wouldn't mind if it was in there now
looking at the main page here you can
obviously tell this is not the stock
launcher that comes with the device this
is Nova Launcher and I pretty much put
this on all my devices with the
exception of pixel products and so on
just to make it a little
streamlined a little more familiar this
gives some cohesiveness to this
experience
it feels interchangeable with some of
the other ones that I've come from I'm a
big fan of Nova Launcher I've told you
that before so anyway if you're
wondering why it looks different that's
what I'm using here I also toggle back
some of the animations to make it feel
quicker
Nova's awesome you already know that ok
another quick thing to mention super
fingerprint ii you you can probably tell
looking at that image there the jack is
picking up this is something that exists
on pretty much all glass backed phones
it's kind of unfortunate that there's a
limitation in materials available here
you want a premium material you have to
have the transmission of radio signals
which happen to do pretty well through
glass and supposedly you have to have
this premium feel like you have to have
all these pieces together and you have
only so many materials available to you
and this is why you're seeing this glass
back on pretty much every flagship phone
for me this drawback is too much like
that's just an ugly look so I did have a
case on it this is actually a
first-party case that Huawei makes and
it's even got a magnet in it for a car
mount which I never used but look at
this surface no fingerprints so you have
a premium device you don't want to show
off too many fingerprints as much as I
don't necessarily like using a case I
had this on the whole time that I was
using the phone in order to avoid the
alternative which was the fingerprint
factory you can see that does not happen
there so anyway that's an observation we
all know what you want to talk about and
I do too because it's it's really the
elephant in the room right now in terms
of this device it's this guy right up
here it's the camera yeah the camera on
this thing is amazing honestly it was so
much fun to play with they got the
juices flowing a little bit because of
the versatility of it with the three
lens setup and the crazy night mode it
was like I want to test this thing out I
got lost in the flow a little bit like I
want to see what it's capable of because
at least in night mode with this thing's
capable of it sort of feels like magic
now I knew that going into this switch
because I had played with it at the
launch event hadn't used it myself over
an extended period but I had
at the launch event and I was like how
is this thing doing this the way it
works in night mode is if you snap a
photo it will actually take some time to
shoot and it will take multiple
exposures and somehow even if your hand
is moving around somehow it's able to
merge this data together to give you
some crazy results even in your
pitch-black environments of all the
phones that I've used that claim to be
incredibly capable in low-light and so
on this one is for real like this night
mode is something completely different
it's not like decent performance at a
particular ISO because of this software
somehow how it's using the image data
along with the shakiness eliminating the
shakiness of your hand to give you
practically night vision I do have a
sample of that in here this shot is in a
pitch-black bathroom lights off door
closed and just this candle light and
the detail in the object here is
incredible you could be out at a nice
candlelit dinner and you end up with an
image that that a phone that a
smartphone has no business taking I
promise you the night mode on this thing
will blow your mind
it's it's you can really do something
with this camera that as far as my
experiences you can't do on other phones
now as a regular camera just as a camera
that thing's ridiculous
- I'm gonna zoom in to this wasp nest I
shot this photo okay check this out I
mean I am up close and personal I am the
detail on these wasps and look at how
zoomed in I am it doesn't break up now
you know you're dealing with a 40
megapixel sensor but interestingly
enough even when I'm in the 10 megapixel
mode I'm still getting incredible images
so I'm not sure what kind of fancy
business is going on but if you don't
need the full resolution in the giant
file size you can shoot in this 10
megapixel loading and still get
ridiculous results you can see here
because of the optical zoom we can go
from there to there and keep full
resolution zoomed into a chest piece
look at that from there to there
kablammo how about this the isolation of
a water dropped what is this
stock photo no I took that I should
license this you should pay me what is
this daddy images Getty get on the phone
whoa the camera is the feature that can
still pull you into the premium
smartphone territory it's the only
feature that can compel you or should
compel you to spend those extra dollars
because it's the only difference maker
like processors are pretty ubiquitous
now displays are pretty close also but
at the premium level it's like which is
the best camera and why and I think you
can make the argument that this is that
camera it might be on this phone right
here but the reason I think that I put
this one on top is because of the
versatility it's really like having
multiple cameras with you it's doing
something that other cameras aren't now
granted you guys know I loved the pixel
to excel and the software on that device
for the bokeh effect or the portrait
isolation is incredible Google software
is bananas I've said it before I'll say
it again you already know that but
there's no night mode like this night
mode and that's a single-lens device so
when you start talking about zoom you
got to go take a nap as well this camera
is special like that you feel like
you're paying for something that you're
getting in this implementation right
here it seems that this setup they have
going on is working and it's giving you
versatility that other smart phones
can't there is an actual tangible
benefit to this unusual setup yes it's
expensive it's in that premium range and
I've been talking more and more recently
about how you don't have to go to that
premium range I have a funny feeling
about which phone you guys are gonna
suggest for my next switch and I think
it's probably not gonna be in the
premium range because you can get some
crazy specs now for a fraction of the
cost of this device but if you were
stuck in the premium segment and you're
like I just have to have the best if
that's you you're probably gonna be
satisfied with this phone the one killer
characteristic above all others is
camera and this camera made shooting
smartphone photos fun again and
interesting and that's a totally
different experience from anything I've
had recently the p20 Pro is a good
choice it's kind of my job to keep
switching and breaking it down for you
and I intend on continuing to do that
I'm gonna remind you once again I want
you to leave a comment down below let me
know which smartphone I should switch to
next and I'm gonna be back here real
shortly because this SIM card has to go
somewhere I have a funny feeling I know
what you guys are gonna pick but put it
in the comments I'm about to switch
again p20 pro you'll be happy with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
