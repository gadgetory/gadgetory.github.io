know that unusual things show up here
today is one of those days but I think
you might find it interesting I know I
did because as soon as I crack the box I
saw some unusual items for example you
cook you know that's the beginning of a
fantastic video a hardhat what do you
think about that look there Jack set a
new look and unbox therapy Bob the
Builder version edition if I'm
remembering correctly I think the white
helmet is a big shot look at that I'm
running the job site now alright here's
the note happy new year Lois it's the
people at mobile fun I thought you'd
enjoy a smashing start to 2017 the
three-in-one executive emergency pen and
stylus but it has a third function
unlike any other in the event of an
emergency you can use this accessory to
break glass in order to escape a vehicle
or building the glass will be shattered
thanks to the conical tungsten tip this
sounds intense thank you people so what
why do we need such a big box then oh
well I think these glasses will work
they'll probably be good check me out
now
how you gonna mess with that you're
thinking right now why do I need to
smash glass with my pen but as they
suggest it's an emergency thing you're
trapped in that vehicle the bridge
collapses and you're sinking how are you
going to swim out or okay that's a
little extreme what it it's like
Independence Day or something no
whatever I don't know some type of
emergency maybe the electric locks are
malfunctioning there's a fire whatever
the situation you need to shatter some
glass there is a market for tactical
pens that can crack glass and this one
is spring-loaded so we have some glass
oval castle
spider-man is in case of emergency
spider-man photo that you need to smash
there you know well I appreciate the
effort here from the people at Basel fun
so Penn like that it's actually kind of
got a nice weight to it oh my goodness
what oh that is the tungsten tip right
there I pull back it goes in and then
smash comes out super sharp too so it
has a little cover on it so you don't
poke yourself kind of like that and the
tip that screws on acts as a stylus so
you can have ten input for I don't know
your tablet or your phone or something
and you've got the emergency scenario
boom bust that out bang crack some glass
since that's what you're tuning in for
let us give it a test here now technique
would be what a wonderful shelf contain
this explosion is about to be are we
ready here jack are you ready for this
I'm gonna put it in the center on a lift
up whoa see that oh is that why it's
fireman because it shatters like a like
this quite like the web let's do it a
couple more Oh
okay I'm getting a hang of it now you Oh
fly some pets pressure oh there's
something kind of satisfying about that
oh okay even now that works that works
as expected and the cool thing is you
don't need a lot of power like if you
just wanted to smash some glass I don't
know what the pen tip let's say you will
be banging at that thing it would be
dangerous because if you break through
guess what guess what else is going
through your whole hand
you're bleeding now plus the things on
fire or you're drowning or I don't know
what the emergency is that's not a good
look
so you got the glass breaker on there in
that moment you're a big shot everyone's
like look at that guy hook it up
bang get the tool for the job when you
least expect it and then then you're
ready for business the rest of the time
like that signing documents
sign and check I don't write Rhymes I
write check
P Diddy anyway there you go if you never
knew this world existed here this is an
example but like I said this is actually
a common feature on something called
tactical pens a lot of survival type
people military people law enforcement
are fully aware of these glass breakers
I'm assuming there's a reason why
there's all kinds of potential for
dangerous various types of apocalyptic
scenarios including the zombies and when
the zombies have you cornered and you
need to break out of some glass well
guess what unbox therapy has you covered</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
