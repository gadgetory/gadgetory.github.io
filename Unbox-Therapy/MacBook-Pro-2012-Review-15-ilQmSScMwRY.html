to you by Netflix what's up guys Lew
here and welcome to what is normally the
in review show but I'm going to use it
as an opportunity to do a full on
opinionated casual style review on the
latest generation MacBook Pro this of
course was recently unboxed on the
channel there you can see it's razor
blade thin incredibly thin and light and
if you haven't seen the unboxing yet you
might want to check it out if you're
into beautiful visuals on brand new
technology I'll put a link in the
description as well as up in the
annotations of this video so you can go
and check that out but this video here
is going to serve as a review video and
an opinion driven review there are a lot
of reviews on YouTube and elsewhere that
are going to list the specs show you
benchmarks do comparisons from a
technical mathematical standpoint and I
didn't want to replicate those because
those are already very well done instead
I want to use this review as an
opportunity to offer up my opinion
because I get a lot of questions people
say should I get the MacBook Air should
I get the MacBook Pro what's the
difference between the new one and the
old one so on and so forth so I want to
break it down in regular language for
you guys for those of you that don't
know I've been a MacBook Pro user here's
the old one looks chubby now I've been a
MacBook Pro user for a long long time
this is the 2011 model that I've been
attached to recently this does all my
work it's powerful I did some some
special things to it like swap out the
optical drive for an SSD while
maintaining the storage associated with
the regular standard hard drive so I
customized it in a sense I put 16 gigs
of ram in there so I did some things to
it aftermarket and that brings me to my
first criticism of the new system while
it is thinner lighter more powerful
better with a better screen all that
beautiful stuff it is not user
serviceable in any manner yes there are
screws on the bottom you could open it
up if you really wanted to but you're
going to void your warranty right away
and on top of that there's not much you
can do once you're in there you can't go
ahead and put in an aftermarket SSD
at least not easily there will
eventually probably be aftermarket stuff
that is compatible but it's going to
cost you a fortune you're not going to
be able to put a standard two and a half
inch form factor SSD upgrade in there
the RAM is soldered on now so you're
stuck with what you order and that means
generally speaking a bigger investment
up front because you're going to want to
spec it out to make sure that you're not
going to want to do or need to do
upgrades in the future now a positive
thing here is that they all ship with
SSDs that's what allows them to be so
thin and light so you're going to get
performance out of the gate and you're
not going to be sitting there saying oh
I have to go and put a aftermarket SSD
in there like I did on my stock model
2011 MacBook Pro so that's a good thing
but you know by the time you put like
say a larger size SSD in here and you
max out the RAM you're talking at a
major major investment and that is
probably my single biggest criticism of
this particular machine so go with me
here for a second I know it probably
seems strange because I paid just as
much for the old generation I think a
lot is happening in computers especially
since you have so many users nowaday
transitioning to mobile devices for a
number of their different computing
tasks so a twenty two hundred dollar
computer a year ago or two years ago or
three years ago might have been more
justifiable than it is today I think
Apple has a responsibility along with
the improvements that they make to their
systems to also drop the prices to make
them more accessible to more people
twenty two hundred dollars today for me
it just it just feels strange to pay for
a laptop it feels like too much and it's
such a popular topic of discussion in
the comments section of so many videos
of these particular laptops yes they are
beautiful arguably the nicest best
constructed laptops on the market for
you know people who do what I do
but for $2,200 it just I don't know why
it seems like so much like I said before
I've paid that for the older generation
but as we move along and we continue to
advance in the way that we interact with
computers and smartphones
cetera I'm really believing like these
things need to become more accessible
yes you've got a MacBook Air at a more
affordable price point you know starting
around eleven twelve hundred dollars so
that's an accessible way to sort of jump
into a Mac and I think it's a really
good value and if you watched my macbook
air review on the latest generation it
got better and it got a lower price
point so that's sort of what I was
looking for in this model they should
have dropped the old form factor
completely and just made this model here
cheaper now everybody knows Apple's
margins are significant they rarely run
lost leaders in terms of hardware they
bake in a fairly significant margin now
I understand that the retina technology
which is damn beautiful by the way and
I'm sure you guys watched my unboxing
video and probably really appreciated it
it's a damn beautiful screen an almost
impossible form factor this is really a
beautiful piece of engineering but I
maintain my opinion on this particular
system obviously there going to be
people out there that spend their whole
day on their computers and for them it
might be easy to justify that kind of
investment but for the rest of us who
sort of compute on a number of different
devices doing something over here a
little something over there so on and so
forth it's pretty hard to recommend a
twenty two hundred dollar investment in
a single piece of kit by today's
standards like I said people are
computing in a different manner than
they ever have before and that needs to
be considered now obviously these are
flying off the shelves
people don't care people are addicted to
Apple products and there are so many of
us that make a living using these
products that it's tough to not be
compelled to go out and drop another
twenty two hundred dollars on something
that earns you your living that's how we
all justify but I think we as creative
professionals need to start demanding
more and by that I mean nothing freely
like you know like a Retina display and
and an inch thinner and things like that
that's all fine and dandy like I'm happy
about it and it is beautiful and all the
rest of it but we need real stuff like a
lower price point that to me is far more
significant and would make a far bigger
statement than some of these part
improvements and I know Apple doesn't
want to do it because they want to keep
you prepared to spend that to jeez every
time a new model comes out because as I
said before they bake in that
significant margin they want to keep you
prepared for it they don't want us you
know Pro users so to speak to get used
to getting a new model for fifteen
hundred dollars or a thousand dollars
for that matter but if the PC market has
had any bearing on how things are it's a
you know it did you don't stay at the
top forever by you know not iterating by
keeping the same form factor the same
price points the same methodology and
things are going to get more competitive
in fact they already are so many people
are getting by computing on mobile
devices and trust me I know I look at
the YouTube statistics for example and
almost half the views now are coming
from mobile devices so people are
spending time on very cheap devices that
do basic things and don't do half the
stuff that this one does and as a result
this should be cheaper and more
competitive if people are going to keep
buying these things that's my opinion
take it or leave it I know I went on and
on and I rant it a little bit I love the
Machine don't get me wrong it's the
quickest thing I've had on my desk in a
long long time it exports videos in four
freaking minutes all the rest of it you
name it it's a beauty I don't think it's
worth twenty two hundred dollars that's
my take anyway guys I'm going to let you
roll out on a message from the sponsors
right here if you're a lover of this
particular machine please don't go drop
