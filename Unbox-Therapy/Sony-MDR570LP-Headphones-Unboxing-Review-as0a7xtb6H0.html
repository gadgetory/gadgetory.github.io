therapy and today we're taking a look at
the sony MDR 570 LP headphones yes I
know Sony's got those long product names
but the reason that I picked these up is
because I wanted a travel style
headphone something slim but not an
earbud and I've got a lot of big
headphones tons in fact including the
sony xba-1 ZAR decent they've got decent
frequency response from twelve to twenty
two thousand Hertz and they've got a 30
millimeter driver which should be decent
for bass representation not quite to the
level of the XP 500s but decent
nonetheless if you guys haven't seen my
unboxing of those XP five hundreds I
keep talking about which are like my
favorite headphones right now then check
that out I'll put a link in the
annotations as well as in the
description but let's talk about this
unboxing it's the regular bare-bones
Sony headphone unboxing experience here
you've just got a little pamphlet
explaining what's included they have
included a little cable management
adapter although I'm not sure why
because the headphones have only got
about four feet of cord which is what
you'd expect on a portable headphone
anyways I suppose it's for travel or
something along those lines here's a
closer look it is made of plastic but it
does look metallic because of the kind
of paint that they use so I do like the
appearance and there are metallic
components especially on the adjustment
mechanism here you can see you've got a
lot of play on the actual headphone
itself this headband is wrapped in
leather so it's got a nice finish and a
nice touch to it but the main thing here
is that these are so lightweight that
you don't need a gigantic headband to
support them they kind of just rest
there on top of your ears and you don't
even feel them they're light as a
feather to be honest with you but there
is a trade-off there's not a ton of
sound isolation with these headphones
here's a better look at that cable
management adapter again as I said
you'll probably only going to use that
for travel and here's one of my pet
peeves a straight connector instead of a
right angle connector I really wish they
had a gun with the right angle connector
even better a 45-degree angle connector
which I'm seeing on some headphones
these days so here
they are up against those XP 500s that I
talked about and as you can see it's
night and day the XP five hundreds are
gigantic you know they have been
nicknamed the Princess Leia headphones
they're super comfortable but wearing
them on the street they're huge and they
also almost isolate sound too much to
the point where you're you know you're
jumpy when you see something come up
over your shoulder I kind of wanted
something that was less isolating as
crazy as that is so here's a look at
that right angle connector as I
mentioned before on the XP 500s I wish
they had have used this style connector
on these 570 LPS instead they went for
the old-school straight connector and a
gigantic one at that kind of weird for a
travel style headphone I'm going to get
you even closer here you can appreciate
the paint job you can also appreciate
that adjustment mechanism that is
entirely metallic so you know they're
built to last they actually feel nice
and sturdy and this is very well padded
for an on the ear headphone as you guys
can tell I'm pretty impressed I'm
actually using these headphones to
record this audio right now I have
listened to a little bit of Daft Punk
the Tron soundtrack and these things
have done a pretty good job for a
headphone that is this size and weight
and this at this price point I mean like
I mentioned I paid only twenty-five
dollars for these I have to say I am
fully impressed if you're looking for a
travel headphone and you don't like
in-ear style headphones you might want
to check these out anyway guys if you
