they're interesting metal slabs
interesting because these slabs
represent the most highly anticipated
probably devices that are going to come
out soon on the right hand side over
here we have the next generation Galaxy
Note represented and then over here is
the entire Apple lineup well now the
iPhone is a little bit less interesting
because I've already kind of profiled it
we had the clone version as well which
actually what probably isn't all that
close to the eventual iPhone 11 these
are likely a lot closer especially when
it comes to the camera implementation
but then I haven't actually looked at or
held the next generation note format so
over here for the first time ever you're
gonna have two versions of the Galaxy
Note series you're going to have the
standard no 10 and then the note 10 Plus
which gets even bigger and compared to
the max version of the next gen I phone
what you'll notice if I flip it around
it's substantially more screen
especially in the in the height
Department now if you look at this
closely what you'll notice is this tiny
tiny little representation of where the
frame will be and instead this is gonna
have glass that wraps around right to
this tip of this edge right here and
it's gonna be glass of course on the
front and the back so presumably you'll
have a display that stretches from the
very far corner top corner to the very
far bottom whereas in Apple's case
you're working with a bit of a bezel and
then of course you're still gonna
maintain the current version or at least
something very close to the current
version of the face ID notch that exists
whereas in Samsung's case it looks like
they're gonna have the smallest hole
punch setup that they've ever had
implemented this is scaled down quite
significantly from what we're currently
looking at especially on the s10 Plus
which has the larger dual front-facing
camera hole punch I don't know it's
probably half the size
of the hole-punch on the standard
version Galaxy S 10 so what does that
mean for you it just means a whole lot
more screen in this form factor now
weirdly enough it gets a bit confusing
as far as which one of these you're
supposed to go to because like I said in
the past the note series was perceived
already as a professional option as a
kind of pro version of the S range like
you had to S 10 or s 9 previously and
then you had the note series 4 maybe
even slightly bigger battery slightly
bigger display and then the pen input
but now you've got two versions of it so
it might get a bit confusing for
customers that said options are always
good but the standard note series
size-wise still the screen is somewhere
in the same territory as the max version
of the iPhone though it does look to be
slightly more narrow but then in your
hand it feels tiny comparatively to the
max version of the iPhone and that's
because of this very sharp edge they've
been able to engineer again this is
gonna feel likely even better when you
have the glass metal combination but
even right now I mean this feels way
smaller than my 1 plus 7 pro this feels
smaller than most flagships I've held in
a while so then you're like okay I guess
there's a portability component there's
a single-handed functionality component
to the smaller size note but when it
comes to note users in general I have to
believe they're going to gravitate
towards the bigger one because you
typically that's that's the reason to go
for this particular devices kind of get
the the biggest form factor that's out
there especially when you consider using
the pen if you're into using the pen
then you can you know it's gonna be a
two-handed scenario anyway so anyhow
we're gonna see two versions I don't
think there's going to be any kind of
performance different difference between
these two from a spec perspective beyond
the fact that the bigger one will
obviously get a bigger display and a
bigger battery to go with that bigger
display maybe a few extra pixels on that
display as well but otherwise I think
you're gonna see similar chips inside
similar performance specs so it'll just
come down to that and then oh and also
maybe you'll see
the bigger charger the higher wattage
charger go with the pro version the Plus
version whatever it is they happen to
call it okay now on the Apple side over
here
this for the first time at least for me
is this is the first time I've seen all
three of the potential iPhone 11s
together in the same spot the max is the
only one I played with in mock-up and
the clone version and it's a familiar
size it's basically the same
specification size-wise as the current
version it's very close the camera cut
out it's controversial people have
different opinions on it jack thinks it
looks terribly ugly I think people will
probably get used to it as they normally
do with Apple devices Apple had to go
and do some reengineering here they had
to advance to a certain degree because
all these other manufacturers are
sticking more cameras on they had to do
something but what they did scale wise
is they made the cheap model the R model
which is represented in the center here
will likely only have two cameras they
made it in between the two from a scale
perspective so as you can see it scales
up accordingly here this being the
standard version of the iPhone 11
feeling somewhat small by today's
standards this would be the are
represented here in the middle and then
we have the big boy on the far end of
the spectrum
should I get a measuring tape
the standard version iPhone 11 model
over here coming in diagonal measurement
and around here about five and
three-quarter inches measured diagonally
somewhere in that territory the the
budget our version of course gonna be a
bit larger there you're gonna have
similar to the current model probably
it's looking around six inches and the
biggest max version of the next
generation iPhone is going to measure
around six and a half diagonally now
where things get interesting in my
opinion is on the notes side because as
I mentioned you have the disc
bleh really moving around the edge of
the device so you kind of have to
measure it almost from the very corner
to corner and in this form factor I mean
you're measuring close to six and a half
on the little note series and when you
when you know that when you hold these
two together they feel like totally
different size phones just because of
the way Apple treats the edge of the
device comparatively you can see if this
one is thinner and it feels more narrow
so it just is a lot more comfortable for
one-handed use and then if you go up to
the big guy
the Pro Plus version of the note things
get even crazier it's almost seven
inches diagonally on this device and it
feels I would say it doesn't feel all
that much bigger than the max version of
the iPhone so if you're a power user and
you're looking for the kind of ultimate
screen to body ratio the ultimate screen
that you can get in a package that's
manageable I think there's no doubt here
that this particular implementation on
the Samsung side is going to give you
more screen for your scale and that's
not even factoring in the bezel and the
notch which is of course occupying some
of the real estate all right so there
you have it represented in their
metallic structures the future of
flagship smartphones from Apple and
Samsung and now I guess you get to
select you get to tell me which one it
is that you're waiting for or most
excited for man the stuff is stacking up
I would say at this point I am pretty
confident that these here are very close
representations of the eventual devices
based on what's leaked up until this
point in the fact that this type of
stuff is showing up at the studio to
begin with I think Apple users are gonna
have to become happy with this
particular camera implementation because
I don't see some other version happening
anytime soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
