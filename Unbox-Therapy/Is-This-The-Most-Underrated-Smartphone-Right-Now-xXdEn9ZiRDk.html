from you guys to check out this device
in front of me this is the 16th
it's the latest device from a zoo I have
featured some of their products in the
past one of their devices that had a
screen on the back of the phone they've
done some interesting stuff you might
not have had exposure to this particular
brand that said in certain parts of the
world they're putting out some some
really competitive stuff and you can
pick up a device like this one the 16th
starting around 360 bucks so this one is
kind of targeting the polka phone area
of the segment it's got close to
flagship specs Snapdragon 805 processor
3000 milliamp hour battery the one in
front of me has 128 gigs of storage and
8 gigs of RAM
you're talking about a 20 megapixel
camera on the front dual lens setup on
the back now if you are in North America
you'll likely need to import this device
you can do so through Aliexpress and
just keep in mind you want to check your
local bands for your particular wireless
provider to make sure they're supported
by the unit that you actually purchase
this one features LTE and that'll work
on certain carriers so just make sure
before you buy there is a plus version
this is the smaller of the two now
apparently this device is also very
light and slender weird name as well I
should mention it is not meizu 16 it is
16
ah I almost forgot features an inbuilt
fingerprint scanner which is incredibly
unusual at this particular price point
it has a slim bezel curved bezel top and
bottom I'm a fan of this you guys know
I'm not a big notch guy let me peel this
off peel this off peel this off peel the
midnight black you can see the dual lens
setup here 20 megapixels 12 megapixels
Sony sensor so it should be pretty good
you know cost to performance ratio below
there is what looks like a flash kind of
a ring flash unique design this glass
design is what everyone's going for it's
that luxury feel and to be honest at
this price point it's one of the
differentiating factors of this device a
lot of the competitors
delivering similar specs at this price
are not giving you these materials metal
and glass is pretty much all that's on
here you still have the headphone jack
many of you are fans of this I myself
don't see the need to rush it out the
door you would be type-c over here
beside that a case to get you started a
hard shell and it's very slim and I kind
of like that yeah it's free okay
type C on one end classic USB on the
other your sim tool and your quick
charge power brick included in the box
okay very nice
given the price point you're probably
wondering what is this display all about
well it happens to actually be AMOLED
fhd plus so you place your finger on the
display right over here I'll make sure
it gets every angle of your finger cool
succeeded all right whoo you know what
it's pretty effective
this is what's so weird to me why is it
that Apple for example would be
reluctant to do that why is it that
market leaders who should have way more
money to invest in tech like that or to
even buy up companies that are capable
of doing it because for me that's just
an easy obvious fix to the problem of
having strictly faced ID and if users
understand that it's an optical scan if
they understand that maybe it doesn't
have the same security level then what's
the problem you just give them the
option for the end display okay now
obviously as you can tell straight away
there's a pretty heavy skin situation
going on it is not stock Android
although the settings menu is very
similar it's got your usual eye friendly
modes there's some different
optimization modes for the display as
well from adaptive standard photo it's
set to dynamic out of the box you can
also toggle in your color temperature
independently it's got always on display
functionality raised to wake and so on
so something that's interesting to me
about this phone is how slender how slim
and light it is here's the pixel 3xl
even makes that one feel a bit fat I
guess the materials here do give off a
premium vibe fingerprints are a bit out
of hand though like I do have to say
alright now the camera seems to be an
area where you make some compromises but
ever since all these manufacturers at
the lower end started to just use these
very similar Sony sensors you've seen
the caliber of the budget smartphone
camera just elevate substantially we
have our usual little test here we've
got Conor we got the plant there's a
beer bottle back there this is just the
standard photo mode I have not changed
anything
by default beauty mode looks set to off
by default I like that thank you very
much and what do we have okay you know
maybe it's a little blown out in certain
parts it is a super bright environment
the image is OK and I'm gonna take a
zoom for your money is that gonna
suffice I think I'd say so now of course
it does have a portrait mode also
I don't know if I look at the lines
around the hair you can see it's pretty
good I told you guys I'm not a huge fan
of this mode in the first place
there are so few phones that do it well
video mode we can go up to 4k 16 by 9
it's 1080p by default it also has an HDR
functionality so let's just give HDR a
chance here also whoo of course we get a
little bit more dynamic range with the
HDR turned on selfie I mean we got to do
it the beauty mode enabled by default
trying to boot there's Jack not
beautiful maybe we can work on that
anyhow face beauty off thank goodness ok
cool oh ok I mean we've seen some more
selfies in here in the studio we've seen
them we've seen worse
Jack that's a phone that starts around
360 bucks in some cases but it's not the
best selfie we've ever taken here it is
by no means the worst need to check out
the speaker is very important ok ok so
they're doing what a lot of other
manufacturers are doing descending sound
out of the bottom as well as the
earpiece kind of the high end being
represented out of the earpiece as a
secondary unit not quite stereo sound
even though some companies are calling
it that but you can't completely block
the sound and you get some extra clarity
especially on dialogue by having
something forward firing so I'm a big
fan of this style of implementation
especially when you're dealing with such
a slim bezel to begin with there's not a
lot of places to put speakers so this
little sliver speaker unit I mean that's
kind of a good move
this phone is a bit of a surprise I got
to be honest here's a good phone for an
affordable price here's an incredibly
slim form factor here's a high screen to
body ratio here's uh we don't need a
knotch even though everyone else is
doing one snapdragon a four five here's
eight gigs of ram here's 128 gigs of
storage here's a 3000 milliamp hour
battery here's an OLED display that's
six inches F HD plus you kind of get
where I'm going here here's a headphone
jack cuz you still want it here's a free
case in the box here's a fingerprint
magnet no they didn't say that in
testing but there is a fingerprint
sensor in the screen again at that price
and functioning the way that this one
does that's a kind of compelling package
isn't it an unexpectedly compelling
package I'm starting to understand why
you guys were sending me those tweets
about this device and in fact you had
questions you were like what about this
versus the polka phone now obviously the
polka phone has a much bigger battery
it's got four thousand milliamp hour
battery so we need to take that into
consideration
but this trade might be one that some
people are willing to make because here
you have what I would consider to be
traditionally a more premium build with
the glass and metal you have a slimmer
profile you have a no knotch situation
which I know matters to some you have a
six inch display in probably the most
comfortable to hold form factor
maybe that I've ever held maybe you
would be willing to trade a slightly
bigger battery for those things I don't
know maybe I could get by utilizing this
thing maybe I could live they never
cease to amaze me what they can deliver
at the prices that they're doing it
there's no gimmicks here at the 16th
from meizu I think it definitely
deserved some attention from me if you
guys want to see me potentially switch
over to this you can always let me know
down in the comments section I think
it's pretty impressive now that it's
dipped below 400 bucks that's my take
but anyhow
we'll tell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
