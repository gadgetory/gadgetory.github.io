therapy and today we're taking a look at
the avermedia Game Capture HD this
device is gonna capture gameplay from
your favorite console it'll do the ps3
the Xbox 360 or the Nintendo Wii and
it'll do so without the need to add
anything that isn't in this box meaning
all the cables you need to connect any
of those consoles is right in here it's
also got its own smart management system
and the reason for that is because it's
a standalone solution there is no
computer necessary to operate this and
the reason why that's cool is because
not everybody has a computer next to
where their console lives and also it's
kind of ridiculous to use all the
resources of your computer for something
that such a simple device can handle so
this one can do it one of two ways
you can either hook up an external USB
hard drive or USB key or you can install
a two and a half inch SATA hard drive
right into the unit you can imagine like
up to a one terabyte hard drive you get
plenty of space to store all your
gameplay footage another cool thing here
is that you can either use NTFS or fat32
file systems and on top of that is gonna
record in h.264 codec which is
incredibly easy to work with once you
get to your mac or pc so anyways let's
go ahead look inside the box see what we
get and see how to set it up so on and
so forth
should be pretty self-explanatory as I
mentioned before they include all the
cables necessary to hook up to any of
those aforementioned consoles now you
guys know I mentioned earlier about
possibly getting into gameplay footage
possibly getting into commentary
possibly getting into game reviews using
a device like this and you guys had sort
of mixed opinion on whether or not I
should do that or if I should do that on
this channel or if I should do it on the
B's feed or if I should start a complete
other channels so have a little vote
down in the comments let me know what
you vote for anyways as you can see in
this little pamphlet here you can either
use a USB key external drive you could
hook it up to a games console blu-ray
player as you can see these are the very
basic instructions on how to get it up
and running everything is run via
component cables just like on any
capture card the difference being that
the the actual capturing part happens
right here locally instead of just
feeding the video signal out to a
computer to do the capturing now you get
this inner
national style powered after a lot of
companies are including these kinds of
adapters these days really helps them
ship one model across the whole world
and also if you happen to move somewhere
else in the world you can just get a
different tip for it at least in theory
imagine assuming that it's available and
they're real easy to install I'm in
North America obviously so I got the
North American tip and you can see you
just slide it down and you're ready to
go you've got your power there now this
is the cable that's real cool it's three
consoles in one so this component cable
here is gonna handle your Xbox 360 your
ps3 or your Nintendo Wii and I like the
fact that it's all in one cable it means
you don't have to keep track of a number
of different cables and you don't have
to go out and buy anything after the
fact I know that some of the other
manufacturers require you to do so so
here it is it's all in one package
incredibly smart and easy to use I can't
wait to get it all hooked up the next
thing we've got is the actual device
here you can see it looks a lot like
some of the other capture devices on the
market but it has obviously some
different features that we'll show you
in a second here it's got a matte finish
on the top the front side is where
you'll see your USB port as I mentioned
earlier you can hook up either an
external hard drive or USB key and on
the back of the device is where all the
action takes place all the other action
you've got component in and component
out obviously you want to see what
you're playing while you're playing and
you've got audio in and out that's
important so you want to hear wait I
think while you're playing and record it
and you've also got DC in to power up
the device now on the bottom is where
this thing gets interesting this is
where you could install your two and a
half inch hard drive is a little
pamphlet here telling you not to remove
the drive while you're using it yeah I
think that's pretty obvious that you
shouldn't do that
but you've got a regular SATA connector
for a two and a half inch drive you can
imagine throwing a 1 TB or even a 500
gig in here you've got plenty of space
no computer necessary very cool I'm
probably going to use the USB port on
the front because I've got externals
lying around I'll see how that goes plus
it's an easy way to transport the media
and then you've got a dedicated record
button power button and an IR receiver
that's because this baby's got a little
remote with it that's another cool
feature they've even included component
cables from the device to your TV and
audio cables from the device here to
your TV so they've
thought about everything I mean they
really haven't missed out on anything
here you do not have to go out and buy
anything you've even got the batteries
for your remote so this is a cool little
remote with some basic functionality but
also has some cool dedicated buttons
you've got a dedicated snapshot button
for taking a snapshot at any time record
button you've got a disc info button to
tell you how much more space you've got
you can change the quality of recording
from here everything from your couch
without getting up without walking over
to your PC or anything like that you've
also got the user manual in case you
want to do a little bit more having
trouble setting it up but it is pretty
straightforward I'm obviously gonna do a
more inclusive video where I actually
show you guys some footage of what it
looks like this was the unboxing and as
I said earlier if you got if you guys
want to vote on where the gameplay
footage should go or how I should handle
it or what I should do with it or if I
should even do it
vote down in the comment section anyway
