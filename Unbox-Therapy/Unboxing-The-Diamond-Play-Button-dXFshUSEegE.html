and I'm pretty sure I know what it is
and it came along with the notes so I
might as well pull that over dear Lois
at a hundred thousand we thought not bad
that's a healthy new channel at 1
million we thought wow this creators
pretty awesome but ten million at this
point we're actually scratching our
heads how on earth did you do that 10
million subscribers isn't just a lot of
people it's more than the entire
population of New York City 10 million
is a lot this is a note from Susan the
CEO of YouTube and inside this box is
the diamond play button that's right the
diamond play button the peak of all
buttons we even passed 10 million
subscribers now at this point which is
crazy the number keeps growing you guys
keep watching I'm incredibly grateful of
course as a little boy my interest in
technology was just an interest but it
continued into adolescence and then
adulthood and somehow that enjoyment
that passion that interest somehow
turned into this right here you me the
button jack well the whole project so it
only makes sense that we do this
together no matter which stage you came
along and I can say that as of now I
appreciate you being there and taking
part and being a part of the ride in
general and what better channel to unbox
the diamond play button than unbox
therapy so let's do it
the first thing I notice is the little
cleaning cloth you got to keep it
polished there's a key two keys old for
the briefcase of course oh wow it is
heavy holy way heavier than I expected
whoa look at that this is solid do I
need a speech I don't have a speech
prepared here who can I thank I don't
know man of course thank jack where
would we be without without this camera
lens here well don't forget well
congratulations on passing 10 million
subscribers unbox therapy ok
you know what let's go guys come on
camera come on let's go
jeez guys we're trying to celebrate here
okay there we are we got will we got
Jack it's the team oh we're missing a
couple but we might as well share in the
celebration a little bit everybody has
played a role in this entire endeavor of
course you guys as well I already told
you that Jack what would you be doing
without without them we got to do
something here that we all enjoy very
much and I know that's not necessarily
the case for everyone that's out there
everyone in the world not a lot of
people get to focus on something that
they're passionate about I'm out there
in the world I realize it's not that
common and yes there's a lot of hard
work and consistency and so on we
published I don't know
over a thousand videos maybe even in 15
hundred videos like it is hard work it
is a grind but at the end of the day you
take the moment you reach a milestone
like this you hold on to a diamond play
button like this and you just reminisce
a little bit you just realize that you
are that you're gracious you want to put
some gratitude out there into the world
we are gonna do that actually - there's
a crazy giveaway coming up in order to
commemorate this milestone so definitely
stick around for that so thank you
seriously from the bottom of my heart
and theirs because they're not gonna
tell you the unbox therapy family we are
happy to have you don't leave us hanging
we need you
all right much love 10 million here's to
the next are we gonna hit 100 ever I
think so
soon here's to the next billion later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
