I did a video about a five dollar
smartphone a four dollars a four dollar
smartphone this really bizarre situation
where and we're about to find out what
the hell is four dollar phone does
people were pre-ordering this eventual
smartphone that would be sold for four
dollars it was like everyone thought it
sounded too good to be true
and it turned out that it was and then
those phones never ended up shipping and
it was a huge fiasco how are you this
afternoon alrighty then
well maybe a $4 or $5 smartphone is not
a reality right now for various reason
but I have what is the cheapest phone
period that I've ever looked at by far
by a longshot
no it's not a smartphone as you can tell
looking at the picture here if vive v1
made in India a monochrome display a SIM
card slot is kind of important on a
phone torchlight phonebook FM radio SMS
and 650 million power batteries how much
would you pay for something like that
this is five dollars it's a real thing
you can go out and buy this right now
why is it interesting well you kind of
have to adjust your mindset a global
perspective on this it's made in India
first of all so it's made in the
domestic market and sold to domestic
customers this may be their very first
point of connectivity we all know where
that goes from there so this is gonna
put a phone in the hands of a lot of
individuals who maybe never had a phone
before so the question is what were they
able to pack in here for five bucks
okay cool unboxing experience is fairly
bare-bones that's about it let's see the
cheapest phone made in India thank you
there's a power brick to charge it up
removable battery and there is the
device what a throwback that is kind of
reminds me of my first Nokia or
something like that a number pad as well
as the old-school t9 style texting
navigation happens here to call and hang
up earpiece up top monochrome display on
the top there's a flashlight
I wouldn't expect to see that in a $5
phone a headphone jack oh my goodness
even a $5 phone has a headphone jack so
no microUSB it's got a tube style
connector and it looks like the speaker
is on the back over here here we have
our SIM card tray first of all it looks
like there's a sim already in there
maybe they give you a simmer maybe they
gave me a sim I don't know let's see
what happens let's see if this has juice
there it is monochrome but a little bit
of contrast there no big deal
ambulance police here's the flashlight
there you go
possibly an emergency phone that
somebody could keep in the glove box of
their car or something all of a sudden
you start to understand why you would
want to have a flashlight there oh you
need to have headphones plugged in for
the radio because the headphones are
gonna act as the antenna there's a
calculator built-in six plus six equals
well there you go games is actually oh
it has snake and only snake okay
I'm having some nostalgic feelings right
here we have messages there's a phone
book let's try the different ringtones
what was he doing
I'm asking you I didn't need vitamin yet
I find that a little difficult to
believe that piercing my favorite is
number whew
a lot of drama there has a surprisingly
strong vibration motor so if you can't
hear it you can feel it I don't think
I'm gonna be able to put my sim card in
here to make a phone cause the problem I
think it's a micro these ear pods
what are these cost will us price 35
bucks
35 5 let's see if we get this FM radio
to work on here oh so this is action
this is acting as the antenna right now
that's a pretty loud speaker
a little FM radio might cost you five
bucks I don't know pixel to XL Viva be
one eight hundred and fifty dollars five
dollars how many of these could you get
for one of those a hundred and seventy
with the quick mats who's that guys
quick maths he goes two plus two is four
what not freaked out now obviously I'm
not comparing the two that wouldn't be
fair that's not fair at all
but 170 people with the connection with
some form of connection to the rest of
the planet or just one fancy boy like
will do with this fancy smart phone you
want to browse I want to be on social
media we're gonna be on my Twitter
tweeting smart phone people unbelievable
it's such an unusual thing to feature I
went on the Amazon page some people are
upset they're like call quality not that
grey the thing I like about dumb phones
in general their functionality is basic
so generally what you end up with
something that can turn into a good
emergency phone is it this thing is five
bucks and what does that mean for smart
phones and connectivity on that front
that price keeps coming down as well and
so accessibility goes up the more we can
create and distribute ideas $5 phone
it's not something I thought I would see
technology it keeps pushing and I like
that and I think you should too
vive v1 it's a thing it's real you can
buy this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
