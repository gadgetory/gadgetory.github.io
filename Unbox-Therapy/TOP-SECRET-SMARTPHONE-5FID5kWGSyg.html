another video and today it is something
exciting and exclusive in front of me is
not a box B instead it is a briefcase of
fancy briefcase and what I know at this
point is there is an exclusive device
inside the new flagship smartphone from
Huawei delivered by hand let's jump
inside this briefcase and see what it's
all about
so this is just not not not a standard
briefcase guys this is like the code I
didn't even know until right now that's
how secure this situation has been unbox
therapy embossed in leather so what
that's called that's it that's embossed
right very secure in fact triple zero in
this case oh can you see all that what
we have here my friends so this is uh
this is some kind of custom case here
the device is in the middle the new p9
here there's also a leather case and
then lastly very special booklet here
congratulations Luis you're the first
person in the world to unbox the new
Huawei p9 and then lastly underneath
here we have the accessories
unbelievable and we think about all the
attention to detail that goes into
manufacturing something like a high-end
smartphone why not present it in a way
that it deserves to be presented like
this this is the key right here the fact
that you have this dual lens system Co
engineered with Leica if you guys don't
know Leica you probably don't know
photography these guys have been around
forever one of them is RGB while the
other is monochrome capturing more light
and better clarity so it's to 12
megapixel sensors to separate 12
megapixel sensors 5.2 inch full HD
display at 1080p it's also got Android
6.0 three gigs of ram 32 gigabyte wrong
it's also got an 8 megapixel F 2.4
front-facing camera and the battery is
3000 milliamp hour
whoa very nice USBC for charging it up
in ear style earbuds and it does support
quick charge the first thing that stood
out to me here is just how thin the
overall design is it's not much thicker
than a USB port your power switch on the
right hand side of the device we have
the SIM card tray this also features a
micro SD card slot it's one of those
combo sort of sleds on the back of the
device you can see the specs listed for
the dual lens system from Leica and also
in the center there is a dual tone flash
on the bottom of device you'll find a
speaker as well as the USBC connector
you will notice a fairly vibrant display
here launching into the camera
application now the camera is actually
pretty quick pretty rapid-fire when it
comes to taking pictures so as mentioned
earlier the p9 features a dedicated
monochrome sensor this will allow you to
take these really high contrast native
black-and-white images so one of my
favorite features in the camera app
little button that looks like some
aperture blades this allows you to
utilize both of those lenses essentially
what you end up with here is the ability
to change your focus to simulate some
kind of depth of field it's really
unique ability to focus in on what
matters within the frame so we can
select any area of the image and change
focus after the fact I'll probably be
posting some of these samples shortly
after this video on my Instagram so make
sure to go follow me there to check
those out so let's go ahead and snap a
real quick selfie here dare I say krispy
dare I say okay I'm going to enroll my
fingerprint on the back here you want to
go ahead and unlock it look at how look
at how fast that is watch it you see
that
and once again we will be evaluating
something that YouTube yes it works
thank God that of course is the main
reason you would get any smartphone of
course to watch more unbox therapy right
right Jack tell them there you have it a
quick look at the new flagship device
from Huawei this my friends is the p9
with this very interesting collaboration
with Leica lastly before I take off
I've actually got an extra p9 big shout
out to Wow way for hooking one of you
guys up if you want to win this just
head over to my Twitter I'll link it in
the description I'll have all the
instructions over there I'm going to
make it very easy for one lucky person
to get their very own device and bite
that photography bug does that make any
sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
