been exploding you seeing these things
pop up left right and center now I made
a video a little while back evolve
Carbon GT right jack Oh a little more
juice now you probably notice that in
front of me is not a box or something at
all that resembles a longboard this
company right here believes that
Electric skateboards don't need to be
that big maybe they can be a little bit
more portable maybe there's another way
to think about it so in front of me here
is one of the first models of the lew
electric skateboard that's right I said
Lou like Lou and you see so that was
just too good to be true
actually this Lou is spelled L oh you
this Lou is le W because that's the way
Lewis is spelt in my case so I guess I
can settle it once and for all in the
comment section you want to address me
do it the right way
Kickstarter or IndieGoGo I'll link it
down below I think there's a few days
left on the campaign the motors are
built into the wheel which is different
she is a new electric skateboard that is
fast portable reliable and durable she's
made of carbon fiber has two motors in
the back wheels and an internal battery
in the deck you can ride Lou even when
her battery dies so I guess you can push
it like a traditional skateboard when
then battery dies you can ride Lou if it
is wet or rainy so would you check that
out it looks a lot more like a normal
skateboard a tool for the trucks these
trucks look a lot more like traditional
skateboard trucks to be honest
power-switch charge port in that
location over there mmm check out the
grip nothing too bright or flashy the
remote here a couple of LEDs to identify
if you have juice to accelerate brake it
charges microUSB so no batteries
necessary rechargeable that's good micro
USB cable as well so the front wheel
looks kind of like a traditional large
skateboard wheel but here it's covered
up and that's because the motor actually
lives inside this wheel probably the
most appealing thing about this to me is
just how understated it looks and
doesn't really scream electric
skateboard at first glance first
impression here I'm excited to try it
out
alright so we're outside would be the
obvious place to test an electric
skateboard the longboard
tom has it somewhere so we're going to
do Alan maybe we'll do a little race at
some point this is a far more portable
version as you can tell plus as I think
I mentioned earlier it works like a
normal skateboard too you can see if
there's no hold up I can just pedal it
if the batteries happen to run out on a
remote there's two settings so if you
slide to the right that's gonna be your
safe mode your basic learner's boat it's
not too fast and then if you go to the
left it's actually pretty quick so far
my testing so anyway we're gonna ride it
around see what it's all about compare
it to the other one and give you some
feedback big Tom hey bud easy there
the overt the overtook me on the drag
race it has a more gradual acceleration
so it can get up to a pretty fast speed
but it doesn't fling you off it's not as
twitchy as that one in that said when
you are at a high speed six years
you don't have such a long wheelbase you
kind of feel a little bit more wobbly I
would say I'm actually kind of amazed at
how fast this little thing can go you
can see it's got the belts it's got a
whole belt system up there and that's
part of the reason why you can't really
pedal this thing without resistance out
here there's probably an advantage for
this one but super urban scenario look
at how much shorter this thing is plus
with the lip on the back you can quickly
change directions on this thing whoa
easy there bud
it's kind of tough to compare the two
because I really feel like they're for
different customers I feel like a lot of
people may have held off on those long
boards just because of the lack of
portability compared to the Lu board
over here which as I've said throughout
the video in an urban environment it's
going to be tough to be at the short
wheelbase you're not really bothering
everyone it looks less like an electric
skateboard you can get it a little bit
wet everything sealed underneath of it
the frogs a big fan of the Lu skateboard
look at him he also rode both and he
says go for it this thing's a lot of fun
if you haven't tried an electric
skateboard before and you're like I know
on the fence about it this is a good way
to get into it's not as expensive as the
other one and it's far more portable
anyway check out their Kickstarter I
think it's plenty fast any faster than
that with a wheelbase like that your
face plan right Tom right that might be
your first electric skateboard this
might be the electric skateboard that
you want you might have all just
happened right here on unbox therapy
you're welcome
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
