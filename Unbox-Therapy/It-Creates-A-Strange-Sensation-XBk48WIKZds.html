about a while ago it was requested by a
number of you guys you're like glue you
were the guy you have to check this out
let me know if it does what it claims to
do and today I've got it in front of me
this is called the baselet it's kind of
like you know like bracelet but baselet
you put it on your wrist
somehow it tricks your brain it enhances
the feeling of bass in your music I know
it's hard to imagine how does a little
thing on your wrist achieve all that I
did a video on a different version of
body-worn bass today we're gonna crack
into this box and find out if the
baselet is the future of music listening
or if it sucks it was a Kickstarter
project raised like 700,000 bucks close
to a million bucks maybe this is the key
to your to your happiness get yourself
off antidepressants and just where the
baselet this is not the place for
medical advice it's kind of good-looking
nondescript it kind of looks like a
watch scrap the baselet tightly to your
wrist press the top button see the white
light you're all set okay a rubber
wristband clicks in like this it's not
the cheapest thing in the world I
believe it's around two hundred dollars
so take that into consideration also in
the package an extra wristband by the
looks of it a little tool a microUSB
cable to charge it up this little
contraption here will plug into the
headphone jack of your audio source and
then your headphones will plug into this
and hear intensity buttons so you can
toggle whichever kind of intensity
you're looking for now this is cool you
guys know I love magnets check this out
kibou and now you're charging the both
of them up that's kind of genius I'm a
sucker for magnets in general all forms
of magnetic Tom what's going on there
bud got somewhere better to be Tom and
there he goes
hello darkness my old friend
tartness smile friend if this video gets
50,000 thumbs up I'm sure we can
convince Tom to come back it might take
a hundred thousand thumbs for Tom to
come back he just texted me hundred
thousand minimum come on be nice to Tom
alright this is a tool to remove the
strap and replace it yes it is an extra
strap press the top button I see the
white light you're all set I will plug
in the adapter that'll just live in your
pocket and I have a pair of headphones
here now these are fairly flat frequency
response SRH 440s so let's see if we can
get a little more bass and now your
headphone just plugs into here oh I'm
feeling something oh oh oh my goodness
check you can see that man that thing
vibrates look at it watch it
it's thumping I think I got it maxed as
well watch this
[Laughter]
side benefit it'll walk across the table
on its own it's amazing it has a real it
has a ton of power for something this
size it adds a base experience to music
that otherwise wouldn't be there right
you have no rumbling you have no
vibration what I like about this is when
it's on the wrist it's not you can't
hear it buzzing if you are a music
producer or DJ or something like this
could you get more out of the sub pack
and just just call it a day I think this
is more for casual users the only issue
that arises there is the $200 price tag
if I had like a feature request I wish
it did some other things like if they
had a watch face on it as well all of a
sudden that's like I wear a watch
anyways but on its own is a little bit
tougher of a proposition here we go I'm
changing my gear a little bit hip-hop is
probably the beg as far as what I've
listed too so far this put me in a
different vibe
so maybe I'm changing my tune a little
bit maybe this thing is actually pretty
cool you're like an NBA player the video
in the back when they're walking out
with their crazy outfits on they're
trying to get pumped up trying to get
psyched and this is another way another
element to kind of intensify the process
of the bump up music of the bump up song
you know I kind of like it it doesn't
suck I wish it was cheaper and I wish it
did something else but it doesn't suck
you know if you liked his own out you
like to go to a different world there's
no way this ain't gonna enhance it
that's all I'm saying
it's growing on me as a whole it's like
my brain needed a little bit of time to
getting tuned with this idea of feeling
the low end here I have a strange
suspicion that the more I use this thing
the cooler it might become</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
