collector's edition here the game was on
pre-order through EB Games and as a
result we get this extra voucher which
gives you even more extra costumes you
get this voucher whether you preorder
through EB Games or Game Stop and to be
more precise you get the Tron costume
with that preorder amongst some other
things too now the collector's edition
is going to come with its own perks in
particular you're going to get even more
costumes as well even if you didn't
pre-order inside here our first item is
the commemorative sac boy over here is
the game itself
and lastly should be the infamous
bookends which could either be used for
books or maybe even games they're being
kept on an open shelf let's see if I can
get in here and inspect the quality of
these things I'm really not expecting
very much but maybe I'll be surprised
see you
so probably going to need the knife
again to slice this open and it's a
bunch of cardboard sort of protecting
them from one another and the first
thing I notice holding them here the
quality is not that great they kind of
feel almost like a maybe a laminated
plastic or something I don't think
they're wood I guess there are a couple
steps above cardboard but what the hell
did you expect I mean really they're
token pieces put them up on a shelf
remember the fact that you got yourself
the collector's edition because you're
that kind of guy let's get a closer look
at the Sackboy C's got the official
PlayStation tags on them and he's got
this zipper that's half real half fake
put him down get a closer look at the
game here we're going to have to slice
this open to trusty knife here doesn't
back down from anything or anybody
not expecting any surprises inside of
this box just going to have your game
your user manual
that's right so on the right hand side
we got the disc on the left hand side we
have the instruction manual might
actually be useful for the Kinect
controls which have just been added oh
and that's right we've also got our
voucher for buying the collector's
edition it's going to give you a bunch
of extra in-game stuff as well here's a
closer look at the manual now we're
going to get a closer look at some of
the items here here's a better look at
those bookends it's very difficult to
portray the quality through video but
like I said earlier then nothing to
write home about
they're probably exactly what you
expected not that you needed quality
bookends anyways you probably just
wanted to say you've got the collector's
edition here's our here's our toy and
like I said that zipper is not legit
buddy's cool find somewhere to put that
and here is the collectors edition
voucher with all the extras that we get
for purchasing the collector's edition
those are in-game extras and use a
closer look at the GameStop /eb voucher
which gives you even more in-game stuff
so that's probably the major benefit of
this edition it all kinds of in-game
stuff yeah and probably the sack boy
that everyone's going to be talking
about here's a close up of the game
pretty straightforward artwork on there
nothing nothing too fancy and a better
look at the case anyway check out our
channel more unboxings always on the way
and peace and love people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
