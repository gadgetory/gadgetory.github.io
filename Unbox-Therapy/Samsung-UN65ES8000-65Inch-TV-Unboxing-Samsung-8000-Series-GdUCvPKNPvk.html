do a late night unboxing and I thought
you know I might as well share it with
you guys I thought you might be
interested it's a rather large item and
they're tough to unbox it's a television
a 65 inch flat panel the 8000 series
from Samsung with some special features
so I thought you know what let's
struggle through this unboxing together
I'm going to place the camera down on a
shelf over here and give you guys a
closer look at this TV I'll be showing
some gameplay on it too we'll hook the
PlayStation 3 up to it in a second so
let's go ahead and take a closer look we
got AJ in the house to help out these
things are not easy to get out of the
box
good ok
let's spin this now I'm going to grab
the camera and we're going to take a
closer look at some of the accessories
in here before we get to the actual TV
so let's take a look at this over here
this I believe is the IR blaster which I
included to control some of your other
components in your AV rack if you choose
to this system does have some
interesting remote options already
included included including sorry a
Bluetooth option with a touchpad Smart
Remote smart to remote take a look at
that next oh they also included 4 pairs
of 3d glasses how do I jump in there
alright over here
they're the the flat style kind of
funny-looking actually so four pairs of
those guys give give AJ a thumbs up ok
this man's new to unboxing and you can
see that he's already a professional
over here whoa whoa what's this about oh
four batteries cool so anyway it's a
good look this is the touch portion up
here Samsung is actually coming out with
a keyboard with a touchpad on it for
even better data input when you're using
the Smart TV functions but this is a
good look
I believe they include a regular remote
- no oh yeah right over here probably
won't pull this one out of the bag but
this is sort of your standard Samsung
remote that you've been getting for a
number of years very similar looking to
many that I've seen before
number of other things some cables a
little breakout cable there for standard
AV I don't know who's using standard
definition AV on this particular display
probably looks pretty damn terrible and
a bunch of batteries to power everything
up okay I think I'm going to go place
this camera back on the shelf now for
obvious reasons and hopefully we can
lift this flat panel out is it already
on the standard we're gonna have to
install the stand what do you think okay
hopefully it's on the stand and we'll
put it up on the table and then we'll
hook up a console and do a little bit of
gameplay coverage alright hold up one
second wait I need to hydrate Oh
straight hub down here good look at that
we're like professionals I thought we
were gonna screw it up for certain we
see this is these are the rules right
here for TV unboxing you want to have a
happy TV not an angry one see that's me
and AJ right there alright
so you guys can probably get a better
idea or maybe you can't right now it
just looks like a big giant black hole
but um you got this cool little like I
said brushed bezel on here there's also
a webcam included for Skype is built-in
Skype on the smart interface so you can
do your video conferencing right on your
TV it's also got a unique base on it
hopefully uh if AJ can remove that foam
covering down there you can see what the
base looks like very slim and
unobtrusive it actually has smart
interaction so you can use gestures to
control the TV which is kind of crazy I
don't know if I'm going to be you know
using Kinect gestures Kinect style
gestures to control the TV people
probably be walking by the living room
thinking I'm a little bit crazy
you've got smart content of course smart
evolution not really sure what they're
talking about there as a dual-core
processor this TV is actually upgradable
you can actually improve the RAM at a
later date which is kind of interesting
there are four HDMI inputs I believe
last year's model actually had more I
think it had five HDMI inputs which is
kind of strange that's a closer look at
the box and like I said earlier this is
the 8000 series so pretty much the top
of the range if you guys are interested
in more details and specs on this TV
I'll put a link in the description to
the product page so you could check it
out but it is a beast I mean it's one of
the bigger flat panels that you can
actually get so I'm going to cut this
video and we'll jump back to having a
console connected and we'll get a look
at the at the picture with a game on
there one piece of advice for you guys
if you pick up one of these Samsung flat
panels or even any of the modern flat
panels from other manufacturers is that
a lot of them do post-processing to your
image and that introduces a lot of input
lag into your gaming experience so if
your display has a game mode find it and
turn it on it will vastly improve your
experience your screen will respond
faster to the things you input on your
controller which will mean you'll get
more kills you'll perform better trust
me just turn on game mode if it's an
option
on the Samsung TVs it's hidden in
general so you want to scroll down to
general in the settings Oh AJ is going
to do as a favor and show us where it is
so system and then I believe the net its
general is the next one is there general
yeah there you go so system followed by
general and then game mode at the very
top and you want to make sure that's on
and what it'll do is it'll disable a
bunch of other options within the
settings here so you can't modify
everything once you have game mode on
but it's doing it for good reason its
disabling all the post-processing that
is going to you know increase the input
lag on your gaming experience so just
trust me go with game mode on and
everything is going to be better for you
alright guys so here's a look at some
gameplay once again this is the 8000
series from Samsung and you can see it's
really bright lots of contrast here with
the game mode on not a ton of input lag
actually I'll bring even closer into the
image here I should go ahead and walk
around it a little bit just show you
guys how thin it is I don't know if I
did that yet it's stupid thin actually
look at that that's actually crazy thin
man you can see the Fat Boy PlayStation
3 making a bunch of noise rambling along
like a muscle-car USB connection up top
5 volt another USB digital audio out
another USB that one says HDD did the
other ones no this one does external
hard drive I guess USB thumb drive HDMI
IN HDMI IN HDMI IN DVI audio in audio
out and 10 it in you've got analog audio
component in for video and there's a LAN
port for Wired internet although
obviously this TV does have Wi-Fi built
in so you won't need to use that but as
I said earlier stupid thin super bright
screen with lots of contrast as you'd
expect
from Samsung's 8000 series and as I said
earlier guys if you were interested in
pricing and availability on this model
definitely check out the link in the
description W view all the technical
specs as well so I know this has been a
quick and casual video but it is like
2:00 in the morning maybe 3 in the
morning now so that's a super late night
unboxing for a large item appreciate
appreciate your guy's viewership if you
enjoyed this content please remember to
leave a like and favorite down below as
it does help out a bunch and also give
AJ a thumbs up thumbs up give AJ a
thumbs up because it was tough for him
to help out on this unboxing he was
nervous about it
he didn't know what might go down you
know if we dropped the TV it's stressful
sometimes it's a tough gig it's a tough
job sometimes so anyways alright I'm
babbling on right now it's late at night
that's probably why I'm doing it so I'm
going to close out this video thanks for
joining me and I'll catch you guys on
the next one later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
