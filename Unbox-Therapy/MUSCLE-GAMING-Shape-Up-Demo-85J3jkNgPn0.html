Lew here, back with a brand new video for you.
And today it's about to get physical.
You might think that's a little weird...
but that's because Ubisoft just sent out their brand new video game to me.
This is called Shape Up.
And as you can see I'm in the frame right now.
This is a physical game.
Using the Kinect for the Xbox One.
This is exclusive to the Xbox One.
You can actually get a little bit of physical fitness
while having fun at the same time.
On the right hand of the screen you can see me from...
I don't know about an hour ago trying it out for the first time.
This is a game within the game called Stunt Run. I'm gonna give it another shot right know and try to beat my record from a little bit earlier.
Check this out!
Some of the exercises are for your legs, uh...lower body, some of them are for you upper body.
This is my favorite so far.
Oh!
[laughing]
Ha!
[laugh]
Dude!
Ha!
Ha!
Ha ha.
Ha.
I told you...
...this'll get the get the heart rate going.
Let's see if I beat it.
I beat it!
The champion!
Twenty-two thousand.
Did you see I need to get in better shape?
I need a game like this.
Thirty-day challenge.
I'm gonna drop ten pounds.
You heard it here first.
[breathing]
[laughing]
Aha!
I need more cardio, man.
Jeez.
Ha.
Ha.
So as you can tell, this game is no joke.
It had me huffing and puffing, and that's actually pretty impressive.
Believe it or not, I play ice hockey twice a week.
So, even though this physique might not tell you that,
I have a little bit of cardio in the bank,
so if your goal is to get into shape while having a little bit of fun,
possibly playing a video game Shape Up might be your ticket.
If you want to find out more about it, check out the link down in the description to the official trailer.
Leave a &amp;quot;thumbs up&amp;quot; down below if you enjoyed this content.
Leave a thumbs up because you got to see me...
...run around...
...and uh...
...get my heart rate going on camera.
That might be a first here on Unbox Therapy.
Thanks again.
I'll catch you guys on the next episode.
Later.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
