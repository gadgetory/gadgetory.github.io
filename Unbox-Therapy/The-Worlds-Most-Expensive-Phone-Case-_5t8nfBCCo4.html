expensive phone $25,000 I mean you
probably saw the video you didn't go
check it out its ornate for two other
people out there that still need to be
in that territory but maybe not to that
extreme
you got this company here they're making
as far as I can tell the most expensive
iPhone cases on planet Earth and the
companies called gray in this case in
front of me is called the alter-ego
I think this alter-ego why don't we have
here is like two grand something like
that they make another case this thing
which is a bumper and this is also like
two gram for this particular version I
have they sent a bunch of them what
exactly are these crazy expensive cases
how do they look and so on so and you
know let's start with the alter-ego this
is the first thing you have to install
onto the device look at that lodi and
this protects your phone because it's
like machined out of titanium that's
metal or aluminum it's held together by
magnets and now you are in expensive
land territory so pretty much this is
like if you have a Lamborghini you have
to buy this case your key doesn't work
until you have this case for your phone
actually you see at the top here Jack it
says number 14 out of 500 so super
limited again you're talking about
luxury items there's nothing more luxury
than limited you just know that's it I
got one of a handful so it's special it
has to be you have the the little
screwdriver tip what is this this what
is it
Oh extra screws this is the little
message but it's on a metal plate the
spirit of the future engineered today
almost every significant human
achievement has been founded on two
beliefs but the future can be better
than the present and that is it is in
our future power to make it so this is
the spirit of the future yeah that's the
future
you understand he's got like these
little grooves it's obviously machined
anyhow what is this about the support
paperwork so you peel that baby out like
that put this guy on first but it's
rubber sort of protects your device I
mean you're probably gonna want to get
this color on a black iPhone I would
guess you know what's weird about this
though you're putting a case on the
phone and cost more on the phone it's
the case protecting the phone or is the
phone protecting the cake you get this
little screw in there this phone is now
I mean you got the cost of the iPhone
you got the slab on the outside you are
now squarely in the territory of what
like this whole package being 4 grand 3
grand something like that I know what it
is what's on the phone is so valuable
you understand your your messages your
your Pat yeah yeah James Bond stuff
comes around the camera here it doesn't
do it on that side that's a bit strange
now the good thing here is that they
have a less a slightly less intense
version of their ultra expensive case
it's the advent which I actually think
they're more famous for it's a bumper
style even here it is still incredibly
luxury this is metal the whole package
grey on the bottom this is the advent
bumper case and this is the Aurora color
and as you can see is like a color
shifting purple orange blue and you have
the same rubber bumper piece that goes
in first to protect your device it's
actually for an s10 plus that's right
s10 users not left out they can also
enjoy ultimate luxury status there we go
very nice ok all right so they make it
for the Galaxy devices latest ones the
iPhone device is big small and actually
just Aurora color set up with this kind
of back it's a whole vibe look at that
you see that Jack
but this one is actually limited to 50
number 4 out of 50 while again
you an incredible grip on the device
it's all you know very angular but it's
a bit raw as well it's kind of pokey I
don't know this stuff is extreme it's
intense that's kind of the idea of it I
mean this is this is really for people
that are looking for the most outlandish
crazy expensive luxury stuff they ran
out of stuff to buy make that's who it's
for well what's the what seize that
price on this one 1,300 bucks
you see it's still more on the phone you
still rather dent the phone than that
thing it's kind of wild for some
customer out there in the world some
super villain a Russian oligarch what is
all the gardening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
