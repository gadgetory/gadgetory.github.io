you about it in all their glory and
they're all here I mean every last one
even the ones that were tough to track
down how did it happen
I'm still not 100% sure I linked up with
the guys at D brand I said I need some
iPhones and Tim Cook he didn't come
through so what do they do show up with
every single model and then say hey
after your unboxing and why don't you
give him away and I said are you crazy
they said damn straight we're crazy and
I said well me too
if you don't know D brand skins they
make these right here he's cool-looking
skins you can put on your different
devices check them out you can customize
your phone and if you get one of these
jet-black ones you might want to protect
it Apple said it could scratch easily so
1 2 3 4 5 iPhone 7 plus 1 2 3 4 5 iPhone
7s without any more hesitation oh let's
jump inside the boxes iPhone font is
changed now let's see if Dave can pick
that up that's right I said Dave we got
Dave 2d in the house today
Dave come say hello are you having a
good time yet in I am say hello to the
people this channel terrible rose gold
gold the matte black something tells me
that's gonna be my favorite got to be
honest with you the jet black in the
black box so that you feel special oh my
goodness look at this look at all this
candy let me zoom out this might be the
most I phones
I've unboxed in a particular video a
matte black 7 some nice form factor
right there from a layout perspective
you're looking at something super
similar to the 6s of course the camera
at the top is a giveaway this color
happens to be a giveaway and then the
fact that there's no headphone jack on
the bottom is the other way that you can
identify it a power brick and then the
earpods
which they now terminate in this
lightning connector as we expected
that's what you'll be connecting yes
this means you won't be charging your
device and listening to music over a
wired connection at the same time I
don't know what to tell you other than
get used to it or use one of these you
wouldn't expect Apple to include and
adapt
can you see all that dongle action right
there Dave have a dongle here you go
let's go that's a dongle for you seven
seven plus oh I mean that's a look right
there oh my god it's insanely glossy
just looking at that I'm nervous
here they are in all their glory they're
looking like pieces of candy or
something I really want to check to see
what fingerprints do to that jet black
absolute nightmare of course I guess
there's some people that are gonna take
that trade off it's a fingerprint magnet
it's gonna be a scratch magnet okay
the home button doesn't click anymore
I'm sure you've heard that already
you're gonna get used to it but it
certainly it emulates a physical click
so it gives you that haptic kind of
feedback you get the vibration like on
the trackpad on the math books but hey
on a SIM card tray there's a gasket on
there officially the first iPhone that
is water-resistant at least they're
willing to admit it Dave 2d is 90% sure
at ip67 if he's wrong it's simple just
unsubscribe from his channel meet the
new home button tap an option below then
press the home button to give it a try
you can have it as a very faint kind of
haptic feedback or something more
significant I made it I want to try
right away is of course the camera
all right so she's just discovered this
matte black very slippery the reason
that you're going to want to do a lens
system is you end up with something
closer to an interchangeable lens camera
different lenses gives you a different
effect a different opportunity to create
a picture if you've got a wide-angle
lens you can get more in the frame and
that's one X that's 2x and it's optical
so unlike in the past on a single lens
system it's not a digital zoom it's not
simply cropping into the image it's
using a completely different lens I know
I'm a big fan of wide-angle stuff I'm
talking to you in wide-angle right now
and phones the
most part haven't had the widest angle
lenses so that's exciting to me
this black is one of the most slippery
phones I've ever held the matte black
I'm envisioning cracked screens globally
and I'm just giving you the warning
ahead of time I think I'm going to go
ahead and not recommend the matte black
to you regular iPhone 6 7 plus the real
thing that's going on here is the way
that the sound is firing what's
happening on the new model I can hear
sound coming forward so the majority of
the improvement is when you're sitting
like this
ready success watch this same idea so
there you have it every single iPhone 7
and 7 plus unboxed all at once for your
entertainment let me know down in the
comments which one you like best
and don't forget I'm giving all of these
away why because I'm crazy and I'm
friends with the folks at D brand skins
