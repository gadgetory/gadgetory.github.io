with another video and today we are
checking out two products from WD these
are from the my cloud series and
essentially what you're looking at is
something that sort of looks like a
traditional hard drive but in this case
it's actually some cloud storage these
are network-attached you're not going to
have these things connected locally to
your laptop computer desktop or
otherwise instead you can connect these
to your router essentially have your
files available to you no matter where
you are now I have two of them here this
one is kind of the more basic version
two terabytes of storage one dry over
here is the mirror and essentially what
you're getting here is two physical
drives inside and they're set up by
default in a mirror mode or raid one for
those technology enthusiasts out there
that are looking for a reason to say
raid because it feels good
raid oh my hard drives yeah they're
there in raid in the catastrophic event
that one hard drive fails which can
happen you've then got another backup so
you've backed up to here and then it's
backed itself up again to the other
physical disk inside of this raid one or
more simply mirror mirror mirror on the
wall Jack's the fairest of them all so
let's open these babies up and compare
them this will work on PC Mac and
there's also a mobile app so it'll work
on iOS and Android if you can describe a
setup explain how to set something up in
a small piece of paper like that
that's a good thing people like that
plug it in to your router give it a few
seconds my cloud.com slash setup oh of
course
an Ethernet cable some power an
important component in any gadgets life
power don't know what else to say about
so there it is Oh
here you've got your power Ethernet and
then you've also got a USB 3 port it
looks like you can probably then connect
another peripheral here to this drive to
then share via the network features on
this bad boy look we have one more
plastic wrap removal this is what you
guys signed up for Oh a similar power
port Ethernet port and in this case two
USB 3 ports you've got your two physical
drives installed desktop three and a
half inch drives a power brick and an
Ethernet cable what I'm going to do I'm
going to take this mirror here and I'm
going to connect it to the network and
then I'm going to show you guys how the
setup functions and I'll also sort of
use it in conjunction with the drive
that I'm currently using so you can see
that both of them can operate in harmony
okay so okay so now I've got the my
cloud mirror connected to my router then
you just install the my cloud app as an
opportunity to manage any devices that
are connected to the network in my
particular case it just found the new my
cloud mirror you can also see my ex4
which was previously connected in this
same window here one of the features
that is probably most useful for people
is the ability to move stuff from your
phone onto these giant storage devices
so if I select mobile device from this
drop-down menu here I'll go ahead and
jump into camera for example taking a
lot of video keeping a lot of music and
so on
and at some point you may end up having
to delete stuff but in this case you
don't have to you could just move it
over to one of these devices right from
on the mobile device if I select a photo
here then I select this little menu
button up here move and then here you
can see the new WDM iCloud mirror click
on that click on public shared pictures
checkmark and just like that that photo
is now uploaded so you got photos but
what about video you can actually stream
video from right within
like this it's a little heavier for sure
but let's say for example you got some
music on here and you got a Bluetooth
speaker like this one and you do a
double stream stream to here and then
stream that data over here to this
Bluetooth speaker this song is not
stored on my phone it's stored on the
cloud in the cloud on the cloud near the
cloud in it people are using their
mobile devices more as their primary
computing devices so having the support
here to manage network-attached storage
which used to be a fairly complicated
thing to manage is pretty impressive
sharing your files is really easy you
can see your stuff that's shared with me
and here's stuff that's shared with
others and you'll see the share button
comes up I can share a link with people
who can then go ahead and view it from
there or I can share it privately so
that that link only works for them one
of the things I liked is I'm not super
organized I just chucked a bunch of
stuff on it and it scanned it for
certain types of media in the menu here
you have all photos and it just it
grabbed them same goes for music and
videos for that matter so there you have
it the WD my cloud mirror as well as
just a regular my cloud whichever one's
more suitable to you pricing and
availability links will be down in the
description and also going to be giving
away a few of these thanks to WD we're
going to give away two of the standard
my cloud and two of the my cloud mirrors
I'll be doing that on Instagram so head
over to my Instagram for your chance to
win just let me know what you might
store on there
keep it clean guys thanks very much for
watching all the links that you need to
know about down in the description leave
a thumbs up if you enjoyed this and I'll
catch you on the next episode later guys
later jack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
