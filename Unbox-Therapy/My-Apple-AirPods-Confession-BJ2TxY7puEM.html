starting to feel a bit guilty here you
know I'm just I'm being honest I'm being
transparent in front of me I mean you
know this product this product became
such a meme it's like it's crazy how it
picked up steam after the fact after it
came out I mean when it came out there
were jokes about it there was a lot of
taco a little dental floss like I said I
mean it's almost exactly like a dental
floss case what does it think it's doing
what does it think it is why does it
have 160 dollar price tag this is of
course the Apple earpods now when that
came out I made some comments you know I
was like I don't really like this thing
that much I'm not getting a ton of
volume now it's probably better for my
hearing in the long run but I like up I
like a thump to it you know sound
quality's not there there's not a lot of
isolation I can say this sound I'm not
happy with the sound the convenience is
an A+ though this is way better
headphones out there and way better
value out there so I kind of said that
in that video and I continued to say
that for a little while but these things
they somehow they stuck around they were
in my bag from time to time they were at
home they went a few places with me and
so the problem with that is I started
thinking wait I told people I don't
really like these things but here I am
using them I felt like I had to sit down
and just set it straight I've been using
the air pods and kind of enjoying it I
have some reasons for it they are not
perfect they're still not great and I
still would not recommend them at this
price point for most people that are in
the headphone market looking for some
new headphones I still wouldn't but yes
I reach for these things frequently and
in most circumstances I actually prefer
them to other headphone options even
though I don't use an iPhone what is
it's s10 right now but even before that
with the oneplus and as I mentioned
before with the laptop so what is it
what's special about these little man
Apple really did something here in terms
of the package in terms of fit and
finish the scale the convenience factor
nevermind sound isolation bass it's not
here all right that's not what these
things are right now you see wait
their headphones why how can you not
evaluate them on those parameters I do a
lot of listening to spoken word audio
podcasts and that's where these things
really shine is you just need some audio
wirelessly in a very small package
that's convenient charged up fits in
your pocket there's really not a great
alternative that I'm yet aware of now
there are other products that are fully
wireless like this that have little
charge cases I've talked about them some
of them have features better than what's
offered on here but they all give up a
little something for example the
wireless earbuds style that sits further
in the ear improvement in sound quality
improvement in sound isolation but the
problem the in-and-out function you pop
it in it's a bit of a crank you kind of
get it set in there this guy over here
it's a real it's a casual endeavor it's
like it's like nothing what did you say
okay cool see you later now this earbud
is not gonna fit everyone and it looks
wacky and wonky and when you see them
out in public you're like who does this
guy think he is you can't help it for
whatever reason this is the design we're
just having to live with it but that
design gives you some positive aspects
like the form factor like I said earlier
this is tiny I need to give you a
warning here even though this is a
confession video about me actually using
these things however reluctantly there
have been circumstances where these were
in my bag and I wanted to die there was
a time at a coffee shop for example
there was an obnoxious conversation
going on over my shoulder it was all
yeah yeah go on go I was dying and since
they do very little to isolate external
noise there was nothing I could do about
I couldn't crank them up anymore similar
circumstances where I have access to
real noise cancelling headphones like
the Sony's I can't hear anything the
conversation behind me doesn't matter at
all so these are not a replacement for
that but somehow someway in so many
circumstances I just end up reaching for
these and I felt that it was important
to let you know now the real question is
at this point
what's Apple gonna do for version number
two I think the popularity of this
product possibly even surprised them
still not certain exactly why I keep
reaching for these but it's the truth I
do and you deserve the truth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
