therapy comm and today we're gonna take
a look at the 11 inch MacBook Air now
this product's been out for a little
while so there are a number of unboxings
already on youtube but I'm gonna do
something different I'm gonna take out
my macro lens and get up close and
personal with this baby so if you stick
around till the end you're gonna get
closer to this MacBook Air than you
probably ever have before
probably closer than human eyes can get
if you know what I'm saying so stick
around is gonna be worthwhile anyway
getting back to the unboxing we're gonna
peel off this plastic covering and like
all Apple packages you can see this is
simplicity at its best you get right to
the main attraction the 11 inch MacBook
Air and let me tell you it's crazy light
I mean it doesn't feel that much heavier
than the iPad 2 in my hands I mean I
know what it is but he doesn't really
feel like that much more we got our
MagSafe power brick and these are fairly
ubiquitous they all look the same across
the entire macbook product line but they
are different because they supply
different amounts of power and these
sizes are a little bit different too
depending on which macbook we're talking
about but what's nice about these is
they have this removable prong system
here so you can pop that baby off and
use the extension if you need to be
further away from the outlet or you can
leave the extension at home and travel a
little bit lighter so it's nice to have
that option and PC manufacturers haven't
really figured that one out yet I don't
know why anyway we've got our actual
MagSafe portion and that's been
redesigned for a while now I actually
had some older Mac books with the
previous style and it had a tendency to
fray
so hopefully this new one is better here
is everything else we've got our hello
guide it's basically a QuickStart guide
I won't be reading that because I won't
need to but it's there for anybody that
likes to kick it old school next we've
got our USB thumb drive which is
actually going to be used for software
restoration obviously this machine
doesn't have a disk drive so that's the
way to go a little bit more
documentation and ubiquitous Apple
stickers next we've got the unit itself
all alone and about to get naked let's
see if I can get this plastic off of
here there we have it and like I said
guys this is just crazy light I mean
it's amazing what's happening with
laptops I remember the first laptop I
ever owned thing had to be like 10
pounds you know now we're looking at
something that's 2 or just over 2 it's
quite crazy stuff anyway let's see if I
can pop it open here and maybe get it
booted up I'm probably not gonna do the
whole set up sequence but I'll show you
guys the first boot nonetheless you can
get a look at the keyboard here too and
it's a nice size when you consider the
overall size of the laptop so there we
are that's that first boot virgin boot
anyway I'm not gonna do the whole
complete set up but at least you can see
how quickly it boots the first time
around
now it should speed up after the initial
boot because there's all that setup shit
going on but you're not really gonna
shut this thing down too much because
it's got that instant-on kind of thing
where you pop the lid up and you're
right into the OS so it's not gonna be a
real issue waiting the boot I don't
think so you have it time to get close
to this baby here we go so we got a USB
we got our display adapter port on the
left hand side and on the right hand
side we got our microphone our headphone
another USB and of course our mag safe
here's a closer look at the keys of
course you're not gonna get the backlit
keyboard on this unit it's just too thin
for it that's alright
anyway it was a fun unboxing I can't
wait to use this thing and get a review
up for you guys so be sure to subscribe
so that you can catch that review as
soon as it comes up oh there it is up
against my iPad - and I'm telling you it
ain't much bigger anyways
hope to see you guys around the channel
comment if you have any questions later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
