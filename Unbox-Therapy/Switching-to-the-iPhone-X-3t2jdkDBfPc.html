of me and I can't say that I mind one of
the great privileges of this particular
profession is the ability to try out a
completely absurd number of smart phones
so I'm gonna give you a little bit of
history right now on what I have been
gravitating towards the phones I've been
using and what I'm about to do which is
drastic in front of me here I have my
various daily driver smart phones for
the past little while the past few
months at least I've got them in
chronological order of when they
occupied my pocket on the far left I
have the Galaxy s8 which I put my sim in
so I got my hands on the Galaxy s8 when
it came out enjoyed the phone it had its
own sets of positives and negatives I
switched over from that device to one
that I actually didn't show you guys
unfortunately I never got around to
making a video in the active version of
the SI an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive device which
increases the battery life up to four
thousand milliamp hours now you know I'm
a big fan of big batteries otherwise
it's essentially the same granted it has
this alternative body on it kind of like
having a case on your phone it has a
shatterproof display which sounds good
but it actually made it more prone to
scratches so I ended up with a tiny
little not the worst scratch in the
world what it gives you in flexibility
when you drop it you give up a little
bit in hardness one of the things that I
didn't like very much about these phones
is the fingerprint scanner maybe this
was the only place they could put it but
maybe they could change the shape I
don't know but I never really had
ultimate confidence in this location in
the shape of it if you're using a case a
little more finicky to get your finger
in there of course you touch the lens
there's a giant fingerprint on the lens
right now otherwise an awesome phone but
then the pixel comes out the pixel to
pixel choo XL we're talking about the
pixel I've got a bunch of them in front
of me if there's a new OS Android 8 I'm
like I gotta use it I enjoyed this I
mean again not without its issues the
color shift on the display
probably not the nicest OLED display of
the bunch an almost entirely plastic
build which you may or may not like lots
of positives to the forward facing
speakers not a thing that we see on
these other two
vices it feels really nice to type on
the camera is very nice from there I
tried out this thing that was so
different you probably caught the video
I was very complimentary of this device
meet razor phone in an age of bezel asst
smartphones they were like who cares and
what we're gonna do is put the best
speakers ever in a smartphone in this
smartphone it's the best speaker I've
ever heard of smartphone and that's what
they did and because of that I was
compelled to move my sim over and give
it a real shot the multimedia I'm
enjoying it I'm really liking the
fingerprint scanner the location of it
on the power switch the noise that it
makes when you unlock very razor esque
but then you look at the camera and I
believe I've got some level of
preliminary software on here so my
confidence is not a hundred percent yet
considering this phone hasn't shipped in
regular users aren't using it yet but
also majorly important a four thousand
milliamp hour battery the same as the s8
active so that brings me to the end of
this lineup and you've probably already
noticed sitting there is an iPhone 10
the phone that has had a split reaction
some people think it's the greatest
thing Apple's ever made others are
critical of the notch and the software
the fact that it's not a hundred percent
optimized yet but of course we are
talking about Apple's flagship and the
camera so far has been phenomenal but
the iPhone and Apple in general is a
source of major influence in the tech
space I feel a responsibility to give
you guys as much feedback as I can to
dive in more deeply to find out what's
good what's not so good and what might
even be bad so today I am switching to
the iPhone 10 something you probably
noticed here is this is a lineup of
Android devices so this is kind of a big
deal I will be using the iPhone 10
exclusively as my daily driver for at
least one week at which point I will
come back here I will sit here and I
will give you the one week later report
Jack show the people cue the music
bye bye Android hello iPhone 10
the SIM card is in this is my new daily
driver device for at least one week I
have officially switched to the iPhone
10 and I will hold nothing back one week
from now the truth will be here and only
here so subscribe if you haven't yet and
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
