may have seen a recent video on the
channel with the big boy the 17-inch
Razer laptop this is the more stealthy
version in fact it's actually called the
stealth the razor blade stealth it comes
in two sizes 12.5 inches or 13.3 the one
in front of me is a 13.3 inch model I
have some accessories here as well an
external battery for it which will give
you an extra six hours on top of the
battery life speculated around 9 hours
so we're talking about 15 hours of
battery life the protective sleeve
official from Razer and like their other
products you can add the Razer core to
this laptop to get desktop-class
graphics for your laptop 2.7 gigahertz
with turbo up to 3.5 of course the 7500
you intel core chip 16 gigabytes of RAM
the 13.3 inch display is qhd+ and it is
a touchscreen also it's got a 512
gigabyte SSD and it all comes in under 3
pounds 2.93 pounds a box within a box a
very slick box with a carbon fiber look
and the Razer green on the bottom oh
that's a very slender power adapter I
like how it's got some cable management
built in and this is a braided cable so
it should be pretty rugged and there it
is the bright green Razer logo ooh
that's very that is very slender and of
course light a sticker so you can show
your Razer pride and then a cleaning
cloth to keep this aluminum black finish
free from fingerprints and so on very
good looking check that out did you get
used to something like that nice and
slender just a nice matte black laptop
and of course we have the sticker on the
front indicating that this is the newest
model it's packing the 7th generation
Core i7 on this side of the unit you
have a USB port as well as
full-sized HDMI and then over on the
other side you have a USB type-c
connector Thunderbolt three capable this
is the port you would use to hook up to
a razor core if you want those desktop
grade graphics when you're at home
another USB port and a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack so this right here is
kind of the only issue with the black
it's so good-looking but fingerprints
the lower and almost instantaneously so
that's something that concerns you you
could always go ahead and put a D brand
skin on it Jack I know you've got one on
your laptop play hoop why are you
looking at my face I've got one of my
laptop jack has one on his you can
change the look of it and kind of avoid
these fingerprints it's essentially a
battery bank glorified a little bit by
the Razer brand-name and the fact that
if you look at it it just it fits in
real nice that's cool so the power
output is on one side to traditional
USBs and the type-c and then on the
other side of the unit your power button
some LED indicators for charge this one
is fully charged and just like that six
hours of extra battery life ooh okay
inserted for travel carry it just like
that
or put it into a bag now mousing around
over here look at that jack the little
mouse icon and you see that right away
you're gonna see the color stylings of a
Razer laptop you get the RGB
representation so you know what you're
in for
so we've got the backlit keyboard turned
on now look at that magenta color and
then it's shifting through it'll cycle
through of course you can change that
that's customizable however you like it
so as I mentioned this is a qhd+ panel
and it also happens to be touch so I can
reach up and touch it looking at this
beautiful display I don't want to put
finger prints on it but I'm not gonna
complain for having the feature let's go
ahead and test the accuracy of the touch
with this little tiny X ready Jack very
nice now one of the things I was
interested in testing out is this
keyboard because I tried out the 17 inch
pro and and that of course is one of
those low profile mechanical keyboards
which is one of the only mechanical
keyboards in a laptop now on this one
you have a
more traditional low-profile keyboard no
mechanical key switches certainly not
like in the 17 inch Pro I think I like
this keyboard better it feels like your
average low-profile chiclet style
keyboard which I'm okay with let's go
ahead and test out these speakers real
quick there laptop speakers right
generally these tests are always a bit
of a letdown so you have to kind of curb
your expectations a little bit want to
stick headphones into it let's be honest
here what are you doing with your life
let's load up and unbox therapy video oh
for dialogue it's pretty good I drink a
lot of coffee and sometimes you know
when it's hot out and so on I want to
switch it up we'll load this into 4k
that's a nice display that's where this
thing comes I do really like this
display it's looking real slick on here
you're not gonna be disappointed with
that either
look at this Jack guy spills coffee on
loud Lamborghini people hate Lamborghini
hey they need them
alright okay so that's a guy throwing a
coffee in a Lamborghini because well
we're on YouTube so that's what you get
some of that people get so angry can
these people relax pick themselves a
nice little nice little Razer laptop
maybe that's their problem they hate
their laptops they got some big clunky
thing so they're out there throwing
coffee at Lamborghinis maybe that's
what's happening it's not that important
okay now listen you see that Razer
branding and your mind just immediately
goes towards gaming of course this is a
company that's rooted in the gaming
culture maybe more so than any other
company in tech that said this laptop is
more about portability productivity kind
of everything else yes you can add the
core to it and all of a sudden you have
a beast of behemoths but I don't know if
a lot of people that buy this laptop
will do that I think this is a general
laptop super portable ultra portable but
if you're a heavy-duty gamer I think
you're gonna step up to the bigger size
you're gonna go with the pro go get the
big boy like I said watch that video if
you're a heavy-duty gamer for everyone
else this will probably do the job oh
and before I take off shout out to Jonas
who sent in this wonderful drawing here
and on the back could you please show
this picture in one of your videos I
love you well that's a positive message
Jonas and I would just like to say to
the unbox therapy universe out there I
love your right back</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
