this place as well going to screw up
spawns a second if we're not careful
pastor Leroy come on come on come on
thank you thank you thank you thank you
think we're gonna have a few more visits
around this direction as well what's up
guys Lew here and I'm all the way out in
the UK visiting ali-a that's because
we're going to check out his setup today
you're going to get the all-access pass
we're going to find out what he uses not
only to gain for pleasure but how he
also creates content the stuff that you
guys love and then there's going to be a
surprise at the end of this video so
definitely stick around till the end if
you're interested in any of the products
that we talked about more detailed links
and product names will be down in the
description so don't hold us to
accountable for listing off every single
thing we're going to try and try our
best to get through this in a timely
manner so let's go ahead and get started
let's move left to right over here and
let's take a closer look at some of this
stuff I'll hand it over to you this
screen hasn't been hooked up to my
computer but I think I'm gonna try and
work out way of hooking up to my
computer but this is only the moment
being used for gaming on with my xbox
and it's a great-sized screen it's 24
inches a lot of you guys may think I'm
playing on a small screen why play a
small square you can play on a huge one
well actually playing on a smaller
screen means that you'd have to move
your head very much you can stare to the
center of the action on the screen and
see everything that's happening so I
highly recommend this or 22 24 inch
screen especially if you're gaming in
your room like I am a moment TVs that
are based around monitors also tend to
have a lot less input lag when you're
gaming definitely and a reason being
they don't do too much processing to the
image so you actually what you see is
what you get now I choose you agree
about if you look at the sorts of them
timings on the screen being milliseconds
something you definitely looking at this
point two five milliseconds man
some maximum response time is what it we
killed and the lower that is the less
lag you'll have or the input like you'll
have on the controller to the actual
image happening on screen so keeping
that low is always awesome and then you
see I've actually have two headsets we
talked about the Astra one first Luigi
Astro a40 gaming headset fantastic
gaming headset really really recommend
it if it's noisy around years doesn't
feel heavier to laughter long gaming
sessions generally a really good headset
if you guys are looking to invest in one
made for Christmas or something like
that and that's a great product as well
second headset here this is like
something I sort of bought myself for
Christmas and these are the beats by dr.
dre you may recognize them there this is
actually the Silver Edition and I only
used those actually for listening to
music on my iPhone and sort of advising
and staff - really pretty cool headsets
there that's what I go for what you're
probably know in the background here's
some old-school gaming this is the
Gameboy micro and it was launched I
think just before the Nintendo 3ds came
out so it didn't get a lot of sort of
press or anything but it's a really nice
product in all honesty it's really small
we can put it in your pocket and there
are loads of sort of classic Gameboy
Advance games out there which I loved
playing when I was younger and I bought
that and that's something I sort of play
on whenever asked some spare time a bit
bit ball or whatever fantastic little
gaming device there the audio technica
here the at2020 upgraded from the
microphone on the Astro for doing my
commentaries to the audio technica
at2020 and it's got this really cool
blue light to it it looks awesome it
comes with a nice stand here as well so
you can easily put on a desk or whatever
and works really nicely and the sound
quality you get from it is really really
good and it's the USB version of the
at2020 highly recommend if people are
sort of looking to upgrade their audio
levels in any videos it looked awesome
as well as I've said so definitely a
really cool product and going on to
something else looks blue we've got them
a mouse here that's the Razer DeathAdder
and I know you can get a similar product
in a wireless version but you have to
sort of charge that up and stuff that's
a bit of a paint I went for the wide
version
and really smooth mouse really nice to
use it's sort of curved around your hand
shape as well
looks awesome again you've got the blue
sort of LEDs in there as well so that's
fantastic and then I went with the Razer
gaming mouse mat as well because I
thought you know if I'm buying a few
ways of product might as well get the
mouse mat as well I noticed uh you get a
yo-yo over here yeah why I have it no
this is really random because I was sort
of going through my room knowing that
Lou would be coming in and evading my
room and I found this old yo-yo it's a
really good yo seriously it's a really
good yo-yo its shoulder the yo you have
any integral you know part in the
production of your videos I guess it a
stress reliever well yeah yeah I think
sometimes when making videos getting to
me I tend yeah yeah that helps me to
sort of relieve with stress you heard it
I heard it here first guys when you
getting stressed just turn to the yo yo
yo yo you got exams you got schoolwork
don't worry yo yo will take care should
have some like a demonstration about
lacing that and then just behind the
microphone here we've got the keyboard I
use and I know Lou said when you first
saw that he thought it was a Razer
product it looks very much like a Razer
product but in fact it's actually a
Microsoft keyboard and I'm not sure if
it's being discontinued or whatever but
it only cost me like 15-20 pounds which
is about sort of $35 or so and then
finally the last monitor there were a
second monitor at the moment is the
Samsung monitor IP it sort of the
monitor version of this screen that's
the TV version that's the monitor
version again 24 inches and 1080p do all
my editing on that screen and watching
my videos and other things so that is a
fantastic monitor really what you like
that Nets of course hooked up to my PC
which is below the desk and the PC is
basically what doesn't the rendering of
the videos and making it the videos
that's the beast down below and unsafe
at you've got the Xbox at the moment and
we've got the recording device down
there as well you for the Xbox going
into that box that books going to TV and
to your computer and then there's no
input lag so strength no mercy are you
recording your night yeah yeah no I'm
recording right here alright
is it gonna give it a more organic feel
yeah yeah okay well I noticed you had a
board up here with a lot of boxes and
checkmarks and I was intrigued I want to
know what this is about and how you use
that stuff well because my brain is like
a sieve and if I don't so visually see
what I need to be doing it doesn't
happen so if anything needs to be done
which I think I'll forget about I'll
just grab one of these board pens and
just chopped it down on here so you mean
with all this computer power over here
you still like to kick it old school
would be yeah I think the marker in the
whiteboard that's something about
physically writing down yourself we
should put you know you remember it puts
in your brain a little bit more and when
you check it off it feels good yeah yeah
for sure I want to computer things can
get locks you can forget about true
that's true things this is right here
whenever I'm sitting down at my desk I
can look straight up in it and it's
right there in front of me and you know
maybe once a month all sort of updated
with stuff I need to do it's just a
useful way of taking those a good way of
sort of writing down video ideas as well
for anyone up and coming this off got
all these ideas and their head it's good
to sort of stuff down and take it from
there otherwise you know you always
ideas and there's nothing really happens
so one of the key aspects to this new
show called epic setup is that when I
come visit a setup like Ali A's I want
to do a little something to you know
improve it you know you saw my knowledge
on technology and products to bring a
few things along to make it even more
epic than it already is and so in this
case I did just that and there's a
little story line behind the products
that I chose to add to this setup so
let's get straight into it let's make it
a little bit better so first first
product is another there you go yes I
traveled with that all the way from the
other side of the planet another 24 inch
LED monitor from Samsung to match the
two that he's already got so now if he
wants to
you could have triple monitor setup
through the PC or just more productivity
2 PC monitors one Xbox monitor but it's
going to look pretty up there it's going
to match the other ones and hopefully
help them pump out some more videos for
you guys and there's one more item
because that wouldn't be enough you know
this is epic setup after all so here's
item number two see if you can hold both
at the same time well let me give a
closer look at that it's a new Canon
PowerShot ELPH 320 HS a very popular
vlogging camera reason being because it
has a wide-angle lens and that wide
angle lens means you can reach out in
front of you casually vlog kind of like
Vanna White right now modeling products
there you go and I do want to give a
shout out to Future Shop back home
that's Future Shop dot CA I'll put links
to them down in the description for
helping out with these epic setup
upgrades to make every epic setup even
more epic stick around guys and we'll
catch you on the next episode good bye
