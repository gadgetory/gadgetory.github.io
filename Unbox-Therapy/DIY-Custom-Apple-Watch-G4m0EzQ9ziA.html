another video and today we're gonna talk
about customizing your Apple watch as
you see here I have a third party band
installed on my watch this has like a
carbon fiber look with some red
stitching it's just a basic band off
Amazon I'll actually link it down in the
description if you are interested but
essentially I've gone ahead and
installed this instead of the stock
leather band that came with my Apple
watch now you're probably wondering Lou
how did you do that because I've seen
all these different Kickstarter projects
for adapters that people are saying are
necessary to swap out your watch band or
maybe you've seen Apple's other bands
that are available for purchase
independently that started around $200
and go to $600 but I'm here to show you
the simplest most straightforward way to
put any watch band you want onto your
Apple watch
using a simple inexpensive screwdriver
what really so this little screwdriver
features a pentalobe tip which is quite
unusual and probably not in your toolbox
though Apple has been using this style
of screw for a while now on various
devices from iPhones to Mac books and of
course now in the Apple watch this is a
tiny little version of it I will link
this exact model down in the description
if you want to do this kind of surgery
yourself so before we get into this
process I need to mention quickly that
in order to do a swap out like this
independently with your own third party
watch band you'll need to start with the
leather watch straps setup from Apple so
my recommendation is to purchase an
Apple watch with this band pre-installed
therefore the third party options will
be configurable with your Apple watch
now the reason for this is because of
the setup the way that this mechanism
works on the leather band you have this
metallic loop here that goes through as
opposed to some of the other band styles
which travel straight into the metallic
connector itself and when you remove
these you'll notice right away on the
leather band setup that you have these
two screw points
here tiny tiny little pentalobe screws
upon removing these screws be very
careful not to strip them and also not
to lose them because as mentioned they
are tiny but I'll go ahead and show you
what happens when you remove these
screws so after removing these screws
you'll be left with a few components the
two screws themselves this metal bar and
then this other bar that travels right
through the strap itself and connects
like this so this part is the key
component this is what will enable you
to install any watch band any standard
watch band that uses this same style and
believe me there are tons to choose from
so you can set something up that's
completely unique to yourself no
Kickstarter required so reinstalling the
strap works exactly the same way as you
break it down you just insert these
metal rods back into the strap they will
connect in the center you'll sort of be
able to line that up yourself then you
take this connector portion line that
back up should fit on very easily then
take your tiny little pentalobe screws
and attempt to fit them in there and
then you just go ahead and tighten down
these screws making sure not to over
tighten them but that's really it fairly
straightforward to screws and you can
put any watch strap you want onto your
Apple watch so long as you're starting
with the leather band instead of a
different one anyway guys there you have
it a custom Apple watch strap setup hope
you enjoyed this content and you found
it useful if you did make sure to leave
a thumbs up down below subscribe if you
haven't yet and I will catch you on the
next episode now go customize your Apple
watch later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
