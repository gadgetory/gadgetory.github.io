mentioned on both Facebook and Twitter I
decided to come out and check out some
of the boxing week deals obviously
there's better deals on the actual
Boxing Day but I decided to spend that
day with my family and avoid the big
lineups and the different headaches
involved with trying to shop on that day
I heard the traffic was crazy and of
course inventory is limited so you might
go out there have all the big hassle and
not end up with what you want anyway so
I decided to wait till the boxing week
sales I think that's a little bit
smarter you can still get some good
deals without the headache so I decided
to come out here to Best Buy bring you
guys with me I've actually got the flyer
right over here and if you take a look
you'll see there's some semi-decent
deals first there's this Xbox 360 along
with the Kinect for $1.99 that's a
pretty good deal they say it's a hundred
off there's also the beats by dre tour
in ear style headphones in black and
white for 99 bucks but you can see the
little disclaimer below it says minimum
20 per store so might not be many of
those available and then there's a lot
of stuff in the way of gaming and
whatnot a bunch of games a 39 bucks some
decent titles there I'm personally
interested in NHL 12 which I don't have
yet as well as Need for Speed the run I
do enjoy my racing games and then on top
of that there's even some $29 titles and
some super cheap blu-rays as low as
$4.99 that's like a happy meal price and
some decent headsets sutures some Turtle
Beach headsets on sale including the p21
which is actually a real nice headset
and it's almost half price as well oh
and of course the PlayStation display
the 3d display is is a big discount
right now it's on a big discount it's a
$2.99 and that thing just came out it
was $4.99 you know like a month ago so
that's that's a crazy price drop you
guys know I did unbox that particular
display if you want to check that out
I'll put a link somewhere in the
description as well as probably in the
annotation but I'm gonna go in the store
now and take a look around see if
they've got any inventory of the things
that I'm interested in and they will
reconvene back at my house and we'll see
what I picked up give me a quick second
see you guys alright guys so I just got
back from my boxing
week shopping over at Best Buy and I was
surprised to find that most of the items
I was interested in or in stock there
was inventory of them I was kind of half
expecting them to be all sold out and
stuff
but that was not the case let me know
down in the comments section if you guys
got any sweet or sick deals this holiday
season either on Boxing Day or boxing
week make sure to mention the retailer
as well in case anybody else wants to go
check out those deals or if you just
want to make people jealous I'm just
kidding go through that but in terms of
my shopping I got a couple things I was
looking for a couple of games
Need for Speed to run this is the
limited edition which includes some
special supercars 39 bucks so a decent
feel they're obviously a little bit of
money off the regular price i do like
racing games quite a bit so that's gonna
be fun I also got le noir this is
obviously an older game as well I never
picked it up in the first place I don't
know why but I've heard some good things
about it and it was 29 bucks so I said
this is the time to do it if I don't
like it it's only 29 bucks and the cool
thing here is this one actually has some
pre-order bonuses I've said didn't
pre-order this game but Best Buy had
some left overs including the pre-order
bonus so I scored a little bit of extra
there and then lastly I picked up the
beats by dre tour in ear model
headphones in white
these were half price so 99 bucks
instead of $1.99 also available in black
so pretty excited to get a better look
at those as well so anyway guys stay
tuned to the channel I'll give you guys
a closer look at these different items
here as well as all the other stuff that
I've mentioned that's coming up and as I
said before definitely you leave a
comment down below if you get any sick
deals there's a boxing week or even on
Boxing Day itself anyway guys if you
