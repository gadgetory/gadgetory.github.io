therapy and today we're taking a look at
Apple's a newest iPod touch this is the
fifth generation I'm actually giving one
of these away as well so make sure to
hit that subscribe button up above and
check out the official giveaway video on
my channel now this is a beautiful
little device we're gonna be looking at
that second but first we got to go
through all the other items inside of
the box this is an unboxing video after
all we've got a little bit of paperwork
first to get us started that's the most
boring aspect if you guys are interested
in checking out a number of different
colors and pricing and availability of
the new iPod touch there's a link in the
description so you can do that we've
also got the new charging cable as well
this is the lightning cable similar to
the one that you're gonna get with the
iPhone 5 we have a wrist strap included
which is removable so you can decide for
yourself if you want to keep that
installed or not next we have Apple's
new earphones these are called the ear
pods and I've done a separate review
video on these that's available on my
channel as well so head over there if
you want to know more info on Apple's
newest earphones so here's a closer look
at the device and the first thing that
strikes me and will probably strike you
if you buy one of these is just how thin
this device is it has a really nice
finish on the back I really like this
color as well this metallic blue kind of
finish it should be more durable than
the previous generation 2 with that
chrome that got scratched easily you've
got a much improved camera on the back 5
megapixels it's gonna shoot HD video on
the bottom is where you'll find your
ports and your headphone jack as well as
a speaker you've got volume up and down
on the left hand side followed by your
power switch which is up on the top of
the device now this device is super thin
like I said before here it is up against
an SD card and it's not even a quarter
of the thickness of the height of an SD
card it's crazy it's a super thin that's
all you need to know about that now as I
said before the wrist strap is
detachable and this little button here
sort of allows you to attach it and
detach it and you can push the button
down if you know you're not using the
wrist strap at all it's pretty easy to
install probably leave mine off but if
you want to rock it that way that's
completely cool it's really easy to put
on so I'll go ahead and turn it on in a
second here but first let's talk about
the remaining features you have a
forward facing 720p camera
you've got your usual home button that
pretty much everyone is used to nowadays
so I'll go ahead and boot it up here and
of course there's the usual setup
process I'm not gonna make you sit
through that I do want to take a quick
look at the beautiful Retina display
this does share the same display as the
brand new iPhone 5 so most of you
probably know that's a beautiful display
to look at I don't have to tell you and
this one is just as impressive and just
as bright too
these displays get super super bright
this would be a really good device for
watching multimedia as I'm sure you
already know anyway guys that's being a
quick unboxing if you guys enjoyed this
content please remember to leave a like
and a favorite down below as it does
help out a bunch and as I said before
remember to subscribe remember to check
out my channel because I'm giving away
one of these on Sunday you do not want
to miss out alright guys thanks as
always for watching and I'll catch you
on the next video thumbs up alright
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
