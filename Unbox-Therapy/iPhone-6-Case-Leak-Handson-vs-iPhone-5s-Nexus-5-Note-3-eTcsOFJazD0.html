exciting video this one's unusual I was
lucky enough to get my hands on what
looks like the case or a case for the
next generation iPhone or the iPhone 6
now if you've been following the rumor
sites different components have been
leaking out there is speculation of two
different sizes for the next iPhone both
which are bigger than the current
generation the case I have right here is
for what will likely be the 4.7 inch
iPhone 6 and you can see it here up
against some other popular devices so
the case is on the far left here in the
second location we have the iPhone 5s
followed by the Nexus 5 and then the
note 3 which is the largest device on
the far end one thing you're going to
notice right away is that the iPhone 6
case is almost the exact same size as
the Nexus 5 which obviously would make a
lot of sense given the rumors for size
speculation etc now one thing I want to
say before we examine this case further
I want to give a shout-out to sunny
Dixon for helping get me in touch with
this case or getting it over to me so
let's go ahead and take a close look at
the case and then do the comparisons to
the different devices that I've got in
front of you so I'll push these to the
side for a moment so here is what might
be the iPhone 6 or at least what it
might look like the first thing that I
noticed that's interesting is that on
the side here is the location of what
looks like the power button and that is
a departure for Apple because obviously
like on the iPhone 5s or etc actually
every single iPhone the power switch has
been on the top of the device but when
you move to a larger device like this
assuming that this is legitimate
all of a sudden reaching the top switch
requires a shift in your hand and I can
see why Apple has chosen to put it on
the side I'm a big fan of having the
power switch in that location when
you're dealing with larger devices once
again guys this is speculation at this
point I am told that these cases are in
production and based on everything I've
seen I am led to believe that this is
what the next iPhone will look like as
well something interesting
is just how thin this is once again it's
a case so it should fit on the outside
of the actual device and when compared
with the current generation iPhone
you'll notice the case is actually a
little bit thinner than the entire
iPhone 5s that means the device itself
is going to be probably significantly
thinner than the current iPhone here you
have your cold switch over on the side
as well as what looks like will be the
volume buttons the volume buttons have
changed in shape a little bit
assuming that again that this is a
legitimate and that's kind of a little
bit tough to make out based on this case
but they're larger similar to the volume
buttons on the iPad Mini for example and
a lot of the leaks that are currently
available point to a design shift in the
direction of the current generation iPad
Mini and iPad air on the back we have a
cutout for the camera obviously we can
compare to the current generation iPhone
you'll see that these components would
obviously fit in this location as well
so maybe not too much changing there on
the bottom is the remainder of the
information that we can draw from this
case here there are three separate
cutouts here and one would assume that
we've got to cut out for the microphone
the speaker and of course the lightning
connector to charge and sync the device
so not too much changing down there the
whole purpose of this video is just to
show you guys what the form factor of
the iPhone 6 will look like or might
look like etc there is speculation that
there will be two sizes as I'm sure
you've probably heard this one is 4.7
there supposed to be a 5.5 inch version
as well but I've heard that there may be
delays on that particular version just
based on the leaks that are currently
available so let's go ahead now and do a
comparison to the other devices here on
the table I'll push the case to the side
for a moment first up is the iPhone 5s
which looks you know significantly
smaller than
this speculative iphone6 next up is the
Nexus 5 one of my favorite Android
devices as many of you know now this is
where things get interesting they look
almost identical in size very close when
you consider that this would have to fit
inside the case yes very very close so
if you've held a Nexus 5 you probably
have a pretty good idea of what an
iPhone 6 will feel like or might feel
like one thing I will say is that the
thickness of this case once again points
in the direction of a thinner iPhone
thinner than this Nexus for example
there's another look at that right there
it might be it's a little bit hard to
make out here because the Nexus is so
dark comparative to this vibrant pink
but let me tell you that the case for
this upcoming iPhone at least if this is
legitimate is showing a thinner profile
than the Nexus 5 so it may be even a
little bit comfier to hold than that
Nexus even though they share a very
similar form factor and on the far end
of the scale we have the note 3 which is
obviously significantly larger you can
see when I hold it here it's a very
large device as most of you know and
maybe this this form factor here for the
next-gen iPhone is it's perfect I don't
know I am a big fan of the Nexus 5 form
factor and this is very similar with a
slightly slimmer profile from what I can
tell based on this case right here and
this feels really really comfortable and
my thumb lines up perfectly with this
power switch my finger lines up
perfectly with the volume controls this
is a really really comfortable form
factor it could very well be my favorite
form factor for that matter and possibly
the perfect size for a phone of course
that's subjective some people like
bigger screens for various reasons but
for one-handed operation for the average
sized hand this is you know right on
that boundary right where you get the
benefits of a larger screen and a form
factor that's very manageable to hold
and operate with one
so anyway guys that wraps up this little
inspection this quick video on this case
that was sent over to me once again big
shout out to sunny Dixon for helping to
hook this up I think based on everything
that I've seen so far regarding leaks I
think this is what the iPhone 6 will
look like of course I can't guarantee
that at this particular point and if it
is then I'm excited finally a bigger
iPhone and I think they've made the
right move by moving the power switch to
this location on a larger device so
that's pretty much all the information
that I can draw away from this minor
little preview if more components are
available to me prior to the devices
launch I will be sure to show them to
you guys right here so make sure to
subscribe if you haven't yet and other
than that thanks as always for watching
I will catch you on the next episode
make sure to leave a thumbs up down
below alright later guys</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
