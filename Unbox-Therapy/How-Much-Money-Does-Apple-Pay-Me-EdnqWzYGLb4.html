published a video my last video who's
about the new Galaxy s8 possibly the
world's greatest smartphone right now I
brought to light some of my initial
reactions and feedback and thoughts I
think I even introduced the video saying
it was a hot take which implies it was
like a quick immediate feedback of
course I had the device for 24 hours
which I also stated and funnily enough
there is a series of comments maybe I
don't know hundreds of comments and some
comments with hundreds of thumbs up in
which people are suggesting the reason I
identified some of the things I was less
than enthusiastic about on the galaxy s
8 is because I've been getting
substantial payments from Apple in order
to feel that way now obviously these
must be new people to the channel
because they probably forget that my
most viewed video ever was bending an
iPhone in half
the same comments existed in which
people were saying I was paid from
Samsung in order to do that video which
reached by the way 70 million people and
also had an impact on the overall stock
evaluation and market cap of Apple at
that time so yeah probably not the
biggest fans of mine but the truth is I
guess I haven't really talked about it
and a lot of people wonder they're like
loo what phone are you actually using
what's in your pocket I thought it was
fairly well known but this phone in
front of me right here this Google pixel
Excel has been my daily driver if you
want to use that terminology since the
thing came out and that doesn't mean I'm
not using on the phones here and there
but to be honest I haven't used that
iPhone a lot and I haven't used an
iPhone as my daily driver all the way
back to like I guess the iPhone 6 but
even then I was swapping back and forth
between whatever Nexus was out at the
time and I had every single Nexus device
before that in fact if I was a fan of
anything it would be stock Android and
throughout there I did use on a regular
basis many Samsung devices in fact I had
the earliest galaxy stuff like super
TouchWiz galaxy s Samsung Galaxy S and
then the galaxy s7 was in my pocket for
I don't know probably a year as well so
listen people I know you want to find a
conspiracy somewhere I mean really this
is not surprising of course you make
these kind of inflammatory statements
and people are going to pay attention
and they're gonna rise to the top of
comments sections and convince other
people and in many cases people they
just read the headline and and watch the
first bit of the video you watch the
whole video through towards the end I
say it's the best Android device on the
market but of course we all know how
this thing works on the Internet quick v
jerk reaction and so on but I just
wanted to put this out there in order to
clear this up Apple hasn't paid me a
dime and the phone that's been in my
pocket has been the pixel Excel you can
see the thing is dinged up on all the
different corners it's scratched that's
that's real world you see and that can't
be said for a lot of devices that come
through here another reason that iPhone
videos keep showing up on the channel on
a regular basis is because there's a lot
of interest in them it's a very popular
device now if you go back and watch my
recent video about the iPhone
I read that entire video was sarcastic
I'm going on and on about this fantastic
amazing innovation of coming up with the
red color and then at the end I opened
the box and I say oh it's a red phone
like it was a joke two or three videos
later
it's like he's taking cash from Apple
when two or three videos ago I was
making fun of Apple so that would be an
incredible business relationship if
that's the way it worked and I'm not
saying that the iPhone 7 is a bad phone
seven-plus those are great phones I'm
not saying that the Galaxy s8 is a bad
phone I think in fact there's a
convergence right now of quality there's
so many quality options and those that
are winning are us the customers alright
quick recap just for ultimate clarity
here Apple hasn't paid me a dime to say
anything the pixel XL has been in my
pocket since it came out and I haven't
used an iPhone as my daily driver in
years and I'm pretty sure Apple wouldn't
want me saying that in this video here
if I were cashing checks from them and
then also the galaxy si is amazing as I
do say in that video but on my way to
getting there I tell you some of the
things that might bug you that's about
it
all right thanks very much for watching
and this should be a fun comment section
here as well I'll see you down there
