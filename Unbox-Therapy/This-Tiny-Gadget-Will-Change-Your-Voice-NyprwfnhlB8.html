I've got the I stranger voice changer
some of you have been watching on by
therapy for a little while and you may
have caught a previous video about the
world's smallest phone now that thing
had a built in rudimentary voice changer
it had an optimus prime style voice
Donald Duck was on there Donald Duck
Daffy Duck a lot of ducks in the cartoon
world this one is another level honestly
I don't really know what to expect but
chances are we're about to have some fun
with the I stranger voice changer let's
jump inside as we usually do here very
nice box so far oh it is a unique voice
changing system designed to be
compatible with most existing cell
phones insert the voice changer in the
headphone jack and that's about that
micro USB cable to charge it up oh it's
kinda it's slender look at it there's a
mode switch on the back there's a couple
of different LEDs here low high voice
and then a charge indicator I don't know
what it's made out of but it feels a lot
more solid than I expected so you plug
it in and then you immediately see this
low indicator now you can change that
you hit the mode button and it switches
to high now at this point the voice
changer is the phone's headset so you're
actually talking like this earpiece is
there and the microphone is down here so
this is like your phone now due to the
variance in octave of the human voice
some people may not be able to use low
and high so anyway I don't know I'm
gonna call Ryan on low yo how do I sound
right now
would you know that it's me if you
didn't see the caller ID okay please
please tell the people that one second
okay yeah two large pizzas please a
little bit great cosmically as well I
just gotta make it a little bit
healthier
you heard my bizarro voice now I'm gonna
get a call back so that I can react
hello oh excuse me it's going it's going
well how about you wow you sound me man
whoa there's absolutely no way that I
would know that that was you oh you got
the voice from like the guy from ransom
ah you're creeping me out do Oh
oh my goodness this one is much more
defined you can't there's no way that
you're going to be able to recognize
whose voice that is on the other line
I stranger a little a little phone for
your phone where you could be a whole
new you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
