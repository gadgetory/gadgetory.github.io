therapy just picked up the new iPod
touch this is still the 4G it's still
rocking an a4 processor but it's now
available in white and it is also going
to ship with iOS 5 so you're not going
to have to update it when you get it
home not a huge deal but nice
nonetheless so I'm going to give you
guys a breakdown of the new OS iOS 5
that is and I'm not going to do it in
this video though I'm going to save it
for another one because obviously it's
too much to cover so the very next video
I do I'll give you the breakdown of iOS
5 oh the changes and features that have
been added and let you guys know exactly
why you should be interested in it but
let's talk about this unboxing because
that is where we're at right now the
very first thing in the box was the iPod
touch this is an 8 gigabyte the price
dropped which is nice as well down to
$1.99 we got the boring paperwork that
we got a we got to get through including
the ubiquitous Apple stickers please
don't throw those on your bumper of your
car alright fine if you absolutely have
to go ahead but and then we got the sync
cable but I shouldn't even call it the
sync cable because you can now sync
wirelessly in iOS 5 so it's a charge
cable but hey you could still sync with
it if you want to kick it old-school the
headphones are basic there is no remote
no microphone bog-standard I did notice
that the connector is a little more
robust than on previous generation
touches I did notice that on the new
nano that I unboxed as well now we got
to release this iPod Touch from its
shackles and we got to put it into
service so you got to pull down that tab
and that will loosen it up real good and
then from there you got to remove this
fake iPod Touch sticker on the front
side here anybody in need of a fake
stick you can stick that on your on your
other device and pretend it's an iPod
Touch so we got the camera in the back
as well as the volume buttons of course
the 30-pin connector along bottom our
headphone jack and a little baby speaker
and on the front we have our forward
facing camera as well as our home button
and then the power button along top so
let's boot this up see if we can get a
quick little preview a little glimpse of
this iOS 5 goodness so there it is no
more are we greed
goodbye that terrible connectedness to
itunes logo no now we're good to go
straight out of the gates it's kind of
like setting up a laptop actually you
pick your region along with whether or
not you want to opt in to location
services I'm going to say no for now
maybe I'll activate that at a later date
we'll have to wait and see and then you
connect it to Wi-Fi and that's how this
whole thing happens I'm not gonna let
you guys see my password though I know
some of you were probably waiting to
come on over here and hack my network
get some free Wi-Fi right I'm just
kidding I know you guys are you guys are
good kids right so I'm gonna skip over
entering my Apple ID for the sake of
this video and here's where you say yes
to the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions sign your life
away to Apple forever alright never mind
I'm kiddin about don't be scared and a
couple of checkmarks and we're in and
you can see already it's iOS 5 because
it's brand new icons and whatnot but
let's go into the general settings here
and make sure that the version is
correct and there it is version 5.0 yes
we have iOS 5 goodness preloaded now as
you guys know this thing is super slim a
real pretty device you probably already
knew that because of the black model and
hey if you were thinking about getting
one and you wanted it in white now well
I guess now is the time to bite it feels
real good in the hand anyway guys if you
don't mind hopefully you could like and
favorite this video as it does help me
out a bunch and stay tuned for that iOS
5 video I'm going to go over the new
features and functions give you guys a
break down tell you why you should
upgrade tell you how to utilize the new
things and remember to check out my new
