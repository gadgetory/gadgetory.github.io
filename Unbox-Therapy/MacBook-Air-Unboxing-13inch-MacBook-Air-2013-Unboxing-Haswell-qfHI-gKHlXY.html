therapy and today we're taking a look at
the brand new MacBook Air for 2013 this
here is the 13-inch model but it is also
available in an 11 inch form factor if
you're looking for something even
smaller but they are both incredibly
portable and now they've got some
performance improvements courtesy of
Intel Haswell this is the base model
13-inch with a one point three gigahertz
dual-core Intel Core i5 processor but it
can turbo boost up to 2.6 gigahertz and
if you spec this thing out even further
up to say 1.7 gigahertz which is the top
chip that you can put into it that will
turbo boost up to three point three
gigahertz so some insane figures for
such a portable laptop a lot of people
were hoping for more performance but the
bigger story here is the battery life
with Intel Haswell you can now expect to
get according to Apple of course up to
12 hours of battery life on this
particular model I'm gonna put that to
the test I'm actually going to do a
time-lapse video using this for all of
my daily activities one day in the
coming week probably on Monday if you
guys want to see it actually leave a
thumbs up down below if you want to see
my battery test to see what this thing
is really capable of you'll probably be
a short video like a time-lapse I'll try
and crunch twelve hours down into like a
minute 20 or something I don't know I
haven't done the time-lapse in a while
but anyways let me know down below that
you want to see that by leaving a thumbs
up let's go ahead and talk about the
unboxing it's much like the unboxing of
any MacBook or macbook pro or MacBook
Air of past you've got a little bit of
paperwork from Apple including the
ever-important Apple stickers and then
you have your power adapter with the
power adapters extension cable it
features MagSafe too so you have a
slightly smaller connector than you'd
expect to have like on the older MacBook
Pros with the unibody configuration and
then you have your power brick on the
other end of 45 watt with
interchangeable tips so depending on
what part of the world you're in you
will see the corresponding tips in this
particular case we have the North
American adapter of course since I am in
North America so as I mentioned earlier
the big story with Haswell is the fact
that you can get all-day computing on a
laptop that is sub 3 pounds that's
really an amazing feat it's something
I've wanted my whole life so if you
happen to be a student or somebody who
travels a lot this is going to be a
really really big deal that means you
can leave your power adapter at home and
really start to recognize the absolute
portability of a three pound or sub
three pound laptop of course even more
if you happen to go for the 11 inch
version this thing is razor thin it
really boggles my mind every time if you
don't get to play with a MacBook Air on
a regular basis you will definitely be
impressed with just how thin this thing
is on the left hand side is where you
will find your power port as well as a
USB 3 port a headphone jack and then
dual microphones and as we continue to
pan down you can really start to
appreciate just how razor thin and razor
sharp this is on the other side of the
laptop is where you'll see your SD card
slot as well as another USB 3 and then a
thunderbolt port one thing to note is if
you go for the 11.6 inch version you
will not have that SD card slot so
you'll be giving that up for the
slightly smaller form factor opening up
the MacBook Air the rest of the hardware
is visible now you have the backlit
keyboard as well as the nice oversized
trackpad I still think Apple makes the
best track pads in the business you've
also got the 720p FaceTime HD camera
which is going to come on both the
13-inch as well as the 11 inch model and
in terms of screen you're getting
actually decent resolution 1440 by 900
native a lot of people were hoping to
see a retina model MacBook Air that
didn't happen but hey 1440 by 900 is
still pretty good and it's a reasonable
amount of work space for a 13.3 inch
laptop if you go for the 11 inch you're
going to get slightly less workspace at
1366 by 768 native so anyways let's go
ahead and boot this thing up it wouldn't
be an unboxing video without showing you
the Virgen boot so here we go I'll go
ahead and press the power button and
shortly after booting it up I'm going to
give you a quick comparison of the
latest generation MacBook Air at least a
physical comparison up against my 2011
model MacBook Pro which believe it or
not isn't going to exist too much longer
because we're still going forward with
that super macbook pro project in fact
the new MacBook
I was set to arrive very shortly I
believe on the 21st so stay tuned for
that project there but anyway guys that
wraps up this unboxing I hope you
enjoyed it if you do if you did sorry
remember to leave a thumbs up down below
I'll leave a link in the description if
you're interested in pricing and
availability on this model or any other
macbook air for 2013 thanks as always
for watching and I'll catch you guys on
the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
