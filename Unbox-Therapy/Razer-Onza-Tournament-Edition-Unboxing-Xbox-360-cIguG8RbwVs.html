therapy and today we're taking a look at
the razor ons a tournament edition
controller for the Xbox 360
now this controller retails for around
fifty bucks and it is a little bit
different than the Xbox 360 controller
that you've probably already got
assuming you have a stock one now as I
get a closer look at the box here you
should be able to see that there are
some different features and functions
from the stock controller
you've got adjustable analog sticks as
well as some backlit what they're
calling hyper response buttons that
would be your a B buttons etc I'll give
you guys a closer look in a quick second
as soon as I get the ONS out of the box
now you guys know razer is known for
their gaming peripherals and let me tell
you at first feel at first sight this
thing is pretty nice it's got a
rubberized finish here you can get a
better look at those adjustable thumb
sticks they move up and down as you
twist them now it's not the easiest
thing in the world to twist but that's
probably done so on purpose so that you
don't adjust them by accident while
playing so they definitely feel pretty
high-quality and here's a closer look at
the a/b buttons etc and as you'll notice
they're extremely low-profile and as I
mentioned earlier they're also backlit
that low profile aspect means they
they're really easy to click really
sensitive now you've got some extra
buttons along top including some really
nice concave left trigger right trigger
buttons that I do like there's a little
bit more of a curve than what you're
already getting on your stock controller
along bottom of course you've got your
input for your Xbox Live Chat and then
on the back of the controller you have
two buttons there's a remap right button
and a remap left button obviously for
remapping the controller and in the
center here it looks like there are
likely some LEDs to identify what kind
of configuration you're using so this
obviously uses a USB cable to connect it
is a cabled controller it is not
Wireless and the cable is a braided
style cable so it's pretty tough and
it's actually a little bit thicker than
some of the braided cables I've seen
before for example on gaming mice etc
it's also very very long it's about 15
feet long so it doesn't matter how far
away you are sitting from your console
you should have enough slack to sit in
that location
one more thing that's slightly different
is the d-pad there are four independent
buttons on the d-pad and it seems like
it's elevated a little bit higher anyway
guys the controller feels real
comfortable in my hands from a dimension
standpoint it's very similar to the
stock Xbox 360 controller so it's not
like I have to relearn anything and
having those adjustable thumb sticks
should prove pretty cool you can get a
customized feel find out what works for
you anyway guys if you enjoyed this
unboxing then hopefully you can like and
favorite this video as it does help me
