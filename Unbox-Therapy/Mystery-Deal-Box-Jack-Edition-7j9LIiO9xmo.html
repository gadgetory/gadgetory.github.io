Jack's mystery box the mystery deal boss
you see even put himself on the Box this
time I know it's incredibly creepy now
this episode has been brought to you by
video blocks who are video blocks they
are the largest repository for
royalty-free use however you want video
clips on the planet an example of Jack
using a site he was downloading these
old-school astronaut video clips he put
together this really like dramatic short
film I don't know I'm just saying if you
like to get creative you want to get you
want to start doing some video editing
give this a shot it's a great way to get
started they've got a 7 day free trial
so you can try it for yourself all the
details will be down in the description
for those of you that are new to this
concept this mystery box thing that Jack
keeps telling me is such a good idea
this box is full of gadgets or cool
things objects that are having deals
right now deals just for you and limited
time very limited I'll be explaining it
all as I go through it but essentially
what you've got here is a fancy box full
of fancy deals so let's get it started
number one whoa a backpack this is from
a company called
ghost Tech and you're gonna notice right
away it's not your average everyday
backpack this guy has a battery built
into it for charging up all your gadgets
can charge the whole thing up right from
the outside of the bag you put the power
adapter in there plug your bag in and
keep it charged on the inside that's
where the battery lives in this little
section right here it clips out this is
a seven thousand milliamp hour battery
there's a little dock in there for it
and then on top of that via the dock
you've got these various USB ports
accessible to you so there's one on the
outside here for that kind of like quick
charge and then on the inside of the bag
you have a couple of female USB ports
here so you can keep some items charged
while they're in the bag and that will
all be coming off of this 7,000 milliamp
hour battery which you could check the
status with this LED indicator on the
front this section comes down and you
have a sleeve for a laptop jack what's
the deal not just this bag but
apparently ghost Tech's entire website
20% off for the next 48 hours from the
point at which this video is live link
for this
and all the other deals will be in the
description all right what do we got
next
look at this thing over here stick it
hub com
the three-in-one magnetic phone holder
concept here get this little base
station right here and you can mount
that to anything you want it could be
your car - and then this little ball
acts as a pivot point for this unit
right here which is a strong magnet and
it you see what I mean now on your
device you put this little metal plate
here and then this thing comes on like
this when you're ready to dock it down
or as the name implies stick it this
thing becomes standalone when it's not
near your pivot base so essentially just
like this one on here can stick to here
that could be your locker and then this
can stick to the outside of that so
that's the three-in-one part you know I
love magnets I can never get enough what
can I say what's the deal
give them the deal jack okay this is 20%
off again for 72 hours so you got three
days on this one from the point that
