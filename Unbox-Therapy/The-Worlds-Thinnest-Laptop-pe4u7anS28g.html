another video and as you can tell today
something special is happening I am not
in my normal studio environment that's
because I'm in Paris today I'm checking
out the world's thinnest laptop what
this is from HP it's called the spectre
and it is thinner than a pen thinner
than this pen ten point four millimeters
thin let's jump inside the box and see
what it's all about okay as you guys can
tell that is that is crazy thing you're
probably wondering like okay it's thin
am I giving something up what am i
giving up in exchange for ultra
portability actually in this case not a
ton if you look around the device you'll
notice you've got three USB sees on the
back this one is going to be used to
power up the device as well unlike some
other ultra-thin laptops on the market
you're not giving up connectivity there
with multiple ports and then you've also
got a headphone jack in this location on
the back now if you've got a bunch of
older USB equipment and you need to have
the traditional connector you have an
adapter included as well that simple
stuff go ahead and test that out and
then BOOM here's the power brick fairly
portable again what about the specs your
going to be able to configure this guy
with either a Core i5 or Core i7
processors not underpowered one of my
favorite things is this hinge design
here as you can tell super smooth but
very unusual because it's using some
piston technology in underneath the hood
there completely new HP logo ultra
modern to go with the kind of ultra
modern vibe you've got this copper along
the bottom the top of this laptop is
aluminum but then the bottom side is
actually carbon fiber guys know I'm a
huge fan of carbon fiber whatever it can
be used you'll notice the way these feet
sit it actually keeps the bottom of the
laptop up off of the surface it's on a
little bit that's going to help with
cooling you can also see this unique
layout for the grills where the fan is
this guy comes in at 2.5 5 pounds you
are hardly going to
that now the audio on this device is by
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen with HP audio boost to
see the speaker grilles there I like
what they've done just to add a little
bit of interest a little bit of
uniqueness the keyboard is very
low-profile chiclet style keyboard it
also has a backlight on it so if you're
working in bed late at night and so on
you want to keep the lights dim maybe
you're trying to set the mood there's
also a dedicated button for airplane
mode and then of course the display it
is IPS technology what you'll notice is
as I sort of twist the display a little
bit you're getting no color shift in the
image video can you play video yes of
course
look at this okay here you go Jack 1080p
full HD display and 13.3 inches diagonal
now the display is actually covered in
gorilla glass rather than the standard
stuff that's going to give you some
extra durability characteristics that
I'm sure you're aware you can also spec
it out with an SSD up to 512 gigabytes
this model I'm looking at here has 8
gigabytes of RAM as well you've
essentially got your traditional laptop
specs just jammed into a much thinner
profile how thin this pen is actually
thicker than the entire device it's the
same thickness the entire way now when
it comes to battery life you're going to
be looking at roughly all day or HP's
claiming 8 plus hours so there you have
it guys the new HP Spectre the world's
thinnest laptop you are now aware of it
this thing is launching very soon it's
really a unique design I'm a fan of it
big thanks to HP for inviting me out
here to Paris to check out their latest
and greatest thank you very much for
watching guys and I'll catch you on the
next episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
