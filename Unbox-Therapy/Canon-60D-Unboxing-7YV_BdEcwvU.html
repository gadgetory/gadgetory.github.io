therapy comm and today we're looking at
the canon eos 60d digital SLR some of
you may know that to this point i've
been shooting on the Canon t2i and I've
been wanting to upgrade for a while
finally getting around to it so here is
the warranty for the 60d and something I
always like to mention is that Canon
gives you a canada-us warranty so
continent-wide whereas Nikon will only
give you a Canada or US warranty not
both so we had our installation discs as
well as our instruction manuals which I
probably won't ever have to look at not
saying I'm a pro or anything I'm just
saying these are pretty straightforward
to use at this point anyway we've got a
video cable standard definition video
cable and this pisses me off I mean you
spend a thousand bucks on a body I think
they can give you an HDMI cable or HD AV
cable it's about time come on canon
you know nikon is the same both of them
need to smarten up well put the body to
the side for now and get to that in a
second
first we'll finish with the accessories
included in the box here's the battery
and of course it's different from the
t2i battery it's a bigger one but this
means I can't use my tty batteries in
this model so those will have to go up
for sale along with the t2 I here's the
EOS 60d neck strap that will probably
never be installed in my case I use the
camera in a studio environment more
often than not next we have our USB
cable these come with pretty much
everything these days it's a mini USB to
USB no big stink there you go
and the last thing to look at is the
battery charger this one is also a
little different than the one I received
with my t2 I instead of having a power
cord coming out of it it's got the
flip-out style prongs I guess it's a
little better for travel but
little less versatile as far as where
you place it so here's the body and it's
heavier than the t2i or the t3i for that
matter but that's because it's a little
bit more rugged and it's larger which I
like because the T - I felt puny in my
hands so it's got a slightly better grip
on it slightly different rubber they're
using and of course the articulating LCD
which is fantastic for getting shots in
strange angles we've also got this
second adjustment wheel so we can modify
shutter speed and f-stop on the fly real
quick so we'll go ahead and insert this
battery and see if it's got any charge
on it although I doubt it so I was right
it shipped with no power I'll have to go
ahead and charge that before I go
through the menus but as you can see
there are a lot more physical buttons on
this model than the t2i or t3i you've
got this locking selector as well and
dedicated on/off switch so you can leave
it in the same mode all the time there's
that new grip I was talking about here's
our connectors mic HDMI AV out and a
plug for a remote is that second wheel I
mentioned earlier this is a big deal for
me when you're shooting stills in manual
mode you need two adjustment dials in
order to work quickly and mighty - I
didn't have and I really missed it
lastly we've got the articulating screen
which will be nice to use as always make
sure to visit the channel and hopefully
you'll subscribe</div></body></html>
