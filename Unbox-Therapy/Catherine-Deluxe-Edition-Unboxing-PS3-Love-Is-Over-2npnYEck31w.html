therapy and we're finally taking a look
at this special edition of the game
Katherine for your PlayStation 3 this
has got to be the strangest special
edition game unboxing that I've ever
done and you're about to find out why I
really don't know very much about this
game I've heard a lot of mixed things if
you guys have any strong opinions about
it then throw them down in the comment
section but right away you can see this
is different than any other game it's a
pizza box that it ships in I'm sure a
lot of you know why but I don't and
inside it almost looks like a care
package from your grandmother but as you
look more closely you realize it's a
perverted version of that the very first
thing you see is some polka dot
underwear and uh I don't know if you
guys see some new underwear but if you
do hey why not pick it up with your game
so they're large in case anybody needs
to know large with pink polka dots and
as you get further in it doesn't get any
more normal the next thing is a
pillowcase and it's got a female I'm not
sure if this is Catherine or not don't
hate on me guys I really picked this up
on a whim I don't know much about it but
imagine putting that on your pillow you
don't people come over say dude what's
your girlfriend doing on your pillow and
so the it does come with a game yes
there is a game hidden in there and a
little art booklet as well as an audio
disc and we'll find out what that's all
about and some suggestive animation in
this art book some very suggestive
animation including erotic pizza-eating
if you guys are into that so yeah I mean
I have never seen a video game like this
in my life it's not my regular genre and
as I said before this was picked up on a
whim and it looks like I'm gonna finally
end up trying it out so the last item in
the unboxing is this t-shirt and as you
can see the hearts are close to empty
and again if you want to rock this baby
that's a large as well
which is probably important to know and
the last thing we've got is the actual
game as I mentioned there is a gaming
here somewhere there it is and the game
itself is fairly straightforward I mean
it's there's nothing special inside I
don't even think there's any DLC or
anything like that at least there wasn't
a pamphlet identifying any and the only
thing to mention is that it has a fairly
significant manual I'll show you that in
a second yes that was two different
knives in one unboxing that's right the
here on unbox therapy we are not short
of unboxing knives no we got lots so
here's the game and you know as I said
before everything is the way you'd
expect it you get your game disc and a
fairly substantial manual on the other
side so you were all set and you can get
started with this fairly unusual game
and as I said before if you guys know a
lot about it or you have some opinions
on it leave some comments down below
because uh I'd like to hear what all you
think about it anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed this unboxing if you did
hopefully you can like and favorite this
content as it does help me out a bunch
