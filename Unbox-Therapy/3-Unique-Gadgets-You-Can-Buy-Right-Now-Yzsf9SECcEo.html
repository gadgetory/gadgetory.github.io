slows down and today I wanted to put
together a few of the cool ones three
cool unique unusual strange amazing
gadgets rebel cam by shift cam mini rig
mini
the gesture robotics aura this one here
looks a little bit ambitious but let's
get started with the rebel camp CES
Innovation Awards that's a good start
the multi lens photo revolution for
smartphone work on any smartphone a
selfie mirror frame it up it all pretty
pucker up and whatnot
an adjustable ring light to illuminate
in dark environments it's all in this
one little package from a lens
perspective a revolver bowl system I
don't think I've ever said that word
before evolvable oh my goodness revolver
you've never said that word before an
interview mister revolver ball you're
not alright
hey fisheye macro and wide-angle you
know I love the wide-angle where are you
taped brother oh there we go look at
that mirror whoa what do you think Jack
can you see yourself in there spins and
clicks turn it on turn it off and
magnetically look at that right in that
location where the mirror was
multifunctional a nice little carry
pouch so this is what it looks like when
it's on and then to switch lenses you
just spin this little guy
boom boom this must be the macro lens
let's bring it up to some text here oh
baby crazy detail there it's a pretty
wild with the light attached little
chips on the coin there's like little
chips on the surface of the coin which I
couldn't even see with my own eyes
pretty amazing right like have you ever
even seen a fingertip look like that
whoa and you obviously can tell what
this one is right away
it's crazy wide I mean almost like sort
of like music video it's the rear camera
right you get all the advantages of
using the rear camera wow that is a
really cool image and then the last one
is just the regular wide-angle wider
than the usual lens so that's the wide
and there's the regular pixel this is a
cool little gadget some extra aspects
like the light in the mirror I could get
behind this the only thing to mention is
it's a little bit pricey 80 bucks
this could really mix up your Instagram
page so this guy is called mini rig
really the claim to fame here the amount
of sound the quality of sound a super
portable Bluetooth speaker I'm talking
like pocket size up to 30 hours of
battery life 3.5 millimeter audio input
and output so you can daisy chain
multiple speakers together user manual
right there
look at that Hey oh look at that little
guy
Industrial this is metal feels rugged oh
wait a sec a tube style power adapter a
mini jack connector as well it looks
like when I just plug this in it powered
it up yeah that's kind of cool do they
name this thing unbox therapy oh I think
they did
I like this thing it's not just loud
right it's not just about volume it's
about the ability to reproduce frequency
the frequency into music and there's a
surprising amount of low-end represented
in something so tiny this thing is cool
on its own but they make this for a
reason the subwoofer for those that want
a little more juice you can tell already
you're paying a little bit more money
here whoa it just looks like a metal
tube oh yeah that's a lot more big
there's still another output on the
subwoofer it's not quite as convenient I
see this more as an at-home type of
setup I feel like this is gonna stay at
home most of the time
all right last up we definitely have the
most fun gadget of the bunch you are the
controller you have the power we'll see
I don't know this thing is super
lightweight too and the glove to control
the unit works within a range of 6 to 23
feet and it's a removable glove yeah
this thing is super lightweight it also
seems pretty durable with this huge cage
on it you'll have to be too concerned
about crashing it which is good for me
if you've seen any of the drone videos
on this panel extra propellers as well
the removable glove yeah you
I look right to you guys I'm sort of a
cyborg not really at all forward
backward left right there's a dedicated
button takeoff and landing right there
that's a look right there this is our
drone expert he'll II do he tells me to
calibrate it because the gestures back
forward it all starts from the point of
level so you hold the takeoff and land
button for four seconds and boom
calibrated so when I hold that button
the same gesture that I would use for
back and forward now becomes up and down
alright so it hovers we have back
forward those are the most basic
gestures and then right and left now I'm
going to come towards me stop back
forward and check this out Bam Bam
boom might have even exceeded my
expectations it's obviously a novelty
thing is not shooting any video as far
as some of the smaller drones I've tried
to control in this space I mean it's not
destroyed that's got to tell you
something it's a little bit pricey for
just like a hobby kind of toy ish drone
70 bucks keep that in mind but I mean
you get to wear this look at me right
now
so that's got to be worth something
don't you agree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
