have no idea what to expect I often get
emails about new and emerging products
many things I need to try out before you
just like to let you know if it's legit
in this box right here is a machine
called the vapeshot mini and what this
thing claims to do is to take alcohol
and turn it into a vapor form alcohol
that you inhale
I don't know I'm no expert together
maybe we'll become experts after we get
it out of the box quick disclaimer this
thing is a brand new concept so I'm not
necessarily vouching for it or anything
like that it's a new and emerging way to
consume alcohol so do your own research
they claim it safe I guess you'll find
out depending on if I survive or not
inside the box over that they concluded
straws nozzle please note we substituted
the one leader serving bottles with our
new 2-liter service bottle and it's been
prefilled with crown apple liquor sounds
scrumptious also there is a personalized
discount code of $600 off the normal
price for unbox therapy viewers the code
is unboxed zero zero one please note the
higher the alcohol proof the stronger
the affection 80 proof liquor is the
minimum you can also mix 70 or 80 proof
liquor with a 190 proof grain alcohol
that is what we have done with the crown
apple preloaded in your machine you're
done bud oh they shot bomb looks like
belong to an elaborate this is how you
get the vapor into the bottles it'll go
there and you'll it'll it'll be a
one-way valve so it'll be sealed inside
of there until you open it take a look
at that science right there there's like
a pump in there and it's a whole it's a
whole deal some straws important and we
have a remote control for the lighting
that's exciting
Tom you're doing the bomb doing the
bakeshop bomb
let's plug this in oh man
so one thing before we obey the way hi
Tom it's Tom again breathe in slowly and
hold until you feel the vape shot let me
get to it press the button on the top of
the injection gun and count to 15 now
you have a vape shop oh look this is the
booth look at that that's the alcohol Oh
baby
all right now they said to prime it let
me see your hand tom let me see your
head where did that melt like good once
you do it on your hand no no no you know
I got a private real quick here what
does that mean looks I know man oh I
guess it's working they said what 15
seconds yeah
here we come
okay so it's inside the bottle now and
you can kind of like the pressure of the
bottle when you open it it's going to
pop it's in it so why don't you do this
one no no okay there you go
No Hey and it's good I guess it's my
turn
Wow the Apple case is a lot stronger
than I expected what are the benefits
and drawbacks to you of this versus just
traditional everyday alcohol it's quick
mmm no calories like it's smoother than
a shot to drop I don't know there's
something about sitting down with a
drink casually sitting in the other
night it seemed a little immature well I
know we're like sucking alcohol
compatible like air is not even like
liquid the drawback here it's probably
portability like you're probably going
to take this to a party with you what
would you consider the effect to be
right now oh it's definitely stronger
than just a single shot really yeah yeah
there is a kind of euphoric feeling it's
but it's a little different it is the
maximum number of eight shots to be
consumed per hour is one each ten
minutes for a total of six per hour
do I have speaking a big one can it be
like I want to try to thank you this one
oh I'm the good one look at that so same
thing whoo all right I think I'm ready
I'm ready for the breakdown it is a
substitute for the traditional method of
doing it it's obviously far more
elaborate the flavor is certainly better
than taking a shot of hard liquor
there's no calories involved I suppose
also the effects are kind of more
confined like it feels like it might
wear off a little bit faster seems
reasonably safe I mean I feel fine
this is still alcohol consumption so if
you're not the legal age or you're
sensitive to alcohol this is not an
alternative it is the same thing just
consumed in a different fashion it would
be easy to just inhale like Tennessee
odor and all of a sudden you're
completely out of your mind and
responsibilities still plays a role
whether it's this or a shot of booze it
doesn't it doesn't really matter I have
to say I think the effect of it was more
substantial than I expected evade shot
does work it's not bullshit right Norman
take bullshit know you had this thing at
your place you were hosting a party when
people people would be pretty blown away
just popping the thing and the smoke and
it it's quite the show it's great well
apparently Tom's having a better time
than I am so thank you for watching
it's Jack's turn Jack get over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
