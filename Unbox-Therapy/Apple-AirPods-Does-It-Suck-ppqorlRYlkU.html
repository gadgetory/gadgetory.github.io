I almost said ear pods believe it or not
they arrived a little while ago but
there was a lot of things going on
moving studios and then CES and it's
like I haven't looked at them yet
there's got a lot of questions about
these things you're like are they any
good is our future completely wireless
are they just ear pods with the cords
cut off I don't know
so that's what we're here for we're
gonna find out are the air pods any good
or do they suck do they suck does it
suck whatever Apple has essentially
taken the ear pods but now they made it
Wireless it's using a completely new
method of pairing to your device it's a
whole new look right inside your iPhone
when connecting to these now they will
also work with Android devices and other
Bluetooth devices but you won't have all
that fancy pairing going on so here's
what the package looks like and you can
set in the back there's a little case
that comes with it a charging case looks
like some some dental floss and that
keeps some extra battery in it that
charges these things up even when you're
away from an outlet as you know there's
been some criticism with the latest
iPhone ditching the traditional
headphone jack but it's pretty obvious
that that's a move to push people in the
direction of the wireless earphone /
headphone space you guys remember Apple
also owns Beats Audio okay a little bit
of paperwork about the air pods then you
had to air pause themselves like I said
I mean it's almost exactly like a dental
floss space and then underneath there
your charging cable it uses the
Lightning connector so probably have an
abundance of those already so those will
work now a lot of people kind of have a
love/hate relationship with their ear
pods as it is right now but this is
different because now you're buying a
peripheral you're spending money extra
money on headphones so your expectations
are kind of going to be a little bit
elevated lightning connector goes in the
bottom now this guy on the top flips up
is a little magnet in there
your pod pull out like that I mean
they're not the most attractive things
in the world some people said it looks
like a toothbrush sticking out of your
ear or an earring or something like that
let me just see you yeah it's a weird
look they are small and very lightweight
so I feel I feel free it's not the
tightest fit in the game I will say that
of course Apple here with the air pod
just like the gear pod has a one size
fits all there's no tips you put on you
they either fit you great or or they
don't now the other thing to remember is
these things also have microphones right
because you should be able to trigger
certain events by speaking directly to
them or by talking and taking phone
calls maybe that has something to do
with the design as well the shape of the
thing for me this evaluation right here
has more to do with the sound and the
fit and so far these are okay in my ears
they're comfortable at least now the
real thing is this ability to pair with
your iPhone in a far simpler fashion
than a pair of generic Bluetooth earbuds
oh wow okay cool in my opinion that's
why you're buying these things and not
buying these things is for that right
they're smooth as butter look at this
open it up ask you if you want to
connect speed that's the killer app so
look at that I just press connect and
that's it the battery life of the air
pods themselves and then also the
remaining battery on the case now these
babies go in and now it's time for the
musical evaluation the real question
here for me is are these things that
upgrade over the regular ear pods or are
they just a wireless version of it place
on loop with
okay listen I like a lot of volume on my
headphones one of the things I've been
noticing about fully wireless headphones
whether they're Bluetooth or these ones
I'm not getting a ton of volume now it's
probably better for my hearing in the
long run but I like I like a thump to it
you know what if you are on Android then
what does the process look like this
button on the back yeah okay cool that
button now I see air pods I mean that's
pretty easy as well let's try this out
sound is essentially identical even on
Android I'd say it's a little bit easier
than some of the competitors in the
fully wireless space because some of
those were like turn on the one ear bud
and then wait 14 seconds look at the
moon and howl and then the other one
comes online you know it's like it's a
bit of a truthfully I'm a little
surprised Apple made them compatible you
know the way they are with the
proprietary stuff you get the added
functionality with their phone but hey
Android people you can use them you
probably won't but you can let's give
these a shot now I wonder if I plug
these in if it's just gonna immediately
switch over to them now the first thing
I'm noticing is the fit is actually not
identical this one does have a little
bit more depth to it less isolation with
these than those right off the bat let's
see if this just switches over instantly
when I play this it does okay let me
just switch back real quick
the sound doctor boots are very similar
and I think I actually got a little bit
more volume out of these so I think
these are a purchase of convenience
right to have the nice little pack that
goes with it and to not have the
potential pairing woes associated with a
wireless pair of headphones the
convenience is actually a big huge
component here and then you mix in the
fact that you're not tied down strictly
to iOS like you could use these with
Android if you really wanted to from a
sound perspective it's hard to get fired
up you know what I mean like I've
listened to very expensive headphones
earphones earbuds you name it and you
can tell from my reaction normally when
it comes to reactions you can't fake it
like you saw me I mean I wasn't I wasn't
jumping out of my chair they sound
essentially like the things that were
already included with your iPhone except
without a cable is that cool is that
good or does that suck it hard for me to
say it sucks and I'll tell you why
listen up real quick progress getting to
the next level pushing people towards
whatever that next thing is it's always
a little bit painful
there's always drawbacks along the way
but somebody has to step in and do it
and a lot of people out there gonna be
saying but wait Apple wasn't the first
person with fully pods here but it's
true they weren't and very rarely are
they the first but the difference is
when it gets adopted by Apple more
people get into the game more people use
it they have crazy distribution crazy
branding and so people put these things
in their pocket and it pushes other
manufacturers who might make something
more that I would like and you would
like to adopt those technologies because
the marketplace expands rapidly when
Apple does something whether you like
Apple or not their influence is vast in
the game I can say the sound I'm not
happy with the sound the convenience is
an A+ though if you're in the game for
sound I'll show you 300 pairs of
headphones you can stick an app on it
and zone out you can hit the next
dimension that's what I'm about Jack
that's a different story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
