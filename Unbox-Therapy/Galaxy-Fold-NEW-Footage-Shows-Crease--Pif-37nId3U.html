it's important I think it's interesting
you guys were hitting me up on Twitter
you wanted my opinion on this and so
here you have it it's kind of what I do
I break it down I tell you what I'm
seeing what I'm thinking we've got some
fresh footage some user-generated
content about the Samsung Galaxy fold
this is what's been sent to me once
again I got the link via Twitter pause
it right there will pause it right there
and you'll like back up a little bit
back up a tiny bit just before the the
butterfly comes on the screen yeah
somewhere right there right that'll do
this guy has managed to get his hands on
a galaxy fold somehow f900 you AT&amp;amp;T
version who knows how it seems like he's
in Vietnam based on you know I looked up
his Facebook page and it seems like he's
got some kind of a smartphone repair
shop in Vietnam he put his whatsapp as
well as his Facebook page right
plastered on the video so I mean he must
be getting bombarded right now did he
even know he did he even know he was
gonna get all this attention posting a
phone that's not even close to being out
yet nonetheless that's not what you care
about what you care about is this image
right here in the recent galaxy fold
video I showed you the clips that
Samsung put out and there was a question
that I had that you had that will had
that everyone oldest had the question
about whether or not the Galaxy fold
would show a crease down the center
the center line where it folded because
we had more comprehensive out of perfect
condition footage of the mate X from
Huawei and that thing you could see the
crease in it people were worried they
were concerned how much of an eyesore
but then when we got the extra footage
from Samsung on a galaxy full we didn't
see that same crease we didn't envision
that problem and people were speculating
all over the place how did they do it
how is there no crease how can we not
see the actual fold on the fold
within the OLED display so now that we
have this imperfect user-generated
footage you see
a strong crease in there I mean if you
examine this footage you see this this
crease down the center and I can't say
I'm surprised I guess
I just was hopeful that Samsung's
footage wasn't just the perfect
conditions but instead they found a way
to at least make the crease
insignificant in real life but it turns
out it was just magic with their
production because if this clip is real
and it looks very real then this seam
this crease is gonna be a part of your
life no matter which folding phone you
happen to choose now maybe this is
amplified by this guy's light source you
can see this kind of like it looks like
an overhead a more typical light source
and the fact that he's got a dark
display it looks it looks like a black
background so you know how that works it
kind of you know you illuminate the
glass a little bit more if you had a
bright white backdrop like Samsung had
in their video and a dude scrolling
Instagram and such maybe this is less
prominent but in this guy's clip it
looks prominent it looks obvious and I
guess it's just not ideal it's not what
we had hoped for nonetheless it doesn't
seem to alter the functionality if you
roll the clip here will you'll see the
dude not only shows off the phone but he
goes ahead and unlocks it as well like a
factory unlock because I guess that's
maybe his business the business that the
guys in who posted his clip or at least
put his contact info maybe the dude who
put the contact info doesn't even have
the device but got the clip from
somewhere else who knows here you can
see the device being handled for the
first time a user-generated clip an
individual other than a Samsung employee
has this thing in their hands and
they're showing it off you can see oh
that was weird on the back of it it's
got some kind of test number SBP 2 3 4 0
m-maybe this is not a commercial item
maybe this could change with the with
the retail release I kind of doubt that
to be honest I was speculating at least
to myself I was thinking that there's
going to be some
kind of a crease once we get more
details once we get more images and of
course once people get it in their hands
I kind of assumed that would be the case
so I'm thinking this is a real device or
at least a close to production device
but nonetheless this is I guess the best
look we've had at it because the origin
is not Samsung so it's not being shown
off strictly to look pretty instead this
is a regular human being showing it off
and going ahead and unlocking it there's
the crease again in that particular
footage there's a white background and
now you don't see the crease now it's up
to you does this change your opinion of
the device does it does it make you less
excited because obviously Samsung didn't
want to show it off in this particular
fashion obviously they would they would
go through whatever production
techniques necessary to diminish the
appearance of the fold in fact their
background kind of does so on its own
with the butterfly wings
Samsung cannot be happy about this clip
because I must not be the only one
getting hit up on Twitter and so on
people being like the fold has a crease
it has a seam Liu you need to know this
and I suppose it's just important to get
this information out there because I did
address the crease at least on the mate
X and I didn't do so on the Galaxy fold
just because we didn't know based on the
footage we had seen so for this for the
time being
folding phones will have creases they
will have seams they won't be perfect
they won't be completely magical there's
still certain physical constraints when
it comes to folding a display this is
that constraint does it affect your
enthusiasm will you buy it won't you are
you jaded now did you hope for more or
is this what you expected are you cool
with it
are you a future galaxy fold owner
nonetheless there's a seam there's a
crease the Galaxy fold it's practically
a paper airplane</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
