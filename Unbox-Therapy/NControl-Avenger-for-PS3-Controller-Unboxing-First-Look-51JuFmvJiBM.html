therapy and today we're taking a look at
something called the Avenger and as the
manufacturer in control introduces it it
is supposedly the ultimate gaming
advantage this contraption clips on to
the outside of your controller they make
a model for both the PlayStation 3 and
the Xbox 360 if you're interested in
either version or to get the prices etc
links are down in the description so you
can go find out more but for the sake of
the unboxing let's take a look at the
device now get it installed and give you
guys a better idea of how it functions
and why you might be interested in it so
first and foremost you've got a little
bit of paperwork from end control
explaining the reason why this is such
an improvement over the regular
controller the main concept here is that
your thumbs never leave the analog
sticks which apparently improves your
situational awareness and overall gaming
experience now the way that that occurs
is because your buttons square X
triangle etc are remapped to other
locations given the contraption here's
the instructions I'm not gonna make you
sit through my struggle trying to get it
installed I'll just go ahead and do that
off camera and then show you the end
product but here is a quick look a quick
glance at how the contraption looks and
to me it looks pretty intimidating like
some sort of deranged spider or
something but hey it doesn't have to
look pretty if it gets the job done
right I actually can't wait to try it
out myself not that I'm going to use it
every day I'm not really sure if that'll
be the case but just to get a better
idea of how this thing works some people
are a lot better on this device I'm a
little bit skeptical as I said before
but anyways here's how it works it clips
on really simple to install actually and
take off as well so that's not a big
deal you're not ruining your controller
but as you can see my thumbs don't have
to leave the analog thumb sticks in
order to trigger these buttons here and
the way that they're triggered is these
little screws that are adjustable so
depending on the sensitivity that works
for you you can make those necessary
adjustments just with the simple twist
now some people like it super sensitive
and in order to achieve that you just
get it right down to the point where the
button is almost clicked and then the
slightest movement will then click any
button that you so please here's a macro
close-up on how this concept works to
give you a better idea now the screw has
a pad on it so it won't damage the
button on your control you're not gonna
have to worry about that the other
element that's important here is the
trigger contraption and the reason for
that is it basically turns your triggers
into hair triggers and you can use this
little elastic band here to change the
tension so you can make them super
sensitive or a little bit less sensitive
if you find you're firing them much too
easily there's a better look at that
with the macro close-up that you're
going to get used to here on unbox
therapy so as I mentioned before it's
really easy to install and take out it's
a simple clipping mechanism here and
it's you know it takes a little bit to
get used to but after after that you get
pretty familiar with it and the whole
thing is customizable as well if you
notice here the arms that you actually
end up hitting where the buttons get
remapped depending on your hand size you
can adjust them to fit your fingers
properly anyway guys this has been a
first look at the Avenger from in
control I haven't tried it yet so I
can't give you too much of an opinion
that'll come in the in review video
coming up next Monday but for now here's
a look and the links are down below if
you want to know more information as
well as the purchasing pages prices etc
