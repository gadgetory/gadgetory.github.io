therapy and today we're taking a look at
something called the Avenger and as the
manufacturer in control introduces it it
is supposedly the ultimate gaming
advantage this contraption clips on to
the outside of your controller they make
a model for both the PlayStation 3 and
the Xbox 360 if you're interested in
either version or to get the prices etc
links are down in the description so you
can go find out more but for the sake of
the unboxing let's take a look at the
device i'll get it installed and give
you guys a better idea of how it
functions and why you might be
interested in it so first and foremost
you've got a little bit of paperwork
from end control explaining the reason
why this is such an improvement over the
regular controller the main concept here
is that your thumbs never leave the
analog sticks which apparently improves
your situational awareness and overall
gaming experience now the way that that
occurs is because your buttons square X
triangle etc are remapped to other
locations given the contraption here's
the instructions I'm not going to make
you sit through my struggle trying to
get it installed I'll just go ahead and
do that off camera and then show you the
end product but here is a quick look a
quick glance at how the contraption
looks and to me it looks pretty
intimidating like some sort of deranged
spider or something but hey it doesn't
have to look pretty if it gets the job
done right I actually can't wait to try
it out myself not that I'm going to use
it every day I'm not really sure if that
will be the case but just to get a
better idea of how this thing works some
people are a lot better on this device
I'm a little bit skeptical as I said
before but anyways here's how it works
it clips on really simple to install
actually and and take off as well so
that's not a big deal you're not ruining
your controller but as you can see my
thumbs don't have to leave the analog
thumb sticks in order to trigger these
buttons here and the way that they're
triggered is these little screws that
are adjustable so depending on the
sensitivity that works for you you can
make those necessary adjustments just
with the simple twist
now some people like it super sensitive
and in order to achieve that you just
get it right down to the point where the
button is almost clicked and then the
slightest movement will then click any
button that you so please here's a macro
close-up on how this concept works to
give you a better idea now the screw has
a pad on it so it won't damage the
button on your control you're not gonna
have to worry about that the other
element that's important here is the
trigger contraption and the reason for
that is it basically turns your triggers
into hair triggers and you can use this
little elastic band here to change the
tension so you can make them super
sensitive or a little bit less sensitive
if you find you're firing them much too
easily there's a better look at that
with the macro close-up that you're
going to get used to here on unbox
therapy so as I mentioned before it's
really easy to install and take out it's
a simple clipping mechanism here and
it's you know it takes a little bit to
get used to but after after that you get
pretty familiar with it and the whole
thing is customizable as well if you
notice here the arms that you actually
end up hitting where the buttons get
remapped depending on your hand size you
can adjust them to fit your fingers
properly anyway guys this has been a
first look at the Avenger from in
control I haven't tried it yet so I
can't give you too much of an opinion
