front of me
caviar I featured them in the past they
make these outlandish smartphones
project Tesla solar-powered iPhone okay
this one is crazy for a different reason
maybe I should just show you and you can
determine for yourself I will say like a
lot of their products this thing is
ultra luxury we are saying goodbye to
practicality we're gonna enter a dream
world of expensive it's for people who
have everything now you're watching this
maybe you're not gonna buy one maybe not
today but maybe you're a future
billionaire and when you get that kind
of dough you get really confused you're
like I can't just have an iPhone I gotta
have a caviar Royal gift I got Billy you
can't do that with a regular iPhone how
much would you need to buy something
like this well starts at sixty three
hundred dollars chances are you got a
lot more than that if you're thinking
about spending 6300 on a smartphone holy
smokes look at the packaging this slides
out I mean I just want to keep it in the
case I want to buy it just for the case
this is this leather I mean it feels
like
that's leather I'm nervous to open it up
of course I have to it's kind of the
point of the show here we go what
this thing is nuts if you are using this
thing you go to a nightclub with a phone
like that don't yet people are gonna
notice you this guy is so rich his phone
looks like a fine
watch is it an actual watch is that
ticking right now what is going on oh my
goodness
holy Wow it's a legit winding watch on
the back of your phone what is this made
out of well custom engraved blackened
titanium caviar luxury phones on a side
limited edition number 3 of 99 it says
it's an iPhone 10s titanium and 24 karat
gold Wow some paperwork international
warranty certificate of authenticity
like all of their other products and
seniors got the stamp of approval the
design or signature Wow when you have it
written out the warranty is written in
pen you know you just spent dollars you
spent money the headset I didn't
guessing oh yeah what look at the sim
tool what is that a swordfish or
something I've never seen a sim tool
that cool before course there's a
headset as well a lightning cable power
brick yes you have there that okay now I
realize that this is probably tough for
you to appreciate the carvings and the
detail is actually really impressive
here as you know the number of moving
parts like in this type of setup you can
see all the various little cogs and
things in there it's like the old tech
meeting the new tech it's obviously
completely insane
that's the point of it guys if someone
is to see it they absolutely have to ask
you about it it has to be a conversation
starter it's not really meant to be
practical you have the time on the phone
obviously I've number three that means
there's 98 of them out there who are
these 98 people imagine you have a
meeting with a guy you walk in Jack have
a seat yeah go ahead
yeah have a seat God Hey okay yeah we'll
pick it up later
I know this guy interrupting innit I
know okay bye go ahead what go ahead you
can't have a meeting with a guy like you
already lose you're about to be in a
negotiation guys over here you lose the
negotiation you pay everything you get
nothing jack guy like you in Russia you
meet a guy like that in Russia
you're dead guy like you you don't think
doodle guy like you huh it's put
lipstick on a guy like you
don't you dare cut that out based on ETA
United six four nine eight - one
modified mechanics with manual winding
17 stones makes 18 thousand vibrations
per hour and the power reserve is 30
hours through winding this clock yes
manually winding it you charge up the
internal components and grant yourself
30 hours of power reserve a 256
gigabytes iPhone 10s which is already
expensive to begin with so keep that in
mind I mean if you do the math there
then in reality this thing's only like
6,000 bucks instead of 7,000 look it's
gonna be a tough justification all right
half the videos on this on this channel
I'm like look for value in your smart
phones this is not it
but this ain't trying to be this is
screaming in your face it's saying take
me home you have too much money in your
pocket you're rich and you need me if
you're one of the 99 people who paid
seven thousand dollars for one of these
you can come on this show and you can
tell the world what it is that you do
for a living that you can rock one of
these like this and you can host
meetings and you can have Jack there and
shut him down before he says a word
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
