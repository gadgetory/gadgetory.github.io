videos on a channel recently aiming to
discover uncover the best selling items
on Amazon in various categories because
usually the best selling items are there
for a reason and of course just like the
other segments we've covered in the past
with the wireless headphones and so on
there's a list of best-selling TVs on
Amazon and this one it's not the
best-selling TV overall but it is the
best-selling 4k TV it's reviewed really
well it's got the Amazon branding with
the fire TV edition so this 43 inch 4k
TV is 249 dollars if you're in the
market for a TV this is probably
something you should be paying attention
to especially if you haven't stepped up
to 4k yet I mean there's hardly an
excuse left over at this point it is an
LED backlit display and you can get an
idea for the ports lots of HDMI ports to
choose from it's VESA mountable if you
want to mount it or you can use the
included stand so 2160p screen
resolution it is a 60 Hertz panel
there's three HDMI inputs one composite
one digital optical output there's an
antenna cable input headphone jack
see what we got
Oh oh nice all right UFC app Jack
Capitol help we're gonna be here for a
minute look at that PlayStation Hulu
Showtime HBO stars ABC Fox Sports go NBC
NB a UFC NFL NHL MLB news e2b they want
you to select so they can kind of make
up your home screen so let's just pick a
few here pick all the sports why not
that's a pretty nice setup going on they
merge together the streaming services
with your HDMI switch I like I don't
mind this setup it's actually snappy as
well there's even games apparently you
can use Alexa to do some sort of a
global search so let's give that a shot
play some jazz the station all jazz on
Amazon music you I mean like baked right
in order some laundry detergent one
moment that's pretty cool since it's
hooked up to my Amazon account it's two
seconds you know it's also pretty quick
as well
search unbox therapy on YouTube whoa all
right let's get a look at the picture
real quick
[Laughter]
everyone is telling me this is the
future of Sat is a nice image should be
listening to music I'm pretty happy with
that
we can just be like what is unbox
therapy unbox therapy is a YouTube
channel that focuses on making videos
about unboxing and reviewing products
who won the Superbowl
On February 3rd in the Superbowl the
Patriots beat the Rams 13 to 3
who is Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin were an
English rock band formed in London in
1968 what's the most populated country
in the world the largest country on
earth by population is China with 1.3
eight get a graph just like Google home
or whatever it's typically a voice
assistant exclusively but when they
started to make those devices with
screens I guess they had to generate
those various graphics and whatnot what
is the best selling smartphone on Amazon
one would oh yeah that's right that's a
top 20 smartphone by sales we did a
video on this remember what happens if I
click on one yeah Add to Cart let's try
the audio try two speakers out
it's pretty good it's hard to figure out
like what can really compete with this
overall package at that price man you
get a lot for your money the picture I'd
say is better than I expected at the
price point the sound is kind of exactly
where I expected it to be it's easy to
recommend there's a reason why it's
right near the top of the list for best
selling TVs on Amazon now remember it
does come in a 50-inch size as well this
might be the most no-brainer thing that
I've ever showcased on a channel you
don't have a 4k TV 250 bucks you get the
Alexus stuff as a bonus no excuses now I
guess everybody has to have 4k everybody
should everybody will is crazy what
they're delivering at 250 I didn't
expect it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
