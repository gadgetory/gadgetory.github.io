therapy and this is the iPhone 4s
unboxing of your dreams it's early in
the morning I was up all night waiting
for this I'm about to grab my trusty
blade and do what I do best because this
is unbox therapy where products get
naked so here it is the 4s in white and
as you guys know it's a real pretty
device it's time for you to live
vicariously through this consumption
right here there's the device itself all
glass some protective coating all over
it we've got the power brick the sync
cable of course you can sync wirelessly
now
in iOS 5 and of course we've got the
headset with the inline remote and the
microphone attached as well now let's
get a look at the other items we have
our little pin for inserting your micro
SIM card and the boring stuff that we've
got to get out of the way a little bit
of paperwork we have French we have
English we have a little iPhone 4s
manual as well as the ubiquitous Apple
stickers that are always included let's
peel away that protective covering and
get a glimpse at that beautiful glass
that's hiding underneath so there it is
I guess you could say the 4s is now
officially naked it has officially been
unboxed so here you have it I'm going to
boot it up for y'all and as you know in
iOS 5 you do not have to connect it to
the computer immediately instead you can
do that on here I've got to insert a SIM
card I'll do that later this is the
unboxing so the side of the unit has
your volume as well as your lock switch
the top has your headphone jack and your
power button of course along the other
side is where you went
you're micro-sim and on the bottom we
have our dock connector and our speakers
of course the back of the unit has that
brand-new 8 megapixel shooter with that
improved sensor can't wait to use it and
the front of the unit has your speaker
your forward facing camera and of course
your proximity sensor and that familiar
home button right let's press it and see
if we got action of course we get action
because there's a little bit of battery
on this device as I said this is not the
review this is the unboxing the review
is coming next after I use the device
and test the hardware the software let
you guys know what this is all about and
if it's right for you as you guys know
it's a real pretty device I said it
before you're not going to regret taking
a hard look at this baby anyway guys I
want to thank you for watching if you
enjoyed this unboxing hopefully you can
