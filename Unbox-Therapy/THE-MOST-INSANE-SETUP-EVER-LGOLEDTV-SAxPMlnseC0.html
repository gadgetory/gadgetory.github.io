another video and today I have a very
special upload for you now many of you
know that I am interested in maybe
obsessed with trying to create the
ultimate set up the ultimate set of
monitors to sit in front of now back
there in my office I have a four monitor
editing setup I've got a triple monitor
OLED racing simulator from LG now LG saw
that and they said to me that's great we
like the look of it but we want you to
take it to the next level Lou what would
you do with 40 monitors and a venue to
set it all up in Iceland to which I said
I'm on the next plane he is known for
his honest YouTube reviews on newly
released electronic products
let's welcome unbox therapy low-tech did
you guys see the display you gotta you
gotta look at it right that's 40 screens
up there hundreds of millions of pixels
that's the kind of stuff that turns me
on right
those people out there that know me you
know that technologies is very important
to me that's that's the stuff I've been
enthusiastic about for a very long time
and when they said we're trying to put
together this kind of ultimate display
set up we want to use oleg we want to
use multiple screens I said I mean let's
figure it out can they be curved can it
be immersive immediately I wanted to
participate okay can I say something
about Iceland the people here
unbelievable you guys are amazing
Iceland wake up wake up so you guys
watch a lot of YouTube or what yeah yeah
oh yeah that's cool yeah is that like a
code name or is it actually a sheepshead
yeah what part of the head am i eating
all of it
yeah you can see I I can if yeah for
some reason that doesn't sound
appetizing yeah I took a trip around
today I went out I flew some drones I
looked at the landscape I found some
volcanic rock yes there's a lot of it I
know and I just I don't know there's a
certain sense of almost like a mystical
kind of aspect to Iceland been an
incredible time here major appreciation
to Iceland I really can't I really can't
give you the experience of being here I
can just tell you and show you but this
is a special place dare I say magical
let me say something real quick about
all that okay so I've seen everything
that's out there I've seen every tech as
it comes along in the first time that I
put it over there in front of me I was
like oh this oh this is what it was
supposed to look like but the whole time
no seriously if you put one of these
things in your living room you're going
to know what I'm talking about eat those
deep blacks that high contrast it's a
different experience there's no doubt
this is the new frontier right here not
to say that I understand all the
complexities of getting this operating
it's incredibly resource intensive
trying to push that many pixels
independently to each 4k display you're
looking for a kind of environment and a
sort of natural occurrence that can can
really take advantage of some of the
technology that's happening behind the
scenes there sometimes when technology
gets out of the way and enables
kind of personal more human experience
that's when it's doing this best job
thank you so much follow your music okay
Iceland thank you very much thank you
algae for putting this together
unbelievable how about the music too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
