that man in jail what does he think he
is doing I'm responding to the will of
the people the Nero is back oh my
goodness I am back with a video that I
am genuinely excited for this in front
of me is an exclusive look at the very
first phone from the company razor I
don't even know how it ended up here but
I've heard a little bit about this and I
knew as soon as I could get my hands on
it I wanted to because this is a phone
that features something that no other
phone has right now also it's the first
foray into phones from a company famous
for gaming equipment and more
specifically I am at least my exposure
has been to their gaming laptops which I
have loved in here is the razor phone 64
gigabytes of internal storage
the battery is 4000 milliamp hours now
you know I'm a battery junkie four
thousand milliamp hours from now on I
set the standard USB type-c charging
cable USB C audio adapter it's got a
quick charger in the Box you don't need
to buy it extra wink-wink nudge-nudge I
don't even know how to wink that count
sim eject tool and important product
information guy now some other specs I
know for a fact that this thing has 8
gigabytes of RAM most excitingly is the
display that's the special feature that
no other phone have whether you're
watching movies in bed listening to
music on your run or kicking virtual ass
on your commute we're gonna have to
bleep that cuz this is a family show you
need a device that delivers breathtaking
visuals cinematic audio and the power to
last all day it has this aggressive
angular design to it that is cold that
is cold aluminum Razer logo on the back
here
Jul 12 megapixel cameras at the top I
love a wide-angle lens on a regular
camera I love it on a phone as well ok
so before I turn this on I want to prep
you with some exact specifications this
device is the first on the planet with a
120 Hertz Ultra motion display it's also
the world's first phone featuring
Qualcomm quick charge
point o + 8 gigabytes of ddr4 Ram 64
gigabytes u FS of internal storage and
up to 2 terabytes max through microSD
and all of that is powered up by a four
thousand milliamp hour battery okay I'm
gonna put this down for a moment and
look at the other items in the box
Oh looks like we have some paperwork
here as well as what might be the
world's coolest sim eject tool ever see
that Jack the Razer branded sim eject
tool a little Quick Start Guide and then
also of course the Razer stickers to
show your pride braided USB type-c cable
type c2 mini jack adapter okay lastly we
have I'm guessing the power brick yes
and this is your Qualcomm quick charge
4.0 plus power brick with the razer
branding on it you're gonna want to use
the included charger to charge up super
quick so here we go initial boot up
there it is razer logo powered by
android oooh nice little Razer animation
so there you have the new 5.7 inch
display a razer branded set up here
which is nice my speculation i guess was
correct
i believe the power switch over here
jack can you pick that up right there
this is a power switch fingerprint this
is the thing that everybody wanted Apple
to do with the 10 so you didn't just
have to rely on face unlock alright
let's check out this fingerprint oh are
you guys hearing that sound effect right
now
I'll ask my favorite unlock lock and
unlock ever all-time it's got some games
included by default titanfall mobile
version World of Tanks
a racing game alright let's check out
the settings real quick some data about
the phone so here we can see 1.5
gigabytes of 7.5 gigabytes of memory
used Android 7.1.1
I've shown you a lot of stuff that's
cool but this to me is the coolest the
display supports a hundred and twenty
Hertz refresh rate now you've seen this
in gaming monitors you may have seen it
in some tablets but never in a phone now
interestingly by default the refresh
rate is set to 90 Hertz on the device
but it can go up to 120 so let's go
ahead and do it and what you went oh my
it's like instant now your eyes aren't
gonna pick it up the way mine are
because you're watching this you know
through a video 24 frames per second but
when you're scrolling a list there oh no
lag at all
now of course relying on the processing
power of the device as well but what
this means is that the display is just
it has this more responsive attitude
much like if you've ever seen the
difference between 120 Hertz a 60 Hertz
monitor then that's what this is like
and and you feel it when you interact
with it oh and for those of you
wondering about resolution
out-of-the-box 1440p
it's at its max you can toggle that back
to F HD 1080p you know I just noticed as
well a very stock experience being
provided here by Razer no no heavy
skinned or anything like that
camera jack is curious about the camera
as am i so let's launch this open right
now now the implementation on the rear
camera it kind of leaves you guessing a
little bit but that's part of the
software it's the app at some point
during the zoom you're switching over
from the wide-angle to the zoom lens to
the telephoto lens as I do so I'll show
you here you're not really sure where
you have switched to a digital zoom I
mean you can kind of guess I guess it's
about halfway across this is fully wide
and then as I begin to zoom in and you
can tell that your optical up into a
point at which point digital zoom takes
over so I kind of wish
a dedicated button there to just pop
into the other lens quickly you're
pinching and zooming like you would
otherwise even on a single lens system
all right let's try the front one now
front selfie time the beard hairs are on
full display I have to say I am
satisfied alright so we talked about the
display in this incredible refresh rate
but of course a display has to be good
at displaying things first and foremost
so let's boot up some YouTube here and
see what the video quality looks like
and also at the same time test out these
stereo speakers which I've been told
each unit has its own end for extra
volume
they might be the best speakers I've
heard you guys probably can't tell cuz
they're firing at me there's a little
bass in them which is kind of crazy to
say about a phone so far just hearing
what I heard on the YouTube video I
think it's gonna be pretty nice we'll
see
well it's the best speaker I've ever
heard of smartphone that's it now you
can tell there's been focus on the low
end here because the phone it kind of
vibrates a little bit from the thickness
everybody else needs to reevaluate not
only are these speakers loud but they're
just thicker there's an attention on the
lower end and they didn't over push them
either to the point where it's like
grinding and chewed up at the high end
of the volume what can I say guys I
can't hide it like I'm really into this
phone I just like the matte black the
masculine design the idea of a
fingerprint sensor in the power switch
that turns me on the idea of
loudspeakers on a smartphone that turns
me on
the idea of the ultra-fast refresh rate
that turns me on I mean there's just so
much cool about this phone that I don't
see in other phones I think the real
deal breaker is still gonna be the
camera and I'm gonna use it more
extensively preliminary results look
pretty good so far but to be quite
honest I rarely will swap out my SIM
card when a new phone arrives this one
is instant its instantaneous my SIM card
is gonna come out of my pixel right now
and it's gonna go into this phone for a
company to put out their very first
device and hit something like this with
no history in the phone game well done
Bravo that's all I gotta say about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
