another video and today I've got a
speaker a bluetooth speaker you've
watched many Bluetooth speaker videos
here on unbox therapy this one is a
little different because it's in the
shape of a bowl it's actually got six
speakers inside of the unit Mumma mu
Emma but it's also a power station you
know people they come home they have
their smartphone they stick it near the
front door maybe they put it into a bowl
anyways like some one of those jacks got
one it's a little fancy ball you know
carved from a some tree from the Amazon
he doesn't care about the environment
you know this is better because it'll
power it up there's actually usb on here
so it can also be your charge spot and
it's got a microphone in it so it can be
a speakerphone
and there you can see the interior
design style implementation where they
have mounted it on the wall it has
interchangeable covers so you can I've
actually got one over here look at this
we got this felt kind of look over here
now I think this came from Germany or
something I understand is a little bit
of a subwoofer to it as well for some of
that low-end goodness that you guys know
I'm a fan of I'm also particularly
excited about the speakerphone that's
got some weight to it Wow you see it
kind of looks like a UFO here guessing
that's the power switch it kind of looks
like a stock speaker grille oh you just
turned on oh hello there a strainer that
you would put pasta in spins off and
there you can see the actual speaker
itself so this cable here to the input
location and then out through this
channel to plug in to keep this charge
right that makes sense this cable is
going to be used to actually charge up
your device it's also got an auxiliary
input if you prefer to keep it
old-school this on the bottom is for
mounting it you put a screw on the wall
and you just hook it right in there
you could plug it in boom now your
charging let's connect and play a little
bit of music here connecting
the maximum that the mask is like Jason
is it the best I've ever heard no I
don't think so you know it's got some
low-end going for it the volume probably
isn't quite what I expected just
relative to the size I should do a phone
call hello dad
yeah what's going on listen I'm doing a
test here on a new Bluetooth
speakerphone I want to know how do I
sound why it's not fine what are you
speaking to me through well I've got the
you know what do you call it the
hands-free like I'm not done I got my
speaker ontake whew yes so we're double
Bluetooth right now oh yeah yeah awesome
all right dad say hi to everybody on
unbox therapy oh stole the show so this
is probably actually gonna live in the
office here as our little conference
caller because we actually need one and
if you want to spin the camera around
and see jack then you can or can you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
