therapy and we're getting a look at the
moto active this is a very cool device
it's not just one thing it's a music
player it's a watch it's an exercise
device it's also going to interact with
your cell phone your smartphone and give
you some caller ID some text messages
it's just really cool all around it's
it's gonna do a lot of its work via
bluetooth it can be worn as a watch but
it doesn't have to be the only problem
with that he's got to pick up the watch
strap separately for another twenty nine
bucks now the device ain't cheap it
retails for 249 then again you can
really easily spend 249 or more on a
watch that does a lot less than this so
in my opinion it's pretty interesting
and I'm excited to get inside and see
what exactly this little thing can do
and also how it looks because as we all
know if you're gonna put something on
your wrist and rock it all day long
you're gonna want to make sure that it's
suitable to do so some of these Smart
Watch devices in the past have not been
the prettiest I'm looking at that one
Sony Ericsson device in particular that
operated similarly to this one - some of
the exercise functionality so as you
guys notice it kind of looks like an
iPod Nano on its own sitting here you've
got that reflective back on it and you
can use it like this like it doesn't
need to be used as a watch you've got a
dedicated start and music button along
the top edge of the device it's gonna
charge via USB which is nice nothing
proprietary you've got your headphone
jack a nice right angled connector on
your headphones as well your power
button as well as volume up and down
which are important after all this is a
music player and it can also answer
phone calls for you over Bluetooth I
mean I'll get to all the features and
functions in a little bit but
nonetheless inside the box we've got our
cable and then next a little clip
mechanism again if you're not going to
be using it as a watch this clip allows
you to put it on your clothing whether
for exercise or riding a train whatever
you want to do with it you've got some
tips to choose from so you can customize
the fit of the earbuds
it's an in-ear style headphone of course
and as
guys notice it's got a cool red cable
not sure if that's to your taste but if
it is you'll probably like it it's also
got a right-angle gold-plated mini-jack
connector I like right-angled connectors
they're generally more robust and
tougher to mess up you've got a clip up
here because there's a microphone on
this device it's a headset and that
microphone is going to be used as I
mentioned earlier to answer phone calls
assuming this watch so to speak is
connected via bluetooth to your phone so
I've seen some of these inline remotes
before and sometimes they're low-quality
this one feels solid though you've got a
button there which is likely going to be
used to answer and hang up phone calls
really cool a really unique device as I
mentioned earlier I'm not sure that
there's ever been anything quite like it
the headphones are unique as well and
the reason for that is because you've
got this red strip on the interior that
red strip is actually a heart rate
monitor and the reason for that is
pretty obvious it's to monitor your
heart during exercise the tips fit on
fairly easily you can swap them out and
switch them find whatever it is that
works for you now the next thing inside
of the box or the last physical item
inside of the box is this power charging
brick it's a little tiny block very
reminiscent of the Apple brick except
you've got two USBs because two is
better than one so I suppose you can
charge up a couple of us two USB devices
instead of one very cool now we've got
some paperwork this is obviously the
most boring part of any unboxing but we
got to look at it nonetheless you've got
some instructions telling you how to get
this set up get some music on it so on
and there's some accessories available
as well if you want to go wireless with
your headphones you can do that via some
different wireless Bluetooth headphones
available via Motorola now the clip is
pretty easy to use you just slide your
moto active down on to it it doesn't
quite click into place but it definitely
feels sturdy this thing is not going
anywhere you can trust me on that
and everything about the clip feels nice
it's all metallic so here's that micro
USB connector that's what you're going
to use to charge the device and as I
mentioned earlier that's that's a big
plus nobody wants proprietary
connections anymore we've all got micro
USB chargers hanging around and cables
hanging around so it's nice to use
something that's already here so lastly
we've got the wrist strap and as I
mentioned earlier this is an extra you
got to pay another $29 which seems kind
of chintzy when you're already paying
249 for the watch but hey that's the way
that it is and one thing I will say is
that the watch feels really good the
strap I mean it's it's high-quality you
got a real cool locking clasp so at
least in that respect it feels like it's
worth 29 bucks I guess so it works much
in the same way as the clip you just
slide the Moto active and down on to
there and again there's no clicking
noise but it's solid it ain't going
anywhere unless you want it to go
somewhere and here's what it looks like
altogether you still see the Motorola
logo on the inside and this is the way
that locking clasp works you just pop
that baby out and go ahead and try it on
I'll try it on here why not it is a
watch after all so there's what it looks
like mounted up on my wrist I think I
have averaged maybe two large-size hands
so it is a big it's a big device it's
probably not for everyone if you like
chunkier watches then it's probably fine
for you now there is a little bit of
setup work involved only because this
thing is so smart you put in everything
from your time zone to your sex to your
age to your weight some some crazy
details because this thing really
tracking everything about you and
everything that you do in order to come
up with figures on how many calories you
burn in a day how many steps you take
the whole nine yards now as you can see
I picked a kind of unique watch face
here it's it's the skull and skull and
crossbones you know situation as for you
badass people in a crowd but you can
also get much more subtle stock options
in there now this is actually running a
stripped-down version of Android very
cool and after all this is just the
unboxing I can't go too deeply into the
functionality of this thing at the
moment I will do a review I promise you
that so definitely subscribe for it
anyway guys I want to thank you for
