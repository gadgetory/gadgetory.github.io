another unboxing and overview today I am
very excited to take a closer look at
the newly released Moto X from Motorola
so I realized that this device has been
out for a little while and you may have
seen some videos already covering it but
I thought that it would be useful to
hear some of my feedback and my initial
impressions having used the device for a
little bit now as you see on the back of
the box the Moto X is designed and
manufactured in the United States and
that's obviously incredibly unusual for
smartphones the vast majority coming
from Asia so we're gonna have to wait
and see you know how that all pans out
but I have to say it's probably a
positive thing to bring some
manufacturing especially high-tech
manufacturing back to the US so the
first thing on top of the box is the
device you can see mine is plain old
boring black but you've probably seen
images of customized colored
configurations that's one of the special
things about the Moto X you've also got
a little bit of paperwork here this of
course is the most boring part of any
unboxing video so I will tell you about
some specs right now it's packing a 4.7
inch AMOLED display which is 720p and
some have criticized that decision to go
with the lower res display in my
particular use I didn't really feel that
I was lacking too much or I was missing
1080p in any way on 4.7 inches it's not
quite a huge deal as you can see they've
included a double USB charger that's a
really positive thing so you can charge
two USB devices
I think Motorola is the only ones that
do that you've also got this sim tool
here that of course is going to be used
for inserting your SIM card into the
Moto X in terms of processing power
you're essentially looking at a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 pro clocked at 1.7
gigahertz on two cores and then there's
also a quad-core Adreno 320 GPU so
Motorola is calling this package the x8
mobile computing system as you can see
it has this cool almost carbon-fiber
looking back to it but it's very soft
touch there's also a 10 megapixel clear
pixel RGB
see camera on the back which is capable
of 1080p HD video at 30fps there's also
a forward-facing camera at 2 megapixels
or 1080p HD video for videoconferencing
Skype etc now one of the drawbacks are
perceived drawbacks on this device is
the fact that it's only got a 2200
milliamp hour battery though motorola is
claiming mixed usage of up to 24 hours
because they have implemented some power
saving features on this device now one
of the things that doesn't show up on a
spec sheet or in a video is how a device
feels to hold and use and I have to say
that the Moto X is probably my favorite
handset I've ever had in the studio in
terms of ergonomics or the way that it
feels to hold it it's got a nice curved
back with a soft touch material it just
fits in my hand really really well and
the bezels on each side of the screen
are so slim that it's not too wide
across for an average hand I think my
hands are probably average too large but
this is pretty much the perfect size as
I'd imagine it I think 4.7 inches in a
small form vector or a small frame is
really the best of everything you get
one-handed operation when you need it
but then you've got a nice big screen
for multimedia I suppose the only thing
people could be asking for here is
possibly 1080p but like I said at no
point using it was I like oh damn I'm
looking at pixels now I suppose the the
image is small enough that the human eye
at a regular range doesn't really pick
up on it too much unless you've got a
1080p screen directly beside it then you
might start to notice it the device is
snappy and that brings me to another
thing that I really like about the Moto
X the interface it's almost untouched
from the vanilla Android experience and
that is incredibly uncommon believe it
or not in the Android space especially
when you're talking about the top-tier
smartphones like the galaxy s4 or the
note 3 that I just looked at or even the
HTC one each one of those has its own
heavy duty skin on top and you guys have
probably heard me say in the past that I
don't really like any of those
experiences I've been a nexus user for a
very long time and I have often accepted
lower specifications from flagship
devices in order to get that vanilla
experience that I'm such a huge fan of I
mean the way that I look at it is the
R&amp;amp;D that Google puts into a new OS can't
really be replicated or changed in the
amount of time that any manufacturer has
to reskin what they've developed and
what they've built
I really wish skins would just die and
everybody would accept one single user
interface well this is not exactly that
but it is the closest you can come
without going to a Nexus device so as
you can tell that is a major major plus
for me as an end user and a huge fan of
stock Android speaking of stock Android
the next Nexus or the Nexus 5 is
expected to launch relatively soon so if
like me you are a huge fan of these
types of experiences you probably want
to wait for the Nexus 5 to come out so
you can make a more informed decision as
far as which one is better for you
between the Moto X and the Nexus 5 for
the record the Nexus 5 is said to be
built around the lg g2 similar to the
last Nexus which was built around a
previous gen LG phone as mentioned
earlier this device sports a 10
megapixel clear pixel camera it's not
the best in the business definitely not
as good as the Nokia Lumia 1020 that I'm
taking a picture of here or the iPhone
5s but it gets the job done and for most
users that are into social photo sharing
etc it's going to be just fine and I
don't think the drawback is big enough
that it would stop me from buying the
device as my daily driver before we take
off I want to give a big shout-out to
audible.com for helping to make this
content possible if you're unfamiliar
with the site or the service it's
basically a giant repository of books in
audio format so if you're like me and
you spend a lot of time in the car or in
situations where you couldn't
necessarily read a traditional book
audible offers up an incredible solution
sitting in traffic can be a very
mind-numbing experience but if you add
an audio book to the mix you can
actually be learning something at the
same time I'm Liz
turning to the Steve Jobs book by Walter
Isaacson currently and the funny thing
is I actually own a physical copy of
that book but haven't had the time to
consume it traditionally so now I'm
consuming the same information except
I'm doing so in my car back and forth to
work anyway guys if you want to check
out the service there's a link down in
the description to make your life easier
it is audible.com slash unbox click that
link and you can get started with your
first book for free so once again that
is audible.com slash unbox my thanks to
