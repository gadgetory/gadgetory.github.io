therapy
of course it's somebody happy what else
would you be watching what's up guys Lew
here back with another video and today
it's it's something a little bit
different there is no box in front of me
it makes me very uncomfortable I have
the new surface pro 4 coz Microsoft sent
it out to me they said hey we want you
to talk about office Microsoft Office I
was like office what do you mean
everybody knows about office you got
word you got Excel what else you got
Jack
PowerPoint get all these different
things in there that many people know
and love but they've changed a little
bit this device is kind of a unique
hybrid type situation a keyboard and a
trackpad but also this tablet and you
can yank this off and it look oh it
becomes a tablet like some other stuff
on the market right now a pen compared
to some of that other stuff you know
what I'm talking about
this one has a place to go it can just
look at this let's let's try this out
here here we go oh it doesn't only have
to attach to one side either you see how
much fun I'm having him maybe you're
left-handed boom you've also got forward
facing speakers something that is
surprisingly rare on tablets located up
at the top here so when you're holding
it they are shooting at your eardrums a
bunch of cool accessories like this
keyboard and trackpad here which turns
it into almost like a laptop situation
and you can see there that connects via
magnets to it's a hole magnet
extravaganza here pretty decent tactile
feedback here whoo yeah around the
device you'll notice a USB port here so
peripherals are welcome
most got video out this is a fairly
unique power port that's on here as well
hold the charger up to it clips in and
on the other side we have a headphone
jack the volume rocker lives right here
and the power switch is in that
location right there the cover is a kind
of soft microfiber type material as you
can tell I don't mind touching it
JAC give it a touch but anyway this
isn't the reason that Microsoft asked me
to make this video it's actually not
about the surface form it is instead
about the magical world of Microsoft
Office specifically 365 you can
collaborate on various documents it's
not tied down to a specific device or a
specific piece of hardware maybe you're
on your desktop at work or maybe you're
on your laptop and those files remain
available to you via both the web or the
native app which is actually on your
device you know maybe you're like Jack
and you're and you're typing out a
recipe grandma's old chili you got to
get tomatoes in there you got to get the
the kidney beans in there he's gonna get
it down in Microsoft Word and then his
friends only his best friends will be
invited to that document grandma's old
recipe for chili shared with friends are
we off the rails I hope so in front of
me I have word open and I have a
template there which is the beginnings
of a resume for yours truly I go over
here I go new now you're gonna see
featured templates they're loading up I
mean there's a variety of them to choose
from here maybe you like to kick it
old-school and you like to start out
blank that's where I start when I'm
writing rap lyrics head-bobbing lyrics
flowing now if I start typing something
like this is loo from unbox therapy need
your gadget unboxed question mark who
wouldn't sign up for something like that
Jack on the other hand on his screen you
you may not have known but he's
collaborating with me here and if you
look over in the side pane there you'll
see that I'm editing in real time and
Jack is also editing in real time say
something to the people updates are
available save your document to refresh
it looks like Jack is using my my cover
letter as a place to store his grandma's
recipe so
you see here 229 ounce cans of tomato
sauce some diced onion tbsp of Italian
seasoning see that's news to me but it
also happens at the same time online if
I launch my browser you'll see it'll be
the same so you see you're prompted here
when they go ahead and open the document
in Word you can either continue working
online or you can go over to the local
app now the reason there are two Jack
McCann's over in the little pain there
is because Jack McCann is editing online
as well as locally that's the whole
agenda here let people into your
document let people into your life one
of the cool functions that's new to me
is something called tell me well here
are some suggestion leave a comment
change how the table looks edit a header
if I said insert picture oh really and I
can do an image search right from there
or I can insert from Facebook okay we
have the chili pepper how dare you okay
so now we've got a picture of me
inserted eating pizza let's say I want
to look up a term and I'm gonna select
the word unbox tab like that we've got
something here called smart lookup get a
little more information without leaving
the document or what I'm working on I'm
gonna have insights over on the right
hand side in its own kind of section
here unboxed with an album by a Sammy
Hagar unboxing on Wikipedia if I select
that it'll just launch me straight into
the Wikipedia article many places claim
that the first unboxing video was of the
Nokia e6 t1 cell phone in 2006 Wow come
a long way single-tier so there you have
it Microsoft Office 365 as you can tell
some cool things built in there
hopefully it can make you more
collaborative maybe help you make a
couple friends and probably most
importantly help you make a better bowl
of chili if you guys enjoyed this
content make sure to leave a thumbs up
down below thanks as always for watching
and I will catch you on the next episode
later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
