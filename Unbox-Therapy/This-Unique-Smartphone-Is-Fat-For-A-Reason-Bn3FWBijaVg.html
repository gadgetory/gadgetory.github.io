smartphone smartphone Spartan remember
the Spartans it's called the power 5 and
I think it's gotta be the biggest
battery smartphone I've ever featured
here on unbox therapy I'm pretty sure I
don't know a week long battery life on a
smartphone 30-plus hours of screen on
time 300 hours of standby time it packs
a thirteen thousand thirteen thousand
milliamp hour battery inside if I ever
have to go out into the wilderness or
something or I have to Sambi apocalypse
takes place I can quickly grab any phone
that's fully charged I could reach for
thirteen thousand milliamp
whenever I see something that to people
like zombie apocalypse the towers are
down the cell towers are down you forget
treasure maps and you have a flashlight
maybe you got an audio book to pass the
time before the zombies approaching it's
also got an 18 by nine screen give me
the resolution Haley do da day left HD
plus 1080p display it's an LCD display I
already know that six gigs of RAM that's
nothing wrong with that I had the
resolution right there will sheesh well
what do you say you want to take over
the video at this point well says no you
got to deal with me okay cool dual rear
camera which what's going on with the
rear cameras the fake bulk effect it's
bogus
we'll see how it performs how much is
this well two hundred and seventy bucks
you think about how many iPhones you
could slam in here you'd have a gimme an
iPhone eight battery size 1800 milliamp
hours so how many iPhone eights is this
device right here let the people know
will it's time for unbox therapy math
class 6 or 7 what are you going with you
know you could do the math it's seven
there are seven iPhone eights inside of
here if you're just doing a one to one
that's bananas
okay haha whoa it is not just a phone
it's a weapon ha oh it has a case on it
by default oh I see that's what the
phone looks like without the case that
is not real leather but there's a little
texture to it you see the camera up
there they give you a free case oh it
has wireless charging that's kind of
nice the fingerprint scanner on the side
of the device where your thumb goes
your unit at the bottom as well as a USB
type-c screen protector in the box
and adapter for audio which is kind of
weird you would assume they could put a
headphone jack in the thing there's got
to be space in there somewhere if
there's also an adapter here from pypes
II to microUSB this could be used I
suppose to charge up other devices right
or transfer data the power 5 powered by
Android app drawer here I mean the icons
seem a little bit bigger it's a stock
experience basically though that's
definitely not the worst we've seen it's
not super bright Jack can probably get a
better idea of it I had low expectations
but pretty decent here's a charging
cable USB type-c ooh various ear tips
very important that you get the right
the sound is firing out of the bottom
here and also out of the back a little
bit you can really muffle it it has no
base to it trying to get to the $270
price point which kind of makes sense I
get that fingerprint here we go they've
put it a little lower than you might
expect not the fastest I've ever seen I
do wish it was a touch faster this is
for people who are gonna be away from a
wall outlet for a while it's heavy to
pocket test actually you know what if
you're used to carrying a big phone
already this is not such a huge jump
things gonna stop a bullet to be honest
honestly even just lying in bed or
something just watching content this is
gonna get heavy what are you gonna say
what are you gonna tell the ladies
either the phone is too heavy your arm
hurts all right now an area I'm a little
concerned with is the camera area ooh
you know what one of the better images
I've seen that's weird I did not expect
this
you see hilly hoo-ha over there it's
pretty good now granted it's got this
dual lens setup which I'm pretty sure
it's fake you look closely at the
secondary lens the thing is not even
properly centered yeah so if you go to
the blur mode which you would assume is
using this secondary lens in some way
you just see this blur slider which is
like that's not how this thing works
it's just garbage to be honest oh that's
vibrant Jack can you see it blammo I
mean that's I mean that's green the
image is not that bad I think it's
taking better photos than the BlackBerry
did I do have to mention right at this
point look at the Wi-Fi signal they're
like when's the last time it dipped to
halfway I think that antenna is hidden
in there deep in the caverns your
reception is gonna be affected ah maybe
a bit better than then I thought it was
gonna be based on the preview obviously
it's not the best but you make your
mental adjustment for the price what are
your options man if you're out there
looking for something with a battery of
this size seven iPhones you'd be
carrying can you imagine how many movies
you can watch on here in an airplane or
something this fingerprint scanner very
convenient location but if your palm is
hitting it and it's failing then when
you go to use it it'll say too many
attempts try again later
and then you're back to your pattern if
it was a button then it would know
immediately if it was an intended input
or not that's 270 bucks this thing is
actually a real 13,000 plus milliamp
hour device I'm glad these type of weird
devices exist because why not start some
conversations with that right well you
go on a date the ladies are like man
that guy's got a big phone this episode
of unbox the repiy has been brought to
you by Marshall and the new major three
bluetooth headphones that feature 30
plus hours of Wireless playtime Jack you
know what that means that means we could
go from here Toronto to Japan and back
on the same charge you've also got other
technologies like aptX for low latency
and better quality Bluetooth
transmission to go along with the 40
millimeter tuned drivers inside of here
inside the box you will see the
headphones in their portable fashion
look at that they are foldable how small
is that also a wired audio cable coiled
if you choose to use them wired you can
alright another unique feature on these
headphones this golden control knob here
which at first looks like a standard
button but actually works in multiple
directions for skipping tracks raising
and lowering volume playing pausing
picking up phone calls and so on so
thanks again to Marshall for supporting
the show if you want to support us go
