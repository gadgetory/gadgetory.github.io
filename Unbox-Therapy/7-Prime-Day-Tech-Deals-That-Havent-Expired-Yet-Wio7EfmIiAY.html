special day for online shoppers that's
because Amazon has a bunch of deals and
they've even extended the window for
many of those deals up to 36 hours from
the point at which Prime Day started now
you're probably watching this video
thinking loo prime day it's been going
on for a little bit but I wanted to
delay my video so that I could make sure
I could glance at the best deals that
were out there and then it hits you guys
with those because of that extended
window that you've now got now I've also
got a few products in front of me that
are exclusive deals with coupon codes so
pay attention but first things first I
want to give a shout out to honor
they're the ones that hit me up and
actually asked to collab on a prime day
deal video and that's because they've
got two devices with some pretty amazing
deals themselves view 10 as well as the
honor 7x the view 10 already at an
affordable price $4.99 goes down to 399
today the 7x at a regular price of 199
goes down to 169 throw it in your car
and you'll see the actual price you're
paying reflected so what do you get with
either of these well the view 10 6 gigs
of RAM and 128 gigs of storage the deal
that I talked about is for either the
black version that I have here or the
blue version you can see the dual camera
set up on the back 5.99 inch display and
they have also maintained the
fingerprint scanner on the front on this
device 20 megapixels and 16 megapixels
USBC connector here and they've opted to
keep the headphone jack and then the
major budget focus the 7x you can see a
similar layout in this case we have the
fingerprint scanner on the back three
gigs of ram and 32 gigabytes of storage
5.9 inch display F HD Plus kinda crazy
you can get this for a hundred and $69
new right now couple of other deals we
have a portable speaker here from Cove
it's called the commuter 4,000 milliamp
hour battery NFC for quick pairing and
water resistance
aha hello there this is touch-sensitive
for skipping tracks tactile volume
control you spin this right here outdoor
mode indoor mode alright so there's
gonna be an exclusive unbox therapy deal
on this speaker you need to reference
the description because the details will
be there they are far too secretive for
me to even say right now check the
description
alright last up we have some headphones
from blue do these have over 700 reviews
on Amazon four stars they're normally 89
bucks which most people seem to think is
a good deal but we have even more
savings a special discount code it's in
the description this video which will
lower this price by another 35 percent
that discount code appears to be working
for other blue teal products as well
check out that graphic on the back auto
pairing pairs to your favorite Bluetooth
devices there's eight driver units in
here two woofers and six tweeters so
gonna create a surround type environment
Bluetooth five Oh a serious carrying
case with these as well little carabiner
now you can see they pulled up pretty
small when not in use all the necessary
controls on the side and well Marv so
they're clicking and you know when you
press them you can see the volume
reacting there Wow lots of bass here if
you're into hip-hop or dance music it's
a sealed ear cup tons of volume go plug
in the discount code and check it out
and remember it probably applies to
other blue tio products too not just
these ones so check that out all right
so I've selected a few more deals on
Amazon for prime day that are running
out pretty soon but I think you should
know about first up this Toshiba 50 inch
4k TV this is two hundred and eighty
nine dollars for a 4k TV so it's a
hundred and ten dollars off if for
whatever reason you need another TV or
you've been avoiding stepping up to 4k I
don't know what the excuse is anymore
280
buff's all you got to do is skip the
fast-food every so often save up a few
of those and look at you got you got
yourself the 4k TV finally it's about
time now for the next product it's the
Google pixel book and I sent out a tweet
recently about how much use this thing
had been getting at my house I have this
laptop at home it's of course
convertible you can flip the screen
around it has touch input it has a
really nice keyboard the hardware is
just it's it's just nice it's something
you want to interact with it's something
you should be interested in and it's on
sale today as well this is the i-5 model
with eight gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of
storage it's for 749 which is two
hundred and forty nine dollars off the
regular price it's a pixel book for 749
okay last product worth mentioning here
the Xbox one s with one terabyte of
storage the starter bundle this thing is
70 bucks off so it's 229 if for whatever
reason you've been holding out on
picking up a console this is a pretty
good savings right here it is the deal
of the day 229 to get a new Xbox alright
there's a couple deals for you for prime
day remember everything is limited all
the details are in the description
I do have to say though Amazon this year
you've done a better job there are
better deals out there than I've seen in
the past or maybe it's the manufacturers
nonetheless you win I win let's go buy
some stuff okay cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
