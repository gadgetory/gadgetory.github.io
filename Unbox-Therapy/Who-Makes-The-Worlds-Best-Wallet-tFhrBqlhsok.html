for any period of time you know that one
of my personal missions in life is
tracking down the ultimate wallet and
this is kind of a funny follow-up video
if you consider what the last video was
which was this idea of this one card to
replace all your cards well for most of
us we don't live in that reality yet so
it got me thinking about wallets in
general and how so many people are
carrying around these giant ones and
then you got a lot of other people who
prefer the slim variant there's a lot of
stuff happening in the world of wallets
that you just might not be familiar with
so in front of me today I've got five
six seven different wallets some of the
coolest wallets that I could find online
I'm gonna hopefully land on what I think
is the coolest best overall best value
so that you can swap out that ugly
traditional fat wallet for something
that's a little bit cooler each one of
these has some sort of unique feature
first off vault skin London I have the
prices over here this one is 25 bucks
making it the most affordable wallet
we're gonna look at today 25 comes in a
few different colors very slim okay
card in here thank you slim RFID stylish
and professional top grain leather so
you have a single pouch on the front
here you insert that into that section
there now you want to get access to it
so you pull this little strap and boom
you're ready to go kaboom pops up ready
to go the idea with this strap is
probably to put your most commonly used
card in that section there your credit
card in there ID over here
so therefore this little strap just is
for the main card listen to that and it
happens to be the cheapest to so there's
got to be some serious points for that
okay I like this for one dollar more you
could get this distill Union wallet now
this is called the wally micro by the
way this is reversible so it has two
sides you can pick your color it's got
this elastic band absolutely tiny gray
on the outside red on the inside you
pack it full of cards and then you pull
that and it come out now this one is not
spring-loaded I don't think I'm a fan of
this one to be honest it swarms around
towards the bottom where you're holding
it not as fluid as the vault skin inch
you can flip this over move the strap
and then have
the red leather on the outside that's
just way more satisfying you have been
defeated wall-e micro very nice
now the other product from just steel
Union in this gray box here is the Wally
sleeve you have a quick access sleeve on
the back and now they said I can have
six in here that's five right there
let's see who I think I'd probably do
like two cards in here this is probably
still the fastest just pulling it out of
the sleeve here that's kind of nice with
two it's probably okay with three this
dangly thing bugs me though compared to
this elastic version all right you're
done - this was 34 bucks so this is even
more money than the vault skin and I'm
still keeping the vault skin at the top
of the food chain for now let's switch
over to these wallets that can hold keys
this in one pocket your phone in the
other pocket you might be golden so I
like that it's not quite the best
looking thing you can put a lot of cards
in there it starts to get a little bit
fat all right I really like what's
happening here and it does have an
advantage over this one again this is
the key clip from lfd this one is on
Kickstarter right now it starts at 45
bucks then this one here this is
expensive this thing is a hundred bucks
we're in a different realm here - lumen
them you might like that it's kind of a
cool look it's obviously very durable
there's not a key installed but it would
work exactly the same way as this bottle
opener slash screwdriver
these are simple Phillips screws you
remove those attach your keys and they
just kind of slide out like this cards
on the other hand they slide in here the
only problem with this is very heavy and
of course expensive if the idea of
putting your keys and wallet together as
one is what you want to do with a
slightly lighter package and with the
leather if it is in your pocket bumping
into other things it's not really going
to Nick them up I'm sticking with this
one or plus these are expensive I want
to keep this one kind of as an honorable
mention it's exciting the idea of no
more keychain I like that now the ridge
wallet this is made out of carbon fiber
which makes it special it also comes
with a really cool screwdriver to adjust
it you don't need the carbon fiber it's
going to be less expensive it starts
around 45 bucks this one's a hundred
bucks so once again premium wallet
territory so the method here is to push
them up part way out like this
then when you pinch the bottom they fan
out so you can reach into the center
pull one out if you want you know what
it's not terrible I don't know though I
don't think I'm sold on this idea it's
just a lot of weight to be carrying
around without a huge upside over just a
traditional sleeve that you could pull
your card out of no thank you I can't go
this route there's no real slick
OneTouch way of getting access to all
the cards this is the real challenger
the question is can the pilot from andar
displace it as the champion here oh look
at that a nice little bag whoo we have a
challenge that so satisfying what they
did here is kind of what I wanted not
strap a whole wallet around the outside
of it making it fatter but instead just
cover what you have in leather to make
it more soft touch they put a single
slot on the outside and then a little
strap there to slide some cash on your
so it might be the ultimate solution
this thing costs 37 bucks as well that's
a pretty good deal so no hesitation I
can put them all in at once and watch
what happens when I hit the switch check
this out
boom see how they're fanned out you can
see them all this card here boom I don't
care who you are I don't care where
you're from that's fast boom and you
feel like a like a secret agent it's
just such a satisfying thing that's the
front card there that's the back card
the most frequently used cards you'll
either keep them at the back or at the
front this wallet is hard to beat that's
another reason to have that if your card
has the tap function keep it in the
outside pouch and boom you're tapping if
I say it's a tie am i cheating it's 12
dollars more but there's a WOW factor
it's just it's not quite as special as
this moment right here you're not even
going to notice this thing in your
pocket it's much more lightweight than
this one but I'll probably carry this
one to be honest it's the best of all of
it I say spend the 37 the pilot it might
be the greatest coolest wallet on the
planet you probably noticed Lou what's
up with the Amazon gift cards in this
video 10 bucks apiece so here you go
are you ready I'll drop a link in the
description to save you some time to
