episode of deal therapy I was asking you
guys on Twitter and on Facebook if you
wanted to see a fresh episode and you
guys responded like crazy you really
liked this show so we're gonna keep it
rolling keep it going but before we get
into today's deals I do want to talk
about a special giveaway that's going on
with myself in conjunction with Intel in
order to celebrate their presence at PAX
East they're going to be giving away in
Ultrabook to be precise it is a lenovo
you 410 so a very awesome prize and it's
really easy to enter all you need to do
is tweet at Intel I will construct a
tweet down below in the description of
this video that has all the details you
need in it in fact all the information
is down in the description but there's a
click to tweet button that will have all
the info in it all you need to do is
click send and then you are entered in
the Ultrabook giveaway so very very
simple the description is your friend as
always and all the deals we're gonna
talk about today are gonna be down there
as well so definitely check that out if
you're interested in winning in Intel
ultrabook okay so let's go ahead and get
into today's deals first and foremost I
know you guys love headphones so we do
have another headphone deal today but
this one is not large over the ear
headphones instead these are in ear
style and they're from clips and they
have a very very high review rating on
Amazon everybody loves them that gets to
triumph they are the image s4 and they
have dropped in price from 80 bucks down
to 43 dollars so you're probably not
gonna want to miss out on this if you're
looking for a portable earphone you know
in-ear style something that's
comfortable with interchangeable tips
and also sounds great you're definitely
gonna want to check out the clip image
s4 next this one's a little bit unusual
for deal therapy but I had to mention it
because the deal is just insanely great
if you are at all interested in getting
a new guitar or your first guitar or you
know you or a tentacle tar all of the
fender strats are on sale right now on
I'm calm for 40% off give or take a
little bit more a little bit less in
some cases some of the us-made strats
you can save as much as $900 off retail
you really need to check out this link
because the savings are pretty much
greater than I've ever seen on
Stratocaster so a really good value in
tons of selection too so hey maybe it's
not you personally that wants a guitar
but if you know anybody you definitely
share the link down below with them
because these things don't go on sale
this much very often the next thing to
mention is a buy one get one free offer
from invisible shield this is available
through a specific the specific link
down below which will take you straight
to their website and it's pretty much
exactly as it sounds if you want to buy
an invisible shield for your iPhone or
Android device or anything like that you
can get an extra one for free
after you check out as you guys know
invisible shield is an incredibly
durable material that you wrap on your
device keeps it safe you can hit it with
a hammer but an incredibly tough surface
to add to your device without adding a
ton of bulk so definitely check out
their buy one get one free happening
over at zag complet the specific link is
down below next this is kind of a funny
one this is just to mix it up a little
bit not exactly a deal but I was
checking over on vat19 which is kind of
like thinkgeek it's a site where you
could you know buy some pretty crazy
insane things sort of geek like things
but anyways I found a bandit guns rubber
band shotgun pump action with a 10 shot
capacity this thing looks pretty insane
actually there's a lot of cool stuff to
look at over at vat19 so definitely
click that link down below and go check
out this monstrosity next is a monitor
this is actually from jnr and it's an HP
monitor it's called the 23 X I and I was
I was checking it out because it's
actually an IPS panel and if you guys
know you know about productivity
monitors then you know IPS is the way to
go you get incredible viewing angles
color uniformity so it's an IPS panel is
a great price it's a 23 inch display for
169 that's down from 229 so if you need
new panel for some productivity
definitely check that out I think
they've also got a deal on the twenty
one and a half inch model so both of
those are worth checking out at the link
down below
that's from J&amp;amp;R next I've got to deal
for people in the UK you guys were
screaming at me in the last video saying
Lou we need more international deals so
I have a deal
for those of you in England or the UK
and it's on the Logitech MX performance
Mouse which as most of you know is
pretty much my favorite Mouse been using
it for as long as it's been out still
use it every single day you've got a ton
of buttons you've got incredible
precision the battery life is not the
best but I'm definitely willing to trade
that off for my favorite Mouse in the
world essentially anyways you can get it
at the UK Amazon right now
for 49 pounds it normally retails at 89
so it's almost half price which is
really a great deal obviously here it
can go as high as a hundred bucks
so anyways 49 pounds is is pretty decent
for in my opinion the best Mouse in the
world check out the link below next I
have a deal for people in Canada too got
to show the Canadian folks some love and
this is on amazon.ca and it is for a
transcend 32 gigabyte class 10 SD cards
so lots of storage if you're looking for
a new SD card I've used transcend in the
past and I've only had good experiences
and this is available for $26 the list
price is 64 so it's time of storage for
only 26 bucks this is for those of you
in Canada like myself so check out that
link the next is via Best Buy and this
is on a product that very rarely goes on
sale it's the 13 inch macbook pro base
model macbook pro and as you guys know
margins are very slim on apple products
so you can't ever really save all that
much but in this case you can get the
base model macbook pro for one thousand
seventy four dollars which is a savings
of 125 so if you're in the market for a
macbook hey saving something is better
than saving nothing so 125 dollars off
at the link to Best Buy down in the
description now the last item is sort of
a new thing that I'll be adding to the
deal therapy segments here on unbox
therapy
this is like a WTF or a ridiculously
priced item you can actually get a 4k
television right now in stock on Amazon
it's from LG ultra-high definition 240
Hertz I'm not gonna tell you the price
because it's good yeah you know it's
really not gonna be fun to know but it
is $1000 off right now so maybe that can
give you a little bit of a clue but that
link is at the very bottom of the
description so go and have some pain in
your brain when you find out how much an
84-inch ultra-hd that's what they're
calling it Ultra HD 4k television is I
know I want one don't have the budget
right now maybe soon probably not all
right guys
