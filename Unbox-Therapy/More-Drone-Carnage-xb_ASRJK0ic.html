another video and today we are looking
at another drone another small little
drone you may remember the video I
posted recently of this tiny little fit
in your palm size drone this one's a
little bit bigger than that it also has
an application that comes along with it
that you install on your phone iOS
Android or Windows Phone it has a camera
built into it so it's just a little bit
more advanced so this is the rolling
spider from parrot mini-drone
it can be used inside and outside it has
a range of 20 meters or 66 feet you
could do flips and as I mentioned before
it has smartphone control and it all
uses low power consumption Bluetooth
which is good but you're still not going
to get a ton of battery life on
something like this it's actually only
about eight minutes but the truth is
that's still enough time to have a fair
bit of fun with it and you can get extra
batteries and just keep them on deck
this is very stable as you'd expect it
has a number of different sensors that
keep it floating perfectly so here it is
not huge by any means still sort of fits
into my hand as you can see so we've got
an ultrasonic sensor as well as a 3-axis
gyroscope and accelerometer there's also
a camera here a little tiny camera
capable of taking fairly low resolution
pictures a USB cable micro USB to be
exact a little bit of paperwork don't
need that the rechargeable battery and
it takes about 90 minutes to recharge
these
now these are interesting how do these
this thing actually has wheels well it
can actually do a little driving too I
mean you could just have these things on
sort of to protect it when I first saw
these that's what I imagined flying this
thing indoors there are a number of
different obstacles things to run into
people to run into hopefully not where
do they install I missed a piece oh I
need this professional unboxer I think
not I talked all this big game anyway
this clips on and these crazy-looking
wheels go on the side here so it's going
to be pretty hard to mess up your
propellers or
kill anybody with these installed so
let's go ahead and insert the
here we have lights on the eyes now
because he's got like these orange
headlights and a pretty mean looking
face which I like let's live dangerously
let's try it without the wheels at first
the app is called free flight 3 as
mentioned it works on iOS Android and
even Windows Phone how about that some
Windows Phone love oh yeah ok we're
going to lying flat
he needs to be lied flat apparently then
launch the app free flight 3
disconnecting look at this we got all
the way to 87% and then we froze what oh
my god had to start again thanks a bunch
I'm sorry to say this but I have a funny
feeling that if we were on iOS right now
this thing would already be flying
sending file okay so people hate to
break it to you but once again it looks
like at least at this point that iOS has
gotten more love on the app side we are
connected and we're actually sending
over the firmware update iOS love from
manufacturers not a new thing
they love their iOS like that right
their connection you guys need to know
this kind of stuff this is real life
right here on unbox therapy Remini me me
me me yes green eyes Wow it connects on
iOS so fast hoochie-mama here we go what
what why did it well we have our first
durability test look at this we can set
a max altitude so there's various
piloting modes here speed settings
you
so the way the controls operate the left
hand side is is controlling your
altitudes and the sort of spin axis of
the drone and then on the right you put
your thumb and then you've engaged the
accelerometer in the phone as you tip
down it'll move forward pull back it'll
go backwards even though I've set
maximum altitude at 2.5 meters it still
sort of obviously 2.5 meters it still
jumps up in the beginning so I can't
even really launch it from the table so
now I move down to the floor and I'm
attempting to sort of fly it into frame
here
I blew it
I blew it for a bit
oh ho oh yeah
go easy on the microphone dude
right underneath the mic Oh still though
I had it in the zone man
drones are so much fun I'm a triangle
I'm gonna land it Milland it right here
little spin
flute does that account chopped up the
microphone a little bit
that's drone carnage right there whoa
I feel like me sitting there was messing
with its sensors a little bit
low battery alert
oh the little battery alert yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
