to you by ting what's up guys Lew here
and I wanted to make a quick update
video because tonight at midnight black
ops 2 is dropping and I'm gonna be there
with all the coverage you guys want to
see so to get it started I'm gonna be
picking up a care package edition that's
the top of the line Edition that you can
get for black ops 2 has a number of very
exciting things included so I'll be
unboxing that version and I'm also gonna
be giving one away
that's right there'll be a care package
giveaway right here on unbox therapy so
if you haven't subscribed yet do that
now and definitely smash that thumbs up
button down below if you're excited
about your opportunity to win a care
package and they're not cheap they're
actually getting marked up price-wise
right now because they sold out the next
thing I'll be doing is also unboxing the
hardened edition so that way you guys
can get a better look at the two
editions comparatively and decide maybe
if you haven't bought one yet which
version is gonna be better for you so
that's gonna be happening tonight after
midnight but the very first video I'll
post is of the actual event because
these kinds of midnight launches can get
pretty crazy when I was out for the
modern warfare 3 launch it there were
some pushing and shoving and it made for
some good entertainment so I'll be
vlogging I'll bring out my little
point-and-shoot camera and I'll upload
that stuff as soon as I can I know you
guys like to look at that stuff and it
ends up being kind of fun to do a little
bit of logging every once in a while so
anyways that pretty much wraps up this
update stick around subscribe if you
haven't yet and hit that thumbs up
button down below and I'll see you guys
very soon after midnight right around
midnight
alright thanks as always for watching
and check out this message from the
sponsor ting is a new mobile phone
service provider offering up major
savings over the other guys chances are
if you're currently operating a cell
phone or smartphone you could save a few
bucks by moving over to ting now the way
they can deliver this value is by giving
you exactly what you need that means
delivering the number of minutes
messages and megabytes suitable for you
you never pay for extras that you don't
use and if you happen to use a little
bit more data minutes etc than you had
expected to you just get bumped up to
next tier so you're not gonna get hit
with those crazy overage fees that end
up doubling or tripling your bill Tings
online Account Manager is one of the
most beautiful I've ever seen and I say
this because of how simple it is the
same cannot be said for a lot of their
competitors you get to see what you used
and what you're paying for in a simple
method if you guys head over right now
to unbox therapy ting calm you're
actually gonna get $50 off of a device
purchase and they've got some beauties
over there including the galaxy s3 which
would probably be my choice within their
inventory anyway guys one more time it's
unbox therapy ting calm</div></body></html>
