another video and today I'm gonna blow
your minds
I've got speakers here with dancing
water fountains inside why I gotta be
honest with you have no idea I stared at
it for awhile I said there's no way
these things sound any good but dancing
water in the studio was just too
compelling to pass up so these are the
sound Sol six watt musical speakers from
the fabulous water dance speakers this
is a monumental occasion Jack I hope you
appreciate it for what it is they work
off USB the USB powered you see here you
cook up a smartphone laptop or otherwise
obviously there's a big ambient
component here maybe you're trying to
show a lady friend
just how established you are like some
Michael Douglas type character she comes
over you've got a pool table
it's a white pool table maybe you're
drinking some champagne champagne yeah
let's look at this peak Oh easy ban holy
there's water all I see is a little bit
of water inside now that I didn't know
was I gonna have to add it's not much
water though is it actually water whole
thing looks weird right now okay there's
one there's two ah
what a fun day this is oh look it's mini
USB remember the other day I was what
take what uses mini US mini USB see some
other cables here a mini jack that's the
one I think I want to use okay I think I
need USB power give me a second
oh those things are juicing right away
you thought you knew the world of tech
you thought it was all about the latest
smartphone let me tell you something
things are happening beneath the surface
in the sewers of Gotham the sewers are
ninja turtles what does it have to do
with Gotham
they were always eating pizza those
turtles should we play some music oh my
water here please normal what a weird
combination who's that that's what I
need go back to the drawing board see
things are not good enough I need more
water
take the lights
so motional right now I'm gone right now
take it the light nothing says romance
like loitering your speaker my alley I
don't know these are weird but I like
weird I mean the best-sounding no hell

people going to say what is up with
those things hell yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
