looked at these various devices that
changed the dynamic of the camera that
exists on your phone now usually a lot
of these they come out for the iPhone
but I haven't at this point seen any for
the new iPhone 7 7 plus because of
course it has this unusual dual camera
setup so a lot of those older
accessories aren't really going to work
then I spotted this one on Amazon from a
company called camera seller and they
say it's the world's first dual optics
lens solution for iPhone 7 plus now if
you're unfamiliar with these type of
cases the whole reason they exist is to
give you the ability to zoom in to get a
macro effect using your phone's camera
you can see an example of that there and
then to allow you also to just do a
standard zoom like a telephoto and then
a fisheye effect if you want a super
crazy wide-angle kind of like the one
I'm used to speaking to you guys through
right here that's you that's me look at
that the fisheye effect on this device
is probably going to be even wider and
how about the design on there what is
that it's like a little pixelated kind
of thing going on huge logo not a big
fan of that but otherwise I mean this
this right here looks pretty cool
now it's rubber on the outside and then
it's a hard plastic on the back there's
protection for the volume buttons it
looks like now the lenses are in here I
guess so the macro zoom lens and the
fisheye and telephoto lens so if I pop
this open look at that
you can see right there this is a
fisheye and that's the telephoto I
assume and then this guy slides in like
that when you're using slide it up boom
snap a photo
now here's macro and zoom this one's a
little bit more flat so I don't know
maybe you could keep that one on I think
we should give it a shot I want to start
with the fisheye and telephoto and we'll
see what a wide-angle view of this
shooting space looks like you guys
haven't actually seen the back end of
the shooting place right now it's kind
of well it's mayhem let's be honest here
whoa
major fisheye happening on here Jack say
hi to the camera
boom and then I'm going to do a
telephoto looks like I said this over
there macro lens I'll take this photo
and then I'll show you with the
wide-angle just how different those two
frames are Wow we've actually got you
can kind of see the edge of the lens
around the outside so if you were using
this for video you would still have to
crop in a bit in post now if I go ahead
and zoom in boom fish eyes to zoom so it
kind of like it kind of accentuates the
features of the dual lens system on its
own because of course with this case off
if I slide these down you still have
your zoom which moves to the other other
lens but it's less substantial so it's
less of an impact now where things yet
possibly even more interesting is with
this macro stuff to get crazy close
focus now that's something that your
camera can't do with all nevermind
accentuating so if I pull out this other
device here whoa
wow that's pretty wild
now if I switch over to the other lens
oh my goodness it goes in even oh wow
that is tiny fun
what am i watch here let's see here Wow
okay so I want to get smaller stuff over
here
I got blades of Steel upcoming videos
blades of Steel the classic now just rip
that up on the on the very bottom here
you have really fine print
now let's you have to if I come with
this now it not only picks up that but
every little pixel underneath it what is
that decisive I don't know the tip of
crayola marker maybe we should get a
coin or something for the coin let's try
and get a shot of that oh look at the
table this is a table even look like
that to you from your camp I mean holy
smokes
that's wild that's probably one of the
nicest macro adapters I've tried on and
I don't know if it has to do just with
the adapter or the fact that I haven't
used an adapter with the iphone 7 camera
yet seven plus to be exact
let's say you carry this one around on
the case you've got four different
cameras right now a macro a Mac
and of course your standard wide and
your standard zoo when these are small
enough to carry around - I think this
thing is a win right here now I don't
know if it's the only one that's out for
the seven plus I don't know how much it
is I'll link it down in the description
I can't remember but if you are
smartphone photographer and your goal is
to maybe have a little more creativity
while using your seven-plus this is
definitely a way to do that camera don't
forget the name</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
