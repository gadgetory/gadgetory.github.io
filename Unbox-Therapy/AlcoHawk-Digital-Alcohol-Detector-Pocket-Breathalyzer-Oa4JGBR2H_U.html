therapy and I have an unusual unboxing
for you guys today this is the alcohol
which is a pocket breathalyzer for
determining how much alcohol is in your
system very cool it's something that
I've always wanted I picked it up as
part of a bigger order from
thinkgeek.com and it's gonna be
hilarious to use with my buddies and my
family over the holiday season here in
fact I've got a special holiday edition
of the Beast feed planned with some of
my friends so if you haven't subscribed
to the Beast feed Channel that's my
second channel I'm gonna put a link up
here in the annotations as well as down
in the description you've got to do so
it's going to be hilarious
anyways let's talk about the
breathalyzer actually a pretty simple
device one-button operation and it fits
in your pocket it runs off two double-a
batteries and here's what it looks like
there's a little bit of paperwork also
included here because you do need to
know how to use this thing it's it's not
exactly as as easy as you might think in
fact you've got to wait 20 minutes for
example in between any kind of
consumption whether it be alcohol
smoking eating anything like that to get
an accurate reading you have to take 20
minutes off of all of that otherwise
it's going to contaminate the sensor and
you're gonna require recalibration and
all that bullcrap so you have to follow
these instructions in order to get the
best reading and an accurate reading out
of this breathalyzer
you also get three tips that's because
you want to give each person their own
fresh tip you can obviously wash those
and reuse them later but while you're
using it you don't want people using the
same tip because that's going to affect
their own personal readings so this
little part pops up on the side here you
go ahead and install your tip on top of
that and as I mentioned before you can
pull this on and off and replace it with
the other ones when somebody else wants
to use it now it does take two double-a
batteries as I mentioned and
unfortunately they did not include them
so you've got to go and track down some
of your own which I just did and the
magic of video editing if the batteries
are installed so it's a one-button
operation you click this button it
counts down from 60 all the way to zero
don't ask me why I suppose
it's getting ready setting itself up and
then after it gets through the countdown
you'll get a solid red light that's how
you know it's time to blow so in my case
I mean you have to you have to basically
blow into it for about five to ten
seconds it'll beep again and then it'll
give you a reading and as you might
imagine I'm completely sober this is a
sober unboxing of a breathalyzer whether
or not that will be the case on my
season's greetings version of the B's
feed well that's a different story
but anyways as you guys can tell this is
a obviously not my usual unboxing this
is a little bit of fun well you know you
want to mix it up every once in a while
keep keep you guys on your toes you
never know what to expect on unbox
therapy anyways if you enjoyed this
content hopefully you can like and
favorite this video and as I said
earlier you have to come over to the B's
feed this breathalyzer is going to play
an integral part in a project I'm
putting together for the beast feed my
second channel over these holidays if
you want to come have a laugh please do
subscribe to that channel click in front
of your face or down in the description
and come and do it alright I'll see you
guys over there okay later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
