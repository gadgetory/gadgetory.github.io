therapy calm now I know I've been out of
commission for a few days here but
that's just because I've been down and
out with a bit of a head cold finally
getting back into action here and I know
I'm a little bit behind the 3ds case
giveaway and did a few days ago and I
still haven't announced the winner so
now that I'm healthy that's the very
first thing I want to do and without
further ado the lucky YouTube user who's
gonna take home this aluminum 3ds case
is user gamer sunny so I'm gonna put the
name right up here but I'll say it one
more time the winner is gamer sunny and
for the rest of you guys thanks for
entering I'm gonna have a lot more
giveaways coming right up so stay tuned
for those and one more thing I want to
talk about before the next video is I
recently set up a Facebook user group
for unbox therapy for anybody who wants
to get their updates that way and we
could use a few more likes so if you go
over to unbox therapy comm and the
right-hand side right over here I've got
the unbox therapy on Facebook box here
and if you go ahead and click that
little like button there then you're
gonna get updates every time a new
article comes up or a new video comes up
so it's gonna be a real cool way to keep
in touch as well as letting your friends
know just how much you're into unbox
therapy because who the hell shouldn't
be anyway guys thanks for listening to
me I got more content on the way like I
said now that I'm healthy I'm gonna be
