another video and today we're gonna
we're gonna do something strange you
know I receive boxes here at unbox
therapy and I don't always know what is
in them these my friends are real-life
counter-strike knives what what do you
meet what so this company here I believe
they're called elemental knives am I
right about that I'm gonna link them in
the description you could check them out
real-life interpretations of the knives
that you use in the game
this is video games come to life so what
we're gonna do is inspect these babies
and see just how crazy videogame knives
look in real life now also inside the
box was this little slip here you can
see with a special code for some csgo
skins so yeah you want to follow these
instructions if you're the fastest to
redeem this some free stuff first one of
the day now obviously this is a slightly
different video than usual but I'm kind
of pumped full disclosure I'm not a
counter-strike player myself so you guys
are gonna know a lot more about these
than I do
oh whoa it's kind of like a rainbow
thing going on Wow now my feeling on
these things is I mean they're they're
mostly commemorative right like these
are collectors type things that said I
mean holy smokes this thing is legit you
happen to get attacked by a bear or
something while you're playing Counter
Strike reach for the real deal oh
there's something else I did not know
that this guy has a legit folder open
that baby up
who get me the box
combat training for years that's what
I'm box therapy has truly been about
it's all a ploy to practice my knife
skills on cardboard boxes think about it
boom pocketable I guess flip style knife
oh man oh oh these are crazy look at
that this guy like the tiger situation
in the gold it has a clip on it as well
so you could put it on a belt so we got
a little pouch here as well let's see
how this guy goes in there you go
sweet okay man these are sharp as well I
like this one this one has you know this
piece of steel goes across the entirety
of the knife this is like from a
durability perspective a very solid long
lasting idea here this guy up here's for
what like fur for skinning something I
think this these are like legit hunting
knives this hole is just the biggest one
this could get wild you guys got a vote
down below which one was your favorite
this is the Rambo knife right here I
mean you're like almost in the sword
territory at this point here that is a
combat knife right there again a crazy
pattern on that this if you need
something like this you're a pretty
serious dude Sylvester Stallone special
right there all right maybe something
more practical here okay so we got
another flip style with that like
rainbow pattern reflective a lot of
different colors represented in there
that's really cool
whoa Jack that's not mean you can't feel
comfortable right now oh my god that
looks dangerous
Wow in this case it just has a hard
shell and some cord here oh that is that
might be the perfect unboxing look at
that
classic combat look here you know look
at check out that spider-man pattern on
there that one feels really comfortable
as well oh yeah another kind of hook
style going on different color pattern
Wow what do you think about that right
there okay super gruesome looking I'll
probably use it on watermelon myself I'm
a peaceful guy the last one perfection
oh it's another Rambo joint with a
different paint job on it I mean come on
this is still the one for me I can see
the hardcore csgo players getting amped
about this knife collectors what can I
say
thanks to Elemental knives very cool you
know who you are you're the man rang</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
