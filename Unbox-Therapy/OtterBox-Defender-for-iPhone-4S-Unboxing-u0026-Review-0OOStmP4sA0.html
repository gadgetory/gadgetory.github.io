therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Defender Series case from OtterBox
and this is for your iPhone 4 or 4s it's
available in a number of different
colors I've got the black one here and
actually I'm really impressed with
OtterBox products up until this point I
previously unboxed their iPad 2 case I
believe it was called the reflex series
I can't remember the name for certain
but I'll put a link in the annotations
as well as in the description so you can
go check out that unboxing if you
haven't seen it yet but the reason I'm
impressed is because of how tough the
material is the ruggedized sort of resin
material that is mostly what this case
is constructed of - the external
rubberized silicone like shell the real
magic happens internally but first let's
talk about the exterior portion there
says this is a three part system you've
got this rubberized silicone like finish
but it's much thicker than what you're
used to in terms of say a silicone skin
and then on the interior side you've got
this front portion that covers the front
of your iPhone of course and it even has
a built in screen protector for you know
stopping scratches and whatnot from
occurring now the interesting part here
is I've already got a screen protector
installed on my phone I'm gonna see if
it'll work with both now this is the
back side of the case you have a nice
soft material here including a cutout
for the Apple logo up here and then
another cutout for your camera as well
as flash the camera cutout has no
plastic cover over it which makes sense
considering it has to function with that
flash whereas the Apple logo cutout does
now here is the infamous pink iPhone you
may remember from other videos it's
featuring the brixon
color shield which I also unboxed and
featured a little while ago on the
channel and as I said before that's
already a screen protector and then the
outer box brings another screen
protector to the party and I was amazed
to find out that it functions perfectly
even with two screen protectors so this
is probably overkill if you decide to go
with the OtterBox permanently then
you're not gonna need two screen
protectors but for the sake of this
video I just wanted to show you guys
that it does work installation is
actually pretty easy you take the two
internal components and clip them
together there are
Eclipse one on each side of the body and
then one on the top side and after
that's done it's pretty much secured
within this enclosure the only part that
you are left to do is wrap the silicone
rubberized external portion around this
portion and boom you've got the finished
product now you've got a very generous
cutout along top for your forward facing
camera your earpiece as well as your
sensor so you're not gonna have to worry
about having any sort of issues with
those phone components and as I
mentioned before you've got a built-in
screen protector so you won't need to
bring your own to the party unless you
really want to and you're super paranoid
and then on the side of the case you've
got access via this little flap to your
vibrate switch and you've also got your
fully covered volume up and down buttons
but you still get a little bit of
tactile feedback the bottom of the case
leaves enough room for both your
microphone and speaker and you've got a
really robust sort of cover for your
dock connector fully covering it up so
you're not gonna get any debris or
anything like that up in there anything
that you don't want so here's a look at
the back of the case and as I mentioned
before you've got cutouts for both the
Apple logo as well as the camera and
flash so you know everything up there is
gonna function correctly along the top
of the case you've got a fully protected
hold switch and then you've got access
as well to your microphone and if you
flip this tab here up you'll get access
to your headphone jack you've even got a
little crevice here which makes it
easier to flip that portion up which is
important because you know you're gonna
be using this particular aspect of the
case fairly often when you're inserting
headsets etc now this case also includes
a bail clip if anybody uses those
anymore but it is one of the better bail
clips that I've ever seen holsters
whatever you want to call them it's got
a ratcheting style clip and it
definitely feels like it's not gonna pop
off by accident it's made out of the
same rugged sort of resin material that
the interior portion of the Defender
Series case is made out of so you know
it's gonna be just as tough now here's
the key how does it hold up two drops
and bumps and whatnot well let me tell
you something I'm fairly confident in it
just sort of testing it out here these
aren't huge drops just a couple
feet but I'm actually more worried about
the table than I have about tea hi phone
there was some nice big bangs no dents
or anything but anyway guys as you can
tell I'm pretty impressed with this
product I'm gonna use it and find out if
it's gonna be a daily driver or not but
anyways until next time I want to thank

giveaway that's gonna be coming up a
real soon as soon as I get some things
sorted out and definitely stay tuned to
