they're calling it a three-in-one
and it's kind of in the name the HP
elite x3 so when they reached out he
said hey we think you're the right guy
to check it out to see if it's the next
cool thing I said send it over I'm
trying always uncover that next thing
you you might not have known about
including the idea of a three-in-one
there's a phone component there's a
desktop component in a laptop or in this
case laptop and what HP is aiming to do
with this x3 is to eliminate all three
of those and replace them with one so in
front of me here I have the x3 and
desktop combo over here on the left is
the x3 right here as you can see when
this connects to the dock all of a
sudden you can have a desktop style
computing experience so the audio on
this device is done by the legend over
at Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen on the bottom here
there's a USB C style connector we of
course have our various buttons on the
side here there is a headphone jack the
cameras on the rear and there is a rear
fingerprint scanner as well
got a forward facing camera but there's
also an iris scanner maybe listen you
want to take the security to a
completely different level you want to
be in the future it's time for that
retina scan check it out so your choice
dual sim or sim card as well as SD
expansion options are good there's a
gasket and that's important because this
device is actually water-resistant ip67
rating also inside the box here is the
dock and this thing is testing on the x3
goes ahead and sit down on there your
power port your wired Ethernet jack
there's a display port a couple of USB 3
ports that are also capable of charging
other devices at high speed and then
over here is a USB C type connector as
well USB C to a standard USB cable they
did give us a pretty nice
actually a power brick keep it all
juiced up there's some adapters included
for the dock if you happen to have a
case on your x3 and it's a slightly
wider stance on there there is a port to
keep it locked you can lock this down so
that it's secure all right so I've got
the foam booted up as you can tell but
for me this is really where it comes to
life in this kind of environment this is
what sets it apart from different
devices that are out there since it's
running Windows when you connect it to
this dock right here all of a sudden
your various peripherals become
available to you and you can use this
device in a more desktop PC light
experience I'll show you what that's
like put this in here now I'm connected
with DisplayPort here and keep in mind
the dock itself has a couple of USB s as
well as a USB C on itself you can
connect other peripherals to the dock
now I have a keyboard and mouse
connected these ones are Wireless so
they're connected over Bluetooth
but if these were wired USB devices
they'd work just as well going straight
into the dock so you'll see I move
around here just like a desktop style
interface and if I scroll through maybe
open up a web browser here so here we
have a full web browser you see I've got
unbox therapy the unbox therapy YouTube
page loaded up so whether it's
consumption or creation it should have
you covered you could come down here
open a Word document for example and now
to really get down to business typing
something hopefully as important as this
is obviously if you've got a longer form
document having more screen real estate
is going to make you more productive so
what you can do here is as you'll see I
just move around just like the mouse
yeah it works like a touchpad if you've
ever used a touchpad on a laptop before
that's essentially how this operates now
some of you guys might not know this but
I'm not in the studio all the time I'm
not sitting here in this cozy
environment sometimes I like to get out
into the wilderness sometimes I like to
work for most
but you can also do a wireless dock to
something called the laptop which is a
more traditional laptop style form
factor going to be useful on airplanes
potentially in coffee shop got a
keyboard a display and once again the
brains are always inside the main x3
unit so there you have it the elite x3 a
super ambitious device aiming to
eliminate the need for a number of
different devices in your ecosystem a
desktop a laptop and of course a phone
you can start a book on your phone and
finish it on your desktop or you can
start a movie at home and then finish it
on your phone it goes where you go x3
continuum the future
watch this I'm out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
