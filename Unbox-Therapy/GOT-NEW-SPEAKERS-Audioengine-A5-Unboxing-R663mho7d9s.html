video I would like to remind everyone of
a little something called quarterly I
spoke about this on a previous video
regarding the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one
because I will be picking one lucky
quarterly subscriber to actually win one
of those consoles in conjunction with
the quarterly package I'll be sending
out to every single subscriber if you're
unfamiliar go back and watch the
original video I'll put a link in the
description but the reason for this
update is because the deadline is fast
approaching I believe it's happening on
the 11th you can ask me for sure on
twitter i'm at unbox therapy but you
have to subscribe very soon there are a
limited number of spots that are left up
to break it down very simply it's a box
i send to you with some of my selections
in it a little personalized letter and
some other things so you basically are
subscribing to products from me and on
top of that like I said one lucky person
is also going to win a gaming console it
trust me it's a good value I already
know what's going to be in this
particular package it's taken a little
while I apologize for that but this is
our first one so we just really wanted
to get it right so if you're already a
subscriber the package is coming soon if
you're not a subscriber yet a limited
number of spots still available a link
down in the description don't miss out
let's get into today's video what's up
guys Lew here and today we're going to
take a closer look at the audio engine 5
plus my brand new speakers for my
simplified setup as you can tell the box
is kind of large it hardly fits into the
frame right here but I picked these
speakers for a couple of different
reasons one of which is the fact that
they're powered they don't require a
separate amplifier and I am going for a
very minimalistic set up in my new sort
of home office space behind me which I
will be showing you guys shortly I'm
also going to connect my brand-new
turntable so anyways let's go ahead and
jump inside the box I'm going to switch
to camera B to give you guys a better
perspective because we're a little bit
cramped in here so let's jump to that
camera and get moving on this so from
the top of the box you can see some of
the specifications over here on the
left-hand side so you've got two
speakers one of them is powered I don't
know why they list it like that anyways
the amp is in the left speaker which
then powers the right speaker I guess
that's the accurate way of saying it so
they aren't both
powered one is which then powers the
other there's a remote control speaker
wire detachable power cord mini jack
audio cable which is 2 meters RCA audio
cable which is also 2 meters a
microfiber speaker bag micro fiber cable
bag set-up guide and a product brochure
so let's go ahead and open this up a lot
of people ask about my knife that's
something that I've been getting a ton
of questions about I will try and find
it and link it down in the description
though I'm not sure if they make it
anymore if it's still available I'll try
my best to find it but it is a very cool
knife and I've actually got a couple of
other cool knifes on order so if you
guys are interested in seeing some of my
knife collection then leave a thumbs up
down below but that's not what this
video is about this video is about my
brand new speakers which I am super
excited for I've been dealing with
headphones for a long time and a lot of
people sort of agree that mixing on
headphones is ok but there can be after
a certain amount of time there can be
some fatigue that occurs when using
headphones and sometimes you can get a
more accurate mix and you can also a be
test to figure out how things are going
to sound when you're mixing them not
just on headphones but also on a set of
speakers and you know that's that's sort
of one of the rules of mixing anyways
power cable inside of course kind of
important
a little microfiber bag over here which
is the first one to open up this feels
like more cables okay so we have
standard RCA cable 4 analog audio a
standard mini jack cable nice and long
one as well so this is going to go from
your portable media player computer
laptop etc into the speaker's directly
as I said remember they are powered and
then we have some speaker wire which I
assume is to connect speaker B to
speaker a it's nice that they come in a
little organizational bag
alright let's pull out some of this foam
here this is probably going to be pretty
heavy whoa
so here they are I'm gonna get a few
woes in this unboxing as well guys
and now that I've started doing them
live you're getting a lot more of my
reaction in there which didn't really
carry over to the voice-over after the
fact because there is excitement
whenever you get anything new although
I'm sure you guys are aware of that okay
so I decided to go with the white ones
as you may or may not be able to tell
just pull this out real quick
I'm just going to put this to the side
for a moment get the other items out of
the box first this is the user manual
and guide as well as the little tiny
remote which I'll pull out okay
might as well open this right now so
it's a little you know portable remote
there's a little nighttime button I
don't know that's for maybe it's backlit
we'll have to wait and see it's soft
touch plastic convenient volume mute
straightforward stuff and then the other
speaker all right let's get this box out
of the way before we continue did I
forget something a giant bag of silica
gel do not eat throw away you heard it
here first
okay so speaker time so they come in
these really cool microfiber bags pull
this out and I got the glossy white
finish which again I'm just trying to
have a minimalist set up and so the idea
here is to have them not really take up
as much visual space as a big giant set
of black speakers since my walls are
white in my setup over there they'll
kind of just blend into the background
and you'll just see the central portions
these are really nice actually heavy too
it's a nice cabinet and then on the back
you can see you have your connection
points here these are for the speaker
cable as I mentioned earlier from
speaker to speaker be the the next
speaker is a more interesting one
because it has all of your connections
on it let's go ahead and open this one
up once again a really nice microfiber
bag and this one I can feel the amp on
the back already
okay and piece of tape I noticed also
they have mounting points on the bottom
if you want to mount them so if you have
I guess speaker stands or maybe you have
I don't know it looks like almost like a
tripod screen you can probably mount
these on a tripod if you really wanted
to so I'm not sure why you would okay so
there is speaker number two right away
you'll notice a difference on the front
there are two lights as well as a volume
knob and then the interesting part is on
the back where you will find all of your
connection points so we have an input
for a mini jack connector that's this
cable here so that'll go from you know
your portable media player or your
laptop that uses mini Jack's straight
into here again no amplifier needed in
between a USB power which is cool so if
you're using you know an iPod or
something that you want to leave
connected and powered all the time you
can plug it into there or maybe you just
want to charge and play at the same time
from your phone tablet etc we have our
input for RCA s right and left there's
an output as well you can send the
source to somewhere else that's pretty
cool okay and then the speaker
connections on this speaker here which
we'll send out to the right speaker so
left speaker to right figure because the
amp as you can tell is built-in to this
one power switch a voltage selector and
then your power connector for the power
cable I like the fact that they built
the power brick into the actual unit
instead of having it outboard which is a
little bit of an annoyance sometimes so
all right I'm gonna just flip the back
over this one actually sits a little bit
flatter so you can see the front a
little better but you've got a Kevlar
woofer here I don't know how big that is
I think it's five inches hence the name
five I believe so I've heard these
before at least I heard the previous
generation and they were really really
impressive with a fair amount of low end
which is something that I look for I
listened to a lot
bass-heavy music but also you can add a
subwoofer at a later date if you want
even more bass the subwoofer kit comes
in white and black as well and will
obviously improve the amount of low-end
which would also sort of help these in a
multimedia environment if you wanted to
hook them up to your TV or something
like that alright guys so that wraps up
the unboxing portion of this video the
next step is of course to get them
connected to some audio sources and test
them out since my setup is not a hundred
percent ready and I still have to do an
unboxing video for the record player
that I purchased it's a project audio
record player which I'm really excited
for as well I guess the sound test will
be up coming very shortly I apologize
for not fitting it into this video right
here but I really have nothing set up
right now so stay tuned for the vinyl LP
player unboxing which is coming up
shortly and then of course my updated
mini little minimalistic setup tour
which is going to happen in the space
right behind me a lot of people have
already seen a preview of it by checking
me out on Instagram if you aren't
following me there it's a great way to
see what I'm working on when I'm not
making videos or the stuff in between
videos I guess I will link my Instagram
down in the description but my name is
unbox therapy and as you can see in my
Instagram photos of my setup the whole
goal here is to build a set up that is
minimal that there are only items there
that I absolutely need and want because
I've had some very cluttered setups in
the past and they just get complicated
and convoluted and there's too many ways
of achieving the same thing so I'm
looking for items to add to it that will
have that minimalistic appeal and it'll
be easy to keep it tidy and just to keep
a clear frame of mind while working
there because a lot of these setups can
get crazy and intense and 200 monitors
okay that's a bit extreme but you know
you can you can get crazy with it and
never stop and ask hey is this really
becoming more productive for me or am I
just adding stuff for the sake of it so
this the goal of this setup is complete
minimalism and I can't wait to show you
guys as soon as I get these hooked up as
well as a sound test on these so make
