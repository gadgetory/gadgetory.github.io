gentlemen boys and girls it's the new 38
inch ultra wide 38 inches diagonal it's
like a giant TV on your desk but with
the proper resolution and viewing angles
and everything it's an IPS display this
guy here now supports USB type-c as well
as Bluetooth audio now the resolution is
a little bit different than the ultra
wise I've shown you in the past instead
of being 1440 pixels high it's now 1600
pixels high against 3840 in the other
direction am I right about that 3840 yes
I am what does this mean for you it
means more work space a bigger monitor
holy smokes it barely fits in here let's
get it out of the box so we can take a
closer look now you know what it's gonna
be crazy if I try to put three of these
things on my desk like I did with the 34
inch version here you go Jack Chico
now for the main attraction wow that's
big that's a big boy who had some big
that is a big monitor
upstream USBC connector that's what's
new to female USB 1.5 and charge ports
there's a service port here headphone
jack DC in two HDMI and a display port
in so lots of opportunity to interface
ooh slick goes in here all that is
convenient little switch lifts up out
and then this guy here is thumb screws
interface like this and you just screw
that in and really that's like a two
minute job Wow oh and can come up
probably a four foot desk right here and
this thing takes up the majority of it
now we obviously need to get this thing
booted up before chops my head up oh
sweet they've included cables Wow did
not expect that so you have a display
port cable a USB C cable an HDMI cable a
USB C to regular USB or old-school USB
this thing is insane in all the right
ways whoa oh oh holy you don't really
even have to say much about that when
you see that happen enough said
let the monitor do the talking you put
this on your desk
god knows what you're capable of so what
you're looking at up here is some drone
footage in 4k spread across this
magnificent monitor helping you to
appreciate the color representation the
contrast and so on the viewing angles
this is kind of a good array of that
very bright sky whoa easy there Lou with
the USB see that's now included transfer
your video that way and then use it as a
single cable to interface with all of
your other stuff it's like a workstation
for your laptop all in one place and
just to spice it up a little bit before
I take off I know you're looking at this
you're salivating so LG
you covered they're going to give away
15 of these to some of you and then one
grand prize of a $10,000 work station
set up all the details will be found in
the description so look at that some
love for the audience</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
