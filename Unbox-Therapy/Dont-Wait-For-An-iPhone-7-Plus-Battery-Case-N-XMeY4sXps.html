nuts iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus you know
about them
they've been tough to avoid but they are
brand new and that means that the world
of accessories for those products has
not necessarily developed yet in the
battery case market place Apple they
have their own you know the humpback of
Notre Dame you saw it with the 6s it's
pretty much the same for the seven but
other manufacturers they don't have
their new versions yet I bet if I look
around if I take a peek on Amazon I
might find something that works I
recently switched over to the iPhone 7
plus got it right over here you see like
with the matte black finish and whatnot
but I was like every soft and I like to
slip a battery case on there can you
ever have enough juice when you're
thirsty in the desert the absence of an
actual battery case for the 7 plus I
started to snoop around and what I
realize is the vast majority of cases
for the 6 and 6s plus wouldn't work on
this one because the camera cutout
wasn't suitable maybe just maybe does a
product on the market that could
accommodate the 7 plus potentially an
older 6s plus or 6 product with a bigger
cutout then I found this the moko 4000
milliamp hour battery case essentially
what you're looking at here is a case
designed for the 6 and 6s plus with 4000
milliamp hours of battery life but the
thing that caught my attention
specifically with this one is the fact
that it has a really large cutout on it
can you see that 7 plus it's got the
totally different camera design this
might be your go to now something to
remember here there are a few
differences not just in width here but
also in height USB cable inside two
frames it's got an audio jack with a
with a adapter obviously not going to
need that on the 7 plus but that
shouldn't harm you at all so here's the
design here soft touch kind of material
a battery indicator on the back a
lightning connector and you can see the
speakers get re routed here so that's
kind of a cool bonus because now you're
holding it like this of course as you
know on the 7 plus you've got audio
coming
out of the earpiece location now and the
bottom ones will essentially refire this
way so now it's like two forward facing
speakers that's an added bonus and
there's a different frame to I don't
know maybe you want to go clear on the
front and black on the back so the
moment of truth
so that part comes off the frame this
will slide in here push it down and
money in the bank as I suspected fits in
there like a glove fit the front part on
here doesn't actually increase the
thickness all that much buttons work as
you'd expect are we going to get the
nice charge going to hold down the power
button for bars if you look up in the
top corner right there it's charging up
just like that
four thousand extra milliamp hours for
the seven plus no need to sit around and
wait for third-party manufacturers to
put out ones that have seven plus on the
title just pick up one of these designs
for the 6s plus and you're operational
now I will say on the bottom here you
still have this cutout for the headphone
which obviously you will not be using
now for sound I want to give you a quick
test on that I think that's the audio
actually gets a nice little improvement
here
it's actually a little bit deeper it's a
nice little touch so there you go don't
waste your time waiting around for a
seven plus battery case pick up
something like this and get moving
straightaway if you're a power user you
want ultimate battery life I got you
covered
I did it so you don't have to links will
be in the description thank you thank
you</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
