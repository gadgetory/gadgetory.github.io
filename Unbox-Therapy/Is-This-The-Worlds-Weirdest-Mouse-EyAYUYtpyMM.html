another video and today I've got
something that I've never seen before
this company contour they reached out
and he said Lou we've got a completely
different kind of Mouse it's called the
roller mouse redd+ I was like what do
you mean I looked at it I'm like that
doesn't that's a mouse what do you mean
here I said send it to me allow me to
determine if this thing is revolutionary
in any kind of way apparently some
people are really into this thing look
at this on the back it sits at the
bottom of your keyboard and you're like
you're rolling around
who knows maybe you're one of these
carpal tunnel people maybe you're
looking for the future of how you might
Mouse around and maybe this is it nice
unboxing so foo this thing looks
high-tech screws that's comfy though oh
very smooth actually and this guy slides
across here as well your buttons and a
scroll wheel copy paste and a button
here for cursor speed what are the
screws for ah if you want to mount it to
a keyboard tray that's cool this part
here is removable the padding
those are keyboard risers ah so
depending on the thickness of your
keyboard you'll use a slightly different
riser I've got the desk keyboard here ah
that fits in easily okay I get it
so now right I totally forgot that this
keyboard has this ruler on the back I
totally forgot about that for this
keyboard I think the long riser is
actually better these two clip together
short riser long riser action this is
going to be better yes
now listen around clickety clack the
roller bar provides two functions
pressing down performs a left click
moving it side to side
performs cursor movement you're the best
around none
I'm gonna keep it down whoa weird I
don't think I really like clicking on I
think I'd rather just click on this
thing who is Jack they had one son Jack
intern Jack married noe the
deeply religious couple produced six
children holy
give a full of and
the twins deep and s ch ITT
does that mean I can say it okay so you
got the scroll right that's functioning
well you know given the amount of time
I've used it here I'm feel like I'm
already starting to get the hang of it
and from an ergonomic perspective it's
like kind of a cool spot for my hands
urban dictionary behaving British do you
know what that is the act of doing
something you know you'll regret
immediately after I mean I like having
the dedicated copy and paste buttons
kind of feel like you're on a keyboard
trying to process the fact that you're
like your keyboard is here and your
mouse is here it's growing on me a
little bit the more I do here you know
what airplane mode means this is when
someone cuts themselves off from the
world not logging into Facebook or
checking their cell phone this occurs
after a breakup or a rough work week and
you know what's cool about it is that
you can use two hands you know if you
search unbox therapy the next suggested
after unbox therapy is unbox therapy
Jack this is for somebody who is
dedicated to their ergonomic s' some
people they've got this carpal tunnel
they're there they're there they're
messed up there is something satisfying
about it I will give it that other
environments where you don't have a
mousing surface the racing simulator
where you can just have something on
your lap and you don't need to be
mousing because it's all right here it's
officially the weirdest Mouse I've ever
tried if you got aching arms and wrists
and God knows what else this might be
the solution to your problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
