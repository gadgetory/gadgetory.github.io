box from the folks at Dyson they claimed
to have the next innovative thing in
vacuuming but this one is obviously
different you can tell from the box and
the scale of it whoo
26 Dyson 360 I to enter the u.s. 26 we
could we if we could've done better
where's number 126 is pretty good I'm
just we are looking at a robotic vacuum
this is the start of a new and hopefully
fantastic journey into the world of
robotic servants oh oh you're making a
statement with this guy rolling around
your house the 360 i right on the top
here it has a 360-degree camera looking
peeking around your space drawing out a
map a path for how to efficiently clean
up your mess and I know you got one
there is this incredible intelligence
internally using complex mathematics to
map that all out is the thing gonna suck
up dart crumbs chips popcorn 78,000 rpm
the motor is spinning at 78 thousand rpm
holy smokes
carbon fiber filaments I mean these guys
they kind of make a vacuum look like a
sports car like when you look at that
jack on the front there look at that
serious piece of machinery whoa it's
like a mini tank look at that it says
tank tracks I mean who really wants to
vacuum if a robot can do it for you am i
right well we have a very sleek looking
power supply what is this how does this
work oh it's a little charge station so
that fits up against the wall there and
your little guy oh so this plugs into
the wall the Dyson sees it he just
scoots over here sits down grabs himself
some juice
and it gets back to work unbelievable
from the app I'm assuming you can
schedule meaning days contact points on
the bottom of it right on their little
touch that I really like the power cable
can go on either side why don't more
companies do that hit this button here
and I have the app over here on my
device whoa easy boy
it sees me on GT jump to the table I
would not go long
there you go tough guy let's see what
you got tough guy
oh this is in seed cuz this table if he
dips off the edge of this table he's
gone he's a goner
oh I feel so satisfied for it when it
grabs a chunk of dirt like well done
well done buddy what can I say about
this little guy
I put him in a tough position here
impending doom on the other side of each
edge and without a doubt it was able to
stop and see that it was gonna fall off
a robotic vacuum are you kidding me if I
was like 13 years old and my mom is like
hey vacuum downstairs again I'm like you
know I'm I'm saving my lunch money I'm
putting the Dyson down so what do you
think about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
