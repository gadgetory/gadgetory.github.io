the latest episode of deal therapy you
guys continue to tell me how much you
love this show I was talking to some
people earlier on Twitter and you said
yes do another deal therapy today so
we're back and the title deal the
biggest one my favorite one today is
actually on some Ram some laptop Ram so
you can upgrade the memory on your
laptop to 8 gigabytes I know a lot of
people are still running for gigs that
can be a little bit tough when you get
into more resource intensive tasks video
editing video games for that matter so
you can get an 8 gig upgrade kit from
crucial
this is ddr3 at 1600 megahertz and it's
35 percent off today so it's gonna be
about 58 bucks after that discount if
you check that out at the first link
below everything I talked about today
will be outlined down below as usual
next we have a site wide promotion
happening at Griffin Technology it's 15%
off the entire site if you haven't heard
of this brand before they make a number
of popular accessories for iPhones iPads
there's also things like headphones in
fact they just put out some new wooden
inspired headphones they're called the
wood tones and you should definitely
check those out but they've also got
something called the elevator laptop
stand
that's the stand I'm using over on my
desk that my MacBook Pro sits on so it
will elevate your laptop up to a height
where it sort of matches up better with
your external monitor if you use one but
on top of that it'll also have help to
cool the laptop since the surface is not
right on your desk its elevated a little
bit so that's the second link down below
you will need to use a coupon code in
order to get that 15% off site-wide the
code is Griffin saves 15 but once again
that will be listed down in the
description and it's good until the 30th
of this month April one thing to mention
is that a lot of these are limited time
deals so make sure that you don't waste
too much time going to check them out
every single one is different and I
can't necessarily isolate each one and
tell you when it will expire so just
remember this stuff is time
pending next we have a camera deal up to
200 bucks off of all of the Sony NEX
cameras on Amazon if you're unfamiliar
with the NEX lineup
it fits somewhere between a
point-and-shoot and a digital SLR that
means they have interchangeable lenses
but the form factor is somewhere closer
to a portable camera so if you're sort
of in between to two worlds you know pro
camera gear and consumer camera gear a
Sony NEX series camera might work
perfectly for you if you want to save a
little bit of money there 200 bucks off
or up to 200 bucks off pretty much every
model in the entire lineup you can check
that out at the link below too this
deals a little bit more unusual but I do
like to mix it up from time to time
throw in some things that we don't
normally talk about so over on busted
tees they're having a promo and I
believe this one is 24 hours only but
there's four regular price t-shirts
available for 44 bucks these shirts
normally go for 20 bucks a pop so
instead you're getting four for 44 and
usually when I buy t-shirts I like to
buy a few of them to save of course on
shipping get them all at once this is a
good way to do that some of my favorites
on the site the duck hunter shirt
the control-freak shirt and the Yoda
Mouse don't make me explain this one
sometimes that's just like weird
okay all right take it easy
next this is a program I haven't seen
before on Amazon there's a $20 bonus
$20 money bonus after you trading $20
worth of games so at first I was like
wait a minute Amane sent to you $20 for
$20 worth of games no that's not what
they mean if you trade in your games
your used video games to Amazon and you
reach $20 in values so if they use games
equal $20 not only will they give you
the $20 they're also going to give you
20 extra so essentially you're getting
double what you normally get right now
for trading and video games on Amazon
I've never done it before this is my
first time seeing it I think it's a
pretty cool thing they've got going on I
know a lot of you guys probably have old
games you don't play anymore so
definitely check out that link if you're
interested in that bonus offer once
again that is a limited time offer next
is another slightly unusual and we'll
save the unusual ones for the end or
towards the end of the videos I don't go
scaring anybody this is 43 percent off
of a horse mask yeah all right you know
the the classic famous horse mask that
you see people trolling other people
wearing yeah that mask is cheaper than
it's ever been before
I think it's $17 43 percent off I don't
know this thing just looks like a ton of
fun you have to check out this link so
you know you can prank people or troll
people I don't know do whatever the hell
people do with horse masks maybe you put
it in someone's bed like The Godfather
and they wake up and there's a horse
mask oh I don't know don't do anything
too sick with it it ain't my fault
whatever you do with it is not my fault
all right next we have a deal
from Hostgator if you haven't heard of
them before they are a place where you
can register domains and they can host
your website for you you get 25% off

coupon code site coupon 25 you guys know

next we have a UK deal everybody's
nagging me about international deals or
deals that exist besides those that are
in the United States so the UK deal is
on a pair of Phillips head phones and I
really like the style on these things a
lot of people don't know but Phillips
has had a great track record for value
in headphones so like you know anything
sort of under $100 you're getting a
really nice cost of performance ratio
and these ones are pretty cool looking
they're a newer model the SHL 5001 and
they are 60% off so these normally
retail for 40 pounds and they're on sale
for 15
you have to check these out they might
may or may not be your style but check
out the link below to save a bunch of
money on what I think are stylish set of
headphones of course style is subjective
thing lastly we have a Canada deal I
didn't want to leave Canada out of
course got a rep the homeland
so for Canadians there's a deal on
Amazon on the OtterBox Defender for the
iPad Mini so if you got an iPad Mini and
you're rugged with it you know you want
to take it with you everywhere that you

protect it you guys know I've tested the
