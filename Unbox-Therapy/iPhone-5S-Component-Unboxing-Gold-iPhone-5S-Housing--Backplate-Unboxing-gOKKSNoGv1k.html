special piece of content for you it is
midnight right now I am tired but this
is too important to pass up this is an
unboxing video of the new iPhone 5s Gold
Edition backplate slash housing whatever
it is you want to call it so we can
finally get a better look at what you
expect in this rumored Gold Edition I
want to give a big shout out to the
folks over at iPod uplink for sending in
this footage they said hey Lou you've
got to upload this you've got to show
your fans what's going on because this
is obviously a very rare component so go
check out their channel if you haven't
yet they've actually got a little bit
more coverage on this particular
backplate as well as a scratch test
seeing how it stacks up against the
black or white version so anyways
definitely go over there and check this
out check that out anyways about this
particular video here the only
difference you can expect to get from
the traditional iPhone 5 at least in
terms of form factor and design is a
slightly different cut out around the
flash the shape is ever so slightly
different otherwise you're just talking
about finish you're just talking about
color and preference so this brings me
to my question for you guys
seeing is how it looks fairly likely
that we're going to see a gold slash
champagne version of the iPhone in the
next model is that interesting to you
will you pick that color or will you
pick the traditional black or white let
me know down in the comments which color
you would most like to see in the next
iPhone or not seed but by if you
actually pick one up I guess that wraps
up this video there's not much else to
see you can trust then I will have an
unboxing video of the official product
as soon as it's commercially available
right here on the channel so if you
haven't subscribed yet now is a great
time to do so in a quick little secret
for you there will very likely be an
iPhone 5s giveaway right here as well so
if you don't want to miss that
that is one more reason to subscribe and
stay up to date on my videos thanks for
watching guys leave a thumbs up down
below and I will catch you on the next
episode have a good night I'm gonna go
get some sleep now alright later
you</div></body></html>
