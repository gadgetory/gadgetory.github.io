saw the previous video you see many
videos on the new devices from Samsung
as 10s 10 plus they're out there and
they're they're kind of interesting to
be honest but something that struck me
just using these things a little more
extensively over the course of the day
here is how different Samsung software
is now via this brand-new one UI that
they're using of course I have a long
history with Samsung skins on top of the
Android operating system what used to be
called TouchWiz at one time I was never
a big fan of it it always felt kind of
bolted on kind of half-baked this is
it's a breath of fresh air I felt the
need to jump back on here call me crazy
but I'm starting to think this might
actually be the first skin that I want
to use maybe even more than stock and am
I saying this right now is this me I've
never said that before but let me give
you a quick rundown okay so the best
part of this one UI is when you swipe
down from the top so that looks pretty
normal
but when you pull down the second time
that's where things get really exciting
you pull down and pull down again and
everything that you would normally have
to reach up to access is right here
for one-handed use now that's kind of
nice to have on the s10 but it's even
nicer to have on the s10 Plus which
let's be honest that's a pretty big
phone they went to the drawing board
here and they're like well what should
it be like for one-handed use and that's
the simplest best implementation I've
ever seen secondary swipe to bring
everything back down into reach if you
do head into the settings you'll see it
exists even within there now you're
probably noticing another thing which I
really like about one UI which is of
course this really cool-looking dark
mode on the right-hand side so this is
the s10 plus over here I've already
enabled dark mode on there they're
calling it night mode as you can see
right here and I'm a big fan of these in
general if you're using your device in a
dark environment it's it's far less
obnoxious you're not getting
beamed with nearly as much light it's
just more comfortable to use and its
covert take a look at it now another
thing that's happened here is in in
terms of the icons and whatnot
normally I'm a bit critical because the
icons there a bit cartoonish not
necessarily my style but I'm starting to
understand that having these larger
icons also lends itself to one-handed
usage in this particular case you don't
need to be as precise and you can just
go ahead and reach more of it the
fingerprint scanner and the face on love
Samsung is doing something very special
with the fingerprint scanner in these
two devices these guys are using
ultrasonic they're actually using sound
waves to judge the distance between
ridges on your fingerprint it's it's
kind of amazing when you first hear it
now in practice it doesn't work all that
differently from any other in display
fingerprint scanner I mean the speed I
was trying to check is it faster slower
than the optical based ones I think it's
about the same but the advantage of this
particular technology is it's tougher to
fool because it does actually look for
blood flow that's like the superhero
villian scenario they chop your finger
off get access destroy the world and so
on not gonna happen on this particular
device Kirk okay you can you can rest
easy alright if they chop your finger
off it's no good to them there's no
blood flow ultrasonic also supposedly
this is gonna function better with a
fingerprint that might be a little bit
dirty or wet whatever it I don't know
what you're involved in alright I don't
tell you how to live your life or what
you doing with your fingertips alright I
stay out of that department but if if
you're in a
certain kind of business maybe this is
better if your hands are dirty if your
fingertips it works eight supposedly
works better it does feel a bit slower
when you're coming straight from here
you see what I mean with the black
screen but if you do hit the switch here
you get a better sense for how fast it
is I'd say it's comparable to the
optical scanners but it does seem like
slightly more robust tech now let's go
ahead and register the face unlock as
well I'd like to show you guys how that
works so it does give you a warning on
the facial recognition it tells you that
this is not completely secure it's not
the most secure form of authentication
but I do want to show you the setup
process here on the regular s10 so you
see what you're in for
it's very fast one thing that kind of
bugs me it's a two-step thing similar to
the iPhone I'll show you what I mean
here okay hit the button it sees you
phone is unlocked and then you swipe up
on the oneplus device for example which
just has a you know strictly has a photo
based face on lock you just hit the
switch boom it unlocks immediately now
some people may like that some people
maybe not maybe it's easier to hack one
thing I do like about this
implementation if you look up here you
look closely at the front-facing camera
cutout there's that cool animation that
pops up again letting you know it was
activated it worked and then you go
ahead and unlock otherwise if it doesn't
see you you hit it with the thumbprint
and you're in it's usable it works and
you have the face unlock option which is
also baked in there another cool thing
in here they have added the wireless
power share I think this is a it's a fun
feature wireless power share tap that on
place this device against any other
device that has Qi compatibility and
like check this out okay so we're gonna
line them up Kirk
keep an eye up there on the icon okay
ready I'm gonna go ahead and initiate it
and just like that you get the you get
the sound notification as well as the
visual notification you're now charging
up this device from this device
now there is another glaring
user-interface slash Hardware aspect to
this device I know a lot of people gonna
have questions about that is of course
the dedicated bixby button to dinner
yeah I know we talked about in the past
it it strikes fear into tech fans around
the globe I know I have nightmares about
the Bigsby button and and what it really
wants to do to me anyhow apparently
apparently apparently does this make
sense in this context not really
apparently in a software update that
button is going to become completely
configurable by you it will be able to
launch any application that you like
imagine that a dedicated button that you
get to configure I think it's a good
move on Samsung's behalf and I'm
starting to see a lot of things that I
kind of like about this device it's
crazy I can't believe I'm saying it but
to be honest I just I played with the
one you eye situation just for a moment
you throw on the dark mode you get the
one-handed functionality it's quick you
can go in there and actually turn down
animations now yes absence letting you
do that this is the same company that
gave you TouchWiz what are we doing here
are we looking to them now for software
iteration for software improvement it's
kind of amazing and I think it's gonna
be one of the differentiating factors
with this particular device as I said in
the last video I'm gonna use this a
little bit more but I felt the need to
just do a little highlight here on the
one UI
some promising things happening with
this device outside of strictly the
hardware the software seems to have
taken a step in the right direction and
that's a good thing
for tech fans around the world also once
the Bigsby thing happens you could be
done with those nightmares you can start
even Otis is having Bixby nightmares
they're gonna they're gonna finally
they're gonna finally let us remap the
Bigsby button it can launch any app that
we want this button here that look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
