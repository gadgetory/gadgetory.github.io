this device right here kind of iconic at
this point iconic for the wrong reasons
it feels like a weapon it probably could
be a weapon in fact almost everybody who
commented on this particular smartphone
viewed it as a disappointment this of
course is the red hydrogen smartphone
that's a company with credibility in the
camera space delivering
professional-grade video
cinema cameras but no experience here
not with smartphones so when they said
they were gonna make a smartphone a lot
of people got really excited they were
like well this could be the smartphone
with the best camera for example I went
out and I pre-order not this model but
the more expensive titanium version I've
actually got it it finally showed up now
this thing was delayed but read did
something kind of cool while people were
waiting for their titanium versions they
sent over a free aluminum version in the
meantime while you were waiting that's
cool this one is thirteen hundred bucks
right now
sixteen hundred dollars u.s. I thought
it would make sense to unbox this and do
a quick comparison visually speaking I
don't know of another titanium
smartphone on planet earth but this also
offers up an opportunity to kind of talk
a little bit about Reds future in the
smartphone game and some suggestions I
have but first things first let's check
this out
it's kind of cool-looking oof it's heavy
much like the other one it's a rugged
weapon like looking thing not a claim to
fame here is the 3d functionality but as
we all know I mean that kind of it
didn't pan out didn't catch fire as far
as TVs were concerned with that feature
it didn't catch fire with the Nintendo
device you remember the 3d S
construction though it's like cyborg
future carbon fiber titanium it's all
the buzzwords I mean this is probably
what you would be using in the
post-apocalyptic cyberpunk future you
can see we got these pins here on the
bottom a lot of promise there with
modules and accessories and so on none
of which we've seen yet but that just
highlights how
complicated and difficult it is to get
into the smartphone market and to keep
up with the times the smartphone
marketplace moving so fast
I don't know how customers feel who
pre-ordered this because it's hard to be
mad because you got this free phone but
then in general the way that the device
was accepted by people I didn't read a
single review or watch a single video
from a customer or from a tech channel
that was like this is the one this is
what you need this device is definitely
not concerned with screen to body ratio
you kind of had to search and hunt for a
reason for this thing to exist because
it wasn't the best at the thing you had
hoped it would be the best at and that
of course is the camera unit not good
everything is very blurry glasses list
3d capable display there's a novelty
factor associated with showing off that
type of content watching it yourself for
the first time second time kind of 3d
but not very far it's not like out here
it's just like a little bit away from
the display it's super hard - what do I
even I mean I can't imagine carrying
this thing eventually you're just like I
just want to see my content the way that
I expect some relatively large speaker
units on it so it can deliver some
decent sound still not the best that I
actually heard on any device
I'm a bit disappointed myself I had some
high expectations for this phone and I
definitely didn't expect to be sitting
here talking about just receiving the
titanium version maybe the smartphone
itself the smartphone form factor is the
wrong place
for red to innovate this brand very
popular in the professional camera space
the problem though with red cameras is
that they're big they're gigantic
and and that's good for what they do but
it leaves a gap you know there's a gap
somewhere between the smartphone and the
huge professional camera that's where I
think red should be playing that's where
I think they could innovate if red had a
compact pocket Cinema Camera with a
touchscreen on the back that ran Android
so you could share from it immediately
so you could get better quality stuff
that could then interface immediately
with social media YouTube and the other
things that you do on Android that could
be compelling interchangeable lenses on
a device like that could be compelling a
bigger sensor than expected on a device
like that could be compelling some of
the things that held back those previous
Samsung Android based cameras was the
fact that they just were bad cameras
that so happened to have Android slapped
onto him but what about a good camera
what about a red camera with an Android
back and then red caliber sensors and so
on on the front end so here's my advice
to red kill this product I don't see it
happening I don't see this picking up
steam I don't know who this is for I'm a
kid named plenty of cameras that are
better than this one of course the pixel
the latest Samsung and so on that
marketplace is moving too quickly but
you could create this whole new
marketplace somewhere between where
you're at with the pro cameras and the
smart phone itself that hybrid product
that could be cool
