therapy and I got a real exciting one in
front of you to end out this unboxing
marathon this is the ear force Delta
from Turtle Beach it is a modern warfare
3 branded headset very similar I
believed the older px5 headset obviously
that one didn't ship in such a cool
package with the cool branding but I did
unbox it if you haven't seen that
unboxing I'm gonna put a link down in
the description as well as up in the
annotation so you can compare them for
yourselves and check out the differences
internally I think they're identical but
I'm not 100% positive on that this is a
wireless gaming headset it'll work with
Xbox 360 and ps3 but it is not cheap my
friends sometimes you guys ask me about
the price these ones are $2.99 at least
at the moment that may change there may
be some different deals coming about
coming up to the holidays here so you
have to wait and see but what's special
about these is that they ship in this
Pelican like case so you can bring them
with you if you game elsewhere at your
relatives at your friends or you just
have this thing on your shelf in case
you want to store them this way but that
they'd be pretty hard to use like that
check out my rusty pliers that's right
I'm usually using a real nice knife to
unbox but this thing has zip ties with
no slack that you can't get off so it's
the perfect time to pull out the old
rusty pliers am i right anyways it's a
very beautiful unboxing experience you
have to admit that they've shipped it
and packaged it real nice and you got to
give them props right I mean this ain't
no cardboard box inside you've got the
headset some batteries some different
cables and accessories to get this
entire thing up and running as I
mentioned before it'll work with either
xbox 360 or the PlayStation Network so
you have versatility that way if you're
a multi console kind of guy and about
being a multi console person let me tell
you there's no need for the hatred
there's no need for Xbox sucks ps3 sucks
they're both cool if you can afford it
get them both otherwise who cares no
need to hate so the first thing in the
unboxing is this USB 2 power cable these
things will actually
juice via USB very cool you've also got
a USB to mini-usb included for even
greater versatility and then beneath
that you've got your batteries since
these are a wireless headset they will
require batteries you could replace
these with some rechargeable ones that
would probably be more economical you've
also got the adapter of course for Xbox
LIVE this is going to hook into your
remote control your control not your
remote seeing a television and allow for
wireless transmission it has an LED to
indicate whether you're transmitting and
you've also got an inline remote here
with mini jack connector on it this
inline remote is going to control your
volume your chat volume via this wheel
and it'll also allow you to mute or turn
on your mic and it also includes an
optical cable it's nice to see they've
included absolutely everything you might
need the optical cable is used for
transmission of digital information
which is what will allow for your 7.1
surround sound emulation unlike a
standard analog cable so here is your
transmitter this is what's going to send
the audio out to your headset and
there's a number of different options
for connecting to it what's special
about this one over the px5 that I
previously unbox is it feels a little
bit more rugged the paint job you've got
your headphone jack on the front your
volume knob as well as your Dolby bypass
in the event that you want to bypass
that processing this one has obviously
got some special branding the
turtlebeach branding down here as well
as the logo here done up in this cool
green color you can see it's Dolby
Digital through and through up top
you've got digital in and out you've got
line in for analog if that's all you've
got you've got a line in volume here as
well for adjustment DC in and your power
switch is on the back as well now let's
get a look at the headset afterall this
is what it's all about as you can see
the boom is incredibly adjustable one of
my favourite booms you can really stick
it any way you want and you've also got
the rotating ear cups if you want to
have one off and one on if you're trying
to carry a conversation on with somebody
in the room now I'm going to take you
guys for a tour around the headset
you've got the turtlebeach low
go on the right year cup along with the
power button now I'm going to show you
just how malleable this boom mic is I
mean you can really stick it in any
position that you so desire it's one of
the most adjustable I've ever seen and
you've got the call of duty branding
along top on the headband which is
nicely padded and stitched and all the
parts that would normally be sort of a
vinyl or leatherette are done in mesh
and I actually like that because it
means they're going to breathe better
and that's important for long gaming
sessions which I'm sure you guys know
all about now this controls everywhere
on these things you've got USB in you've
got your xbox live and you have a preset
button a game volume wheel and on the
other ear Cup you've got bluetooth
volume which is this rocker switch a
bluetooth MF B button mic mute and a
main button you can configure these
things in a number of different ways and
like I said earlier I unbox the px5
which I believe are the same internally
so check that video out for a little bit
more information again the links down in
the description so the reason that these
are special as we all know is because
they are Call of Duty branded and
because of that you're going to get a
little bit of Call of Duty swag in here
modern warfare 3 material this is that
same stopt pamphlet that didn't stop me
when I unboxed the PX fives you've got a
turtlebeach sticker here engineered for
gamers of course it is this is a gaming
headset after all you have a preset
sheet a little cheat sheet which is
important because these things do take a
little work to set up a nice glossy
substantial manual no one-page trifold
situation and you actually even get a
DLC code to get some special modern
warfare 3 material if you want to do
that via turtle beach's website so
anyway guys this is obviously a very
expensive headset at $2.99 it's not
going to be for everyone if you're a
major fan of the Call of Duty series
it'll probably be for you I've had
trouble finding the PX 5s for sale
anywhere so it seems like these have
replaced them and at a higher price
point so if you're going to bike this
bullet then you're going to have to
really want them right I mean it's
expensive for a headset it's more than
the console for Christ's sake anyway
