opee today we've got the canon EF 24
millimeter f1 point 4 l lens this is a
full frame lens and for anyone familiar
with canon you'll realize that the l
designation refers to canons top of the
range lens products first thing that
greets us when we enter the box is our
warranty card and something to mention
about canons warranty is that it covers
you in both the US and Canada
in contrast Nikon's warranty will only
cover you in the country where the lens
or camera was originally purchased next
we've got a software disc which is
unusual to see in fact I can't remember
receiving a software disc with any of my
lenses in the past I assume it is some
sort of lens utility we'll have to find
out once I pop it in the computer
next we've got our lens pouch and there
are a few extras included when you
purchase an L lens for example this
pouch is one of them the other is the
lens hood and frankly speaking when you
invest this kind of money in a piece of
glass the least the manufacturer could
do is include a pouch and and a lens
hood not a significant investment for
them to include a couple of extras the
pouch feels like it's made out of
genuine leather and the upper portion
feels like a suede material not sure if
it actually is or not
this pouch is probably not going to get
used very often I keep my lenses in a
studio environment most of the time next
we've got the hood itself and it's a
fairly standard looking hood one thing
that I do notice is the interior portion
of the hood is textured which is a
slightly different finish than I'm used
to
with Nikon hoods Nikon hoods at least in
my experience have a smooth interior
lastly we've got the lens itself and the
very first thing I notice is the weight
it's not a light lens by any means not
that you'd expect it to be considering
it's an L lens the construction is
almost entirely
this is a weather sealed lens and the
only plastic components I seem to see
are the cap and maybe the af/mf switch
let's get a closer look at the lens
now with the cap off we can see the
internal glass elements and we can
really get a print appreciation for the
aperture size we've also got an
oversized focus ring which is really
tight feels nice we also see the
ultrasonic designation which refers to
the ultra quiet internal autofocus motor
here is our autofocus switch which will
obviously switch between autofocus and
manual focus and as we look at the front
of the lens we see we have a 77
millimeter filter size as we pull the
back cap off we can see just how much
glass is on the inside of this lens this
is just a massive piece of glass and
when I take the front cap off you can
really get an appreciation for the
amount of light that can travel through
it lastly we're going to take a look at
the lens hood when mounted on the lens
itself
check out our channel we've got a lot
more to unbox and we'd love you to be a
part of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
