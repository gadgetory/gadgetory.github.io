box that I wasn't expecting from a
company called do G do g ug UG the boogy
boogy s8 we want to talk about the new
phone cult do g x70 say it a few times
it's very entertaining rewarding do G s9
t expand more possibility you see how
enticing that is but I really don't know
much about this phone like I said I did
not order it it just showed up at the
door let's crack this open and see what
we've got
so first things first a little envelope
here it's a puzzle let me open this up
real quick oh there was something on the
other side not what I expected to be
doing right now okay I mean it's just
another picture little anticlimactic
let's find out for ourselves enough with
the fun and games and puzzles and look
at that okay cool
it's a tank it's another one of these
beasts machines it's solid and this is
the magical part right here this is
apparently how this thing is going to
interface with these various accessories
check out the front what is it telling
us ip68 wireless charging SIM card tray
volume up and down power go on custom
tee I like that and look it's identified
with some texture as well that's your
sim your SIM card tray you don't need a
tool for it six point one eight inch
screen Helio p6 d octa-core processor
you can see the camera units assuming
that they're both fully functioning
okay so 5050 milliamp hour battery but
that brings me to our very first
accessory this unit right here now this
apparently clips onto the back of this
device and it will give you another five
thousand milliamp hours I don't know if
Jack can see that also USB type-c to
recharge this so that's a nice little
touch let's see how this goes
whoa okay whoo that's a statement that's
aggressive but it's 10,000 milliamp
hours now so you're just you're living
life and what are the youngsters say
living your best
I'm living my best life right now doing
my best life right now let's see what
this looks like in a pocket well that's
a little something isn't it Jack got a
little something for you got a little
something for you in there
who's carrying that I don't know you got
to be a park ranger that's it
that's the only guy
the life of a park ranger is something I
feel like you know more people should
consider it's probably a really peaceful
like a kind of will could do it will
could do it I can't remember for sure
just what it was it made me decide to
become a Forester I'm sure Park Rangers
do a lot more than pick up trash you
know hey it's dry season be careful with
that fire that you're building keep in
mind this thing still has wireless
charging and they've included a wireless
charger here this is where things really
kick off I mean look at that first off
that's giving jack some reminders of
Space Odyssey right there that's how I'm
sorry Dave I'm afraid I can't do that
Will's telling me this is night vision
well are you going to stand by that but
this is gonna give me night vision
legitimate amazing military-grade
night-vision also in the package
this little guy with this that attaches
to it look at this setup now this is a
setup that's gonna work for Kirk usually
he could pull this off right here
you've now turned your device also into
a walkie talkie okay let's check out
this night vision thing is this real is
well lying to us again maybe we should
give them some more specs while this is
going on six gigabytes of RAM Jackson
foots on the table so you boot it up and
the first thing it does is ask you to
assign the custom key one click could
take a screen shot open a flashlight
start a sound recording open SOS don't
make me say it Kirk Park rings your baby
and then you can set up other
functionality for a double click as well
as a long press well that's interesting
chrome blacks out the notch this is kind
of my favorite notch implementation oh
yeah you can see it in YouTube so there
you go oh very satisfying okay
night vision I think we got to go
pitch-black right
yeah I mean it's pretty legit night
vision all right so you can kind of see
what it's doing here it's boosting up
the image substantially it's actually
kind of reminiscent of the night mode
features for still images that you see
on some other devices but as I move
around you like this is where in pitch
black tone it's very dark up here but
not so much when you're using this night
where's Otis not pitch black obviously
that works and works surprisingly well
it's a gigantic attachment though
walking around with that deal for a
little night mode now what happens if we
load up the walkie talkie oh okay this
is looking a little more beta beta mode
right now but this at least gives you an
idea of what this can look like you have
this giant button here in order to speak
and then here back course you would need
two of these to demonstrate this also
I'm told that this is not ready to go as
a beta beta mode scenario an area that
I'm kind of interested in on a device
like this
is the sound quality because it is such
a big unit
it's alright I mean it's not really
exceptional for a phone that weighs as
much as a brick look that's not really
what we're here for we're here cuz this
thing is crazy wild and cool and as
modular accessories and it just goes to
show you that there is no end to the
potential of the smartphone a walkie
talkie a night-vision camera or even
bigger than it already is we just
haven't seen a lot of modular devices
popping up of course it was all the rage
all the talk at one time my
understanding was that that didn't
really take off people weren't super
into it but doogee doesn't want to give
up the idea just yet
they went rugged with it maybe the
rugged buyers are the ones who are
willing to live modular its job
protecting and managing this forest so
that it will always give so much so many</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
