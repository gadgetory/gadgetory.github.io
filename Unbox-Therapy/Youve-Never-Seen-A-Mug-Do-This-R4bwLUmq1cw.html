instant order for me like I ordered it
up as soon as I saw it because it is
something that is near and dear to my
heart I drink a lot of coffee a loving
relationship with coffee as I'm sure
many of you do and if it ain't coffee
then is probably tea we're always
drinking beverages there hasn't been a
perfect way to have the perfect
temperature for the perfect beverage now
I did a video a little while ago on a
tea machine a machine that makes
super-high NTU is tea for you
whoa now the same thing kind of applies
to coffee if you've ever had a coffee
that's like lukewarm that's no good if
it's too hot you're getting burned and
that's no fun unless you end up suing
the establishment for millions and
millions of dollars or you do like
Kramer did in Seinfeld and you just go
for the lifetime supply
it's outrageous egregious preposterous
this thing right here the ember'
temperature control mug this is the
first time where it's exact and the
thing I like about that is if you for
beverage into here you know it can't be
too hot either because you have this
readout on the front tells you the exact
temperature of what's inside few degrees
can make a big difference in taste you
can save your preferences there's an app
because everything's got to have an app
you gotta have an app these days I don't
care what it is charges up like this I
mean plus it just looks cool in general
works on iOS and Android most expensive
mug on the planet I mean so just
probably some mug with like diamonds and
and gold and and bling some Indiana
Jones type of mug I don't know no
special rubies on this one but just tech
this is pretty nice looking
I like when you've got a high-tech item
that doesn't necessarily give it all
away people as far as they're concerned
that's a normal mug you're just sipping
away look at this this is a nice little
charging base I love when there's a home
for your things for your gadgets do not
microwave hand wash dishwasher safe lid
that's that's kind of nice first the app
to pair press and hold the ember logo
for six seconds this logo right here Oh
having trouble locating maybe maybe I
didn't hold it for safe
one six seven you're still having
trouble looking for it it's right here
man this is a capacitive touch button so
I can scroll through the various
settings here right here it says turn
off then press for six seconds so to put
it in parry mode you want to tap the
ember logo for six seconds from start
like to boot it up also as it shows here
you don't really want to use your thumb
on there you can't be as precise as you
would be with your index finger let's
search for it and there it is
ember mug beautiful name my ember which
I shall call what would be a good name
for my mug mug mug and you don't really
have to use the app I mean they
recommend that you do of course save
your presets and things like that if I
go to the temperature setting I can just
toggle that baby up right like that
alright we have the app we have the
update we are connected you can see that
I can control the temperature the mug
from the app now mainly the app is four
preset so you could have like a coffee
preset a tea preset a hot chocolate
preset and this thing will even do cold
drinks it'll actually cool down a
beverage that's too hot you can see I
can toggle my temperature this way oh
and it makes suggestions okay so 126
degrees would be perfect for a latte tea
is 132 where's coffee coffee is 130 you
can see it's telling me the actual
temperature right now inside of there is
76 that's kind of like the room
temperature I guess oh it can give you
notification when it hits the perfect
temp your phone will get a notification
so there's a high tech mug we do have
some coffee and how hot is it oh it
feels warm to me
we have something special for Jack yeah
that was close
okay so look
ooh we're going up it looks to me like
it's at its at 111 right now so we'll
put it up to 130
the perfect temperature has been reached
little notification here it hit 1:30
you're a serious aficionado I don't
think you can do better than sue this
actually is warm to the touch you get
the nice charging base you push down
this part here to open it up that's the
perfect copy get into the high-tech
realm cuz you're a high-tech guy today

favorite sponsors that's what we have in
