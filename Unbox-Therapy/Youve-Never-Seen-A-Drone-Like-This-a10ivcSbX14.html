rook I wonder if these things were ever
scared of humans they must have been at
one point in time because that looks
like easy lunch to me then so you guys
know drones are the new hot thing right
I showed you a few of them recently well
I've got another one today
from a company called zero tech they hit
me up they said we've seen all those
other drone videos but we think we've
got the coolest so please allow us to
send it out I said alright let's do it
so what is this all about it's called
the DA being Dobby Dobby or doobie it's
called the Dobby Dobby and probably the
first thing that you can tell is just
how tiny it is look at this box smaller
than one of my hands and that's the box
and it doesn't even look like a drone at
first sight because this one has
foldable propellers they go inside of it
and technically this thing is actually
pocketable technically actually box is
fairly simple opening it up look at this
little guy that's a drone we're living
in the future
it's got a camera on it so this is
actually gonna give you aerial footage
the propellers are kind of hidden here
folded in it's got sensors on the bottom
battery pack in this location micro USB
port power switch on the top here so
these little guys fold out click into
place look at this oh my goodness haha
you got yourself a little baby drone how
cool the little charger is that little
guy slides on there pops out
surprisingly USBC as well and a power
brick to go with it ok so the question
is is this thing actually pocketable
did I ever think that there'd be a
moment where I'd be walking around with
the drone casually in my pocket holy
smokes
there's an app for it fly it around
record video and so on
it works on iOS and Android I actually
have the Android app powered up oh hello
there all right it's given me a little
demo here so you can see the way you fly
so forward back side to side and then
elevation by tapping the screen okay I
get it here you can see the app looks
kind of like a camera app this is what
the drone itself is seeing takeoff
the ability to record video over here
take stills I'm going to switch to video
mode what do you guys say do we do we do
a little takeoff here
so as you can tell the the dobby drone
it's small right it fits in your pocket
as I suggested before but it also has
some attributes that are more similar to
larger drones I took it outside it was
stable the wind didn't mess with it it's
actually pretty quick it feels like some
of those larger more expensive drones
but in a in a much smaller package now
from a video perspective it does shoot
in 4k resolution now there is an absence
of a gimbal so the cameras right on the
front so it's relying on the
stabilization of the unit itself I even
set this thing up how high did I have it
was it let's see how high up we go I
think was around 17 meters up it didn't
try to stop me from trying that height
so didn't seem to have an issue at all
so it does have an indoor and outdoor
mode and this adjusts the
characteristics of the device
now I actually preferred flying it with
a kind of traditional thumb stick layout
as you can see here now this little
drone also has target tracking and face
tracking and an orbit mode so if you're
into choreographing those types of shots
it does have that capability alright so
who is this little guy for I don't know
I think somebody looking to get started
in the drone universe but looking for
something a little bit more intelligent
which has an all-in-one package 4k video
quality get you up and running you can
fly it indoors it's small enough for
that or outdoors if you want to get a
bit more adventurous and it folds up
into a package that can fit in your
pocket when this thing is folded down
it's hard to even tell what it is plus
it's not as expensive as some of the
other stuff out there so if you want to
get to experimenting this might be the
way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
