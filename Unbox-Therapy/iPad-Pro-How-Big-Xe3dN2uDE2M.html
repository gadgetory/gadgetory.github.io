another video and today I've got
something I think you'll be interested
in in front of me fresh from my mailbox
is a case actually a couple of cases for
what may be the upcoming iPad pro this
thing has been rumored for a while and
now as usual we've got factories
producing cases in advance of the actual
product release this was sent to me from
the legendary Sonny Dixon whom you're
probably familiar with at this point he
said hey Luke do you want to check out
some of these cases I said sure let's go
ahead and compare them to the current
iPad and see just how much bigger a
twelve inch or twelve plus inch iPad
will be and as you can tell looking at
this image here it's quite a bit bigger
so I've actually got cases here from two
separate manufacturers this one is your
fairly standard TPU style clear case and
then I've got this other leather style
case that flips open the interesting
thing here is that both match
identically in terms of dimensions which
may increase the likelihood of these
mock-ups being accurate so over here I
have the current generation full-size
iPad the iPad air 2 which as you know
has a nine point seven inch display you
can see it measured there now when I
look at this new form factor over here
and I do a similar measurement I end up
somewhere around twelve and a half
inches diagonally some of the components
like the front of it may not actually be
fabricated yet so the bezel may be
slimmer which may allow for you to gain
some screen real estate and get up to
that rumored dimension of twelve point
nine inches for the display nonetheless
this case and this image points in the
direction of a twelve inch plus iPad pro
now in terms of thickness we're looking
at a profile almost identical to the
current generation iPad air 2 so of
course everybody wants a thin device but
in this case it's a little bit
concerning because of the overall form
factor the footprint this is massive and
you have to
wonder if the same materials will hold
up or be durable enough to span this
entire region but maybe this is the
reason why Apple is investing in new
materials the 7000 series aluminum that
was rumored maybe we'll see a stronger
iPad pro okay so let's continue on and
do the remaining measurements of this
mock-up so width wise we are looking at
8 and 3/4 inches height is sitting at
exactly 12 inches and that diagonal
measurement for the entire case is 14
and a half inches giving this mock-up I
think we can confidently say that the
display on this device will likely be in
the neighborhood of 12 and a half to 13
inches now the last thing to talk about
is ports because we have an unusual
layout here but the thing that I like
here is that we have two separate
cutouts on each end and the reason this
is cool is because when you're holding
the device in landscape mode you're not
actually covering any of the active
ports you have an output up here at the
top as well as below your hands at the
bottom I think what we're seeing here is
stereo sound just with a couple of
different places for it to escape now
the remaining characteristics on the
case are pretty familiar for iPad users
here you have a cutout for your
headphones your power switch volume up
and down and then on the bottom there's
a cutout here for what will likely be
the the charging connector which many
are speculating will be USB see now
where things get interesting
you have a separate cutout which is
identical to the cutout on the bottom
but why some originally speculated that
it would be for a SIM card but I've
measured up I put my phone next to it
and it doesn't look wide enough for a
SIM card tray at least not as wide as
the SIM card tray on my phone I don't
really know at this point all I can say
is that the cutouts are identical
whether you're talking about the
portrait cutout or the landscape cutout
and the last remaining cutout on the
back of the case is for the camera
nonetheless with the arrival of this
case and also this one right here which
matches the exact same internal
dimensions I would say that we could
very well be seeing a much larger iPad
coming very shortly at this point it
like sometime around September October
or the regular iPad release cycle and I
suppose the question now goes out to you
is this something you're interested in
do you want a bigger iPad and iPad pro
alright guys so that wraps up this first
look at this mock-up and case pointing
in the direction of the next generation
iPad or the iPad pro which will likely
be sold in conjunction with the standard
iPad once again let me know down in the
comments if this is at all interesting
to you and if you would be first in line
to purchase an iPad pro anyways if you
enjoyed this content make sure to leave
a thumbs up down below thanks as always
for watching and I'll catch you on the
next episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
