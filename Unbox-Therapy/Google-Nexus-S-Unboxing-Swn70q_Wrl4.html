therapy comm and today we're taking a
look at the Google Nexus S also known as
the Samsung Nexus S after all it is
manufactured by Samsung and as you guys
probably know this thing is running the
unadulterated version of Android
nothing has been messed with by any
manufacturer it's the pure google
experience the way it was intended and
it's running 2.3 or Gingerbread
whichever you prefer to say we've got
some paperwork from Samsung that's the
first thing in the box
and next we've got what looks to be a
fairly decent headset it's got some
chrome accents on it and we'll look to
be semi comfortable earbuds we got a mic
on there of course how else do you speak
next we've got Samsung's standard USB 2
power prong adapter and the micro USB to
USB cable that goes into it so here she
is and the first thing I noticed is that
curved screen on the front side it also
looks like it's got some sort of an anti
fingerprint treatment on it at this
point I'd say the appearance is
marginally better than the Galaxy S
series that this was modeled after so
there you have it the Google logo after
all this is Google's phone so to speak
and I'm really excited to get a feel for
Android the way it was intended I've
used a lot of Android devices but pretty
much all of them have been skinned up in
some way by the manufacturer so we had a
1500 milliamp hour battery nothing else
to special on the inside no microSD
expansion we've got our charging port on
the bottom along with our headphone jack
our power button is in the top right
corner exactly where it should be
and on the other side we have our volume
rocker along with our speaker on the
back of the unit and of course the five
megapixel camera and LED flash that the
Galaxy series were lacking
there's our earpiece along with our
ambient light sensor and our
facing camera so here it is up against
my Galaxy S and as you can see it's a
little bit chubbier but some of that's
to do with that curved screen a new
design they're going with here you can
see some of the new gingerbread
appearance features you got a new
notification section as well as a new
keyboard anyway guys I'm gonna put this
through its paces and put it up against
some of the other popular handsets out
there so stay tuned for a major
telephone showdown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
