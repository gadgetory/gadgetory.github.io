actually make these types of videos very
often these things don't necessarily
update that frequently but today I have
an exciting update to my travel gadget
bag and the items that are within it
first things first let's talk about the
bag of choice probably seen this bag
here because I made a whole video on it
saying it was the perfect my favorite
the best gadget bag that I had owned
it's like 129 bucks it's got a mesh and
XO mesh so it's slash proof for someone
trying to get inside all the zippers
super high quality you can use a lock if
you want or you can just hide it
underneath this giant crazy lock on the
side here a slash proof strap this thing
has Dyneema in it I believe there's also
an RFID pouch on the inside the thing
was just amazing I've used this for
years beat it up just something that I
notice is that the bag itself is a
little bit heavy when I receive the new
limited edition version of this bag I
was really interested so that's this bag
right here I've got it packed up with
all my favorite gadgets to travel with
to my taste this one a little more
stylish so this version of this pack
safe bag is in collaboration with Keri
ology it's kind of just like an upgraded
version of that one and that's a good
thing don't change too much they
upgraded the handle as well a fully
leather structured handle the heavy duty
zippers on the top like this you still
have the same locking mechanism over
here there's an RFID pouch on the inside
same attention to detail on this one
slide the zipper through they can't get
into that outside pouch / proof strap
hidden in this pocket here so you don't
have to have this exposed if you don't
want to if you're not gonna be using it
these are all metal components exomesh
slashguard think of it like a web that's
underneath the surface of this material
also the zippers themselves are puncture
resist tough zips someone could take
like a Bic pen and come through the
zipper itself not so with these ones see
how this piece clips together like this
this comes down you see like this and
then this twists over onto here like
this and then you
would a regular travel lock down at the
bottom there now the interior this bag
changed a little bit it's now orange the
old one was this gray color then it went
to this orange color
laptop it's the MacBook Pro the heat
score itself this is the latest one the
full spec and if this does go with me
then I would also take a tablet Samsung
Galaxy Tab now the reason that I've been
travelling with these two devices on
Netflix you can take certain content
offline but that doesn't work on Mac OS
or Windows it only works on Android and
iOS I can download all that stuff in
advance it's one of the few times I
actually get to watch stuff is if I'm up
in the air sometimes if it's a light
trip I don't need the full scale MacBook
Pro I could skip both of these and
replace it with a simple pixel book I'm
actually doing a lot of work on the
pixel book lately and it can run Android
apps you just set it up super thin you
know we got to have headphones I've been
talking about these headphones a lot
these are the PXE 550's from sennheiser
noise-canceling you could configure the
amount or style of noise canceling
through the app these have great battery
life super comfy surprisingly
lightweight go watch the full video I
basically said to my favorite headphones
right now I've talked about this mouse
before as well MX master 2s from
Logitech super configurable comfortable
lots of buttons horizontal scroll wheel
where your thumb is I've been on this
train for a while I still roll with it I
can't just have big headphones I have to
have some small ones as well I've been
really into these lately IQ buds the new
version various profiles and microphones
on the outside so you can set up a song
scape hear a certain amount of your
surroundings along with your audio mixed
into it fully wireless style
earbud super easy once again check out
the full video if you want more info on
that phone you already know what it is
it's the s9 plus that I've been using
testing out a new case with it right now
how about those LTE speeds
I love the form factor I got the Nova
Launcher I'm living my life drives this
one is mine we use these in the studio
for just about everything this is the t5
2 terabyte crazy fast crazy small type-c
connector this is fast enough for us to
run in the pro res video clips that
you're
watching right here we have a bunch of
them this one has my name on it so that
will be in my bag now I'm also gonna
have a power brick of course a
relatively long power cable to go with
that I'm a big fan of short cables like
this one I can link this down below in
fact I'm gonna link everything I talked
about in the description of the video
this is Type C 2 standard USB but you
know when I'm traveling I don't want to
be going through a rat's nest of cables
pull out what I need and chances are I'm
gonna be close to a port anyways couple
other adapters cuz we're living in mac
book lantern Type C into some other
things since it's the only port you have
on the new MacBook HDMI the old
thunderbolt port 2 standard USB ease
this one even has an Ethernet jack a
Type C pass-through micro SD and
full-size SD card that's a lot of ports
as every port you're giving up on this
latest MacBook back with one cable so
once again laptop pouch tablet pouch
RFID safe pouch a mesh pocket that you
can see into Oh almost forgot gotta have
a sim tool at all times how about those
personal items that I mentioned that are
an absolute must
you're gonna think this crazy glue
you're getting carried away here slow it
down just a little bit you're too fired
up these little things right here Jack
those this is my go-to this is like is
this in my bag I'm looking I'm wondering
it gotta be there these are called ear
planes I never get on an airplane
without them I'm serious I haven't been
without these in years I had an
experience in the past where I was on
the airplane when my ears wouldn't pop
and it moved into the orbital socket and
I thought it was getting stabbed in the
eyeball afterwards I go online I'm
googling cabin pressure along with sinus
pressure that you may have had from a
cold or something like that so what the
recommendation was is these things right
here these are crazy that's what they
look like right there these tiny little
guys they're not earplugs because they
have a valve on the inside I don't know
if Jack's gonna be able to pick that up
which is gonna slow down the exchange
the pressure exchange from inside your
ear canal to the cabin of the plane I
spent more time on it on the ear planes
and some of the other gadgets by these
things this is simple these things are
incredible I don't travel it out of
airplanes just own them okay cool
general travel tip advil cold and sinus
it's a beauty you land
low on sleep maybe you're getting a cold
I don't know take one of those those are
usually in there you gotta have a pen
this one is tiny so it doesn't take up
too much space it's called a space pen
as well it can write upside down could
write in outer space if that's where I
was heading this becomes the entire
handle look at that that's beautiful
right there you see that Jack you don't
have a pen like that this thing for my
keys it's called keys smart I made a
video on this once upon a time super
compact way of just carrying a bunch of
keys toothpicks you got to have some
toothpicks okay they're serving you the
steak dinner you're dying
last up wallet I've been experimenting
with this new wallet from a company
called sermon brands and it's kind of
like some of the wallets that I've
talked about in the past you pull this
up and quick-release a card
an alternative spot for a quick card
this one slides in here and then to get
this one out you just push it from there
some space for cash on the inside a
little money cliff so that's something
to look at all right that rounds it out
man I'm really pumped about this new bag
the Kari ology x packs a limited edition
everything that I talked about in this
video I'm gonna link down below in this
studio I have access to pretty much 20
options for each one of these items so
the reason these are selected is because
I tried everything and I'm like that is
a good setup that said this one here is
about a hundred and eighty bucks if you
think that's a bit steep or you don't
have a hundred and eighty to spend you
can still get into the game here with
the original one that I was using this
was a hundred and twenty nine bucks it
has most of the features of this one
obviously this has some slight
improvements big fan of this stuff so
many cool products in here check the
description thanks for watching I'll see
you on my next trip I'll see you at the
airport all right later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
