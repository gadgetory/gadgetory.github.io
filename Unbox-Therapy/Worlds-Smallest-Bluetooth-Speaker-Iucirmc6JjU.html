another video and once again it's your
favorite show here on unbox therapy
called does it suck and of course today
we will be evaluating something that you
may think sucks but am I not and that's
the whole magic of this show right here
in front of me is something that's
listed on Amazon as the smallest
Bluetooth speaker in the world just
quotes around everything here I don't
know there's a smaller one or not but it
is a tiny little thing here I have to
say my expectations pretty slim pretty
pretty slim so let's jump inside and
find out what this thing is all about
now
first challenge here is of course
finding a way in I don't know man
there we go ok cool smart box camera
music calls does it all look at that
little guy
how cute see that there Jack little
grill on the top I'm assuming that's
where your audio is gonna come from and
then on the bottom side a button
possibly microphone and then a microUSB
jack for charging it up a tiny little
keychain type deal here that's it Wow no
charge cable nothing press the buttons
on and off to play pause answer calls
mic hole see I was right Bluetooth
indicator light charging indicator and
microUSB for all right that's it that's
your user manual
let's hit the button
oh the cheaper the product the greater
the likelihood that there will be no
charge out of the box this thing has
been sitting on a shelf for a while
micro USB cable here I come
should I walk back in where were we I'm
just back so I'm gonna hit the power
button isn't it let the samsung sound
flashing blue I think they snagged the
opening chime from Samsung there Jack
thanks for thanks for feedback the icon
here it's showing as a keyboard on my
phone not to speak that's okay this is
the perfect time for some jeopardy music
oh there we go okay cool we got it this
time
smart box connected my main thing here
is attempting to figure out if this
sounds better than the speaker on my
actual device which you can see
comparatively they're still the
blackberry print for now has this
speaker here if this can't beat this or
gonna have a problem
it is cute though
all right you know what uh here
this thing's a novelty that's what it is
you just want to tell people you have
the smallest bluetooth speaker maybe
you're not gonna use as much battery on
your phone if you're using bluetooth as
opposed to the speaker itself I don't
know but I can't really figure out why
you would want or need this does it suck
how unfortunately yes I think so I think
you could have sounded a little bit
better calling Jack hello anybody home
Chris what's going on man can you uh can
you hear me kind of it sounds terrible
doesn't it all right talk to you soon
man Chris don't lie never lied in his
life said his words sounded like I was
talking with a cloth over my mouth
not sure how he knows what that sounds
like I'll link it down in the
description if you have some creative
idea of what you might do with the
world's smallest Bluetooth speaker but
I'm saying it sucks this is probably the
most the single most requested item in
unbox therapy history this is the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
