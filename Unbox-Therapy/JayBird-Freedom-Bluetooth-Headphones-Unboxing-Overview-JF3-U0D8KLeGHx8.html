therapy here and today we're taking a
look at the j-bird freedom wireless
Bluetooth headset now these are stereo
headphones but they've got a mic
included so you can use them with your
smartphone but you can also use them
with any device that outputs stereo
Bluetooth audio for example I hooked
them up to my laptop a few minutes ago
and they worked beautifully they've also
got a limited lifetime warranty
against sweat so what that means is if
you want to work out with these babies
on you don't have to worry about ruining
them with moisture they are the official
training headphones of USA Triathlon you
know they've got to be pretty tough to
earn that designation so the first thing
we're gonna look at is the user manual
which states
welcome to the j-bird family our heart
and soul has gone into making these
headphones that's a good thing to know
I'm glad and we've got a pretty unusual
user manual here believe it or not it's
it's a strange shape but it's cool
nonetheless you get a bunch of different
languages and it explains how to hook
these Jaybirds up to whichever Bluetooth
audio source you're going to be using so
let's place the headphones to the side
for a minute and look at the remainder
of what's in the box we've got a couple
of Apple esque jaybird stickers here so
you can advertise to the world that you
got a real nice set of bluetooth
headphones and you don't you don't need
wires going down to your device so we've
also got another piece of paper here
that tells you that an armband is
recommended for outdoor use after all
these are using wireless bluetooth
transmissions so the closer the device
can be to the audio source the better
that being said in my initial tests this
is not a review by any means but in my
initial tests I walked across the room
and still had fantastic transmission so
I'll wait and see when I go outside see
how powerful the transmission is and
definitely get back to you guys in a
review so anyways we've got a real nice
carrying case that's included here a
premium style carrying case from what I
can tell it's got a magnetic enclosure
and we've got a little charging cable
here which at first I thought was
microUSB but it looks now like it's
proprietary so that's not a fantastic
point and we've got a number of
attachments here so you can get the
right
fit in your particular ear even if your
two ears happen to be different sizes if
you're some kind of freaking no but but
seriously I mean a lot of people have
trouble with ear buds finding a size
that fits you're not gonna have this
that issue with these so here's a better
look at the headphones themselves and
they're real understated design the way
it should be you've got your power
button and your volume buttons on the
right hand bud as well as your
microphone and the connection to charge
them here's a better look at that
carrying case that I mentioned earlier
and it definitely does have a magnetic
clasp which is nice and also a little
elastic band in it in order to hold your
headphones down so they're not jumping
around in there so here are some of
those tips I was talking about and this
is really what's unique about these
particular headphones is that these
little devices in here clip on before
your tip does and allow the ear itself
to hold the weight of the headphone more
so than the ear canal and this is
another option it also comes with these
two if you want to use the around the
ear style these clip on and off real
easy - in my case I didn't need to put
those on but that's the beauty of these
things I mean they're super customizable
you've even got multiple tip sizes the
medium ones are pre-installed and this
one is large and the orange one is small
so all you've got to do is install this
little section here before you put your
tip on that is if you if the tip doesn't
fit you the way you want you can do it
this way and I mean you like I said
before you can really customize the
experience here so it's really up to you
you can try out a bunch of different
ways and find out what works best for
you
now I've actually got a little bit
upside down on there but once you've got
it installed correctly you sort of twist
it into the ear the way it's shown in
that diagram now as I mentioned this is
not a review it's strictly an unboxing
and overview I'm definitely going to put
together a full review on these because
I'm really excited about the prospect of
wireless audio so definitely stay tuned
to the channel for that and if you don't
mind guys please hit that like and
favorite button after all that's what
makes this content possible it helps to
promote my stuff and help people find
out about it
anyway guys until next time thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
