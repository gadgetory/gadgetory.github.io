sit down to do a quick comparison video
of the two hottest products possibly on
the planet right now the ps4 and the
Xbox one there's a lot of controversy
going on a lot of arguments going on in
comment sections on a number of YouTube
videos so I wanted to sit down and give
you guys my take give you guys my
personal professional opinion on what
the hell is going on
but before we get into that I do want to
go over the specs of both of the systems
for those of you guys that have been I
don't know hiding under a rock or
something like that this is how it
breaks down to start we've got the price
price is 399 on the ps4 and 499 on the
Xbox one
that being said the Xbox one does
include the Kinect sensor and you will
need the Kinect sensor in order to
operate the system so a lot of people
are speculating that that's part of the
reason that you have a higher price
point to start if you're into motion
based gaming then you'd need to add the
PlayStation Eye to the ps4 and that's
around another 60 bucks I believe at
this point so if that's something you're
into you're going to get closer to price
parity but I do like the fact of course
that on the playstation side of things
you don't need to have it in order to
operate the system and you don't need to
buy it if you don't envision yourself
using it they both have blu-ray / DVD
optical drive so that's the same they
both have the ability to record gameplay
there is game play DVR functionality
built in they both got 8 gigabytes of
RAM but it's a little bit different
it's gddr5 on the ps4 whereas it's just
regular ddr3 on the Xbox one that might
sound like a major improvement but what
you guys need to remember is the
majority of games here that you're going
to play on either platform are going to
be cross-platform and more than likely
performance and appearance on both will
be relatively similar there is a slight
performance edge to the ps4 on this
front but from a general sort of
gameplay standpoint I don't need vision
is making any kind of huge improvement
on your games and it's probably not the
most important decision-making factor
the CPU is also very similar you're
dealing with an 8 core AMD chip on both
of them they both got 500 gigabyte
hard drives external storage is to be
announced on the Sony ps4 it is
definitely supported on the Xbox one via
USB it will likely be supported on both
once again no real game changer there
cloud storage is available on both this
is where things when we start talking
about software this is where things get
a little bit more squirrely there are
mandatory game installs on the Xbox one
side and as you guys have probably heard
this has to do with some of the DRM
that's going to go into the Microsoft
ecosystem the inability to just swap
games to use a disc and play a game
anywhere on any console this is probably
the most the single most controversial
topic is this idea of DRM no use games
no renting of games now Microsoft has
come out they did have a press release
or it might be on their official website
where they stated that there will be
authorized retailers that are able to
sell use games but this is all really
shady right now nobody has specifics on
it and it sounds like it's going to be a
complicated process so we're going to
have to wait to find out more about that
but we definitely know that the ps4 is
has no such restrictions when it comes
to used games when it comes to sharing
games and when it comes to mandatory
game installs the other controversial
topic is the required internet
connection it's been said now that the
Xbox one is going to need to connect to
the internet once every 24 hours to
remain operational for a lot of people
this is no big deal
and I know myself included I've got
internet all the time and everywhere and
I personally get pretty freaked out when
I lose the Internet in any one place so
that's not a huge issue but I do know
that this happens to be an issue for
some users or else I wouldn't be getting
the press and coverage that it is it's
not just I suppose a question of whether
or not you've got internet but also a
question of privacy people don't like
the idea of an always-on system staring
at you with a mandatory Kinect in your
living room at all times and I can
understand their concerns whether or not
it's doing anything shady or not it's
still a little bit disconcerting to know
that that's a requirement and that the
system won't function without any of
that or or potentially if anything is to
change in the future in terms of how
Microsoft runs their business and if
your entire game library is tied into
this DRM ecosystem who knows just how
mobile your game library will be we
don't know yet connect to does also
offer up motion control for your gaming
so it's not just strictly this device
that you can use for interacting with
the system so potentially speaking if
you go to the ps4 side you would need to
add the PlayStation Move and then on top
of that the PlayStation Eye so there's a
couple of different devices you would
need so it's not just the eye and things
could get a little bit more expensive
but you know my opinion on motion based
gaming is that we're not really there
yet that's that's it's not something
that a lot of people are going to be
buying these consoles for at least not
myself and a lot of people that I've
talked to it's not this this
deal-breaker kind of issue and so I
don't think that really weighs too much
into the average consumers
decision-making on whether or not they
want to get which system they want to
get second screen this is something I
would probably give the edge to the Xbox
one on because smart glass will will be
supported so you'll have the ability to
interface with your console with you
know a tablet if you choose to do that
of course you can have second screen
functionality on the ps4 using the
PlayStation Vita so there is an option
there subscription services have not got
a lot of coverage and I I tend to
believe this has something to do with
the fact that you know it's been hidden
underneath all of this controversy
regarding the always-on and used game
situation but you will need a
PlayStation Plus membership as things
look right now you will need a
PlayStation Plus membership just like
you've always needed an xbox live
membership to take advantage of
multiplayer if you if you look at the
slide from their official presentation
it also identifies PlayStation
multiplayer etc as being one of the
bullet points underneath PlayStation
Plus so that's something worth
considering there is a slightly extended
cost in order to play online but it's
once again similar across both platforms
the other thing the last thing to
mention in terms of differences from a
hardware perspective
is the region locking ps4s will not be
region locked so that means you can play
games from anywhere in the world and you
can take your console anywhere in the
world and have it function properly
whereas the Xbox one will be region
locked so that's something worth
considering so that should give you guys
a better idea of the hardware
specifications of each of the two
consoles but the thing to remember here
more than anything is that they are more
similar than they are different the fact
that they're both running eight core
processors from AMD and also the fact
that most titles are going to be
cross-platform means that the actual
gaming experience should be very similar
on each of the two consoles and hardware
probably shouldn't be the sole reason
why you select one of the consoles over
the other if there is a bit of an edge
it likely goes to the ps4 for having
that gddr5 memory but other than that
like I said don't make your decision
strictly based on hardware so the things
that have been talked about most in
terms of analyzing these two consoles
are obviously the ones that have gotten
the most exposure the DRM the fact that
your Xbox always has to be on you can't
share games can't rank games etc before
I get there I want to talk about price
because price to me is maybe the number
one consideration when a person walks
into a store that's money out of your
pocket for a product and you have to
take a look at what you're going to be
getting back so there's $100 price
difference even though the hardware is
incredibly similar yes as I mentioned
before the Xbox one does have that
built-in ability to look at television
content in a very unique way television
is not a big part of my life so it's
very hard for me to give that say $100
value Kinect is not a big part of my
life so it's hard for me to give it any
kind of significant value either that
being said to somebody out there in the
world I know it's valuable to you so
there's no reason to jump into the
comments and freak out I think people
are going to walk through a store this
holiday season if you haven't
pre-ordered already they'll walk through
a store this holiday season when the
next-gen consoles launch and they'll be
comparing the two and you're going to
have some nice little package put
together by Sony which is going to be
the console a couple games maybe an
extra controller who knows what and it's
likely still going to be less money than
the base model Xbox one or at least
it'll be less money than the Xbox one
equip
bundle and around Christmastime people
are really you know sort of scrounging
around for money they're trying to come
up with gifts for everyone in a hundred
bucks is significant especially right
now what people are having you know
economic issues and can't necessarily
indulge themselves in consumer
electronics like they once could so I
think this is probably the number one
reason why the PlayStation 4 is going to
have success if you remember in the past
with the PlayStation 3 it when it
launched it was significantly higher
priced and that resulted in my opinion
in or partly at least in the success
that the Xbox 360 had here in North
America by being the more affordable
solution at least for a while so price
is a very very important consideration
especially for people who are buying
this thing as a gift and if you look on
Amazon right now at pre-orders I believe
the PlayStation 4 is still ahead of the
Xbox one in terms of pre-orders I think
people really want to hold on to their
hundred bucks right now what I wish
would have happened is that Xbox or
Microsoft sorry created an Xbox one
option that didn't include the Kinect
didn't require the Kinect and gave
people options options are never a bad
thing if you've only got 399 to spend
you can decide whether or not you need
to connect as part of your experience
and then add it later like they've done
in the past I don't think that system is
broken or you know ever was or is broken
today so they should have stuck with you
know a trident root system for modular
upgrade ability when you see a component
you need you go out and get it but point
of entry is very important and having a
three ninety nine point of entry is a
hell of a lot better than having a four
ninety nine point of entry and I think
it'll be a major major component in the
success of the PlayStation for this
particular generation the next thing I
want to talk about is something that
hasn't been talked about all that much
and that is ecosystems on both of these
systems you're going to be able to port
over your progress your trophies etc
from previous gen consoles and a lot of
people have invested a lot of time and a
lot of energy in building up their
profiles in each of those two ecosystems
not just their profiles but their
friends lists and and all kinds of
things and maybe more importantly than
that they've had to argue with people
over the course of the last
few years over which ecosystem was
better for them to be in and of course
that the truth was for a long time that
the best ecosystem for a lot of people
was the xbox 360 or the xbox live
ecosystem so it's hard for people to
make a hard shift for people to make a
hard change for people to see a video or
to see some specifications say you know
what it's time for me to move over to
PlayStation or vice versa it's time for
me to move over to Xbox it's not an easy
decision to make so I understand why
people are so passionate about this
they've invested a lot of time in
becoming you know branded on one side or
the other but if you look at this from
you know a blank consumer perspective
somebody who's never owned either one
and walks into the store which is really
the way that you should look at a lot of
consumer electronics purchases then then
the perspective changes a little bit you
sit there and you say well my
considerations are different now because
I'm not tied in to a specific ecosystem
as you guys know your investment in
games for example in the past has really
helped dictate what ecosystem you stick
with if you've got you know a bunch of
Xbox 360 you know games on the shelf the
likelihood that you're going to want to
convince your friends to also get an
Xbox 360 is much much higher but I see
this new console generation as an
opportunity to start fresh an
opportunity to just pick whichever one
is better for you whichever one you
think sounds better on paper whichever
one you can afford for that matter and
then you know go from there don't worry
so much about where you're coming from
where your allegiances were there's
really no purpose to be allied with a
hardware component it's just a tool it
just gets a job done and you know for
the most part it should be entertaining
you not forcing you to go on the
internet and then and be angry if if
your console is making you angry or your
console allegiance is making you angry
something is wrong something is broken
you shouldn't have to defend anything
whichever product is better will win and
you can be a part of that success or
failure for that matter but most
importantly remember that whichever one
you choose it's about entertainment so
go out get your entertainment and
there's no need to come on here and then
etcetera you shouldn't have to do that
if you believe in your choice if you're
happy with your choice and you want to
see success in your choice then you
shouldn't have to do that
my advice
for you is to really just analyze the
data that's out there stop thinking
about where you stood in the past or how
many people you convinced to be on a
specific platform look at these things
as they are in the modern format with
the modern specifications and the data
that's available to us right now I'm
going to go out on a limb I'm going to
say that so far based on the information
that I have the PlayStation 4 looks like
the better value I like the way that
Sony has played the PR I like the way
they came out and have been just really
casual really upfront about the use game
situation that's a feature that we've
always had and we shouldn't have to
fight for the pricing which as I said
before is really really important people
care about it a lot and then the last
fact they're not having to have an
always-on connection which as I said in
my opinion not nearly as big a deal as
it's being made to be but nonetheless
some kind of requirement that is really
unnecessary whether it's a big deal or
not it's unnecessary so why is it there
you have to wonder you have to ask
questions I'm not a huge conspiracy
theorist or anything like that but it is
there and it really doesn't need to be
there in order for you to play it play
your games the only reason it could be
there is to verify DRM or who knows what
else that's not really for us to have to
understand all we have to do is sit
there and be entertained we shouldn't
even have to consider something like
that the other thing that's really
pissing me off is the way that that the
Microsoft PR people or the Microsoft
representatives are sort of brushing off
all of these concerns that are going on
in this massive online community here on
YouTube reddit everywhere else
everywhere that people are talking about
this they're just avoiding it and when
and where they're not avoiding it
they're actually slipping up even
further you have this new video that
came out where they're basically telling
people to keep playing their Xbox 360
kicking them to the curb saying
next-gen is not for you if you have
issues with you know the new one I don't
really think that's the right play you
have to pay attention to what people are
saying and you can make adjustments you
don't need to be dead set in a certain
way and I think they're coming off as
arrogant more than anything else in not
even really addressing people's concerns
the concerns are real Microsoft needs to
man up come out talk about them
potentially make changes at least make
people feel a little bit more
comfortable about why these things are
there and how they're going to be
lamented more specifically just being
quiet about it avoiding avoiding it or
further entrenching themselves in it is
not doing them any favors and it
basically built the entire PR engine for
the sony electronics group because all
they had to do out and do is come out
and say oh hey our our console doesn't
do any of those things our console is
just like other consoles it's like older
consoles it can do all the things you'd
expect a console to do I mean that's
that's the greatest PR platform they
ever could have come up with and they
didn't even create it Microsoft created
it for them by causing all of these
issues or creating these issues that
didn't need to exist that people
obviously care about YouTube is the
perfect representation of that you can
check down below when you're looking at
the thumbs-up and thumbs-down on this
particular video people do care you do
care I do care and if Microsoft wants to
play ball in this particular marketplace
they have to pay attention to the people
they're trying to sell to anyways
that's my take you could call me a ps4
fan point I'm just analyzing the data
this is what's available to us right now
if you guys enjoyed this content if you
appreciate you know my take on it please
remember to leave a thumbs up down below
you can do one better and share this
video with your friends as well
hopefully you can help people out there
understand where all this information is
coming from and why people feel the way
that they feel other than that I guess
that's it I'm going to Ram I can ramble
on for way too long so I'm going to let
you guys go right now thanks as always
for watching and I'll catch you on the
next video later</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
