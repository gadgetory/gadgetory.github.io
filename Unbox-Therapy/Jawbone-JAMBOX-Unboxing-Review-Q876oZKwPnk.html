therapy and today we're taking a look at
the jam box from jaw bone this is the
original jam box and the reason I
mentioning that is because they recently
released a brand new version which is
larger than this one entitled the big
Jambox how creative of them anyways this
device here will allow for you to
wirelessly pump out your tunes over
Bluetooth from any device really that
supports it so whether that be an iPad a
tablet a smartphone a laptop or a
portable audio device now if your device
does not support bluetooth for wireless
streaming you can still use this jam box
by using the included 3.5 millimeter
cable so that will hook up to super old
iPods etc and so if you're still rocking
the original iPod you're good to go let
me know down in the comments if you're
still using a super old iPod actually
just let me know what you guys use for
music on-the-go right now I'm interested
to find out so anyways let's get back to
the unboxing the very first thing I want
to show you guys here is this little
carrying pouch / sleeve it's made out of
like a felt sort of material and it's
pretty flimsy and pretty finicky so I
probably won't end up using it myself
sliding the jam box in and out is a
little bit of a headache so I'm gonna
put that to the side and probably leave
it there next you've got the micro USB
cable obviously very useful in charging
the device and they've actually included
an extra one so you've got two one that
is very short and one that's a little
longer so you can pick whichever one is
suitable depending on distance you are
from your power source next you've got
the power brick with the fold up style
prongs to make traveling easier and then
you've got the 3.5 millimeter cable as I
was talking about earlier you're gonna
use this with older style audio sources
or if you just don't want to use
bluetooth for whatever reason that'll
work out of any regular headphone jack
now jawbone claims that this device will
give you 10 hours of music playback when
you're not tethered to the wall so the
built-in battery will hold a pretty
significant charge and it will also
allow you to be up to 33 feet away from
your audio source when using it so it's
perfect of course for things like
parties for traveling
if you want to take it to the beach or
on a picnic you guys go on picnics right
anyways about the device I think it's
really pretty to look at I think it's an
awesome design you have this
diamond-shaped pattern around the entire
exterior of the device along with the
perforated metal there aren't too many
buttons on here which also helps it look
streamlined and nice looking you've got
one button for answering and ending
phone calls a minus and plus button of
course those are to adjust the level of
volume you can also adjust volume from
your actual source as well on this side
here is where everything else is you
have your port for your 3.5 millimeter
cable micro USB to charge it and your
power switch is also there which also
acts as an LED indicator to tell you
about the status of your jam box now
here's a quick size comparison against
the Galaxy Nexus and as you'll notice
while it's a bit chunkier from a high
perspective it's not much taller meaning
you could definitely pocket the jam box
if you had to and hooking it up to your
device to play Bluetooth music through
it is dead simple just go into your
preferences the jam box is like
automatically discoverable in fact
there's even audio feedback when you
first boot it up there's a woman's voice
stating that the jam box is ready to be
paired so pretty convenient really easy
to set up at least in my experience
having done it with a couple of devices
I hooked it up to both my Galaxy Nexus a
MacBook Pro a couple of other devices I
can't even remember but didn't have any
problems with that at all one thing to
mention if you do hook it up with your
computer make sure to select stereo
output because mono sounds terrible
something to remember now one more thing
to talk about is these LED indicators
they'll tell you what the device is
doing if it's flashing white then it's
trying to connect flashing red the
battery is low and white red means that
you're charging the battery so anyways
one little complaint is if you play bass
heavy music in my case I say dubstep or
hip-hop or something like that
the device does tend to jump around the
table a little bit as you're seeing
right here now this is not a huge issue
because all you have to do is flip the
jam box upright and it'll it won't move
around at all anymore now some people
might not like that solution but it's
really on a
spectrum of of usage scenarios where
you'd have super bass coming through
this thing and you know it might it
might at that point jump around but what
do you expect I mean for such a small
device to produce that much bass there's
got to be some vibration associated
anyway guys if you enjoyed this video
please do like and favorite it as it
does help me out a bunch and one more
thing I want to mention if you haven't
visited my new channel yet the Beast
feed please go ahead and do so I'm
hungry for subscribers over there you
might like the content I'll put a link
in front of your face as well as down in
the description please come over and
support that channel if you can and
other than that I'll catch you guys in
the next video thanks as always for
watching later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
