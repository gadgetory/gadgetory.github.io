another video and today it's an
exclusive one we are taking a first look
at the new gear s3 it now comes in two
different models we've got the classic
over here as well as the frontier the
classic is a little more elegant and you
got the leather strap the frontier that
one that's the one that speaks to me
personally it's a little bit more rugged
like I am you guys know that this one
looks at home on there it's not too
dainty also want to mention about the
straps there are different sizes and
they are interchangeable I've got the
large installed on both you get a small
and medium as well so regardless of your
wrist size you should be covered you can
see here there's a number of watch faces
to choose from and some of them can even
be stylized you can go with an orange
maybe a red now navigation the fact that
you can navigate the watch using the
bezel the reason I think that's
important is because on a watch you're
dealing with a smaller touchscreen right
smaller than your phone but you don't
want to go to your phone to do all your
various functions either does that kind
of defeats the purpose of the watch you
use the bezel and as you'll see it's a
very fluid kind of interface the first
thing here is notifications
communication what if you get a message
it's gonna ping you and you can go in
there and actually interact with it
right here so there we go we've got a
message from Jack here I can open it up
he says what's up then I can respond to
him right on the watch if you click on
the emoji icon up here of course you've
got all the classics in here happy sad
mad one of my favorites you know the
flame Jack really likes to receive
pictures of himself so we're gonna send
this back to him boom right in the
thread my very own portrait of Jack but
what about phone calls oh here we go you
can hear it's a phone call from Jack and
you can actually spin the wheel here and
answer the call that way hello Jack
isn't is that you Jack just like comic
books you can answer your phone on your
watch not an improvement on these two
guys from the s2 is battery life we're
looking at three to four days of battery
life on a
single charge now that's important when
it does come to charging these up you're
going to use this little tiny dock over
here I'll show it to you now this has a
magnetic back to it so you just kind of
drop the watch on finds the right spot
so once you have the little dock plugged
in you get the LED illuminated and you
also get a kind of cool green bar which
identifies just how much of a charge you
actually have it acts as a cool little
bedside clock there's also a find my
phone feature so if your phone is like
jammed down behind the couch cushion or
something like that click that button
it'll buzz you can track it down a big
concern for people is what what's it
gonna do from a health perspective from
a fitness perspective so this one has a
number of different features built in
through s health you can see here you
can check how many calories you've
burned a number of steps you've taken
and one of the more interesting features
to me is an active heart rate monitor
see the heart pumping there it's trying
to get an accurate reading 75 bpm I'm
within average right now this becomes
more interesting when you're actually
doing a workout feel like a doctor on
your built-in dedicated GPS has the
ability to track your exact location and
then send your whereabouts to selected
individuals both the frontier and the
classic feature ip68 certification if
you haven't heard of that before that
means there's going to be water
resistance as well as dust resistance
but it's one thing to say it another
thing to show it so we're going to do
the dunk test
action that's the shot right there so
there you have it
gear s3 the frontier as well as the
classic completely different look from
last year it's a lot more in line with
my style especially with the frontier
version over here just it looks like it
belongs there</div></body></html>
