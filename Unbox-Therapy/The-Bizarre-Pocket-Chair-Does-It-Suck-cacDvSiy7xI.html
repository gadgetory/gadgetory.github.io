excited normally then there are other
times where I'm not really sure why I'm
excited this is one of those times
cuz this thing showed up and the first
glance you're trying to figure out what
it is what am i what the explaining this
to me that I looked at the name I use my
better judgement and I realized what I
was looking at is a seat look at the
size of it a seat that's in a box that
big now a seat in and of itself is not
very interesting sitting in a seat right
now so are you can I ask you guys
something personal
I saw a poll on Twitter the other day a
surprisingly high number of people stand
up to white Oh
Jack does Jack does um right okay it's a
seat sure
the tagline a lot of people don't know
this but the original tagline and still
to this day of unbox therapy Ryan do you
know it the tag like let me I'm in a
tell the world he's unbox therapy where
products get naked that's the tagline
we're gonna find out if the sit pack is
worth your time worth your attention and
most importantly worth your hard earned
cash I know you work hard for your money
so we're gonna treat you right you
remember that slogan
let me hear it guys I don't trust you
what's it from pull your money you are
all your money right okay whoa
I don't what do you say should we crack
one open see if it'll hold hold up old
uncle Lou there is a sit packing blue a
sit pack in black design and produced in
Denmark all right we got Denmark on the
line now you're gonna evaluate your
entire procession of Denmark based on
this contraption it looks a little weird
all right I just realized that kinda
looks like a peg going you know you're
where it counts it's hitting the target
so to speak now these other boxes over
here are a click on cover with carry
strap this is a way to carry it now
you're wondering why do I need a chair
to be this small
well maybe you like to Ono line up for
things you're at a concert and there's
standing room and you're not about that
mosh pit I don't know you're standing up
your legs are getting sore you need a
little seat and so on and so on it's a
chair that almost it almost fits in your
pocket got strap - let's try the damn
chair already please oh man look at this
guy up here and look what happens if he
does it wrong deck can you see this so
this is the blue one apparently I don't
know how to take up rapper off the thing
my goodness gracious what we got going
on everything open it like this oh man
all right
oh oh
old baby and then I lock it you know I'm
gonna sit on this and I'm about to take
a dive can you call this a chair me
looks like a peg is this a chair all
right let me try this out this could be
very dangerous is this right
this is more of like a leaning situation
I mean I guess I feel better a little
bit I just like having an extra leg
coming out of your rear end you know
three legged Lou did I do something
wrong I don't know when the pitcher
looked like there was a seat a groove
okay good to get out of your way on the
guy away me I thought you're gonna be
able to sit I thought it was like a
stool where you could like get your feet
off the ground whoa whoa easy boy this
is there's nothing good about this when
you can do it it's not meant to be
pleasurable right does take some
pressure off if you're just leaning
I'll give it about us six out of ten I
had higher expectations I gotta see my
slogan was sit back and sit back but now
I can't it's not fair it's not fair the
people gotta have more cushion on it
give you a front pitch your head yeah
yeah gift maybe listen it is what it is
I like it when people tried things out
manufactures they go I don't know I've
always wanted a little I think that this
might be meaningful to somebody maybe
it's you I don't know let me know down
in the comments what your rating is
obviously you haven't tried it but
you've seen a couple different people
try it can you sit on it yes are you
gonna be very comfortable no does it
suck
oh man how much is this thing a couple
of buddies having a few beers on top of
their pegs look at this guy partying on
his head
the sit pack and cover is 87 bucks I'm
not going to say that it sucks I think
that's a little bit extreme idea of just
that's kind of cool I mean that's kind
of fun like you got to give them some
points from an engineering perspective
for putting that together this ain't
gonna replace your couch but then again
you can't put your couch in your pocket
so what are we talking about I'm not
really sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
