that's making a bunch of claims this
showed up and I was like I gotta test
that out I just I don't know it's a
screen protector that claims to enhance
your battery life improve your signal
strength and reduce the amount of
radiation coming out of your smartphone
into your face that's a lot of claims
for a screen protector it's from tech
armor they've got a little image here 15
minutes of cell phone use this guy's
half dead as you can tell silent threat
the jury's out on this whole radiation
situation their new screen protector is
going to push the radiation out the back
of the phone by blocking it from coming
out of the front but honestly the thing
I'm most interested in is this increase
this improved signal strength with
improved signal strength you can also
often realize better battery life as
well in fact they're saying up to 40%
longer battery life so in this video I'm
gonna take some signal strength readings
on this iPhone 10 right here prior to
installing the screen protector then
I'll install the screen protector and
take the readings again in order to see
if it actually does improve signal
strength and gets around 30 bucks maybe
Willie do can give us the big number 30
bucks did I nail that I just test okay
it's 30 bucks it does all these other
things now you guys may remember I did a
video in the past about a case enhance
the battery life what happens is when
you lift it up and slide it you'll
notice it lines up with the antenna on
the iPhone pretty much as expected
it feels pretty substantial actually
it's already nerve-racking I'm already
starting to get paranoid here about
installing the screen protector although
I feel like I've gotten better at it
over the years device cleansing wipes
all right so there's this special mode
you can go into on your iPhone you could
try this yourself type in star three
zero zero 1 cache 1 2 3 4 5 hash star
and then dial it and it brings you into
this field test mode this gives you all
kinds of information about your phone
now the key stuff for us is in the
serving cell measurement right here now
our signal strength lives right here our
SRP zero you can see we are at minus 108
in this case since it's a - figure the
lower the number the better the signal
you can see it fluctuating a little bit
this is LTE this is on the Rogers
Network our SRP one represents the next
closest cell tower the thing to do now
is to install the enhanced tech armor
screen protector and see if it can boost
that up at all
still - 117 115 nothing like a nice
fresh display
it actually is pretty easy to install
part of that's because it doesn't
attempt to go around the curve
alright so the screen protector is
installed now let's launch back in - 109
sledded update here give it a second -
107 - 106 all right so are the same
benchmark right now we're we're where we
might 105 - 107 mmm - 105 again - 107 so
I mean very marginal like the other one
was - 106 and then - 109 okay fine let's
try and hold it does it need to be
touching your face or something there's
a patented layer that redirects
potentially harmful radiation up out and
away from your body to lessen exposure
this process creates a stronger usable
signal from your smartphone which can
extend battery life by up to 40% but in
what circumstance what like perfect
circumstance what you need to take
advantage of that because my signal
strength is at minus 116 right now and
that's worse there's obviously some
issues here they may extend beyond the
capabilities of this screen protector if
we don't see an improvement in signal
strength then we also can't necessarily
buy the claims that we're gonna get this
battery life improvement without the
better signal strength you're not gonna
get the better battery life and then you
also got to bring into question the
whole radiation silent threat scenario
what exactly is this extra layer doing
now as a screen protector it's pretty
nice easy to install and it is a 9h
tempered glass I'm guessing - what they
did is create some perfect scenario to
get their numbers in testing but this is
the real world it actually appears to
get worse when I'm holding it go and
check this for yourself type that code
into your iOS device and see what kind
of reception you're working with look if
this screen protector is doing anything
it doesn't appear to be doing anything I
don't necessarily buy into the other
claims your results may vary if you had
a different experience with this I'd be
interested in knowing about it but as of
right now I'm saying it's just a screen
protector it's a half-decent screen
protector I'm gonna say probably skip
this one based on these initial findings
if anything comes up and I noticed some
sort of change I'll let you know today
you have
I got to tell you the truth here okay
I've got to give you the evidence and
that's what it is tech armor you want to
reach out send me an email and say look
here's where it improves you're in the
park it's a full moon cumulus clouds
foliage then you see the improvement you
want to let me know you let me know I'll
give you a chance ok ok there it is the
truth shall set you free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
