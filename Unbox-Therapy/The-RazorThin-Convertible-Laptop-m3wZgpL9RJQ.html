location right now so HP invited me out
to this really cool suite in Las Vegas
with an amazing view to be one of the
first people to look at the new elite
book x360 ultra-thin convertible this
product in front of me it's a business
convertible laptop but it's also capable
of some entertainment functionality
let's jump inside the box and find out
what makes it special so the first thing
I'm noticing about this is just how
crazy light it is I'm told it's under
three pounds the new slick logo and this
is as I mentioned a convertible got a 4k
display 13 inches look at these little
touches around here a little bit of
bling there another thing I just noticed
as well the type of fingerprint scanner
right there
this one looks capacitive so I'm
assuming that's going to function a lot
more smoothly a micro SD card slot a USB
type-c Thunderbolt connector a
full-sized HDMI port a traditional USB
that's actually not all of it we've got
a dedicated power switch another USB
full-size headphone jack what looks like
a volume rocker oh cool that is a sim
card slot so apparently you've got some
quick charge functionality in here you
get up to 50% of total battery life
recharged in only 30 minutes oh right
it's a pen from a company called Wacom
this gives you some of the most precise
input possible on a touchscreen if
you're in any way artistic or you want
to manipulate something more precise
this is a great way to do that inside
the package is the pen itself as well as
some extra tips I love when they include
the batteries let's power this up one of
the cool things here as well is if you
set up different profiles it may be more
than one person uses the laptop they
they could get access so they could use
their own applications but your files
and your profile can still be protected
by your finger so you've also got a low
profile backlit keyboard it looks like
has a few stages here and here's the
real magic trick by simply folding it
over you can completely change the way
that you interact with it now you're
watching Netflix now you're watching
movies that you've got stored on there's
complete up YouTube how about a little
unbox therapy possibly this
vertical has four separate modes this
being one of them folded completely flat
where it turns into a tablet as you can
see here I could actually have this as
my input method like that there's the
mode I spoke about earlier which takes
up very little space laptop mode if
you're getting into the content creation
you want to type up a document speakers
you might think because it's so thin
you're making some sort of compromise HP
went out of their way here to do the
military standards testing and this is
actually designed to pass twelve
different standards tests including drop
test so does feel solid even though it's
incredibly thin and light you can get
the full-fledged core i7 processors in
here from Intel that'll be your
selection now another thing you might
have noticed are these keys up here
these are dedicated buttons for Skype
for business the idea here is to give
you quick access to Skype for business
functionality take a look at that that's
4k content and here's an example of how
you can shoot 4k content enjoy it on a
convertible like this the future is now
look at this do you ever think the
laptop could do all this for some reason
that feels so cool putting it completely
flat so there you have it the EliteBook
x 360 from HP unveiled right here in Las
Vegas at CES
