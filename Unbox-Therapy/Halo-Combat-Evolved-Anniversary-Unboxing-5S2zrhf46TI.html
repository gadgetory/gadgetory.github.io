therapy you're looking at halo combat
Evolved this is the anniversary it's got
some DLC inside so I'm gonna get you
guys a closer look as you know I was out
shopping today I picked up a bunch of
stuff we're having a bit of an unboxing
marathon here on the channel tonight
this is video number three so if you're
sticking with me
thank goodness for you you guys make
this possible anyways let's talk about
the actual game unboxing the first thing
you'll notice is that this particular
Edition comes with a paper sleeve on the
outside the sleeve is actually a little
bit nicer looking than the game case
itself it's actually got a textured logo
I wish they had a reversed it and put
the external case as the internal case
and have that nice logo on there like
that but obviously they're trying to
save a few bucks so I'm not gonna
complain too much as you open up the
case here you'll notice you got the game
disc on the right and the DLC on the
left you're gonna get the exclusive
grunt funeral skull now it was supposed
to be only for the pre-order but you can
get these particular anniversary
editions anywhere so you're still going
to get the pre-order bonuses you're also
going to get the Master Chief avatar for
your xbox live of course and I'll give
you a closer look at this particular
pamphlet in a second here there you can
see a better look at the exclusive grunt
funeral skull and then below this piece
of DLC there's also some more
downloadable content it is the
anniversary map pack 6 Classic
multiplayer maps reimagine as you guys
know this game is a throwback so it's
gonna peak your nostalgia obviously most
people have played halo at this point at
some point in their lives and I can't
wait to throw it into the Xbox and have
some personal nostalgia as well pull out
that pistol get a little pistol action
going so here you can see heroes never
die
it's 100% faithful gameplay but new
graphics and HD and 3d if you like of
course co-op play over Xbox Live the
multiplayer maps have been reimagined
and there's new challenges enhance story
and more so for anybody who was a Halo
fan big Halo fan in the past you might
want to take a look at this baby here
you can see that it's one to two players
or co-op it's got 3d support full 1080p
which is nice and it's
optimize for hard drive for better
performance so real cool anyway guys the
only thing I regret is that they didn't
they didn't put that nice sort of finish
on the interior case that would have
been cool although I know they don't do
that very often different cases steel
bookcases they cost big money and this
was a cheap game so anyway guys if you
like this content hopefully you can like
and favorite this video as it does help
me out a bunch and if you haven't
checked out the channel yet if you
haven't subscribed you might want to go
ahead and do that if you do like this
kind of content otherwise for you big
hardcore fans the ones that make this
possible stick around the channel the
marathon will continue I got that crazy
headset coming up next alright guys I'll
see you real soon later</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
