experimental legitimately experimental
this thing in front of me is on the
fringe it is a new development it looks
from a distance like a pair of
headphones but really it's doing
something it's doing a lot more
potentially you've got to look at the
studies for yourself this thing is
called halo sport and it is a brain
stimulating device I'm a little bit
nervous about trying it out to be quite
honest there's all kinds of trials that
have gone on with various athletes from
different sports and people are seeing
improvement from wearing this headset
and training their brain putting their
brain in a particular state before the
training begins by stimulating a certain
part of the brain that is directly
connected to motor skills lifting
lifting weights building muscle strength
and performing particular tasks that go
along with a sports now I've been told
there is a little weird sensation when
you wear it a little tingling it is
actually kind of shocking your brain
sort of I don't know let's check it out
all right so halo sport the company is
called halo neuroscience so very nice
packaging so far Oh whoo back to refresh
some replacement ear cups right and left
I like that as a around the ear style
big fan of that but these are the magic
without these you got nothing now these
use moisture you actually spray them
with a little bit of water before you
use I'm going to use moisture to sort of
help them penetrate I guess or notices
to build up that interactivity between
your brain and the headset itself you
just install onto the headband like that
so that's what it looks like this is
what the headset looks like when you're
using it whoa you have this little spray
bottle pull these off spray em alright
so there's an app to go with it as you'd
imagine halo sport uses electrical
currents for contact I knew it
all right you saw step completely
saturate this thing
and install them on there here we go I
mean they sound like your average set of
high-end headphones so they didn't they
didn't skimp on that front Jack here's
what we do we take them out to the ice
rink again
okay so I've been wearing this thing
around for a little bit one thing I know
that these spikes on the top they have
to be saturated I went back into the
locker room I got them more soaked than
they were before and we have immediate
conductivity here so you can see you can
decrease or increase the amplitude does
the amount that you feel you can select
which area of your body you're training
whether it's your hands and figures with
a right emphasis less emphasis or legs
corn arms for hockey I think hands and
fingers with the right emphasis it's
probably best for me and the sessions
about to be 20 minutes so this is what
it might look like if I was using this
to train a particular skill maybe
stickhandling passing shooting whatever
it might be out here obviously we're not
going to see results immediately but the
goal here is to go out take out a little
bit I'll start the session we'll see
what happens we'll see how much I feel
it on my head - alright here we go 20
minutes starting
now obviously we're not going to key
improvements immediately but the goal
here is that right now my brain is
supposedly in some special state of
neuroplasticity so that these movements
are more likely to stick after I'm done
with this particular workout also keep
in mind these are headphones so follow
if I needed some music to get more
amplified right now and up the workout I
could do that too we think that likes to
have a little little prove their weight
hey huh think your body's like writing
information like your brains an SSD or
something you'll load me up with the
lesson on kick handling or something I
don't know if a lot of people were
skeptical as well I got to be clear what
you got guys like calm calm soup was
kept a lot of people talking a big game
about these youngsters on the team let
me tell you something I got I could
teach these youngsters a thing or two
you got to bring on the veteran presence
uncle Lou's your guy all right hit me up
phone lines are open
some of you are probably wondering like
hey man what did that feel like on your
head it's kind of like a pins and
needles feeling it's like it's uh if
your legs fell asleep or something like
that or you don't talk about it's that
kind of feeling but at the top of your
skull so now the session is complete by
the session they're referring to the
headset portion so now theoretically I
take this off and my mind is in this
position it's hyper plasticity position
now so I've got an hour here this would
be the equivalent to going straight into
action now like I'm actually going to
whether it's exercise or again who
really knows how this technology is
going to be used
who knows if I'm going to drop dead on
my way out was it worth it I hope we
brought the heat for you then what we
aim to do at the project trust the
process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
