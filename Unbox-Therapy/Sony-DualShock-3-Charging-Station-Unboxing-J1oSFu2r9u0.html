and today we're taking a look at the
DualShock 3 charging station now this is
an official Sony accessory I've seen
similar things from third-party
manufacturers that have been out longer
but I have not been impressed by the
stuff they've put out there either too
flimsy or there's too many flashing
lights all over them and I'm not a big
fan of flashing lights
no offense Kanye but anyway let's see if
we can get inside this box and check out
Sony's offering this box is a little bit
like Fort Knox I'm not going to make you
sit through my struggle so the first
thing we're going to see is the adapter
plates for the controllers they're
really light so you don't have to worry
about leaving those on the controllers
all the time it's not going to change
them too much
the next thing we've got is the power
adapter and power cable and the nice
thing about that is that you can plug
these into the wall to charge them which
is going to charge them a little bit
faster and it's also going to free up
those USB ports on your PlayStation the
next thing we have is a little bit of
paperwork from Sony we're going to go
ahead and throw that into oblivion there
is no need for instructions on such a
simple device so the next thing we got
is the unit the main unit and this thing
feels like it's got some good way to it
I mean it feels sturdy better than those
aforementioned options and here's a
closer look at the contacts and also
where your power plug gets inserted so
here's that power adapter a pretty small
power brick should be easy enough to
hide and you got a right angle connector
on this side so you can slide it up in
there and make sure it stays hidden so
the next thing we've got is our adapter
plates and these things basically
convert your mini USB port into a set of
contacts that then make contact with the
charging station so you guys know what
I'm talking about and as I mentioned
they're really light and once you've got
them inserted in the controller let's
see if I can figure this out there's
those contacts I was talking about so
once you've got this inserted in the
controller it doesn't add too much bulk
at all in fact you can't even really
tell it's on there
as I turn the controller over here
you'll see it exposes these contacts
here and there's also a little clip on
there so you can kind of tell when it's
made proper contact in the dock and as
you're using it as a controller it
doesn't affect the usability at all as
far as I can see
so the charger you just drop that baby
right on there and you'll hear a little
tiny click and when you see those lights
start flashing you'll know you're in
business so I like the appearance
overall it's understated you know basic
straightforward industrial design the
way it should be and here's what it
looks like next to my gaming setup a lot
better than the previous way I had it
with USB cables going crazy all over the
place anyway guys I hope you'll click
that like and favorite button it's those
two buttons that help to promote my
content here on YouTube which in turn
allows me to produce more stuff for you
to watch anyway guys until next time
