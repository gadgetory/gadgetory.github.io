therapy and today we're taking a look at
the xi3
modular computer it's been called the
steam box by many but it is in no way
affiliated with valve it's not
manufactured by them or endorsed by them
though I can totally see why it's being
called a steam box because it would
function very well in that fashion this
device was the big story at CES and we
were lucky enough to get our hands on
one to do a proper unboxing as you guys
can tell it's a small box comparative to
my hands and this is a fully functioning
computer so it is quite the feat of
engineering and the reason many are
calling it a steam box is because it
would be right at home underneath your
television next to your other consoles
it's small lightweight doesn't use a lot
of power and it doesn't make very much
noise the ventilation happens straight
through the unit through these two
grills that live on each side so you get
a lot of airflow in there you've got
some paperwork included in the unboxing
this is just a quick start guide as well
as some warranty information and then
you've got a power brick and to go with
that a power cable of course the power
brick is external here well after all
the unit is so small you wouldn't expect
the power brick to be built in and this
is a modular computer as well so there
are some components that are actually
upgradable which is really crazy
considering the form factor this one has
a dual core Athlon processor
it's a 3400 drawing 22 watts of power
and has two gigabytes of ddr2 with SSDs
starting at 16 gigabytes and all the way
up to 480 gigs on the back is where
you'll find all the different ports for
all your interface means that's where
you're gonna find your Ethernet port as
well as your video ports DisplayPort DVI
got a power input as well as a bunch of
USB es over on the right-hand side
you've also got sound in and out so you
are capable of hooking up a headset if
you want to use a wired headset with
this device but if you've got it under
your television you'll probably want to
use a wireless USB headset or something
along those lines instead you can also
hook up a wireless keyboard and mouse if
you want to game on it from your couch
or you can go with one of the valve or
steam approved wireless controllers they
can be mapped to some of the popular
steam game
anyways as you guys can tell this is an
interesting device unlike some other
stuff that's on the market maybe it is
the world's first steam box I mean if
that's the way people are using it here
you can see what it looks like
underneath my flat panel and hopefully I
get a chance to play it real soon here
and give you guys a better overview of
just what it can do thanks as always for
watching and I'll catch you guys on the
next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
