continues to produce things to show here
on unbox therapy things you're about to
get zany today I'm gonna show you how to
turn any surface this is what they're
telling me any surface into a speaker
it's called the rocket 3.0 plug it stick
it rock it connect it to an audio source
and then attach this little unit to any
surface and now you've got a speaker
we've got a few things down here that
we're gonna test out and see if this is
actually true rocket uses bins boxes
travel umbrellas cars beds cups lamps
printers printers alright let's check it
out we're friends forever that is that's
the rocket 3.0 so USB on one end and
then audio and USB on the other some
extra sticky pads because that's how
this thing works it's sticks little user
manual we're gonna try not to read that
on the back you've got an on/off switch
volume control and audio import and then
there's also a built-in mini jack cable
obviously not for use in your iPhone 7
but it and the cable look at that isn't
that nifty this is the magic part sticky
piece is what will turn anything into a
speaker if you keep this little guy in
your pocket and you're ready to turn
anything into a speaker at all times
let's give it a shot so I picked a
couple of everyday household items glass
bowl an iPhone box mountain dew can look
at that now I'm told that the more
hollow an object the better it's gonna
sound or the louder so I don't know
let's give that a shot what does it
sound like if it's not connected to
anything let's see
so it's vibrating but super quiet now
let's see what happens that is weird
I'm just gonna try just the table okay
what what's going on here
iPhone Box Tops
is this like speakers technology right
now do we just uncover something here
hahaha the OE bottle let's try this big
box right here
what is going online you now box why
does the fighting boxes work so well
give me the science jack that is by far
the loudest fad yet by far ha ha ha
that is bizarre my whole brain shaking
right now
stick it to anything I mean it's pretty
crazy you stick it to anything and
you're gonna amplify your music find
yourself a box find yourself a flat
surface you got yourself a party</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
