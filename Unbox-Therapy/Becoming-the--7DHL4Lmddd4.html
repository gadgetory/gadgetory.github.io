and I've got a very special presentation
for you today this is not your average
everyday unboxing video what you were
watching is one of the most ambitious
projects ever attempted here on unbox
therapy you can see a bunch of JBL micro
tubes being poured out on the unboxing
surface and that's because we are about
to construct something I like to call
the sound trooper now before I give you
the full details let's talk a little bit
about the JBL micro 2 which is the
device that makes the sound trooper
possible ever since my unboxing video on
this particular device I've been amazed
at its ability to daisy chain to other
micro tubes for those of you that are
unfamiliar with this device it's a
portable speaker for your cell phone has
a little mini jack connector that comes
out of it a rechargeable battery and the
very first time I set my eyes upon and I
said I wonder just how many of these
things you could daisy chain together it
turns out JBL was just as interested as
me in finding out so they sent a bunch
out but rather than just plug them all
in and show you guys how they function I
decided to go a step further maybe two
steps further to find out what these
things can really do
do
you
so as you guys can tell I've gravitated
towards industrial-strength velcro and
hockey equipment these items in
conjunction with the 20 JBL micro two's
will form the sound trooper now this is
a very serious operation and watch guys
to pay very close attention to the
construction it's going to require us to
cut this industrial velcro into small
squares in order to maintain
connectivity between our JBL micro twos
and the shoulder pads which will act as
the vehicle for sound in the public
atmosphere so without further ado I'm
going to leave you with the construction
and the wiring and you will see the
finished product and myself as I become
the sound trooper
you
so
it's all
but
that's awesome that's awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
