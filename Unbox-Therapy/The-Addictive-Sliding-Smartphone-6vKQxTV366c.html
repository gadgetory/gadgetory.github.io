out of innovative and interesting and
dare I say magical ways to deal with
this screen to body ratio obsession you
get met with some new form factor today
we've got the latest to unveil itself
this is the honor magic too
this is a slider phone like the old days
it was a slider phone this one is kind
of different in the sense that the goal
here is to unveil or hide the
front-facing camera equipment now if you
watched the previous video Nubia another
smartphone maker attempted to get this
maximum screen to body ratio by moving
another screen onto the back of the
device it's kind of exciting it's
imaginative and why not who knows what
the proper implementation is maybe it's
this this model in front of me has eight
gigs of RAM and a hundred and twenty
eight gigs of storage now this is only
available currently in certain regions
I've got the Chinese writing here on the
unit itself
type C cable a type C audio adapter
because there is no headphone jack on
this device the headphone jack continues
to be neglected now you're gonna notice
right away it's got a crazy ambitious
camera set up on the rear three camera
modules here including the bottom unit
and then of course AI vision is written
on there so I'm assuming the camera has
some degree of AI capabilities the
construction feels pretty good it's
weighty it's all glass and metal very
nice but here is the action this is what
you've been waiting for boom oh man that
is satisfying I expected it to be
satisfying it's like an adult fidget
spinner if these things become popular
if this becomes the de-facto standard
smartphone bezel list implementation
you're gonna have a bunch of people
sitting around doing this this is rated
for many more uses than whatever motor
might be inside some of those other
implementations okay let me put this up
Wow
that is a cool wallpaper or you guys see
in the action
there it's animated it does have a bit
of a chin I mean some people get mad
about this cuz it's not completely
symmetrical this doesn't really bug me
that much it protects the clean aspect
ratio no bulges no notches as you can
see the display goes to the top boom
boom there you go you need to take a
front-facing image you need to take a
selfie your quick bit of a magic trick
dare I say I think the ladies are gonna
love that right there you see and just
an addictive fidgety thing to begin with
as I mentioned before whole my god if I
carry this thing around I'm having
conversations like go on ah interesting
very nice yeah pardon see that again
it's a little much let's launch the
camera it's like hey slide it down okay
very nice there's beauty happening I'm I
am NOT this beautiful beauty level zero
that's better that's pretty nice it's
realistic how many megapixels on this
front camera will that's a 16 megapixel
front-facing image the crazy part is I
don't even take that many selfies in
real life and part of me feels like a
lot of you guys are in the same boat so
it's it's it's amazing the engineering
workarounds that companies are having to
come up with to solve a problem that
most people only face from time to time
see what I did face face the problem
face the problem from time to time okay
so the display is F HD plus it is also
OLED it's quite vibrant is that the type
of display you can get behind a job
okay now other considerations of course
the earpiece it's able through a channel
there to feed through this region I
believe it's just a mono speaker but I
don't know I'll give it a try here
it feels like there's a tiny bit of
sound coming out of the earpiece section
the vast majority is coming out of the
bottom grill here so there's nothing
special it's getting the job done it's
an average speaker I thought there might
be a bit of a compromise with the whole
sliding action it seems most if not all
99% of the sound is coming out of this
little bottom unit 6.39 inch device it's
actually kind of crazy to get that
screen size but like in this grip it's
got the ki-rin 980 it should also have
the night mode I'm guessing for photo
does go pitch-black let's see what
happens look at this that's in pitch
black like it's just it's it's bringing
life to the darkness it's pitch black in
here ladies and gentlemen so it's got
the crazy night mode battery is 3,500
milliamp hours nothing crazy it's
probably more of a marvel of engineering
than you can possibly fully appreciate
from where you're at when you hold it
it's like man it feels surprisingly
practical and like less of a gimmick
then you might think when you first saw
the announcement or saw the images
floating around online price-wise it's
gonna be somewhere flagship territory
between six and seven hundred bucks it's
only gonna be sold in certain markets so
you're gonna have to check that out for
yourself I'll try to track down a link
and put it in the description but right
now the thing is just kind of hard to
get your hands on especially if you're
like me here in North America you guys
are gonna have to decide is this the
type of implementation that brands
should be going for is this acceptable
to you it kind of feels like too much
for a function that really doesn't get
utilized that much if you're gonna be
doing this all day and it's like how
often are you really using that
front-facing camera and then the rest of
the time are you just goofing around
like this doing thousands of movements
and cycles
on the slider nonetheless you got to
respect the feat of engineering the
honor magic too
I'm gonna slide my way out of here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
