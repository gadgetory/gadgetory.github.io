something you see every day at least
nowadays this is an instant camera
meaning just like those old Polaroids
it's going to spit out an actual hard
copy of your image almost
instantaneously after taking it this is
the fujifilm instax 210 and it actually
is a lot cooler than those old Polaroids
because it does some stuff that those
didn't maybe most importantly as it
shoots wide picture format so you're
going to get sort of a different aspect
ratio output then that sort of square
box you used to get with those Polaroids
anyway here we are looking at our
documentation that's obviously our user
manual along with our warranty
information not the coolest stuff but
she's part of it here is the camera
strap which is actually going to maybe
be necessary it's a fairly large camera
believe it or not here is a close-up
lens adapter which is actually quite
necessary because the standard lenses
out at 95 millimeters so that's going to
allow you to do some close-ups now let's
get a look at the body itself as you can
see it's substantial you're saying this
ain't any point-and-shoot little digital
camera that's for sure we pull it out
here
I mean it's not that heavy as big as it
looks it only weighs in at 650 grams but
it's a it's kind of cool to hold
especially in this age where everything
is you know miniature this has got some
some meat to it brings me back to the
old days anyway here's our controls on
the side there you can see where the
pictures come out of the top your that's
your output and here we can see the
front with the lens which is hidden by
that door and of course the auto
adjusting flash along with the shutter
and here's something cool batteries are
included and their Panasonic batteries
so let's celebrate that oh we're going
to get some closer looks at the camera
right here so there you can see it's a
95 millimeter lens keep in mind this
camera is going to take Instax film so
you got a sort of budget for that the
viewfinder is called a reverse Galilean
style you actually actually have a
little LCD on here which displays the
number of remaining exposures and of
course the lens is going to be the auto
retracting style with the auto closing
lens cover hit up our channel cool
coming out of boxes all the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
