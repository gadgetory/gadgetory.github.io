long time here in a channel and let's
make a video about Beats headphones now
they're very popular they've recently
got purchased by Apple and that has all
kinds of implications and that's the
reason for this video right here but in
general these are very expensive
headphones and they're not going to be
for everybody that said the beats solo 3
Wireless are the first headphones
available to take advantage of Apple's
new pairing process course we'll be
testing them out as well on the back
here you can see wireless Bluetooth
battery for 40 hours 5 minute charge
equals 3 hours of play that's I mean
that's pretty good special edition rose
gold look at this oh very factory fresh
inside nice little carrying pouch a
carabiner when Jack was a kid his
nickname was actually beans so let's
bring it back hit the comments section
say hello to beans let's see how many
beans we can get in the comment section
ain't that right beans and then there's
a cable you might want to use these with
something other than an iPhone I like to
use them on the airplane and of course
as you know there's no bluetooth to the
airplanes entertainment system and every
so often you've got you've got a banger
on there that you just need to watch are
you gonna get there cheeseball
headphones they've got on the airplane
or are you gonna use your own anyway
it's in their unboxing experience a plus
as usual factory-fresh smell on another
level look at that rose gold rep the
rose gold folks for now these are the
very first ones that have this new
streamlined wireless pairing process
adjustable the ear cups are on ear style
ooh so you got a button there play/pause
this is where you'll connect your cable
if you choose to go that route here's
your microUSB for charging it up and
here's your power indicator which shows
that I've got full battery right now and
this guy is starting to flash assuming
that it is ready to be paired to a phone
so look
oh my camera I didn't do I didn't do
anything
unlocked to connect okay click there
touch ID connecting done shows me the
battery life 100% battery life and I'm
done it's the little things so now if
you're using the same iCloud account
across devices those devices now
recognize the existence of these
headphones if it's a laptop an iPad an
Apple watch it all interacts like a
happy family let's test out the sound
do I have SoundCloud on here yet come on
lumen get your act together look at that
I got the RoboCup still on there I told
you already Total Recall Terminator
bloodsport Van Damme in the day time I
need to tell you I need to do something
about the beats thing here super popular
then you got us people on the Internet
and we're all like there are other
headphones in the world and uh have you
ever heard of Sennheiser and very
various other German names ah tech
people just chill out a little bit all
right please because what you're doing
is your juice you're putting yourself in
a silo and you're isolating yourself
from the rest of the world the rest of
the world is complicated just like
everywhere else in life perception is
reality there's marketing there's
endorsements that's all it's a whole
package
you don't walk up to some woman with a
Gucci bag and slap it out of there and
go you could have been carrying a
shopping bag this is a package deal and
in reality if you want a certain image
you always pay for that image branding
it's sophisticated if LeBron James has
to have phones on for years it matters
that is going to affect perception maybe
my coffee was extra strong today okay
I feel like this product the beats brand
it's not as good as people think but
it's not as bad as people think if you
know what I'm saying
there's an accentuation on the low end
they're expensive that I will agree with
you on the ease of connectivity that's
going to be meaningful to people it's
going to be valuable to people stop
harassing people who wear rose gold
headphones they're enjoying themselves
just like you I'm just gonna get lost in
these rose gold solos all right leave me
alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
