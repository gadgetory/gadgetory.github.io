therapy and today we're taking a look at
Gran Turismo 5 this is the collector's
edition now I'm obviously a little bit
late to the party in terms of this
unboxing here but I was down in Vegas
for CES 2012 and while down there I had
to make a trip to the Sony store at
Caesar's Palace when I did I saw this
thing sitting on the shelf there for
only $69 I decided to bite the bullet
pick it up and unbox it for you guys as
soon as I got back home so anyways let's
talk about the unboxing see what's
included here for the 69 bucks and see
if it's worthwhile so the outside box
has a big v on it the internal carton
has a big v on it they're obviously very
proud of the fact that they've done five
versions of Gran Turismo and rightfully
so all good titles up until this point
that is for certain on the Left we've
got the game disc and hiding underneath
is a certificate of authenticity now
that's always important to verify that
your Edition is legitimate you know I
wasn't too concerned about that in the
first place after all I picked this
thing up from the Sony store but this is
nice to have it's a commemorative thing
to be honest with you guys you get your
number stamped in there as well as a
signature from a Japanese dude that's
always something you want to hold on to
now he's the CEO of the company alright
that's why he signed it next you've got
kind of like an art book or guide I
don't know what you want to call it but
or even a directory maybe it's got all
the different vehicles from the game the
different tracks some attributes of the
different cars pretty cool information
in here for all of you Gran Turismo
enthusiasts you definitely want to take
a look through this either while you're
playing the game on pause or maybe just
for leisure a little bit of bedtime
reading who knows I don't care however
you want to do it next we've got the
commemorative keychain I believe this
has done up in stainless steel some kind
of brushed situation going on here and
you've got the GT logo on there to let
everybody know you're a superfan it's
actually a pretty nice keychain I'm not
going to lie and lastly I suppose this
is probably the most interesting element
of this particular edition you have a
model car a scale vehicle of the knee
I'm GTR made by Kyosho which sounds like
a Japanese company I'm sure that it is
although it is made in China and this
product is an accurate scale model and
not a toy not suitable for children
under 14 if you were under 14 years old
leave this video right now this is too
dangerous nah I don't even know why they
say that this thing is one piece I don't
know what a child's going to do with it
I guess they can rip components off chew
em up
you know choke on them or I sure as hell
hope not that would be a pretty gruesome
scene anyways this model is actually
really nice you get the legitimate rims
on there all the different sponsorship
decals and whatnot all around the
exterior and it's a scale model so it
actually does a decent job of
representing the full-size vehicle as
you can see it says it's a collector's
edition exclusive down along the bottom
and I have to say I'm impressed with it
as a little model car I mean that's what
it is so lastly we've got the game disc
and I'm not expecting any surprises in
here but there will be the DLC for some
extra in-game vehicles you know you got
to like when they give you DLC all the
all the things the you know external why
am I saying external all the what do I
want to say material objects that come
along are nice but you want to get
something special something extra in the
game as well to add to your experience
and as you can see here some of the
artwork inside is real nice here is that
DLC I talked about it's one of those
scratching wind-style and you know
that's always good so you guys can't
snag that coat off me I told you you did
it before you're not going to do it
again and lastly we've got the guide the
manual little slim manual better than
those triple page folders though so
anyway guys if you enjoyed this content
