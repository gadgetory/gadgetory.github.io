Lew here back with a brand new video and
today it's all about the iPhone 6 as I'm
sure you know it's early in the morning
and I've got two of them in front of me
a gold as well as a Space Gray and then
I have two more that are coming at noon
that's when I'll get the 6 plus as well
as a 128 gigabyte 6 now that sounds like
a lot of iPhones that's because I'm
gonna do what I usually do and give one
back to you guys so just make sure
you're subscribed if you're new to the
channel hit the subscribe button and
more information about that giveaway is
coming up very shortly but let's not
hesitate any further let's take a look
at these two initial iPhones now these
are our 64 gigabyte models I think
that's sort of the best value 16 gigs
doesn't seem like enough these days in
my opinion and 128 gigs I probably
wouldn't personally use so here we have
the Space Gray iPhone 6 that is a nice
size I have to admit I am a little bit
worried about the size of the 6 plus
having played with the dummy units I
think it's a little bit large for
one-handed operation that's my opinion
but of course I'll have that comparison
coming up shortly on the channel so
let's go ahead and remove the plastic
here that's always a very fun part you
know it's really comfortable it's a
little bit heavier than the dummy unit
which is to be expected I like the fact
that on the Space Gray model the antenna
isn't quite as much of an eyesore as it
might be on the other model so since you
have this protruding camera now it's
probably gonna make some sense to put a
case on your device and there are a few
options that are out there of course
there's the official Apple case which is
expensive and then you've got some stuff
on Amazon that may or may not have been
rushed out in order to meet the demand
of the new iPhone in many cases they
didn't actually have a physical device
they just based their case design off of
a mock-up which as we know they're not
identical by any means so a good option
for you and I'll put a link in the
description for more details on it is a
company called zu goo I
we've been using their products for a
while and they're having a crazy sale on
hi phone six case pre-orders right now
four dollars for the iPhone 6 case and
five dollars for the six Plus case
that's coming down from a regular price
of $15.99 and $19.99 so an insane value
there it comes in a bunch of different
colors and the main thing here is to
sort of take away some of the risk
especially if you drop your phone
straight down flat on the glass since
the case provides a little bit of a lip
around the edge generally speaking that
lip is going to hit the ground first and
stop the glass from shattering even a
small amount of protection thin
protection can make a big difference
with your new expensive gadgets so go
ahead and check them out with the link
in the description anyways back to the
actual device the Space Gray version of
course has the black on the front and I
think this is a good look personally you
get a little bit better immersion into
your content if you're in a dark
environment and generally speaking I'm a
fan of darker colors you have your
buttons that are now a little bit longer
than the previous version no longer a
little tiny circular ones your hold
switch is in this location up here a
camera which I already talked about as
well as a circular flash now the power
button is one of the big changes it has
moved to the side of the device now that
the device is bigger that makes a lot of
sense so that you can get a comfortable
grip and that is sort of where your
thumb naturally wants to rest the SIM
card trays in this location over here as
well and the bottom is where the
remaining ports are that's where you're
going to have your speaker microphone as
well as your lightning port and of
course the headphone jack in that
location right there now other items
inside the box we of course have your
standard Apple paperwork you have the
ear pods which come in there nice little
case here a power brick to charge up
your device and of course a lightning
cable so everything included in the box
to get you up and running with your
brand new phone let's go ahead and unbox
the second one this is the goal
version we'll do a little quick
comparison here but I'll probably do a
more comprehensive comparison video when
the other devices arrive which is
hopefully very very soon like I said I'm
hoping for around noon but anyways we at
least can see two colors against one
another here so here is the gold one you
know what and that's not a bad look
either I just sort of feel like the gold
was a big deal last year and now it's
more about the size there other things
that are new about the device besides
just color so there's not so much of a
need to make a statement with your
golden phone but anyways for some people
this is gonna be what they like best and
of course color is a subjective thing so
it looks pretty nice once again you have
this subdued gold finish champagne as it
were the white outline for the antenna
in this case as opposed to the grey
which I think blends in a little bit
better but not I'm not really a big deal
either way and then on the front you've
got a white bezel which some people like
again a little bit flash here you have
this gold ring around the touch ID
sensor so a subjective thing you're
gonna have to decide for yourself which
color you like best actually let me know
down in the comments if you could get
any iPhone 6 which color would you like
and also are you more interested in the
six plus or the regular six let's go
ahead and boot these up make sure
nothing is do I owe the boot up screens
are a little different so you have a
white boot up screen on the white
version and a black boot up screen with
a white Apple logo on the Space Gray
version they feel better than the
dummies which again is to be expected
they don't feel big comparative to the
old one not as not as much as I expected
so there we go
we have these startup screens hello in a
number of different languages I'm not
going to set these things up completely
right now for the sake of keeping this
video relatively short and to the point
but as I mentioned before I have way too
many iPhones coming in today so if you
want your shot at winning one just make
sure to be a subscriber and I will have
some more comprehensive comparisons on
their way as the other phones arrive
most specifically the 6 plus vs.
the six from a form-factor perspective
just stay tuned to the channel like I
said subscribe if you haven't yet and
lots more iPhone 6 stuff coming up very
shortly just wanted to get you guys a
quick unboxing video just like the old
days very close to the actual moment of
launch hope you guys appreciate it if
you do leave a thumbs up down below and
other than that I will catch you on the
next episode later guys
