another video and today we're checking
out something that I think is quite
interesting this is the asou SPAD phone
X which is a smart phone as well as a
tablet and then if you add the mobile
dock it's also like a little netbook so
a very versatile device and the phone
itself has flagship specifications kind
of an all-in-one jack-of-all-trades type
of device let's open this up and take a
closer look at the PadFone X now this is
the AT&amp;amp;T version it is sold I believe
exclusively on AT&amp;amp;T right now and you
can pick it up for 199 bucks on contract
so a pretty good value if you think
about it with the flagship
specifications you're kind of getting a
tablet as well as a smart phone not kind
of you are getting a tablet as well as a
smart phone although the phone is the
tablet so on and so forth you guys catch
my drift now we're not gonna read
through too much of this instead we're
gonna look at the actual product so this
is the docking portion easy dock the
phone to activate the PadFone station
you have your volume rockers over here
power switch I'm just gonna take this
plastic off right now one thing I like
right off the bat without looking any
further is the forward facing speakers
you don't see that on every single
tablet and that is obviously a welcome
addition because you're gonna get a lot
better audio quality having speakers
facing you instead of away from you
forward facing camera as well as I flip
it over you'll notice the section for
the actual phone to dock the PadFone the
connector is at the bottom here of
course we've got to grab the phone in
order to utilize that so I'm gonna place
this to the side for a moment underneath
we have the actual phone and you can see
of course texting and driving it can
wait
pull this off wireless charging and if
see built in that's always cool so there
we have it
the PadFone X the actual phone portion
pretty comfortable to hold not the
tiniest a bezel in the world but a
pretty nice sturdy feeling phone it is
plastic on the back but a kind of soft
touch plastic over here we have the
rear-facing 13 megapixel camera there's
a speaker here as well as a flash
microUSB down on the bottom you've got
your power switch in this convenient
location where your thumb would normally
live as well as your volume rocker in
that location on the top is where you'll
find your headphone jack a microphone
another microphone at the bottom of
course and of course this is what's
gonna dock into the tablet portion I'll
show you that in a moment but first
we're just gonna check out the remaining
items in the box a headset we have Micro
USB charge cable you can charge up the
tablet or the phone using micro USB
that's important because the tablet has
its own independent battery and it will
charge up the phone so I believe it's
4,000 plus milliamp hours in the tablet
so even carrying it around as an extra
source of power for your phone or if
you're going on a long trip or something
like that it's kind of a convenient way
of making sure that your main
communication device always has power
here is the USB power brick and then
last little portion here is just
warranty card and some important notes I
believe that is everything yes that's
definitely everything let's get some
more room and have some fun folks this
form factor has actually been around a
little while this idea of pairing phone
and a tablet into one seamless device
but it's the first time that it's making
a big splash here in the North American
market where you can actually pick it up
subsidized through AT&amp;amp;T for a similar
cost to a regular flagship device so
let's go ahead and dock this I'll show
you guys how this fits in very
conveniently slides down friction fit
and then
click at the bottom now when the device
is powered on you also get a vibration
to let you know that you have connected
it correctly and it's not gonna fall out
either so you can see here if I shake it
a little bit it's in there in a sturdy
enough fashion that it won't fall out
but if you do want to remove it it also
will come out fairly easily with just a
little bit of a push so anyways that's
how it fits in now we'll check out the
ergonomics with the phone insert it's
not you know what it's not as heavy as I
expected it to be with the phone
inserted of course there's a bulge on
the back but you don't really hold it
there anyways you hold it in this
location here now it does have a large
bezel and I've seen some people
complaining about that but from from my
perspective you need a place to put your
thumbs anyways on a tablet unlike a
phone which you hold in one hand and the
bezel is just getting in the way on the
tablet you know you've got two hands on
it you've got two thumbs so a little bit
of a bezel is not such a huge dealer
anyways just going around this device I
don't think we did yet you've got volume
which is remapped over here to your left
hand you've got a microUSB as I said
before to charge the internal battery on
the tablet portion your power switch is
up in this location right here now the
camera will continue to function from
the phone even when using the tablet so
if you launch the camera app from the
tablet you'll essentially be using this
camera here in this flash etc the
speaker's of course you won't be using
this speaker why would you want to so
anyways I mentioned I have a couple of
other devices over here not devices but
accessories to go with the PadFone edge
so you might as well look at those
before I power this device up first we
have this right here the PadFone X
mobile dock it has a trackpad built in
of course a full keyboard it's also
going to be a friction fit so there's no
like magnetic or mechanical clasp it
just sort of fits in there and uses
bluetooth the positive side of that is
that you can use it when it's not
attached so if you want to have your
tablet resting somewhere else and this
on your lap too tight this also has a
built in battery but it's not going to
be like extra battery power for your
device because you've already got the
extra battery backup of the tablet
instead
this is gonna be battery powered
for the Bluetooth control at the
keyboard and it is rechargeable via
microUSB as well you're gonna get a lot
of battery life since it's a fairly
basic functionality this is plastic but
it's got like a little brushed feel to
it actually pretty weighty
let me go ahead here and just give it a
quick test so you know it basically
functions as you'd expect just like you
know any other keyboard
it's obviously not huge but functional
and if this becomes your main device
your main travel device this could be a
great way to get through a bunch of
emails without having to tap on screen
that tactile feedback is always positive
when you're doing a lot of typing of
course you could also close the device
down and turn it into a netbook sort of
so one device for everything at least
that's the concept let me go ahead and
fit this in real quick so anyways there
you have it that's that's sort of your
form factor you're going to be looking
at and as I mentioned you can set it to
a number of different angles even at the
most open angle it's not completely
top-heavy where it's gonna flip over you
have enough weight in the dock to keep
it sitting in this setting right here
and of course you can close it down
completely like this and then you end up
with this kind of package your use case
scenario can dictate how you're gonna
travel with and how you're going to use
all of these different components the
other benefit here is that you can
answer phone calls right on this device
so if you've got an incoming phone call
through the application manager the
software that's built right in to deal
with this particular functionality you
can answer that phone call locally and
have a ton of battery life to back up
your phone again this is all about
finding one communication device to
carry with you and not have to worry
about multiple devices okay so there we
go
we are completely booted up right now so
you can see here you're running Android
4.4.2 and when you insert this into the
tablet and just open this up real quick
when we need cert this into the tablet
that's when the magic happens watch this
slide this down I get a nice little buzz
and booyah
we have tablet action happening right
now and just like that instantaneously
you've taken your experience to a larger
platform so you'll see here you have the
PadFone assistant and this is where
things get really interesting on this
device you can pick a specific charging
setting you have intelligent mode which
manages the battery power requirements
of the pad phone right you have the
phone preferred mode which the PadFone
station will always supply power to the
pad phone so it will consistently be
providing power from its battery to the
phone and then you have the power pack
mode which when you are outdoors and the
pad phone is running out of battery the
PadFone station can be used as a
charging pack so anyways a couple of
different modes here for dealing with
power consumption on your main device
and the tablet intelligent mode is going
to do its best job to balance the power
between both devices so you've also got
this setting for incoming calls where
you can select to retrieve an answer you
can simply remove the foam portion from
the pad phone and answer calls as you
normally would
you can also answer calls directly here
on the tablet or you can have it so that
you need to remove the pad phone and
click answer call not sure why you'd
want that but that's another option of
course there's also answering mode so if
you've got a Bluetooth headset you can
set that as your preferred of course if
you have this large device here you
don't have a bluetooth headset you could
use the speakerphone as well to answer
that phone call so a number of specific
options that are hamp handled by this
pad phone assistant widget that suze has
built into this device obviously not a
stock Android kind of thing but you need
some special handling for device that is
so unique the screen is 1920 by 1200 and
the screen on the phone is 9
in twenty by ten eighty so relatively
high resolution on both the devices of
course you're gonna get a bigger picture
on the tablet so if you're doing
extensive reading or something like that
it's probably going to be a little bit
more comfortable so there are a couple
other accessories to go with the PadFone
X besides the dock and keyboard there's
also this folio bundle over here so
there is a case for the tablet as well
as the phone it is open real quick and
you probably have seen these before
they're similar to the covers that you
can get on the Samsung Galaxy products
or you know something like an iPad Smart
Cover etc so this one will fit onto the
tablet folds up here does an origami
style back so you can use it as a stand
you can see you have the cutout on the
back so that you can still dock your
phone actually let's go ahead and just
install this real quick so this will
protect the front but something cool
here as well it leaves the speaker ports
open so if you want to listen to music
or something you're still gonna have
access to those speakers even while
you're protecting the front and then on
the back you can see you still have
access to the phone for removal etc now
if we put the case on the phone
something cool here happens as well you
will need to remove the back the battery
is not removable unfortunately but
that's not that uncommon on these modern
devices and over here you have your SIM
card slot as well as a microSD slot for
expanding storage of the device it
doesn't work like a smart cover in the
sense that it won't unlock the device C
so you you know you're still locking the
device here but it just acts as a
protective shell protective barrier and
if you want to dock the device like so
can actually still do it and it will
sort of sit flat relatively flat if you
still want to use the tablet and not be
too
although I would probably find that
annoying myself I'm not a huge case guy
on phones anyways so I'll probably use
this without this special back but it's
there as an accessory if people are a
little bit more rough with their phones
than I am so I'm going to go ahead and
just reinstall these standards back now
one really cool side effect of going
with a combination like this is the fact
that you only need one data plan so if
you've got a data plan for your
smartphone then you're pretty much
covered on your tablet of course you'll
be using the built-in connection on the
phone when plugged into this device
right here so that's a value proposition
on top of the traditional set up in
which you would have data for your
tablet and your phone this is probably
an interesting device for individuals
who want a tablet and a phone and don't
want to spend a bunch of money or just
want a more seamless approach to both of
those devices you have all your
information on your phone and now you
have a slightly bigger screen when you
want it to behave more like a tablet of
course with these kinds of combinations
there are definitely compromises in this
particular case like I said the form
factor is a little bit bulky comparative
to some of the other tablets on the
market of course that's necessary in
order to allow for this transformation
to take place where you can stick a
phone into the back of it like that
right there check that out I think it's
cool I've been a fan of technology my
whole life so anytime I see these new
form factors or attempts at new form
factors it gets me excited I'm not sure
if this is going to be the killer device
that you know millions and millions of
people go out and purchase but I do
think for the right kind of person this
could be a very interesting solution so
there you have it my unboxing and
overview of the PadFone X from a soos a
very interesting device and unique I
