you I'm about to solve a huge problem in
your life well not that huge it's not
like you're dying or something but your
controller is see what I did there guys
see how I did that that's like a tagline
and it's free in this company they can
have it if they want and some dude is
speeding outside Jack call the police
was he over the speed limit he was you
could tell from the sound it was a
muffler situation do it Ryan and Reuben
home so he's talking mufflers
Ryan come say hi come say hi bring the
dance moves
bring the dance moves oh oh there he is
there he is Ryan's in town unbelievable
if that doesn't deserve a thumbs up and
I don't know what does what am i
bringing you today
this my friends is a battery attachment
charger situation for your PlayStation
controller now this affects me
personally it sounds like I'm doing a
commercial for a pharmaceutical okay
there's these little things they attach
to the controller they enhance the
battery life but more importantly than
that I'm hoping it's just a situation
where you can drop the controller on
there and you're immediately charging
I've tried different docks before where
you're getting in there and you're
trying to clip it in of course I tried
cables and you know I hate cables go
ahead and look at your PlayStation
controller any control fragile you're
gonna see these little scratch marks
around the micro USB port you know what
those scratch marks are those are failed
attempts that's you trying to find the
hole anyway listen you don't need to
hear the whole rant on cables I'm just
saying
standard controller eight hours this
baby clipped on 16 hours of play time
all right party time
then you go to bed at some point I hope
probably not but if you do go to bed you
drop it on there and then you get 16
more hours the next day now if you're
gaming more than 16 hours per day but
you're probably doing something right
because I don't know how you have that
much time on your hands to be quite
honest let's get inside and see what
this thing does my main concern here is
that it might make the situation a
little bit more bulky you know heading
over to
do the body pump like these guys over
here
hey can't trust the guy who's doing a
body here we go all right some paperwork
AC adapter oh here are the unit that
high caliber packaging right there and
this is the unit right here I like it
slim like this thing isn't going to take
up too much space
now the power adapter just comes into
the back here and then this little guy
this is the magic this is where the
magic happens now something they did
that I like they use the same texture
here as the back of the controller now
I'm not sure they might make this for
Xbox as well they probably make
something similar but anyhow click this
baby on there did alright so now it's on
it doesn't interfere with anything you
would never notice it was there I mean
you could see that it's there
maybe the controllers a tad bit heavier
I suppose when I was talking about bulk
I didn't want it to add to the grip in
any way but I mean there's still plenty
of room there for your hands what about
the charging situation let's go ahead
and see here am i fiddling around am i
the fiddler on the roof' here or am I
just
Dumbo drop you don't watch that Dumbo
drop because you brought up Vietnam
movies with Dumbo drop of Vietnam movie
that's turn using or tumble drop which
is what what is it can you drop the
troops oh I don't I think that's
something do that alright captain right
over there here we go three two one yes
that's easy how are you gonna miss how
you gonna miss that remember I told you
about those scratches those failed
attempts how many times you missed the
hole yeah missing that hole remember
that that's my player D Brown he had
that dunk where he covered his I think
it was D Brown covers the face like this
and then kind of oh boom did uncle Lew
save the day now you got 16 hours now
you got the holidays coming up right you
got Thanksgiving you got Christmas
you got the in-laws all right they're
doing this they're giving you an ear
beating and what are you doing 16 hours</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
