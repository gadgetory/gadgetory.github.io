passing Apple beating Apple it's the
first time in seven years that the top
two spots were not occupy acupuncture
the top two spots in any quarter weren't
occupied by Samsung or Apple and now
there's a company named Huawei that sits
there and that's what brings me to this
video if you didn't see that video go
watch it but this video is all about me
taking a bit of a deeper dive in a
personal way
I said personal jack what's all this
hype about like of course I've looked at
these products but have I really done my
job
did I really put the sim in and live
that life no I haven't here today we
have another switch video as much as I'm
loving the Galaxy S 9 plus I mean I'm
enjoying it let's not get carried away
it is time to change my sim over for you
to see if this growth in the marketplace
is justified and just how good the p20
Pro actually is now obviously the most
exciting thing about this phone is the
camera layout 3 camera system I honestly
think I'm gonna use this thing for like
2 weeks at least
daily driver status and I'm gonna come
back to you with the realness as best I
can is this thing legit is this the
future is this the smartphone brand that
you need to be aware of this the best
camera in any smartphone 128 gigabytes
of storage 6 gigabytes of RAM there you
are
let's check it out now the first thing
you're gonna notice fingerprint scanner
on the front which is becoming kind of a
rarity yes there's a notch it's not a
huge notch but you got yourself a notch
a little headset reminiscent of oh I
don't know no headset I've ever seen
before there it is kablammo
triple camera setup and some of the
craziest low-light functionality that
I've ever experienced even though it was
temporary when I was at the event
unfortunately we do have a fingerprint
magnet here glossy black insert sim for
those that don't believe me the moment
of truth ladies and gentlemen this is
the s9 plus that I've been using you're
skeptical you're like ah
not gonna do it well look here I'm doing
it because this is my real job give you
the real deal
the sim is in all right so far so good
I'm seeing four bars on a 4G catch a
glance at the display one thing I like
about this it's a super manageable size
they didn't go gigantic with it it's a
little bit shorter than the s9 plus I
already unbox this thing I mean this
video is more about me setting up the
process of switching over to it in the
complications that may arise or things
that might bother me about it but I do
want to give a quick preview of the
camera unit probably the question I get
asked the most is like blue which
smartphone has the best camera could
this possibly be the best smartphone
camera it's got this Leica inspired text
which is cool it's a bit of a throwback
underneath the fingerprints there you
can see they have good collaboration
with Leica 1.6 to 2.4 aperture 27 to 80
that's just straight up that's the first
camera mode a quick little shot if i
zoom in it holds up it's a nice photo
just straight up photo mode portrait
mode is going to aim to create some blur
you've seen this mode in the past here
we can see it caught this edge really
well see this background here that got
blurred out wouldn't have been nearly as
blurry we get that blurry effect
portrait mode on the plant did a good
job around this blade of fake grass but
the craziest thing is for sure the night
mode let's go real low light in here so
people can just tell how dark it oh well
I don't know that we can oh my god maybe
we can we'll try it like this and then
we're gonna go pitch-black very dark in
here obviously you can see I'm in shadow
now now listen at this photo and it
takes time but oh my god the results
bananas it's dark in here you can see
it's way darker than what the camera was
able to pull out it's the craziest night
mode all right let's go pitch-black turn
that light off here we go so that is a
shot from pitch-black now yes you're
losing some of the color there's no
color here in real life this is just
dark now the craziest part here on that
second shot the dim one not pitch-black
but very dim the image ends up being
practically as good as the fully lit one
even more detail in it because it wasn't
blown out by our lights here which are
kind of on blast most of the time so I
mean that's beyond usable it's just a
great looking frame but now it's like
what does that equate to in regular life
and then what are the other areas of the
phone that I like or don't like and and
what's it like really just to live with
a p20 pro as you can tell this stuff
with the camera super encouraging but I
do need to figure out what am I really
missing from the s 9 plus which so many
people are comfortable with in switching
to this one my SIM card is in it now are
they the future is this massive growth
in market share and indication of what's
to come will your next device be a
huawei device
holy smokes for now I'm gonna go use
this and I'll be back I'm gonna bring
the heat I'm gonna bring a fire and
ultimately most importantly the truth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
