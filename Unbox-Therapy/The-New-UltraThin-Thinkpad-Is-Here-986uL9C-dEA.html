point that I've been recently using the
thinkpad x1 carbon as my main laptop
device using it on the set downstairs
that's my daily laptop I had an original
version in the black finish that was not
a custom spec at all and then I liked it
so much I went back and did my very own
build which is this one this is the one
you've been seeing on the desk this is
the one I've been using and enjoying
with the silver finish on it this right
here is the 6th generation of this
laptop some things I don't like so much
like for example the speaker performance
a display that I'm pretty happy with
it's of course got the keyboard that I
like a slim profile it's got good
battery life now even though I just
ordered this thing lenovo was busy
preparing finishing their next
generation of this exact laptop I've got
it now I've got two of them in front of
me I don't know a which spec these
laptops in front of me are I just know
that they're both different versions of
the seventh generation so more powerful
units apparently a little bit lighter a
little bit slimmer one of the two also
apparently has the new finish which is a
carbon fiber weave of course it's got
the latest Intel processors so that's an
upgrade and probably the thing I'm most
interested in checking out is the
redesigned speaker setup because that's
the one area like I said previously that
I really wish the last version could
have been better on it was it was one of
my few complaints so apparently they
redid it let's crack into these and look
how small the box
what an unboxing experience that is
because you see this tiny little box and
you're like wow a 65 watt type-c
connector over here HDMI to VGA adapter
I don't believe these adapters came with
the previous version and this one is a
proprietary kind of breakout connector
to an Ethernet port this is the carbon
one this one is like marginally lighter
but definitely slimmer again this has
always been a carbon product in this
case you can appreciate what it's
actually made of just through the
exposure of the actual carbon we've okay
so quick comparison that's
the new 1/7 generation and this is the
sixth generation so it's 6% thinner
apparently I mean that's hard to even
pick up on here as far as a practical
sense these are the same form factor
let's take a look at the ports so you
have your type C charge connector
thunderbolt capable you have HDMI
traditional USB connector you have a
headphone jack in this location and over
on the other side another standard USB
connector and then the power switch with
an LED light this is a new location wait
a second wait as you see this check they
fixed one of my headaches the old
version you go to open it with one hand
you lift the whole thing somehow on the
new model even though it's lighter oh
that's nice that is somehow very
rewarding fingerprint scanner moved a
little bit keyboard still feels the same
or very close to the same definitely I
would say the old model may have
slightly more key travel okay so there
are three new screen options there's an
F HD display touch screen there's a
privacy capability on one of the screen
options as you can see here you can
cover over the camera lens there's also
a 4k uhd 500 nits display available I'm
not sure which one I've got in this
particular configuration I'm gonna
actually turn both of them on and see
what the spec is turns out both of the
new displays I have on both the carbon
we've version as well as the typical
this is the standard black finish the
ThinkPad finish you are likely used to
it looks like both the devices I have
our 4k displays same chip I 78665 you
CPU at 1.9 gigahertz 16 gigs of ram you
expect these out however you choose
there's there's really endless
specification available when it comes to
storage ram and so forth so i would
recommend going in there and looking at
what's available on a novos website but
display wise this is just this is a
really nice looking display I'm glad I
got a
look at the UHD model it's also brighter
this is 500 nits now you can see the
difference it's pretty should be pretty
clear to you why you hunt a little bit
of extra brightness now granted this is
a matte display this is glossy so I was
kind of a fan of the fact that the matte
display was less prone to fingerprints
and reflections but of course there is a
downside there's less pop in the colours
in general without having that glossy
finish but brightness is a whole
different category that thing is just
blazing at 500 nits next up I want to
check the speaker's because that was my
other complaint they also have the Dolby
Atmos certification now if that means
anything to you but most importantly
they're just up here where you would
want them to be load up let's say a loo
later video or get a sense for dialogue
first and then we'll go from there
here's the old speaker's misleading
galaxy phone that's maximum volume that
I read all the sound is coming from your
front edge here on the new one Samsung
charger Oh misleading thank God see Wow
nurse are you resistant to hot water
Samsung well know it but misleading
advertising now it's night and day as
you know Samsung devices for a while now
have had some form of water resistance I
mean they got their face in all kinds of
hot water the yesterday's episode Galaxy
fold yeah we fixed it did you fix it I
this is one of those rare cases in which
you feel like they really listened to
the enthusiasts part of the market that
was like hey can you please improve this
I mean they improved it massively
I got a switch I got a switch laptops I
mean just over that alone for the vast
majority of people a laptop is access to
a web browser it's access to a handful
of productivity apps then it's a display
hopefully bigger than the display you're
used to interacting with on say your
smartphone it's a set of speakers it's a
keyboard so you can spit words out
faster than you could do with your
thumbs on your smartphone that's kind of
what a laptop is it's access and then
it's that small set of features that you
interact with every single day I would
say it probably display and keyboard are
kind of in the same territory of
importance and then sound is lower down
the list but this one improves I'm
saying the new version improves
substantially in every single one of
those categories you can just tell how
much more pop there is in the contrast I
think we may have a new laptop champion
I might be switching even from my own
custom latest I mean I really do like
this laptop I like the silver color
especially and it's unfortunate they got
rid of it it would have been cool to
have three options but it's good to have
two especially if one of them is this
really cool carbon weave which for the
tech enthusiasts it just gives it a
little extra flavor where you can see
the construction you can see what goes
into it and appreciate the material in a
different way kind of like a sports car
that has the exposed carbon fiber it's
in a similar territory its improvements
all around it's faster it's more
powerful it's ever so slightly lighter
and ever so slightly smaller I don't
think that's the reason you're getting
this most importantly hugely improve
crazy bright 500 nits display and of
course the improvement on the sound
which I mean you heard it yourself
that's a night and day situation
