no they saw you before it doesn't matter
can you just say your name to the camera
please my name is David whoa whoa not
gonna work David well what's your name
on YouTube Dave Lee that's my actual
name my channel name is different which
is Dave TV there it is he came to help
us break down all the happenings in the
realm of Samsung specifically the Galaxy
S 10 so much is happening this is by far
the best phone we've seen from Samsung
for quite a few years Wow
so you work for Samsung then that's why
I'm here that's right Samsung phones for
like three generations three full years
we've been like yeah they're pretty good
right and we've never seen something
that felt genuinely fresh the whole
punch it gives you the impression of it
an all-new product it says it says to
you I'm not an old galaxy I'm a new one
a new one I've been using this for like
a day now every time I pick up my old
phone the iPhone it feels so old like
just the bezel and knotch
it's it's substantial I didn't think you
said it you're saying the 10s it feels
old now it feels you're saying it's
absolutely garbage switching from a
knotch to this phone doesn't feel like a
huge difference at first but coming back
to a notch it feels like wow there was a
lot of bezel I was looking at a lot of
blocks up around the screen a lot of
notch and that's attached to novelty in
general the new thing it just feels
refreshing you know has your life and
pruno with the hole punch versus the
knotch
I would say no realistically like this
is like you're saying it's a it's a it's
an aesthetic that looks nice you can't
deny man a good look no that's how you
get your foot in the door it's got a
sort of aura around it it feels like a
new smartphone it feels like a new
development they did it with the hole
punch kind of a weird approach but they
achieved it nonetheless
of course the spec list we know about it
it's premium all the way through it's
gonna have a price tag to match so that
brings me to what I want to talk about
next okay
Samsung for the first time they have
like a budget 10
II as 10e I think this might be the
winter man of the three all the good
stuff with a significantly cheaper price
tag
this is $750 they followed in the
footsteps of the iPhone 10 are yeah but
unlike the iPhone 10 are this unit is
gonna keep the AMOLED display instead of
instead of shifting to LCD like Apple
did I think that's important it's huge
who's buying a 10 are over this I agree
with you okay
this bone great value okay this phone
all the good bits battery does get
smaller though that is one thing that
has kind of changed or is different from
Apple's approach their best battery
performer is their budget model which is
bizarre I like the idea that Samsung
Apple and others are thinking of moving
down market because there's so much
patience there's so much action
happening that's where that's the place
to be it's the place to be I feel like
they having gone far enough it should be
cheaper not this exact phone you go here
for 150 more we have some major players
at the five $600 price point in this
particular case they give you an amazing
package so I'm not saying that you got
to get this package for five 600 but I
would be interested to see what you
could get in a Galaxy package at that
price point especially considering these
are already so close
honestly if somebody comes up to you and
asks you they say I need to get a new
smartphone and keep it for two years
okay maybe one will keep it for three
years I'm a regular human right now okay
right are you gonna I'm there to tell
them to save 100 bucks at this yeah
they're gonna say they're gonna say it's
$150 over the three years I'm gonna own
it
should I really save a few bucks and get
that one or should I get the triple cap
Center uses a bigger battery associated
with the full-fledged s10 it's a tough
conversation if you have access to a
particular budget you're locked in at
that budget you can't stretch it like a
hundred bucks 150 bucks is substantial
sometimes too right so I feel like
that's the market they're hitting and
the thing is they're smart they the
feature set on this thing is we've done
just right like yeah you want you want a
little bit more but it's like this is
gonna work if I was to make a choice I'd
get the s10 over there
Plus for a myriad of reasons but if I
had to choose between the two
like the s10 and this and say they were
the same price and they were actually
the same price there's a part of me that
would actually go for this
it looks cool that thinness that like
tapering and whatever but when you just
if you had to hold an object in your
hand this just feels better in your hand
I hear you man
maybe this is gonna be a big seller I'm
not really sure I don't think a lot of
people are gonna miss the lack of the
telephoto but I think there will be a
subset of people that just want to have
the higher end device the premium device
I could see this being slightly more
offensive strictly from an aesthetic
perspective when compared to the circle
so that may sway some people to the
smaller size unit as well still not
representing in my opinion the best
value in the smartphone market place of
course not but if you want to play in
the premium territory you can now get
there for less than you have in the past
or at least you currently are into 750
bucks USD as tiny you're saying it's a
go you're saying you're saying you're
buying this you're saying you're using
this yep you're saying this is your next
device you're saying your sim card is
going into that smartphone this one or
the 10 haven't decided yet but it's
gonna be one of the two okay very
interesting interesting times to be
alive in the smartphone universe that we
currently occupy s10 we'll be back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
