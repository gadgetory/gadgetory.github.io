everything up and it's just a thing of
beauty this is a showcase of
possibilities it's like if the Joker had

overclock to 4.6 gigahertz the 210 atti
OC edition cards you got a hundred and
twenty eight gigabytes g.skill ddr4 32
hundred megahertz ram SSD in the form of
the intel obtained on the PCIe but my
real appreciation comes in with the
craftsmanship you got an experienced
group of guys they come together and
they put together a package like this
which is cohesive the proof is right
there exceeded the expectation
