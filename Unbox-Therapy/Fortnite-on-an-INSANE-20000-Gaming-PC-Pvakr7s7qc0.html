gonna kill la la la la la
this is exciting this thing is like 200
pounds 250 how heavy is this well ladies
and gentlemen Hayley who now the reason
this is exciting is because of the stamp
on the top it says I Dax they make
custom pcs water-cooled pcs unbelievable
gaming rigs and they hit me up they sent
an email they're like hey man wondering
if you want a little upgrade well of
course yeah that'll be a cool video
obviously but then they were like what
colors do you like
well how do you want it set up give us
the specs and so and I said nope I said
you had me at hello I was like surprise
me you guys are the guys they went to
the dry boy who came up with this so
this is a complete surprise to me I
don't know what it looks like I don't
know what it is
all right well ready whoa
oh that is a monster and end to elite
limited edition x10 use the code unbox
therapy and get five percent off any
zybax purchase look at the scale of it
look how tall it is oh man that is
enormous
check out the cable management on this
side holy that it's no joke
concentrated pre-mixed coolant so we can
top it up remote controls some crazy
lighting effects the various cables to
get things up and running it's like
candy oh man oh this is real artwork
right here this is beyond just taking
some components and slapping them
together this thought here and
fabrication who set up the water cooling
Carlos and side X mapped it out set
everything up and it's just a thing of
beauty this is a showcase of
possibilities it's like if the Joker had
a gaming pcs for his lab 18 core CPU
overclock to 4.6 gigahertz the 210 atti
OC edition cards you got a hundred and
twenty eight gigabytes g.skill ddr4 32
hundred megahertz ram SSD in the form of
the intel obtained on the PCIe but my
real appreciation comes in with the
craftsmanship you got an experienced
group of guys they come together and
they put together a package like this
which is cohesive the proof is right
there exceeded the expectation
it's the next day now why does the wide
to showcase the capabilities of this
monstrosity the RAM is water-cooled and
you touch inside and it's like air
conditioning in there all right it's
cool in there you want to play the
hottest game on the planet probably I
don't know so we got a fortnight here on
the widest of the wide special guest

Moe has never been more impressed
it touches 300 frames and over that's on
high setting everything epic full
resolution 34 40 by 1440 still 130 and
the game's looking beautiful right now

with the controller I started playing
this game on PlayStation 4 so give me a
break okay

thing is before we were rolling three
kills in a match

serious hours if you want to get better

somewhere close to 20 grand all in this
is incredible I got to give a huge shout
