another video this is the third in the
installment of amazing and cool virtual
reality unboxing videos where you and me
together in VR we take a trip down
memory lane and we look at some of the
most important gadgets in general as
well as in my personal life and this one
takes the cake this is the original
Nintendo otherwise known as the NES
Nintendo Entertainment System this thing
was an absolute game changer it's the
first console I had it might be the
first one that you had as well
it brought a controller into people's
living room and completely changed our
perspective on what gaming was going to
be as you can see I've got a pristine
action set in front of me back of the
box you can see what it's all about
here's the happy family would they be
happy if it weren't for the Nintendo I
can't say I can neither confirm nor deny
but I do want to say something about
this scene right here you see this
family over here alright that was me
that was my family right there because
back then what this represented was
local gaming local multiplayer there's a
reason to controllers are inside the box
you're supposed to do it with someone
else and so when I opened this up on
Christmas morning it was sort of about
the console but maybe more importantly
looking back now it was about the
promise it was about those hours that
were gonna be spent together myself my
brother I mean that even that even kind
of looks like a young version of me
right there maybe in some alternate
universe I'm the kid in this commercial
whoa what are we doing here let's get
inside the box enough of all that and
take a closer look and what made up
possibly the most important game console
of all time so what will you notice here
that the console on the left look at
that cute unbelievable condition you got
the game the zapper and two controllers
let's start out with the game Jack bring
it up right in this location
for people to enjoy and inspect of
course a double gain situation on one
cartridge Super Mario Bros and duck hunt
double your enjoyment Nintendo 1985 also
happens to be the year that I was born
of course this didn't come out here in
North America until later but it debuted
in Japan in 1985 now that's an
interesting point because it brings me
to the zapper now get rid of that game
bring up the zapper in his location over
here it's red right orangish red kind of
color the original one was actually
completely grey
the one that debuted in Japan they had
to make a modification to satisfy the
American audience so it turned into this
orange now I'm going to pull the trigger
right here want you to prepare yourself
okay brace yourself to this moment
very important
you heard that spring unbelievable
incredible experience if you've never
pulled a SAP or trigger its time
probably change your life change course
get rid of the zapper bring up the
controller over here what was so special
about this I mean I'm looking at it now
and so are you and you're going loo it
looks like a box with buttons and yeah
it kind of was okay but really it was
the precursor for everything that was
about to happen in the world of
controllers and consoles in general it
was no longer about joysticks and
bringing those arcade cabinets into your
house no you were leaning back now
that's what the controller enabled got
this long cable lean back boom
rapid fire of course controllers have
gotten a lot better now a lot more
ergonomic but if it weren't for this
controller I doubt we would be where we
are today and now the main attraction
NES itself look at that beauty right
there two-tone gray scrap everything on
the screen near Jack bring it up let the
people enjoy the spectacle of the
original NES of course you're a be in
and out all standard definition but you
didn't care you would have family on the
back of the box right there and then on
the front the door protecting your
cartridge from the dust look at that now
these buttons might be the mostest algid
component this entire unboxing
experience when I hit this power button
I will be transported back to 1985 here
we go do this together with me yes there
you have it the classic possibly the
most important gadget in my entire
childhood I remember wanting this thing
more than anything else and it happened
one Christmas and now I feel like it's
Christmas all over again
the NES 1985 hopefully you guys
appreciated this series I know I enjoyed
making it

these very cool 3d representations of
all of the items inside this box and I
