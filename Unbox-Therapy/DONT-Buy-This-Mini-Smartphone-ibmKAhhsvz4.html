right now there's something very strange
in front of me it's a tiny little box
can they tell how tiny it is with a tiny
little phone in fact that is a two point
four five inch smartphone and the other
thing you notice immediately is the
battlefield 3 image on the front well
you can see it's chopped off on the side
it's obviously not a mobile game and
probably not approved by battlefield or
the developers to be used on this box
though maybe that's why they chopped it
off no lawsuit we didn't use the D we
got to the L battlefield 3 this phone is
crazy okay this is eighty three dollars
eighty four dollars I bought it off
Amazon it claims to be waterproof ante
fall and dust proof as well and it's all
in this tiny little package now the
brand name as far as the listing on
Amazon is hip hip hip hip hip hip ooh
keep up on all of us I'm gonna put it in
the description what else does it say on
it alright the only specks are on the
bottom here model j5 + 3g wcdma 2100
megahertz and GSM 850 900 1900 ok cool
let's open this up oh I said it was
gonna be tiny look at this a little
screen protector included and this is
the phone oh wow look at that little
rugged thing there now it does have a
screen cover I'm gonna remove that here
you go now the screen is kind of gross
looking look at this there look at that
filthy is this the power switch up
thought that looks like the power switch
volume up and down there on the bottom
you have this covered portion where your
headphones and your micro USB go all
right here's some some regular size
phones pixel look at that fits right in
there 7 plus oh my now this is kind of
weird on the back there's like there's a
plate with some writing on it can you
see this jet it's like this subtle
little writing on there but it's mirror
ysf
I mean that doesn't really you can't
even really say that is that what is the
significance of that I don't know in the
top corner there I see a little tiny
camera which I do not expect much of
also in the box some paperwork a user
manual
we built our handset to give user what
we believe user really want so they've
also included micro USB cable I assume
yes there you go you can charge it up a
screwdriver you don't see that every
time I guess you could open this up
maybe we should I didn't expect to be
doing this immediately but why not am I
gonna break this before I even turn it
on well how do you get a SIM card in
here the SIM card is insert into the
back press the knob and open the battery
cover off there's no there's no knob and
battery cover off that you have to split
the case open to get the SIM card into
here check this out so this is just like
a little indent there and you'll put
your flathead in and kind of like split
the casing like that and it'll pop off
okay so it's kind of nerve-wracking you
don't say to do that but that's
essentially what you have to do and then
from within there you can remove the
battery and you have two SIM card slots
look think jam-packed it in there and
also a micro SD card slot right now I'm
gonna put this part back on cuz I don't
need to put a sim card in right now okay
it's the ones in the back that are
actually the structural screws and the
ones on the front are just for show
these little tiny ones so it matches the
bat and the reason I'm guessing they
don't have them installed when you first
open the phone is because they know
you're gonna have to crack it open to
put the SIM card in so save you the time
having to remove them all right the
phone itself what are we dealing with
here what are we working with a let's
try to boot it up oh it's booting
mediatek processor okay Android that's
familiar and comforting it's also kind
of strange that there's no set up
sequence like who set this up does that
make you feel confident seeing it
already set up there so the only thing
that exists on the main screen here is a
phone icon
pretty standard Android phone app and
then the remaining apps in here what do
we have messaging Google settings Maps
Play Store pretty straightforward I mean
it is Android you can put whatever you
want
let's test out this camera on a small
little screen it looks okay probably not
for long probably not when we make it
bigger I mean will can can be the judge
you can getting close on that what do
you say pretty dim not the best look at
the fingerprints on there already now
I'm gonna go ahead and connect to Wi-Fi
ooh
not the strongest Wi-Fi it's taking a
while and these two things that it
sensed already are the lights these are
these lights have Wi-Fi built-in they're
right here and it's got like two bars
for each I see nothing for our actual
network Oh No and now drops one of these
what are the lights the lights are right
here and they brought that there it is
one bar is it's gonna work probably not
oh look at the typing boldly let's see
if it's even gonna connect here so it's
the weakest Wi-Fi I've ever seen on any
smartphone ever featured here Oh
connected holy we are barely connected
to Wi-Fi right now oh look at that the
default home page has been set up is
gmail CPM because the person that input
it for this device couldn't do so
because as small the keyboard is they
put a pin stared at Oh can I even what
can I say if they can't get Wi-Fi from
we've never had a device you're the kid
connect I mean with that level of Wi-Fi
this is borderline useless all right
let's try a hotspot from this Galaxy s8
right beside it
okay mobile hotspot is on if they can't
connect to this well well there you go I
don't know what to tell you come on
Oh Galaxy s8 full bars okay so it's
totally arranged thing there we go we're
connected now let's try this again I go
back to the browser let's do a quick
search here I'm gonna try to type out
unbox therapy
hopefully it'll guess how soon will it
guess you and B yes I can do that oh how
about the latest video look how much
text is shown
it's the mo stuff and then that's that's
what you get is there's not you can't
fit a lot on there okay now we will get
a quick speaker demo out of it and
subtitles pre enabled that's pretty uh
it's pretty hard it's tough to see much
about it I
yes it's kind of unique don't spend 85
bucks on this you can get an actual
decent foam for like 100 bucks like
something that's usable that you can
connect to Wi-Fi I mean the Wi-Fi range
thing that's that's a deal-breaker on
its own it's kind of nice that it's
different that it's rugged but with the
connectivity issue the tiny nosov the
typing and so on the way you have to
crack it open to get access inside the
Wi-Fi thing is the deal breaker you got
to be able to connect your impressing no
one Oh check out my mini little phone
like yeah what can you do wanna bring up
some youtube or something no I don't
really do that too much save your 83
bucks you know I guess that's the
message here it's not often that there's
a clear-cut kind of answer but I think
today is that day
all right don't buy the hip it boo j5
plus you probably already knew that but
now it's confirmed it's been confirmed
right here on unbox therapy who's
bringing you the heat who's bringing you
the truth uncle Lou that's who all right
so we might as well try to do question
time on the device here so let's bring
that browser back up and the most recent
video is like it's full bars right here
right there on the end of the table it's
down to two bars now you you can't you
cannot press back dot you cannot press
that dawn I broke it all right question
time let's see what the people of the
unbox therapy community are talking
about today so here's a question from
splash Myers on Twitter what do you
think of the new goldish color from the
new iPhones now I've seen this I mean I
haven't handled it myself but it's this
kind of dim brushed faded type of gold I
don't know I guess I don't mind it it
wouldn't be my choice would not be my
first choice I tend to go for the darker
color phones but hey options are good
you got it working oh it just died it
just turned up would you use the Lambo
phone as your daily device that comes
from Jay Wolf's no and to be honest I
don't think it's a terrible device I saw
a bunch of people in the comments saying
that they thought that it was some kind
of rebranded ZTE axon and I think they
might be right although maybe a little
more than rebranding because they've
completely reworked the casing around it
but if that's the phone that it is yes
it's incredibly overpriced but it's
usable objectively speaking which iPhone
do you think has more bang for its buck
is it the iPhone 8 or the iPhone 10
we've all heard that this iPhone 10 is
gonna be $1,000 to start which is a lot
of money now some people on Twitter they
hit me up they said thousand dollars is
not just not that much I love it I'm
buying it I don't care that's fine like
everybody you decide what you want to
spend your cash on but the thing is the
smartphone market
it hasn't been sitting still there are
many great choices out there for half
that price now and even less than that
can Apple continue to charge these
exorbitant figures I'm not forgetting
about you either Samsung with the note 8
I'm an equal-opportunity kind of guy
here I think they're both quite
expensive given the other options on the
market so from that standpoint I think
you could argue that the iPhone 8 might
represent the better values all right so
there you have it that wraps up this
video thank you very much for watching
remember if you want to be included in
question time make sure to leave your
questions down below in the comments and
who knows you may make it into the next
