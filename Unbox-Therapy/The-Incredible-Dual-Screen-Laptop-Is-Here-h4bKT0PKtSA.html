thing featured I guess it was at
Computex recently and amazingly it's on
the desk already like this of course the
Asus Zenbook Pro duo it's a dual screen
laptop we've talked about these various
screen implementations this is this new
modern take on what a laptop could be
might be let's take a look at it plus
apparently they're giving you horsepower
too so I'm gonna put that down for a
minute there's a pen also included so
the screen is going to have pen input
also this little wrist rest now the
power adapter pretty large but the specs
on this thing my understanding the specs
are kind of powerhouse specs so this one
in front of me has a ninth gen Intel
Core I 9 and it also has GTX 2060
graphic that's pretty wild for something
with two displays 4k UHD OLED main
display and an LCD on the smaller
display above the keyboard oh my
goodness gracious this is Wow okay
Thunderbolt 3 over here type-c connector
we have a headphone jack a traditional
USB port over there
HDMI port DC in and then another
traditional USB also looks like these
are the speaker grills which is kind of
a nice location for stereo separation
looks like there's a grill there and a
grill over on this side as well whoa it
elevates the deck of the of the laptop
for cooling purposes or the fans if you
take a look here on the bottom of the
device you've got the keyboard chiclet
style down here at the very bottom part
of the laptop deck now over here on the
right is where your trackpad lives it is
glass and you're gonna have to figure
out the trade-off right obviously you're
getting this giant display in here so
that might be worthwhile for you like I
don't care if the track where the
trackpad is in exchange for that
yeah we're in whoa that is strange
look at this it's kind of cool it's like
one continuous display here and
apparently the reason for LCD on the
bottom portion even though you have OLED
on the top
because it cuts the reflections this
section down here is very matte and look
at that it's magic well that is so weird
there's Kauai right there raps run has
cost McDonald's millions in fries
raptors Kawhi Leonard put McDonald's on
the hook for 5.4 million and Counting in
free fries McDonald's franchises in
Eastern Canada finalized the sponsorship
deal with the team for a free fry
program 18 days before demar derozan was
traded two million orders of medium-size
french fries clocking in at 5.4 million
dollars of free fries Jack are you going
in for free fries or what look at that
I'm reading off the second display here
can I do this okay
take a tab drag it up there now I got to
I'm double browsing immediately just
like that
it doesn't have to be just a browser
it's not just about having more than one
window it's also about multiple
applications
okay fine CorelDraw oh wow actually by
default opening it up the tools go down
here are you seeing it and this is
touchscreen so I can just ruby red light
yellow so let me get the pen out might
as well so touch screen on the top and
also on the bottom so now you've got the
tools you get the palette you're up here
you're down here see that what do you
know about that you never saw any got
the game playing over here and then up
top I'm just browsing you know I'm just
reading Bradley Cooper
he's getting split up Bradley Cooper
people are going gaga Oh jack speaking
of body language look at that you're not
impressed with the dual screen laptop
this is cool look at this you're
browsing you're tweeting I have a game
over here I got Bradley Cooper then I
got and then I can also draw Bradley
Cooper
I'm sketching because I'm looking at the
real Bradley Cooper and look the Pens
working everywhere
this is futuristic Jack it's fun it's
different if you really got to get work
done you just go with this one and
you're typing out the emails Jack's I'm
multitasking you don't understand this
laptop also very powerful gaming capable
oh my goodness so with the Thunderbolt 3
you can also output dual 4k video
signals so you could get real wild with
it Intel Core i 9 I think is the one
that I have here that's I $9.99 80 you
get an i7 32 gigs of ram the display up
top 15.6 inch OLED so that's 3840 by
2160 up top one terabyte PCIe SSD the
screen pad plus is 14 inch also 4k 3840
by 1100 close to 2 4k displays in a
package that folds up flat Harman Kardon
audio system endorsed does that mean
much we'll find out
yesterday's show speculated on what
Google was gonna say today you know what
is pretty wild having all that on a
laptop there's way more color the blacks
very deep I like having a panic and just
I mean oh that's just impossible to beat
this is why it took over the whole
smartphone universe and now it's making
its way into laptops including
innovative unusual ones you know moving
windows around being able to just have
an extra spot for it it's kind of I mean
that's compelling on its own
Jack take a look dude can you imagine
you can't you handle all that
multitasking that's your future right
there you're not getting enough
information right now you need a video
you need Kawhi Leonard you need Bradley
Cooper
you need Lou later and what's this up
here inside the private I don't well you
should come in here for this I know you
got a lot to say round of applause for
Willie do because this thing's not even
out yet all the videos is just like
people that were at Computex and then
Willie do was like oh oh Lou would you
want you want to have in the studio cuz
no big deal like
not the riot he's the one who helped me
with are you yeah I don't want to give
all the credit to myself that's actually
mostly good you're getting Ryan some
credit
yeah that he granted it oh it's not
often that a company is gonna send out
something early in its phases you know
show in front of record we're kind of
interpreting it through that lens
because it's not out on the market yet
it's an early look I think they really
knocked it out I mean with this
ambitious design like this is a
powerhouse whoa
top top-tier specs I mean this is really
cool
this is honestly I feel like this could
be the start of like a new line of what
start of something special on the screen
yeah what do you think about the
keyboard you know what's your chiclet
style more travel in a MacBook but
though you'd want to get me started on
keyboard look at that right there
I think it's really cool then they
didn't tell us anything about price did
they it's got to be expensive
no no price availability yet no price
unless do you think oh it's got to be
over to geez for sure okay yeah I would
say - yeah 20 it might even be close to
three it might be that's an ultra wide
monitored on it I would say the only
thing I think people might be critical
of or not like is the trackpad being on
the right right since this is in my
opinion it's in desktop replacement
territory like it's probably gonna be in
a single place or like two or three
places yeah the idea of a mouse here
probably comes into play yeah exactly
typical Asus buddy wait he has some
weight to it I mean it's two-and-a-half
year it's pretty heavy it's two and a
half kilos but again for this spec list
that's not that unusual
they're they're trying they're trying
something different you can talk on them
for that so good for them you know
well nd it's a pretty nice laptop I
think it might be Ashley the future this
one in particular is for a lot of people
I mean you said it yourself
could be for gamers could be for content
creators so yes check it out he knows
yeah he knows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
