another video and today we are checking
out what I think might be the only one
of these in existence what are these you
say it's a speaker that's transparent
see-through a see-through speaker
designed and developed by people people
products Stockholm Sweden
it's gotta be good you know anybody
who's Swedish Jack anybody Oh a box
likely accessories I'm gonna put that
down for a moment alright that's it
we're done thanks for watching see it
yes haha there we go
transparent speaker when you're looking
at audio equipment and they include the
frequency chart you know you're in
business Oh Jack we got your favorite
snack silica gel
hello that is too cool are you seeing
that it's heavy too that is completely
transparent you see all the components
here line in USB power to charge up your
device a line out as well interesting
speaker mode you could do L stereo or
are left right
I suppose this for depending on how much
volume you're looking for the one large
unit down here two smaller units highs
lows they got you covered and a tinkerer
tool through the corners you'll be able
to disassemble your transparent speaker
why would you want to take oh maybe one
pull like a little plant in there like
it's some kind of an aquarium see that
Jack picked that up
he said I'm boxing was not a hard job oh
cool red cables a mini jack cable nice
power cable two different European
options now I'm gonna have to put an
adapter on here obviously no big deal
some mounting hardware maybe one mount
this baby up and then a short mini jack
as well if you prefer I love how useful
are these little love short cables this
is kind of odd maybe I should read the
manual there's like this cable already
sticking out oh wow wireless music so if
you have an airport Express or some kind
of streamer to wirelessly connect to
this over Wi-Fi or whatever you can use
that you use this to power it up and
slide it right in there so if you want
to turn into wireless speaker you could
you don't need to use this you could
just tuck this away and just go USB and
use a USB dongle cool well we're not
going to do it we're just going to go
old school analog right now it's amazing
being like so gentle with it nice
tactile volume bass and treble controls
power switch obviously we probably have
another mini jack yeah bingo and an LED
light now we talked all about the
aesthetics we talked all about how
pretty it is but what good is a speaker
if it doesn't sound
and right where's my phone
I like it he's not the loudest speaker I
ever had on the desk alright but like
it's tight you could tell they gave it
some thought you can have a lineup of
ladies out the door ladies get in for
free before seven dudes can stay at home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
