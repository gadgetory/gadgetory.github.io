another video once again we are here
with some Amazon deals some cool tech
deals but today it's a special edition
or a little bit more special than usual
because today is Amazon Prime day this
is a day that Amazon invented to get you
to spend more money so we'll see if that
pans out I've been looking at the deals
all day long some of them are great some
of them suck the ones that are great
usually run out quickly so let's make
this damn video and stop wasting any
time but before I do you do need to be a
prime member to take advantage of some
of these deals but I have you covered
there as well because there is a 30-day
free trial if you are not a prime member
yet I will put a link to that free trial
in the description so you all of a
sudden become a prime member at least
temporarily or until you decide whether
you want to pay for it or not but it
will allow you to take advantage of
these deals so first up we have an xbox
one halo bundle this is 59% claimed
right now so click that link if you're
at all interested and hopefully there's
some left it's a one terabyte Xbox one
the Master Chief collection which also
comes with a 12 month xbox live card and
Borderlands the game you're getting more
than you'd normally get here Borderlands
value is about 40 bucks originally 60 60
bucks for the Xbox membership so
essentially I guess you could say this
is a 120 dollar savings
maybe around there I guess it's 59%
claimed so go check it out as soon as
you possibly can there's probably some
other other bundles there I think
there's a PlayStation bundle look around
and see if you can find something cool
the next one I'm not sure if this is a
prime deal or not because it doesn't say
that you have to sign in to Amazon Prime
so I assume that it isn't I was looking
around to see how good of a deal this
was because it's available on other
sites for a similar price point even
though the original price is listed much
higher on Amazon here then then probably
what the market rate is nonetheless a
one terabyte SSD from the Samsung Evo
series 850 Evo a very quick drive and
you get one terabyte for 359 they have
the original price listed at 500
Mike I said that's probably skewed a
little bit high but nonetheless this is
a really good value on
very quick drive if you need a smaller
size say 500 gigs for example and
that'll run you 164 from an original
retail of 269 and there's even a 2
terabyte 2.5 inch SSD that will be
available shortly I see the icon there
for it at 800 bucks that's for obviously
people who want to be on the bleeding
edge but for one terabyte at this speed
here that you can expect with this 850
Drive pretty impressive I think you
should check it out last deal of the day
we have a logitech wireless touch
keyboard one of those keyboards that
allows you to sit back on your couch and
control a media center or a Mac Mini or
even a laptop that's connected to your
TV in your entertainment console so has
a trackpad built right into it as well
as a keyboard volume controls fairly
simple design this is a utilitarian
thing but you don't have to worry about
it too much because it's cheap it's $20
today and the original price is about 40
you can see this is one of the best
sellers the number one bestseller in
computer keyboards in fact it's reviewed
very well all-in-one solution for a
media center if you want to use this on
your couch or maybe you have a computer
in your bedroom and you like to lay back
in bed and control all those video files
whatever those video files happen to be
and wherever you happen to have got
those acquired those video files I'm not
gonna judge alright so there you have it
those are three deals that I found on
Amazon today the last - I don't think
our prime related but if you want to
take take advantage of all of the
Lightning Deals that are like coming and
going incredibly quickly then make sure
to check out that free trial linked
Amazon Prime so you can participate

posted here the links will be down in
the description I hope something here

on my Twitter account especially the
ones that are coming and going as
quickly as I just said so follow me
