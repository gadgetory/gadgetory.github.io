and today we're taking a look at the
PlayStation Move sharpshooter for your
PlayStation 3 of course and what this
claims to do is to take your PlayStation
Move controller and turn it into a
traditional gun style contraption and
the reason this might be cool is for
certain games like Killzone 3 SOCOM for
dead space and some other first-person
shooters out there for the PlayStation
that use the Move system if you guys
have been following the channel you'll
know that I recently unboxed Killzone 3
the Helghast Edition and I can't wait to
try out this accessory with that game in
particular the first thing we notice as
we get inside the box is some
documentation from Sony themselves as
well as some stickers I suppose in order
to accessorize your gun depending on
which games you like to play you can see
we've got some Killzone 3 related
stickers and we've also got some SOCOM
stickers too so I guess that's just a
way of personalizing the gun depending
on what you play here's the different
corresponding buttons and how they
interact with the Move controller itself
and here is how the Move controller is
inserted into the accessory pretty
straightforward stuff so lastly we'll
get to the gun itself and this actually
turned out to be a pretty
straightforward unboxing not a ton in
here besides the accessory first thing I
notice is it's light but not in a cheap
way
it doesn't feel hollow or anything like
that it definitely feels like a solid
accessory coming from Sony that's what I
expected you've got this adjustable
shoulder mount and here is where the
move controller gets inserted in the
front side
you obviously need both parts to the
move controller to use this you've also
got your traditional playstation
controller buttons triangle square got a
our button down on the bottom so
everything has been mapped into a
convenient location so that you can
access it while using the success
check out the channel we got lots more
to look at</div></body></html>
