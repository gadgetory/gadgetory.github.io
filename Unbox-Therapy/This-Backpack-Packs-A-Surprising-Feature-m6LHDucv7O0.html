companies that hit me up they hang me up
the same we got the cool thing and I'm
like listen that's my job out here it's
to find the cool thing is this that
thing I don't know yet that's why I'm
making this video what it definitely is
is something that I have never evaluated
before the backpack has a speaker in it
it's from a company called track you
probably never thought you needed a
speaker in your backpack but I'm sitting
here thinking like why not when I was a
kid it was all about the boombox we
would go to the basketball court play
some basketball have some music with us
maybe that's what they say skateboarders
side benefit you get to look like a
ninja turtle and if you don't know the
Ninja Turtles and I don't know you looks
pretty straightforward it's got a pretty
hard shell on it some straps you will
also notice up at the top here some
magic going on
that's a mysterious component and a
zipper that goes all the way around all
right inside a few different pockets
place for a phone place for some money
that looks like the magic right there
this is the speaker unit but it also has
a 5 volt out so you could charge
something off of it it's like a backup
battery as well that's always in your
backpack then there's a charge port to
charge this actual thing up there's an
auxilary out in an auxilary in so
auxilary in makes sense is how you're
going to send music to here via your
phone or whichever device you want but
the out we do with the out doll it up
you and your buddies it's like a
backpack mafia the whole crews coming
through synced up with wires slalom is
another couple cables also what looks
like a microSD card slot so I guess you
could play music right off of it now the
cables break out into this wire here
which then comes up here and
leads to what oh haha
a remote control with a mute slash
volume switch play pause as well as
answer phone calls skip tracks volume up
and down and a backlight you're on the
street you got the skateboard you got
the remote and everybody's watching look
at that guy he's from the future he's a
Tron type dude can we get away with
playing any Tron music right now jack of
course not Daft Punk are you kidding me
gimme a call alright anybody in the
music business this is a promotional
opportunity for you to be on unbox
therapy videos give Jack a call you got
some money to spend now I notice there's
also little mesh pouch and then inside
is your charge cable as well as an
auxilary cord waiting for the connection
whew which connection this connection
can you see that jack is like LED lights
in there enjoy aux music
you there's a microphone on here and
it's picking up the feedback because you
can answer calls on you that turns on
the mic then you want to have the mic
muted most of them right otherwise
you're going to get feedback this is
better than a lot of Bluetooth speakers
we test it over here man I'm telling
something I got Jack 9 his hand over
there and not the usual type and not
like he's about to fall asleep
it's the nod like he's on the groove
like he's getting loose like Ryan
started to rub off on him and that's the
right kind of rub Tomi who is that keep
knocking at the door is a bunch of
little kids interacting like you also
they sing keep the floor like a rat with
a belly full the keys
bro
I like it I kind of like it I kind of
like it all right that's the bottom line
it's a party wherever you go keep people
moving having fun take it to a picnic
pack yourself a lunch I'm out of you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
