think so another Willie do pick from a
company called porch electric it's kind
of fitting that this type of thing
arrived at this time of year this show
takes place in a Toronto area it's been
a bit cold this is high-tech clothing it
emits heat it keeps you warm and it
could be useful for you as well if you
yourself live in a colder climate you're
just snowboarding skiing you're building
a snowman playing hockey you see that's
the key I recently built an outdoor
hockey rink and I got to be out there
flooding the rink maintaining the rink
it's a side job all right it's not all
fun and games over here so maybe these
will come in handy or maybe they're
terrible I don't know heated base layer
heated gloves that's pretty cool you
have the heated base layer shirt one
power bank one charger one instruction
manual and your freedom from the cold
never again will the cold affect you if
your guys like Jack you're freezing all
the time the dude is shivering he
shaking give us a little kiss there
that's him anyhow okay let's do the
gloves first I'm kind of excited about
the gloves some heated gloves I mean who
doesn't want that
they look kind of cool also fire end
gloves than I expected look at these
Wow I'm a new man look at me Ice Road
Truckers I don't I've never watched that
show of my life there's a button on the
front this is the power on and off my
hand is getting hot right now without
powering this up we have these tiny
little power banks you see this 2200
milliamp hours each and neoprene cover
over top the battery unit now it has
multiple power levels that's high heat
output blue is medium and green is low
that's kind of cool you can charge them
both at the same time two tips
and boom just like that so wills just
telling me right now the low setting on
a full charge will give you six to seven
hours a medium will give you four to
five hours and high is gonna give you
two to three hours okay now this is how
we're gonna connect it go like this this
you zip it up it looks like a water
resistant zipper as well you see how it
creates the seal there that's important
so it's if DUP you throw it on okay so
we're on red mode maximum heating am I
feeling heat already or is it just the
warmth of the glove no I'm feeling heat
now it's heating up quick actually it is
very warm it's warm right across here
right up through there in the fingers as
well that's the first thing that's gonna
get cold for those of you that don't
know though this is nice
my hand is hot right now like my aunt is
beginning to sweat now skiing skiing the
Canadian things alright guys
tailgating you were saying a couple
beers in the parking lot this is you
you're there forever apparently these
work for touch as well so oh that's
crazy
that's cool you don't even need to take
the glove off sweet how much are we
paying for these well my hand is
sweating right now even on green I'm
gonna power this down how much are we
paying for these why are you whispering
a hundred and twenty dollars I'm not
gonna pretend us on a serious price tag
you see that stickiness my hand is hot
right now
120 bucks you get on Amazon I think the
person who this is for you know who you
are you want to be outdoors you enjoy
the outdoors even in the cold
I think it's cool it's a bit pricey but
it works man my hand is sweating well I
think you did well on these next up
their other product they sent us now I
know that they make a few others but
this is the base layer this battery pack
here is similar to the one they offer
for the coats bigger it should last a
bit longer okay so it's like the hoodie
but it's kind of thin it's not super
thick
oh and it's a pullover zippered pockets
not bad look at this okay so this is
where the USB connects it has a little
cap on it to keep water out I feel like
the heating electronics are in the
middle section over here should I try it
on what do you guys say okay why not
this could be another good one for the
hockey rink that's for sure
this one has the controls right here I
just noticed on the on the arm looks
like we have one one bar you see this
Jack this is it
just plug this guy in Oh comes on
straight away let's get some some power
flowing raw red mode imagine this with
the gloves I'm untouchable
it can't touch me I'm in I'm in Alaska
I'm saving polar bears if he had if Al
Gore had this back in the day that would
have been a convenient truth instead of
inconvenient you see you know something
I'm not feeling as much heat as the
gloves it is heating up right in this
region it's definitely warm now
something I realized with this one as
well it's not a proprietary connector
it's just a USB connector if you wanted
to you could have a bigger power bank
hooked up to it you could have another
one charged up you know I'm saying well
it's warm I'm getting cooked I think for
some reason I like the gloves better how
much is this thing cost 140 I'm taking
the gloves but this is cool tech it's a
place where tech hasn't really become
super integrated yet you know into
clothing items such as these it's the
real deal it actually works anyhow there
you have it cool new clothing tech it's
all happening we're in the future I'm
getting heated right now I'm uh
alright I'm heading up north later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
