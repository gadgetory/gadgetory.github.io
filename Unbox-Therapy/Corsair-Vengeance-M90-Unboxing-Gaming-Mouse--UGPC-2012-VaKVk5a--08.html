tell I've got a number of very cool
items sitting on my kitchen table these
are obviously components that are gonna
be going into the ultimate gaming PC and
as a result of the accumulation of all
these things I decided to go back to an
old-school style
unboxing right here on the kitchen table
to get caught up and to move into the
official build video which I know so
many of you are waiting for patiently so
we're gonna go back to the style of like
live unboxings I'm still gonna feature
each item independently tell you why it
was selected so on and so forth but
we're gonna do it in that old-school
kind of form factor so in order to get
started we're gonna take a look at this
particular gaming mouse from course err
this is the M 90 which is their top of
the range Gaming Mouse you've got 5700
dpi in terms of sensor capability on
this thing it's a full sized Mouse
you've also got a cord on it which is
preferred for most gaming rigs
especially the ultimate gaming PC for
that matter I'll go ahead and jump right
into it and I'll do so live so sorry for
the audio there guys but as you can see
on the back here 5700 DPI as I said
before laser stream gaming sensor you've
got nine organ amelie placed side
mounted user programmable buttons as you
can see in the diagram right down here
that is a crazy number of buttons and
configurability available to you you've
also got 48 KB of onboard dynamically
managed memory for storing up to 6
on-the-go profiles you have an aluminum
frame so the whole thing should be
fairly rigid and robust it should hold
up to all of your different gaming
sessions you've also got tracking up to
165 inches per second which is
incredibly extreme and adjustable lift
distance which is important in a gaming
mouse as most of you would know 5
selectable levels so it can adjust
depending on your particular gaming
style solid metal weighted scroll wheel
so on and so forth let's go ahead and
jump in a little bit more now hopefully
I can do a decent job of performing this
task live because as you guys know I'm
used to doing this in a more
sort of produced a method wow that feels
you guys are getting the legitimate
feedback from me here on my opinion and
feeling about the product let me go
ahead and just try and get it unraveled
here this is kind of a tough one to get
at it's a long cable it looks like it's
the braided style braided nylon I'd
assume and you have of course your USB
connector on the end here I'm not sure
exactly how long that is I'm gonna guess
probably around four feet or something
here's that metal chassis that was
talked about earlier wow that's that's
crazy I haven't actually seen that
before and the entire finish up here is
this like rubberized texture it's very
soft very nice actually and the good
thing here is that since it's not like a
glossy finish you're not gonna get
fingerprints on there any markings
hopefully the weighted scroll squirrel
wheel feels pretty amazing too actually
that's a that's a real nice
scroll wheel I assume this Corsair logo
will probably light up on the bottom
here it definitely looks that way and
here's a closer look at all these
configurable keys here which you'll
obviously control with your thumb while
those feel really solid and rigid as
well not mushy you're definitely not
going to click it by accident here dad
that's definitely not going to happen
let's see what else is included in the
box so we've also got our Quick Start
Guide right here that tells you how to
get it up and running which seems pretty
straightforward in fact it's a as simple
as plugging it in and getting rolling on
it you've also got a warranty guide here
from Corsair and that's about it it's a
pretty straightforward unboxing guys
you've got the mouse and you've got the
official paperwork etc I'm gonna get
this thing hooked up and as it becomes
part of the project of course as we get
into the benchmarking stages the actual
gaming stages of the build I'll be
putting this thing through its paces and
I'll be giving you guys more info and
feedback as that occurs this actual part
part of the mouse here has a rough feel
to it a really grippy feel which is
probably gonna help in those wild and
crazy gaming sessions that I know you
guys get involved with anyway guys
that's been a quick unboxing of the m90
from corsair this is going to be the
gaming mouse included in the ultimate
gaming pc build and as I said before

stuffs only going to get better at
