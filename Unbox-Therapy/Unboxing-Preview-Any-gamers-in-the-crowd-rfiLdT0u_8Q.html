way out i'm outside it actually just
snowed its but it ain't that cold out
anyway the reason I'm out here I'm about
to take a trip to my mailbox that's
where all of my packages arrived and
I've got something real exciting that I
think just showed up I got a fedex
tracking notification that somebody
signed for something so if it is what I
think it is then you guys are going to
be real interested in the product
especially people who are into gaming so
I'm gonna head over there bring you guys
with me let's go take a look what it is
i can give you guys a quick preview of
what to expect on a channel let's go i
got the product that i was looking for
and the one I think you guys going to be
excited about especially the gamers out
there as I mentioned earlier this is
real exciting a brand new product you
may not have even heard of it yet and
before I get into that I would make you
hold on a quick second I just want to
show you guys what's going on with the
weather out here in Toronto check this
out we are fully covered in snow now
it's staying there on the ground it aint
melting or anything like that so we're
in the midst of winter i guess christmas
is coming and if you see my barbecue
over there it's in desperate need of a
cover because it is getting hammered by
all of this snow anyways that's not what
you care about here it is this is the
package that just arrived you can see I
pre-sliced it didn't want to make you
guys watch me struggle through this
cardboard box and as you know I don't
normally show it coming out of the
cardboard box as you guys like to call
it box ception it's a box within a box
this is by no means the unboxing just a
preview of the product i'm going to do a
proper unbox therapy style unboxing of
course but i didn't want to make you
guys wait to have to know what's coming
up because this is really cool check
this out this is from a company called
aver media and it is called their game
capture HD yeah we got a lot of glare
coming off there what is special about
this and the reason why it is a it needs
your attention is because it's a
standalone HD recorder for gameplay it
does not require a computer can you
imagine that so I'm not a hundred
percent sure how it works never used it
before the wicked people over there they
got in contact with me and we're going
to take a look how this thing competes
against the other solutions that do
require a PC it's a bit of a headache
having to you know get your pc hooked up
alongside your console in your
television so this might be an
incredible solution they may take over
this marketplace anyways stay tuned for
the unbox therapy style unboxing you
know I'm gonna go over everything I'll
probably even review it and guess what
if you guys want I don't know you let me
know but if you want me to get into
gameplay footage or anything like that
either on this channel or the beef speed
channel let me know because I now have
the capabilities let me know if you guys
think that might be entertaining anyways
until next time until the proper unbox
therapy unboxing of this device that's
just been a preview want to keep you
guys in the loop I'll see you around
okay later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
