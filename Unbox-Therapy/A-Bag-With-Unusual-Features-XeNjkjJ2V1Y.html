another video and today we're going to
be checking out something that's a
little bit larger than usual it's right
over here from a company called blue
smart you probably haven't heard of them
before because they're pretty new
they added some some functionality some
tech if you will to a regular everyday
item this of course is luggage you
probably think it to yourself Lou
luggage it's boring
this is not boring luggage this is the
next level this is for the tech heads
this is for you guys the blue smart
luggage
oh my ever since I saw this I really
wanted it but I never pulled the trigger
I wasn't in on the Kickstarter and then
now it finally went for sale on Amazon I
was like I now is the moment so there's
an app to go with it look at this this
is wild okay so it's got a battery built
in fast charging up to 2.1 amps built-in
bluetooth right so it's going to be
connected to your smart phone here's the
front side it's for anti-theft it's to
keep an eye on the location of your
suitcase if you walk out of range from
it your phone will buzz you and say dude
you forgot your suitcase also it has a
lock if the phone goes out of range you
can set it up to lock instantly zipper
here little pocket this is kind of what
is in that okay so still traditional
keys on the top here you have the TSA
lock so that's what this is for if you
want to use that once opened up it kind
of what oh I feel magnets in there I
don't know maybe this is the better spot
for your passport and stuff because it's
beneath the lock a spot for a laptop
very soft the USB port in there I
believe that's going to be to charge a
device that's so cool
you can have your devices charging off
the suitcases internal battery so that
is a USB to like quickly charge
something that isn't in that pocket
there's a USB in in that location as
well now it is a regular
case as well look at that oh right
it also has a digital scale simply lift
it by this and based on the amount of
weight it's holding up it'll tell you
you know whether or not you're in the
range for a weight restriction what do
we have in here alright so pouch on this
side that looks like your main kind of
compartment for clothing and whatnot you
can lock and unlock your blue smart in
two ways from the app by touching the
lock unlock button or by proximity you
can set up your own distance when you
want to get notified if you've been
separated from the bag if you've got
some high-tech stuff in here chances are
you gonna want to have that on what is
this bow suite so they're even going to
give you a USB cable blue power brick
USB power brick we have a slimmer pocket
to work with some more clothes stuff you
need to keep nice and flat whatever
you're into a book some books Adam ah
that hides the cable now as a luggage it
actually feels pretty robust it's got
like a hardshell four wheels on it look
at that the connected carry-on pretty
smooth actually alright so the app here
just type blue smart you'll find it
turn on your carry-on alright connecting
boom it's going to tell you how much
battery you have 41 percent lock oh did
you hear that
alright Jack I'm gonna put the lights on
lift and hold nine point four pounds so
auto lock when separated that's probably
my favorite feature you walk away from
it booyah so if you wanna ask me about
how much I like it if it's cool and all
that stuff hit me up on Twitter I'm easy
to find
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
