therapy and we've got yet another game
unboxing this is gold and I reloaded
everybody remembers Goldeneye from back
in a day this is the double-o edition
now what that means is you're gonna get
the gun the sharpshooter included along
with the PlayStation Move system
everything you need to get started with
motion tracking shooting you know what
I'm saying
and uh you know like I said everybody
has some nostalgia regarding Goldeneye
because of that nintendo 64 game from
back in the day local multiplayer four
ways split screen good times all around
I know I do at least now what you're
gonna get in this package the new modern
package is the entire move system and
what that means is a lot of extra
paperwork telling you how to you know
set up that move system where to place
your camera so on and so forth now
what's cool about the move system is it
actually tracks in a couple different
directions
it not only tracks left to right but it
also tracks depth that's because you've
got optical tracking via that camera
you're also going to get the the other
aspect of the move system which is that
little nunchuck controller as well as
this particular portion this is the
tracking portion the part that glows on
the end of your gun and lastly you've
got the camera as I mentioned before
this is what's responsible for the
optical tracking and it comes with a
fairly long USB cable so you got some
options as far as where to place it now
lastly we've got some sharp shooter
specific paperwork talking about how the
different buttons are remapped etc and
down here we've got some stickers if you
want to tag it up I don't know why it's
always so calm for stay because they
never mix it up I've unboxed a number of
different sharpshooter collections or
games that shipped with the Sharpshooter
as you can see hope maybe I can play
this game with two but I got a couple of
these lying around and every time it's
SOCOM stickers that's all you ever get
to see but anyhow here's how it operates
you pop this little top off get your
little move controller inserted in there
and you're ready to use your
sharpshooter to do some sharp shooting
hopefully hopefully you can hopefully
you can hit some targets with that baby
and other than that the only other thing
included here is the game of course
that's kind of important and there is
some DLC for buying this particular
addition of course it's got the move
compatibility up top and on the back
you'll notice it still has that 1 to 4
player local multiplayer which is sick
as well as obviously more multiplayer on
the network and it is a 1080p game which
is cool so let's go ahead and check out
that DLC we'll go ahead and see if I can
cover up the code I know you guys have
snatch codes from me before let's see if
I can do this gracefully so here's that
DLC let's go for the flip can I cover it
oh oh you saw a little bit not enough to
steal it so as you see you get Hugo Drax
that's the special character you get you
also get the Moonraker laser pistol so
some cool DLC gotta love the DLC you
actually get a legitimate manual game
disk is fairly basic so there it's been
that's the gold and I reloaded
double-oh-seven double-o edition the
Sharpshooter package if you guys enjoyed
