therapy just got home from the midnight
launch call of duty modern warfare 3 you
know how it's going down picked up a
bunch of stuff including the hardened
edition of the game
the special edition guide and also the
console the limited edition Xbox 360
with the special design the special
controllers and of course another copy
of call of duty modern warfare 3 I'm
going to put this one to the side for
now that's going to be the next unboxing
so definitely stay tuned for that video
but this one's going to be dedicated to
the hardened edition and the limited
edition strategy guide so let's go ahead
get inside and see what we get for our
hard-earned money see if you guys can
still pick up one of these hardened
editions if they're still available got
the nice matte finish on the outside of
the box the back of the box shows you
some of the items that are included and
then you've got a box inside of a box no
tape here just flip it open and here you
can see the contents of a hardened
edition on the left hand side the first
thing you're going to notice is this
Call of Duty Elite card that you're
going to receive that's going to get you
into that elite group of individuals
your actual code to sign up is on the
back of the card so I'm not going to
show you that and below that we've got
this really cool retro war style
notebook similar to a moleskin notebook
except obviously it's got you know war
type stuff inside of it you got some
different maps and strategies and all
kinds of cool stuff it looks like some
of the pages are bloodied up for all you
gory mofos but I like this cool kind of
material is actually some inserts in
here as well a fake photograph as well
as a newspaper article in Russian
obviously I can't read that maybe one of
you guys can tell me what that headline
says is that Russian I don't even know
so anyways yeah some real cool sort of
historic looking wartime material in
there we also get a real nice steelbook
case I love these steelbook cases real
nice way to keep the game real nice
artwork on the front as well and you get
that added
tection you can't get from plastic on
the inside we've got the game disk
itself as well as our mini manual that
we're used to getting these days but who
needs any more paper let's let's save
the paper we all know what we're doing
in these games anyways there's a much
closer look at that artwork I mentioned
earlier and the call of duty modern
warfare 3 signature on the back and also
a slightly closer look at the inside the
last piece of material we've got is the
Call of Duty Elite little booklet here
again this is the fact that you're going
to join this this special group of
individuals that get to join up to this
program right here and again your signup
code is on the back of that book so I'm
not going to show you that so lastly
we've got this really cool limited
edition collector's guide but inside it
you've also got this stand with all the
different maps from the new game on it
and you can you can sort of stand it up
almost like a calendar I'll show you
guys that first little piece of
cardboard here separates the two but as
I mentioned before the de maps they sort
of like flip up so you can you can keep
it on whichever one you may be currently
trying to dominate and as I mentioned
it's a stand so you just put it on your
desk or you know wherever you like to
game or wherever you think it looks nice
who the hell cares it's up to you so
let's get a closer look at the strata
the limited edition strat guide I do
like these things get a nice look at the
artwork and of course some tactics if
that's what you're into so here's a
closer look at what to expect in that
booklet I'm not going to give it all
away but just give you guys a nice quick
idea of what to expect if you pick this
book up as well keep in mind that's not
included in the hardened Edition that is
an extra that I added on same with the
poster underneath that was extra - I
shouldn't say it's extra but my my EB
games included it for free so anyway
