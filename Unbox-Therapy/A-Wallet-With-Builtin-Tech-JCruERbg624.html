another video that was very fast but I
just came right into the video you know
what if I just today we're gonna if I
skip the what's up guys and today we're
going to talk about today we're looking
at that's it
today I am bringing you something useful
I think I hope what they've done here
this company Nomad is they took a backup
battery that you would normally carry in
your pocket and they built it into a
wallet a 2400 milliamp hour battery
which is essentially a complete charge
of full charge for iPhone 6 or 6s now in
the back of the box you can see the
design it is a fairly traditional kind
of wallet layout let's crack this baby
open cuz that's what we do here on unbox
therapy blue why is your knife so
goddamn big you'll find out in the next
video ok so I mean it feels like a
pretty standard wallet of course you got
this battery sort of like the size of a
lipstick size battery in the what you
know what and pretend I'm sitting on it
here I mean it's no bigger than my
wallet normally ends up George Costanza
style once I get it loaded up it's al
it's a little bit bigger let's be honest
here is that leather can't tell the
cable on the other hand you guys can see
that there it slides in there and that's
actually where it gets stored right in
there some space for cash up in here now
on the bottom here I notice a button so
that's going to give you an LED
indication of the battery having a
charge let's find out what's in here ah
so they did include a micro USB cable to
keep this charged up let's grab an
iPhone real quick and just see what
that's like so let's say who are you who
are you where are you maybe you're in
high school you're having lunch in the
cafeteria phone runs out to friends are
trying to tweet you snapchat you there's
a party later you need to know about it
you need a charge just pull out your
wallet slide out the cable at this point
everybody's looking at you the whole
cafeteria is wondering who is this guy
what does he think he is with this
battery wallet you know who you are
you're the man rank the females come
over they start swooning you ever heard
that word swoon now normally they're
only coming over if you got extra french
fries or something like that but in this
case because you got the wallet cuz
you're a nomad you don't stay in one
place ya motorcycle and you smoke
cigarettes what that I'm joking don't
smoke I'm serious it's terrible for you
it's a bad idea motorcycles they're
dangerous too when the girl you have a
crush on she's low on battery and you're
like I got you that's a move that's how
I mean every quality relationship of the
future is gonna start that way there is
no way to a woman's heart like giving
her a charge when she needs it most
show me some thumbs guys I need it 2400
milliamp hours in your wallet never
never thought I'd see the day
it's meta share sharing is caring you've
heard that before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
