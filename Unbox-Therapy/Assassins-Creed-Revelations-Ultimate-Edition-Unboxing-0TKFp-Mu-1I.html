therapy finally getting around to my
Assassin's Creed Revelations unboxing
this is called the Ultimate Edition but
it is different from the ultimate bundle
which was a Game Stop exclusive that
included the two statues or figurines
this instead is going to come with this
nondescript envelope which I'll get to
in a second as well as an art book and
the signature edition of the game now
the Signature Edition was the same
Edition you'd receive if you had to
pre-ordered the game via Game Stop or EB
games
so the DLC that's included in here will
be the same regardless if you get this
edition or if you just pre-ordered the
game one thing that the Signature
Edition comes with is the free inclusion
of the original assassin's creed all on
your single blu-ray so that's pretty
cool and there's a closer look at the
DLC on the left hand side you get a
couple of extra items as well as your
code for you play your you play passport
so many games now are requiring a code
to get onto the multiplayer they're
trying to kill your resale value so here
is the the mini manual that we're so
used to receiving basically a couple
page trifold situation not much here's
the art book which is not hardcover but
the stock is really nice and thick so
you know that there's some quality here
and as you guys know I really do
appreciate the artwork that goes into
these games they take forever to make so
I do prefer an art book to a figurine if
it's an option so I do prefer this
addition to that ultimate bundle that
was also being offered and the reason
for that is also because you get these
cool cards here they're they're they're
cardstock but I guess they're really
pictures you could put them in frames or
something if you want to display them
that way and what they are basically
assassins the assassins throughout time
and throughout the different cultures so
I think that's pretty cool I mean I
wasn't I didn't really know what to
expect but this this actually turned out
to be quite impressive as far as I'm
concerned and as I mentioned earlier
actually do prefer the artwork if I have
the option instead of the statues or
figurines so I also picked up the
collector's edition of the official game
guide and there's some special
inclusions in here as well the main one
being these glossy stock maps you know
maps of the many different levels within
the game and of course the purpose of
the guide and these maps is so that you
can just you know get through the game
quickly and make sure that you cover all
your bases you get all the content
that's hidden within the game that's the
purpose here you get a look at the spine
the complete official guide collector's
edition and once again you're going to
be greeted with some real nice artwork
but also a significant amount of
tactical information as I said before so
you can blast your way through this
particular game anyway guys if you
