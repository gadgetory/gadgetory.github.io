something that I get to do very often
that is check out a new BlackBerry this
is the key to I don't remember did I
check out the key one I don't think so
man one of my very first smartphones was
a blackberry I don't remember which
model now for me just in a sea of smart
phones that are somewhat similar this is
kind of a refreshing it's so refreshing
to me that I am going to use one of
these oh my goodness I'm gonna put my
SIM card into one of these and just see
what it's like to use a blackberry in
2018 I don't have too many friends on
bbm anymore
before iMessage the whatsapp the top of
the pyramid it was bbm okay well you
must have had a blackberry at one point
Wow
Kirk Jack hey man take it easy there are
two colors in front of me 64 gigabyte
and six gigs of rent what else can we
see on the back here intelligent
keyboard powered by Android 4G LTE 4.5
inch IPS 1620 by 1080 display for 434
PPI that has to be one of the smallest
displays on any modern smartphone maybe
we will see better battery life I'm
getting a sense this product is about
productivity business making deals
spreadsheets
I'll book in next Tuesday what is your
12 p.m. looking like how about your 1
snapdragon 616 o 8 Series Snapdragon
processor 12 megapixel autofocus there's
a wide and Italian 8 megapixel
front-facing 3,500 milliamp hours and of
course the OS is Android in the silver
ooh
one thing blackberry still has going for
it is this incredible security
encryption I know there's a password
manager on here a place to keep all your
passwords if you are security conscious
or you do weird stuff on your smartphone
like Jack like well like Kirk this could
be a good selection for you a place to
keep your secrets silver I kind of like
it the screen doesn't seem tiny I could
see myself getting used to a display
that size we have the power switch a
programmable mapable button you hear me
Samsung huh
and no it does not launch big speed not
as heavy as it looks
camera unit on the back I don't have the
highest expectations can I live with it
I don't know we'll see I'm gonna switch
I'm gonna put my sim card in a
blackberry
in 2018 I do it for you yeah you say you
think I don't see you because you see
the view count and you're like I'm me
what I was there's a million views what
no you specifically headphone jack why
not
USB type-c to connect a speaker unit
down at the bottom black one the trim is
different on the back and of course the
frame as well will black or silver will
says black Kirk black or silver silver
one two one Jack with the tiebreaker
Jack's going black what a surprise now
this is the perfect time for you guys to
decide down in the comments is it gonna
be black or is it gonna be silver quick
charge 3.0 that is a decent little
headphone for a free be interchangeable
ear tips blackberry you've outdone
yourself so this is cool it actually
does have a fingerprint scanner and
they've hitting it in the spacebar
that's genius
and look at that it does have haptic
feedback as well cool should we go
through some of this the software okay
okay so the old Blackberry experience
it's not just a hardware thing there are
some modifications as well to the
software so of course you could go ahead
and install any launcher you want but
there is a blackberry launcher on top of
Android touch and hold the background
access settings for your wallpaper
widgets and more pop-up widgets is
another thing the productivity tab I can
swipe out from here this will bring up
the newest and most important info
slides into view things like calendar
new messages tasks contacts and so on
you can have these keyboard shortcuts
for launching certain apps or even
certain pages within apps so you can
have it monitor the overall security of
the device and if they ever cross the
line or attempt to do something you
wouldn't expect or you didn't initiate
then this monitoring service will be
able to tell you so you can see right
now I'm in the fare zone security wise
let's do some typing the
quick brown fox huh
what does it jumped over hilly who
hailey who da day AKA hailey
daily there's something satisfying
about clicking buttons I told you about
buttons earlier I like them tell me you
don't like a button here and there in
your life oh that was interesting I just
brought up the virtual keyboard you can
still have a virtual keyboard if you're
insane it's also a touchpad I can scroll
right on the physical keyboard how about
this custom button over here you can add
up to 3 shortcuts ah
you can have it trigger a car profile no
maybe you have your notifications
chilling out in the car cuz it could be
distracting right you want to go look at
that a text you're dead put your phones
down please kids I mean come on now
you've got a snap on snapchat what might
it be you're dead you saw the snap
you're dead oh good that's it even deal
is a good trade put down a snapchat when
you're driving you hear me
I'll find you notifications off Do Not
Disturb I am driving could be on the
lookout wandering will won't be
responsible for his death this is you is
the ball like I could live with this
here's max 32 gigs a very fancy glowing
memory I put it in average territory
speaker wise the screen is smaller than
you would be used to it's not the
greatest display I've ever seen now the
camera how do you get around it right
like everybody cares about cameras your
smartphone is your only camera so I will
try the zoom as well I'll say just on
initial inspection this maybes a little
better than I expected even though we
have lights here I'm lit I get all that
it's kind of possible I could live I'm
worried about this front-facing camera
because it seems immediately like it's
blowing out the highlights a little bit
Oh Jack the dynamic range is not great
there where it's blowing out one side of
my face which is not a great
front-facing camera let me try it like
this but like look at this cheek jack
wiped it out not a selfie factory here
so on that note let's go ahead pop out
the SIM card tray here as the expansion
lets
let's do the thing let's do the dance
let's get the SIM card out see if I can
live the BlackBerry life see if I enjoy
the physical keyboard the taps the
button spooned up oh my notifications
are coming in it happens now I just
switched to a blackberry in 2018 let's
find out if it's the real deal or if my
life takes a turn for the worse remember
watch out for Willy do he's out there
he's wandering put your phones down I
need your eyes on the road his life
depends on me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
