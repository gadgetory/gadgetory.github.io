weird I know you're looking at this box
you're like glue what but honestly I had
to do this it's been a while that I've
been using this product safely say this
is one of my best gadget purchases of
all time I had to make a video you
needed to know about it it saved me man
it has really changed it's changed my
life this product it changed my life
jack it's called the electro fan and in
case you can't tell yet it is a sleep
machine not any have a problem falling
asleep but I didn't know what I was
missing until I used this thing right
here it has white pink and brown noise
ten varieties of ambient sound and what
that does is it masks noise disturbances
so when the room is like too quiet
any kind of little noise that's
happening around whether it's
consciously or subconsciously you pick
up on that you bust out asleep just a
little bit this particular noise machine
which is very popular in Amazon four and
a half stars for people who have used it
and like 8000 reviews people care
they're not wrong I promise you it turns
out that for you individually a
particular frequency might work best
when you start to go through the various
options in here you find the tone that
works for you okay you pop it open this
is the unit this is the power it's a
simple USB power brick that they give
you a relatively long USB cable like so
I'm gonna pop this open it's a
relatively simple design there's a 60
minute timer you have fan sounds on the
one side and white noises on the other
and there's also a volume control over
here I have no affiliation no
relationship with this company this is
just me this is just real life alright
let's plug this in I'm gonna show you
what it's about get ready to relax a
little meditative session here which
look at that straight out the gate
ladies and gentlemen just listen here
I'm gonna hit the vomit turn the volume
up for your sake
you can see it can get quite loud
surprisingly loud let's just live for a
minute let's just soak it up okay we're
on a mountain
we're in Tibet
I know there's those of you out there
that I like I don't get it Lou I could
just get a fan what's the big deal over
here I'll tell you what the deal is it's
low frequency in that realm it's a
simulation of the experience in the womb
as a chasm as an unborn fetus I don't
know if that's true or not but so much
so that when I toggle this thing on
sleep is happening I hit the button
kaboom I'm out it's over now if I go
over here to the fan sound button will
cycle through a few of them No thank you
this is for Willy dude this is like an
airplane cabin that's a higher pitch to
it now everybody's ears are gonna
function a little differently you may
have hearing loss in certain frequencies
most of us have some degree of it so
you're gonna cycle through here you may
even try a couple different sounds when
you're sleeping until you find that one
that buttery smooth situation
this is kind of like a car ride
ladies and gentlemen
would you look at that
you're tapping in to the frequency of
the universe its security its relaxation
okay so that's the end so this also is
capable of delivering white noise brown
noise and pink noise this is white noise
I assume this is doable like this right
here before I made the investment in
Balinese I was using every kind of app
that existed on my phone a phone speaker
it doesn't look like this jack it's not
this big so the low frequency was
suffering and on top of that the looping
where my I can actually pick up on the
audio file loop point in some of those
apps almost every app I could pick up
the audio file loop point and it would
drive me crazy when I started to
recognize it one of those things once
you see it you can't unsee this guy
somehow no loop point into the white
noise is here this one is getting too
much into the high frequency for me same
here and now we're just into like
television static and then back to the
end I'm more in the fan space obviously
as I told you this is my favorite tone
right here
milky smooth I love it it's imperative I
honestly at this point do not sleep the
same without it I noticed myself getting
up more frequently this thing in front
of me is one of my favorite gadget
purchases ever
it's like 49 bucks and I feel like every
bedroom should have one it's the electro
fan tried-and-true there are so few
gadgets that I love this much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
