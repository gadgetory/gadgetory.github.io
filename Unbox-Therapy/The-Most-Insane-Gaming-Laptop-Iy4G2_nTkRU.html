thing is serious I'm pretty sure it's
serious you may recall a previous video
in which I was talking about the new
cor-ai 9 MacBook Pro there were some
issues with some thermal throttling you
know that's a tiny little chassis it's
it's so slim of course it's not really
targeted at gamers if this I 9 chip is
so hot so powerful
what type of chassis what type of laptop
should it really be in and also what
would that laptop look like so of course
I asked Willy do I said hey man take a
look see what's out there I want to see
a real core i9 gaming Beast then he
found this one from MSI this thing is
supposedly going to blow my mind
it is a GT 75 Titan this is possibly
maybe the core i9 laptop you've been
waiting for in the form of a gigantic
enormous gaming laptop I bet you it's
gonna be heavy too I mean look at this
box 4500
yeah that's almost 5 grand that's almost
a $5 laptop alright so will says that
this thing in our current spec retails
for around $4,500 it's actually been a
while since we looked at a gaming laptop
we did have the crazy predator at one
time
that's a box msi on the front true
gaming on the back here's the spec jet
bring it up 17.3 inch anti-glare IPS
level 4k well that sounds exciting Intel
Core i 9 8 950 HK ok I told you by 9
that's what it's about course it has a
gtx 1080 in it 1 terabyte 7200 rpm plus
one terabyte SSD in what they're calling
a super raid you have 32 gigabytes of
ddr4 yeah I'd say it's a pretty powerful
specs we have accessory box
gigantic dual power do Go Go Power Wow
all right so this does this whole baby
dual power link right there in this box
and then this will power up the system
that is why the main attraction boom go
for football
look at the giant grill on the bottom of
this guy now for the right person this
is this is making them tingle shoot whoa
let me give you a little reflection
there whoo
you have two USB ports as well as an SD
card slot there's also a Kensington law
and then on the other side of the unit
three more USB ports and tons of audio
ports Ethernet jack DisplayPort
Thunderbolt HDMI and then this is your
power connector oh wow that's right
those are mechanical key switches on a
laptop that is quite tactile for a
laptop so brought out the resident
expert in black ops call of duty all
gaming gaming champion pro gamer MLG
it's Willie do oh you can see Otis
kinesio this he can say hi as well also
a gamer the world's first competitive
dog Call of Duty player there you go
he's ready to play yes he just told me
that we can run the latest black ops
with everything turned on details
textures
yeah shadows like sudden lighting Mac
settings but you did make a small
adjustment to the render resolution this
displays 4k and to lock it to keep it
performing at 60fps you just toggled it
down a bit
275 yeah it keeps us stable at 60fps
oh it does look very smooth right now
and this is 60fps I see that it's locked
in now you got the mechanical keyboard
as well which is unusual on a laptop
apparently it's this developed in
conjunction with steel series what do
you think I like it oh my god clicking
this I usually go with but yeah this is
satisfying now on this system you have
the analog audio outputs for surround
sound as well if you want to go to a
surround sound speaker type of setup so
this this new mode on the game is
basically battle royale right yeah
that's what you're in right now
yep that didn't last long I feel like I
could have done better than that you did
not meet the expectations at all I
talked you up I talked people is pretty
horrendous if Dave 2d sees this video
you guys are not friends ending yeah
yeah the battery life on here 5 minutes
12 yeah well while gaming yeah max
resolution I think I hope you can get
away what happened but again that's not
really what a system like this is about
you want the v8 engine alright you got a
pea to fuel you're gonna try to put this
thing on your lap did you try to put it
on your lap no okay let's try super
heavy okay let's try it
what is that right now your sperm count
is diminishing this is a health issue
that's it's definitely a health issue
it's still a laptop well what do you
think you can do that yeah oh so it's
throttling how many frames see there 19
frames it's trying to save power because
we unplugged it so the thing is if
you're gonna do laptop gaming with this
thing that's barely a laptop then you're
gonna have to keep in mind you may have
to toggle your settings down a little
bit that GPU
that needs the real juice the wall juice
very important so well you've been
playing this game on a desktop gaming PC
downstairs yeah as well with a full
setup mechanical keyboard Gaming Mouse
gaming monitor a crazy gaming monitor
yeah it's pretty good so here's the
thing on here when you're playing you
know with the 60 frames on this 4k
display on his laptop how was it
stacking up you know I think it's the
monitor thing the fact that it's like
kind of a smaller screen is something
I'm not used to mmm but everything else
mint it's it's pretty on par yeah what's
it yeah the keyboard itself is Katy
Blakey and I like it's pretty satisfying
right the fact that it's portable it's
actually a pretty good setup pretty
serious setup yeah not that this thing
is super portable no for the record no
but it is a desktop style performance in
something that I guess is somewhat sort
of almost portable
hardly even mentioned the RGB keyboard
so not only is it mechanical yes it's
RGB which is what you'd expect on
something like this I like the fact that
has a matte display as well because it's
rare that's a rarity these days not just
useful for games but also presumably as
a workstation you could do video editing
on here
yeah yeah I'm good at it photos and so
on cuz it's got the power to do so there
you have it it is a wild and crazy
monster of a laptop look at that it can
hold it like a pizza good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
