so here's a new thing this is a new take
to new development they're called IQ
buds oh great another pair of fully
wireless earbuds big deal but no no no
no what these things here do is allow
you to mix your outside noise with your
media noise look at this little booklet
goes with life changing Plus this guy's
beard is not bad he's kind of got my
whole thing going on there advanced
speech amplification noise control
augmented hearing it's like you're at
the gym you don't care about the noise
around you your surroundings but then
you're dining out you're enhancing a
conversation this happened to us the
other night we're at that bar over there
the music but then you're in the office
you want a little bit of both you've got
the podcast or the music on then your
colleague over here
that's a colleague he wants to talk to
you and you can't hear anything cause
you shut off from the world
it's an easy-to-use app on both iPhone
and Android 16 hours of bluetooth
streaming battery life alright so we
have a cool little carrying case here a
bunch of different tips ear tips so you
get the right fit each of these has
these contact points that'll match up
with the microphone is on already listen
to this that's crazy
it's like your very first hearing aid
will go with round larger shirts to
start if you're Jack you're out of luck
will would you need quadruple XL for
those babies over there okay here we go
we're in there press and hold for five
seconds until you hear pairing okay oh I
got the pairing there we go IQ buds whoa
I'm in the restaurant setting right now
everything is so clear and as will five
Tom say something
oh you're amplified right I can hear the
room noise too
I toggle this now I met Starbucks I'm
ordering I hear everything so I'm going
to just speak to me a little bit can't
you hear me without those oh no speaking
Tom you are so clear right now take take
them off and no you're you're reading at
a table it's a remote hang your laptop
goes in yeah isn't that kind of
intrusive yeah so you turn you toggle it
so you mix your surroundings with the
music you listening to what someone's
about to hit you with their car they're
honking and you're lost in your podcast
while you're biking okay I get that I
don't get it at restaurants I don't get
it restaurants is just a hearing aid I'm
enjoying this conversation with these on
more than if it was just natural I don't
think I've ever shared this many words
with you people
nope okay I'm gonna switch to driving
here we go Oh same thing way different
Wow I kind of like driving
okay I'm gonna switch to home whoo
you're doing chores around the house
you're listening to your music the
babies in the crib screaming away what
if you're waiting for your pizza to be
delivered but you want to get lost in
your tunes you're not gonna hear that
doorbell no I look at what I'm doing
right now Tom I'm hitting ya with the
science you presented it originally as a
Starbucks example I do have to look
thick they put it in your pamphlet man
yeah that's stupid the example you're
coming up with a good poop though I'm
the guy yeah I'm the guy you could set
up your favorite locations there's work
out street office plane music offices
good office is good it's really good
you're in classroom Oh
oh you're in high school you don't want
to pay attention to all that you don't
want that what I'm gonna do start a
little bit of music and see how this
goes if I can still maintain okay
the most amazing part here is I can hear
my own voice now if I go to music it's
gonna completely closed off just
straight-up music check check one two oh
my oh my it's terrible now my voice is
muffled it's like normal headphones nap
and now I realize what the magic is
these things are for real these things
are for real Tom I can't hear anything
he's saying now watch me I'm gonna go
back to home yo oh I'm alive again it's
the best of both its isolation when you
want it it's socialization when you need
it you can go a step further where you
can actually mix it yourself now it's
gross again and then I come back up and
there's maximum amplification Oh Mike oh
my god you want to try them out sure
restaurant let's say okay
oh yes yes oh man
see that's right that's magical man
that's weird so now I'm gonna turn it
I'm gonna take you just to music now say
something oh man yes sucks
it's terrible though this terrible
you're sitting at home it's like late or
something right and everyone else is
asleep and you have your headphones on
but you're isolated and you feel like
you heard something you're like you have
that moment of like somebody standing
behind or you get startled because
someone actually is yeah wow they're
amazing
they're amazing these are so cool this
is so cool it's a cool it's cool Tom
never says that Tom never says that IQ
buds
nothing ever blows my mind
and certainly Tom never keep in mind
they sound good as headphones too but
this is the feature it's all about this
is the dream come true this is a moment
right now it's a moment in human history
I mean they walked on the moon and then
this happen Christopher Columbus now
