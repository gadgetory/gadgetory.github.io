another video and today we're gonna be
looking at something interesting at
least it appears that it was interesting
to you guys because I posted it a little
while back on my Instagram and got a lot
of questions as well as likes so we're
gonna go into more depth in this video
right here but before we get into it I
want to give a shout out or at least
mention my brand new channel that's
right started a new channel it's
unrelated to this one it is called more
top-5 and it is dedicated as it sounds
to top 5 videos with various subject
matter different things that I find
interesting from around the web and
hopefully we can discover some new
things together 3 top 5 videos I have
the first video published it went up
this morning some people have already
seen it if you haven't yet head over
check it out click the subscribe button
and I guarantee you you will enjoy
something coming up very shortly on the
brand new more top 5 channel also I will
be doing a hidden giveaway in one of the
upcoming videos
so make sure to subscribe to the new
channel and then keep watching the brand
new more top 5 videos the link will be
down in the description as well as in
the annotations hope to see most of you
guys over there all right enough of this
long-winded introduction let's get into
today's video about this right over here
so this looks like a standard rolling
suitcase but I've actually modified it a
little bit in order to carry consoles
for very special occasions so I'm gonna
put it on the table here and we'll
switch to the overhead camera and I'll
give you guys all the details so as
mentioned this looks like your everyday
standard piece of luggage but it's
actually a little bit special it's
designed to be able to handle a bunch of
camera equipment so when that gets
really heavy you've got a way to roll it
around and there's a bunch of inserts on
the inside that are configurable for all
types of camera gear now in this case I
had to travel with a gaming console and
how we can argue whether or not you
should travel with a games console or
not depending on the type of travel
you're doing if you're a competitive
gamer for example you might need to
travel with a console or if you're like
me and you have some little kids that
might want to watch movies or play some
of their games on the road again this is
an option to get the console to the new
location in a safe way this video is not
about discussing the merits of traveling
with a games console you might have to
do it and if you do this is the best way
at least one of the best ways I've found
ok so opening the bag up you'll notice a
few things here first you have a gaming
headset this is obviously optional but I
put it in there just to show how much
you could fit this is an Astro headset
in the case below there that's where the
PlayStation 4 lives but of course you
could go with an Xbox one or alternative
ps3 Xbox 360 as long as it's able to fit
the external dimensions you could
reconfigure the interior to be suitable
so these little inserts that you see on
the side are acting as bumpers for the
PlayStation 4 and then these two which
are velcro just lift right up and the
PlayStation can come out over here we
have a couple of slots for some
controllers you can see I have my little
grips on there that came in the last
quarterly package these things are a
lifesaver especially with these grips
that break down at least in my case on
the PlayStation 4 controllers I'll try
and link those down below as well big
fan of those little grips a spot for
some games or some blu-rays you can see
I've got a few of them in there got the
lego movie kids are loving the lego
movie right now but this is all custom
configurable so depending on the system
you're traveling with and the other
things that you need to carry you can
modify this to suit now over on this
side there's the power cable for the
PlayStation 4 there's an HDMI cable in
this slot over here a couple of nice
extended micro USB cables these are from
scuf now on the front here we have not
very much basically just an extension
cable never know if you're going to need
that depending on where you need to run
power to and that's about it guys I
posted this on Instagram as I said and
got a lot of interest from people about
specifically how it was all functioning
I can lift the whole
thing out and then you have a standard
luggage if you have kids or as I said
before if you're competitive gamer or
maybe you're moving and you're looking
for a good way to carry all this stuff
in the moving van this is a great way to
make sure that your console is protected
as well as your other peripherals that
go with it you can bring more
controllers if you need to as well
there's lots of room in here and you
could reconfigure the padding for that
so that wraps up this video I hope you
guys found this useful I will link the
products that I can find down in the
description if you want to replicate
this set up but basically I recommend
finding a piece of travel luggage that's
suitable for photography equipment
because generally photography equipment
requires removable dividers and padding
to suit many different kinds of lenses
and things that you would normally carry
with a photography / video setup and I
believe there are even cheaper bags than
this that can achieve the same thing so
there you have it a modded photography
bag that has become the ultimate console
carrier for either a PlayStation and
Xbox even a Nintendo Wii or Wii U maybe
for the future set up I could even put a
small HDMI monitor in there so it's
completely standalone the suitcase
gaming who knows it is a little bit
absurd to travel with an entire gaming
console but like I said if you need to
do it here's one way of achieving that
alright guys if you enjoyed this video
please remember to leave a thumbs up
down below thanks as always for watching
and remember what I said earlier go
check out the new channel more top-5
I'll have the links down in the
description alright that wraps this one
up catch on the next episode that I
already say that goodbye later folks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
