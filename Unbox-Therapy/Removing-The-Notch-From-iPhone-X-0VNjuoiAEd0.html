iPhone 10 for a little while I'm gonna
reserve some of my feedback for an
upcoming video after I've been using it
for at least a week but something has
been making the headlines this morning
I've been on the tech websites and I've
learned about this app that aims to get
rid of the knotch
on the iPhone 10 the controversial notch
that everyone's talking about is this
interesting is this something you should
go and download especially since they're
charging money for the app so this is
the app right here it's called notch
remover get an idea from that image
there of what its gonna look like when
you get rid of it starts to look kind of
like a Galaxy s8 to be honest I'll show
you here how it looks with a couple
different wallpapers so I'll head over
there and open it up you don't mean the
other guys we've looked at it and we're
like you know it doesn't the iPhone
doesn't look that bad with the black bar
at the top I could see some people
preferring this had Apple just come out
with a device like that I don't know
though maybe there's some notch lovers
maybe you're a notch lover but this app
will take your stock wallpaper and throw
that notch in there now if you just kind
of glance these articles and downloaded
the app you might have thought that the
notch was gonna be gone everywhere but
they've just used the kind of weird
little hack here to remove the notch
from the phone by attaching it to a
wallpaper and also just in general the
apps kind of not that good like I'm
looking at this I'm like okay that looks
good safe and then what did it do it
saved it where did it save it what it's
actually doing is saving it to the
camera roll you can select any image
what you can't do is you can't go to
your wallpapers download the wallpaper
separately but anyway if I go ahead and
just select one of these images here and
then hit save it now takes this stock
iPhone 10 background essentially removes
the knotch but of course what it's
really doing is filling in the knotch
it's creating this black outline on each
side of the knotch
that's what your stock setup looks like
knotch now if I go to my wallpapers here
and select the newly created image from
the app you can scale it to right where
you think it fits in kind of somewhere
around there then I'm gonna set it set
to both and when I get back out look at
that the notch is dead
KABOOOM okay so this is you you're happy
then not just gone it's what you've
always wanted and you think you're off
to the races you think you just bought
the the greatest app ever if you're a
notch hater but then you go and you open
an app you open Safari then the knots
come screaming back in this app is
really it's kind of strange it's strange
in the sense that it only does the thing
it claims to do from within your main
phone area here which is I don't know
how frequent you're there the surprising
part here is the fact that this app even
exists because in Apple's developer
terms for the App Store you're not
supposed to have an app like this that
attempts to hide the knotch but anything
like this is supposed to be blocked and
somehow this thing made it through one
cool aspect though is it kind of does a
good job of displaying how great OLED
displays are if I hold this up to Jack
over here it's hard to distinguish where
the screen starts and ends and the
knotch
actually is just by filling in the
display with black look at that but the
question is really for you guys what do
you think when you see an iPhone like
this notch free even though it's not
permanently not free but instead just on
the background here do you kind of wish
that Apple made this device like do you
wish this is how it looked instead or do
you prefer the knotch
do you think that extra little bit of
real estate up there is useful to you or
or is it aesthetically pleasing so let
me know in the comments if this is
something you guys are gonna do does the
knotch bother you so much you're gonna
try to eliminate it with this particular
app are you gonna spend the $0.99 if so
I'll link the app down in the
description but in my opinion I would
save the $0.99 get yourself a coffee
strike up a conversation with somebody
at the coffee shop and get over the
knotch
you'll learn to live with it I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
