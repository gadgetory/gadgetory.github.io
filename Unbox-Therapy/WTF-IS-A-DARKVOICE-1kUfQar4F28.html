another unboxing video and on my
left-hand side is some mysterious
looking foam but before we get into that
I do want to give a shout out to up wave
who recently had me on their channel
doing a special segment called what's in
my fridge and pretty much exactly how it
sounds I give you guys a tour of the
different items food items beverages etc
that exists in my fridge so if you're
interested in checking that out please
go ahead and follow the link down in the
description show them some unbox therapy
love leave a comment leave a thumbs up
anyways
so today's video is about something
special this came to me from a company I
think a new company called mass drop and
this is called the darkboys now before
we get inside the package I want to give
a little bit more information on the
place it came from so it came from this
place called mash drop and they are a
group buying type of website where
individuals can get behind a particular
product and get a lower price if they
can get enough people to commit to
purchasing it so it's a way of getting
expensive high quality stuff at a lower
price than you would usually get by
using the purchasing power of a larger
group so if you're interested in
checking out what they've got I will
link them down in the description as
well they sent this out to me to take a
closer look and show you guys some of
the cool stuff that you can find on mass
drop so this is called the dark voice
and besides you have that little bit of
text on the front you probably can't
read anything else on maybe this down
here unless you speak Chinese because
this thing is completely in Chinese the
manual so we're not going to get much
information from there actually you can
see the model name in there 3 3 6 s e
that's the model of this device that's
in front of us which as I said before
goes by the name of dark voice great
name by the way so I'm going to go ahead
and remove some foam here and give you
guys a better look at what's inside the
package there's some stuff in there but
I'll put that to the side for a moment
this is the dark voice and it is a
headphone amplifier for you know
heavy-duty
audio file type listeners that want to
get
more out of their headphones or maybe
you've got a very special pair of
headphones that needs a lot of power to
drive them then you might be looking at
a headphone amplifier as well also
individuals who are looking for a warmer
sound than is currently available on
digital music amplifiers like this are
really popular for bringing back some of
that warmth that individuals used to get
on analogue audio again this is a
subjective thing it's not like there's
one solution that's better than another
this is just for individuals who are
looking for a particular sound and in
many listening scenarios this can
improve the performance of your
headphones Wow is this thing heavy I
don't know how much this actually weighs
but my goodness one of the heavier items
I've ever featured here on unbox therapy
so solid construction here these
locations here I believe are for the
actual tubes which are stored over there
in the styrofoam for now if you've never
seen a tube amplifier before it looks
pretty crazy mad scientist-type design
you will actually have these giant bulb
looking tubes that stick out here I'll
install those in a moment hopefully I
know what I'm doing I am new to this as
well just like you guys so bear with me
okay so on the back of the device here
you can see your audio inputs and
outputs left channel input right channel
input left channel output right channel
output and there is of course support
for your power cable you can also see
the model name up here 3 3 6 s II on the
front is where you're going to be able
to control this amplifier so you have
your headphone output as you can see it
is a quarter-inch output for high-end
headphones but if you've got you know a
set of headphones with a mini jack
connector you can get an adapter for
that you have your volume knob here
which is very very solid feeling once
again and then your on/off switch so
also included in the package here we
have our power cable pretty
self-explanatory we've also got our tube
that's crazy
ok let's open this up and see about
installing this now I was reading in
some of the forums online that you can
actually replace
these with different tubes if you're
looking for a different sound you can
actually really change the attributes of
a tube amplifier just by swapping out
this tube for a different one and of
course eventually if you need to change
it for any other reason it's nice to
know that it's interchangeable so I
believe there's two in here so it's a
small one in a big one yet there we go
there's the other one so let's go ahead
and get this in here there we go
I'm just going to try and be gentle with
it it is glass after all so that's in so
now that you guys have taken a closer
look at this dark voice headphone
amplifier I'm going to plug it in set it
up and give it a listen and you guys
will be able to catch my feedback as it
happens my reaction I have a pair of
headphones here these are the sennheiser
HD 8 DJ headphones that i recently unbox
if you haven't seen that video you
should definitely go check it out and
these have a cable that terminates in a
mini jack connector but it has this
quarter inch adapter so I can compare
the sound from a standard smartphone as
an audio source and then using this
adapter I can input the smartphone's
output into this dark voice and then use
this adapter to connect to the front
here and see what the improvements are
if any now this is not the ideal
listening scenario you want to start out
with higher fidelity files and a better
player if you can and trust me I've got
more on the way regarding that but for
the purpose of this video and test we'll
just do an a/b my reactions to some
music via the smart phone directly
compared with some music that's going
through the dark voice tube headphone
amplifier so let's go ahead get this set
up plug it in that's important and then
I got to go find an adapter cable so I
can put my mobile player into the
standard RCA type audio jacks okay so I
have the dark voice plugged in now I
managed to track down the
adapter cable so we have a mini Jack
connector on one end and standard RCA s
on the other this will go into the
inputs on the back of this amplifier
I'll just leave it there connected for
now because the first thing I want to do
is just use the standard headphone
connection right into the iPhone here
just just as a comparison I'll use the
same song going straight into the
headphones without the amplifier I'm
going to test that out first and then
second I'm going to plug it into the
dark voice via this adapter on the front
like I mentioned already but anyway so
I'm going to do an a/b comparison and
you're going to get to watch it in real
time I guess I can turn this on now I'm
just going to listen to some audio right
now to myself unfortunately you can't
hear this it's playing now you're going
to watch me just zoned out a little bit
here haha okay so pretty good these are
good headphones and as I said before not
a particularly difficult headphone to
drive an audio player can drive these
headphones that's why they include this
adapter cable so next let's take the
same track put this adapter on here put
it into the dark voice adjust the volume
I have no idea how loud this is going to
be I'm going to rewind this exact same
song here and you can see the tubes are
starting to glow a little bit I'm not
sure maybe under the light you can't see
it but you can see some orange light if
you come up real close I'll give you
guys a closer image of that okay so here
we go
okay so I'm just adjusting the volume a
little bit here to get the the right
level
comparative to what I had before again
this is not a question of better or
worse this is a question of the type of
sound that you're looking for a question
of subjectivity like I said okay so I
have I have an immediate way to describe
it just based on that little minor
listening experiment obviously I haven't
tried out my entire inventory of music
and it's a really basic low fidelity
song but there is definitely a
difference an immediate difference to me
the only reason I kept listening is
because I just wanted to make sure I
wasn't missing anything else this sounds
a little bit more alive that's how I
would describe it meaning is a little
bit more resonance or it feels like
there is I don't know if technically
there is the space that the sound is
filling feels a little bit larger a
little bit more life I don't know if
that's the right way to say it a little
bit more live and a little bit less
machine sort of produced if that makes
any sense now I was listening to sort of
what you would call maybe a classic
hip-hop style beat and obviously this is
going to vary depending on the type of
music that you're into but with a
classic hip-hop beat you're dealing with
samples that come from some old-school
recordings and as a result this kind of
equipment here gives you a little bit
more of that old-school vibe in the
sound similar probably to the type of
production equipment that may have been
used to originally create that sound
these things here these tubes that
you're looking at how about have a long
storied history in the music world and
many many people prefer the type of
sound reproduction that you're going to
get out of an amplifier that does
include tubes again I want to be very
clear it depends on how you like to
listen to your music but if you're like
me and you
feel that sometimes digital music is
maybe lacking a little bit in the warmth
area this is a great way to add some
warmth for your home listening
environment when you know you're
chilling back and you're going to be
listening to a ton of music then it's
like oh listen let me go to my listening
station let me relax let me sit on the
couch let me plug into the dark voice
and really pay attention to the
instrumentation really pay attention to
maybe some some little nuances in the
music that you may not pick up on when
you're using a crappy little built-in
amplifier that exists on your device or
even your computer computers don't have
great built-in amps usually and you know
this putting this in the middle of the
chain can can be a great fix for that
but ultimately the ultimate solution is
to come into this device with a high
fidelity song a high fidelity file to
begin with or high fidelity player like
a high-end CD player or a record player
something come in with a really nice
source to begin with and then let this
do the rest of the work that's an
awesome sort of set up if you're going
for the ultimate this was a quick test
this is the setup that I have here right
now another very cool player actually a
couple different cool players are going
to be coming in very shortly and I will
hook them up to this dark voice and give
you guys some more feedback probably on
Twitter and wherever else it is that I
communicate with you so if you're not
following me on Twitter go check me out
there I'm at unbox therapy my links will
be down in the description a link to
this dark voice headphone amplifier will
also be down in the description so check
that out to show some support to mass
drop big thanks to them for hooking this
hooking me up with this so far very
exciting stuff these tubes actually heat
up it's really cool they're they're
heating the space right now now anyways
some old-school tech that is still very
cool in the modern day if you haven't
heard music through tubes you should
definitely try it out and see if it's
something you're into so far really cool
I'm really excited gonna go listen to
some more music now thanks for watching
guys if you enjoyed this content please
remember
leave a thumbs up down below and I will
catch you very shortly on the next
episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
