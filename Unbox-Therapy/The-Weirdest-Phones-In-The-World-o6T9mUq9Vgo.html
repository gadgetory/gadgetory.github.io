phone and every set of features the
world it continues to surprise you with
very specific phones that you never
would have guessed existed or needed to
exist and this is the purpose for my
constant exploration of the gadget
universe it is my duty to show you what
exists so let's get started oh I don't
know on the left all you see on the box
mini we are not creative we are beyond
creative hey that doesn't get you fired
up I don't know what looking around the
boxes and it's not gonna tell you too
much oh okay
this now this is interesting that is the
entire phone this little tiny package it
looks like a key fob to unlock your BMW
Jack have you ever seen anything like it
in your life it even says BMW on it if
this was on your keychain nobody would
know you are carrying around a
communication device how and where does
the magic happen just like this boom
that is a flip phone holy smokes could
see it's got the BMW grille at the top
for the earpiece an old fashioned dial
pad it's almost some special agent type
thing we got everything we got a USB
cable a headset in there look how tiny
little battery is 600 milliamp hours but
who cares it's not a smart phone this
should this should be just fine a USB
power brick of a BMW keychain to carry
it on except the B is kind of blacked
out no copyright infringement there I
guess it's just an M W so you get that
and you get an extra battery to double
batteries with this guy that's kind of
good all right so let's see how this
functions pull it back off you can see
in here SIM card tray and micro SD card
slot what giving you a micro SD on
something this tiny that's wild now
let's put the battery in yeah
who'd this guy up look at that oh man
that was uh that was the sound of a BMW
right there oh wow so the whole menu is
BMW themed here let's see what kind of
applications were working with you
Internet what I don't think you're gonna
want to be browsing on there folks look
this is not the point of this phone ok
got this baby on the keychain oh look at
the way it's lighting up you can see
that hold on
flip boom get with the times a jack does
your phone do this bam bam Oh baby
that's special that's a button Oh
excuse me haha it beeps like you just
locked your car soapy maybe people are
even gonna believe it man that's almost
worth the price of admission right there
I don't care what this costs is that a
camera on the back oh boy we can't miss
that 240 by 320 resolution on the camera
let's see something here
you know it's there it's got a camera on
it please insert memory card okay well
you're not buying this for the cat I
told you already
all right this is a secret agent phone
easy that no one's even gonna recognize
as being a phone at all
plus you do that every so often it's
very weird that's the whole purpose of
this video now this one the box says new
mind and this one goes a step further
it's a full-on car but it's a phone holy
moly
Porsche I guess I don't know which model
that's inspired by the GT maybe you can
see that has a camera on it a speaker
the phone itself looks kind of cool as
well but I like that they kept the trunk
icon much like the last device we were
looking at this one has a microUSB port
a headphone jack holy smokes they fit
that in there this is just uh just a
charger that's all you that's all you're
gonna get it's probably all you need two
thousand milliamp hours that's a step up
that's an upgrade now let's see if I can
power it up this guy might need a charge
I definitely need oh here we go all
right I'm gonna leave this one plugged
in but it's booting up now oh this has
its own sound effects situation going on
okay so there's a Porsche vehicle
Porsche a Porsche vehicle on the
wallpaper there to commemorate the whole
situation here the fact that you're
making phone calls on a car Oh same
thing like the BMW key the interface has
an automotive motif in this case though
I'm seeing an Audi and a beanpole you
hear that
because you're about that speed but it's
gonna Lambo like it doesn't have to
here's another Audi something happened
there it was a space-time continuum
multi-dimensional black hole
Dark Matter expansion of the universe
was all there Jack uh also a camera 128
by 160 it's worse than 144 P all right
feel the pain it's just it's weird cuz
it's a car that's pretty much it like
you know that secretly there's a phone
underneath there I guess it's kind of
cool if I was going weird zone I will
probably take the other one this one is
real covert ops like that looks like a
key fob Plus who's kidding who who's
kidding who
y'all fooling me I'm fooling you next up
we have this this thing is kind of crazy
this is a very large phone okay it's an
iPhone and you're gonna find out why in
a moment here like just feast your eyes
on that baby looks kinda like a Walkman
I'm gonna have to use my my Mandarin
skills look at the size of this battery
that is a brick 6000
that's a fat battery power brick
microUSB pretty straightforward what
makes this phone special is actually
right here it has a giant speaker on it
it's like the boombox in your phone
alright you carry the party with you
right in your phone it also has a giant
flashlight on it so I guess in a sense
it's kind of like a survival phone like
how many buttons it has like what what's
even going on yes look at the size of
the speaker unit sheesh two SIM card
trays and an SD card slot on the bottom
you have micro USB to charge it up but
you've also got a full size USB port
since it does have a giant battery in it
you can use this to charge up other
devices that's kind of cool now it's a
tank that'll get you up in the morning
oh my goodness okay big buttons here
call button contacts button here's the
camera I guess oh boy you see that now
it's like 1992 at least you know you
took a photo whole leap can be covert in
the streets like whoa all right here's
the music this is really what it's about
here we go wow that's emotional I don't
know I feel like this speaker it might
even beat the razor phone speakers the
crazy stuff I'm into it
and it's got a dedicated switch that's
another crazy thing to consider this is
a new phone it's not like I'm looking at
some relic or museum item it's like
there are some fun stuff out there
you're just unaware of it
welcome to the weird zone now this one
blew my mind when I saw it if you look
inside you see some some flashy green
over there don't just look at this phone
okay
Lou I don't understand it looks like a
flip phone a flashy Apple green apple
green did you say apple green apple what
how crazy is that just a straight-up
Apple logo on a random flip phone that
is wild that's a real thing that's a
product this is you right here this is
you that's bold that's you you're
driving in a car you're hanging out in
the high school cafeteria just chatting
it up on your Apple phone I have to
admit plus like the build quality is
actually kind nice on it easily
Apple could learn a thing or two oh this
has a moose but more modern interface
fun
QQ WeChat eBook browsers I mean I feel
like as far as these crazy phones go
this one is probably the most actually
usable it just reminds you of an era
gone by imagine sampling this thing this
is some crystal castle
whoa that was a wild ride
Oh did anyone see that Jack watch this
ready here we go
whoo try and get your iPhone to do that
and on the open $2,000 iPhone 10 can't
do that that that that Wow the world of
weird phones is weird and I love it and
I hope you do too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
