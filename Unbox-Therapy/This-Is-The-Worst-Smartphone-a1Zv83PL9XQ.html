what about the worst because it's
important to also know what to avoid so
that you don't end up being one of the
unlucky people ending up with a piece of
garbage and I think that might be what
we have here today I could be wrong
maybe I'm gonna have an experience
that's unexpected but this in front of
me is the worst reviewed lowest rated
smartphone on Amazon it has 1.5 stars
there's 19 reviews all terrible all
telling me this thing has bloatware
viruses people do not like this
smartphone and it has ruined their lives
to varying degrees it's from a company
called V Mobile now it's cheap it's 74
bucks
74% of the reviews are one-star it's
lost the money don't do it phone locks
up every time I try to use it slow it
glitches if it gets below 6% the whole
thing freezes it doesn't take a charge I
lost my $70 it sucks
terrible super slow doesn't work this is
a piece of garbage
it worked for a month never buy this
then this one guy four stars it's solid
it's built solid it must have been Jack
he's like I don't know if it's gonna
ever make a phone call I have all the
viruses in the world but it's built
solid and so forth so it sounds terrible
what better way to find out than to
crack this baby open and get the truth
for ourselves
it is the end 8 - end from V mobile you
know what it doesn't feel that bad
I am very skeptical of that Zeiss logo
at the moment give you a screen
protector ok a headset is included in
the package and a microUSB cable this
ain't winning any points for screen to
body ratio pretty basic looking device
you can see a little bit of branding
there it charges from the top
can't say I've bumped into this I don't
think ever it ships with the battery
protected oh man so weird bonus points
for the dual SIM setup and the
expandable storage how about that Oh
Mariga no no setup that's always freaky
right when it comes pre setup like who
set it up now first things first the
screen itself is like gritty in terms of
bloatware there's actually not a ton of
it up see there's a backup an FM radio a
weird Settings icon but at least at
first glance not a ton of bloat
pre-installed actually the hell looks
okay alright now could this be a gem
jack a $75 gym or all these people wrong
is the Internet wrong is Amazon wrong
I'm gonna turn off this HDR try a stock
one I mean obviously like it's all blown
out there's bad dynamic range going on
what about on a selfie front it's not
terrible usable for 75 bucks that's for
certain
well about the speakers that's
interesting I just typed YouTube and it
was an unbox therapy video that's crazy
how they're like there's not much
saturation on the image at all speakers
not good but it's pretty loud how do you
multitask on this thing this button
doesn't do it that's just to add more
screens this button what have they done
to this skin there is there is no
multitask you just to go back now people
said the trouble comes when they try to
make a phone call so as your price throw
the sim in here this is a bad idea all
right you ready we'll give me a ring
dude hello I mean it works as a phone
ladies and gentlemen what dave to d be
impressed by the smart phone can he play
overwatch on it winner of the spyware
classic tournament you know what this
this phone call it's fine
the cameras better than I expected the
sound is better than I expected the
video quality is better than I expected
I mean I thought this was a complete
piece of garbage I mean the guy in the
in the review said garbage what can we
really say in our case the thing is
working like it's doing it's doing what
it should do
come on we'll get in here get over here
well oh just died
are we rolling it just died 70 percent
battery it just died I was about to say
it's half decent and they were all crazy
and wrong
look at that it's rebooting now I was
about to be like well you know 76
percent battery I was about to be like
yeah how about that noise here you go I
got you a new phone I got your new phone
nevermind that pixel yours and just
throw it away I don't mind it
what it is running Android it's but it
shut down imagine that with your real
phone yeah though that would be a
one-part that's pretty annoying who we
use this for a while you should be on
this for a week
no yeah let me get a virus it's gonna
haunt my life it died again yeah you
can't have that it died again okay this
is we figured this thing out this is
garbage this is the worst smartphone on
Amazon for good reason like we just
ordered one just like any other human
would and it definitely just shuts down
on its own yeah five minutes within
shooting that's twice now well I guess
at least we've warned people because it
is still a product listed on Amazon will
it boot back up without me it will boot
back up it just turns off ok hot garbage
there you go I think it's just as
important to know which products to
avoid as it is to know which ones to get
absolutely you see what I'm doing there
ah every time okay don't do this to
yourself avoid at all costs
stay away it could get worse it probably
would if you actually own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
