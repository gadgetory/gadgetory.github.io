therapy and today we're taking a look at
Zelda Skyward Sword for your Nintendo
Wii now this one is obviously the
special edition and what that means is
you're going to get the golden Wemo to
go along with all this other gold the
boxes gold the game cases gold so much
gold it's got to be thinking about Las
Vegas and probably saying why Las Vegas
because I'm gonna be going there in
January to cover the Consumer
Electronics Show CES I'm really excited
about it just got my pass in the mail I
want to let you guys know I'm going to
bring you some crazy product coverage
from there anyways let's talk about this
unboxing first we had our user manual
probably telling you not to throw this
beautiful golden Wemo through your
television hopefully you guys can
restrain yourselves from doing that and
ironically you've got golden batteries
of course it's all got to be done up in
gold and as you can see the Wiimote
actually ships with the protective
covering on it you can go ahead and
remove that give you guys a closer look
at the device underneath the protection
and as you notice it's got gold paint
everywhere gold on top gold on the
bottom just tons of bling right but
otherwise it's a regular Wiimote it's
going to function the same as any newer
style Wiimote got a little a little
design there over top of the speaker and
on the bottom you'll notice that it is
the Motion Plus inside controller so it
is the newer technology and on the back
of the battery cover you'll see the
Nintendo logo as well now the game case
is actually real nice I'm going to give
you guys a closer look at the artwork on
the front of the case towards the end of
the video so definitely stick around but
first let's go inside and see which
extras are included the first and most
major one you're going to notice of
course is the symphony disk that is
going to be your soundtrack it's going
to give you all yours beautiful Zelda
tunes and as we all know that music is
epic as hell so having Symphony disc is
real cool loaded up to your computer get
those mp3s off or do something with it
whatever you please and we've also got
the game disc of course that's kind of
important and on the left-hand side is
where the paperwork is quite a bit of
paperwork actually some special stuff
from Nintendo as well as your user
manual and
little pamphlet explaining that Symphony
disk and how they produced all that
music etc you've even got this little
catalog here outlining some of the other
stuff available currently for your
Nintendo Wii and here is that pamphlet I
mentioned regarding 25 years of Zelda
and of course this Symphony that they
worked on specifically for the game and
for this soundtrack that's being
included with this specific edition so
the last thing we've got is the user
manual which actually is a substantial
user manual a proper user manual none of
this two page trifold situation you've
actually got something you can hold on
to and do some late-night reading if you
so choose so lastly I want to give you
guys a closer look at the artwork it's
actually fairly detailed this golden
material here is kind of hard to see
from a distance so I want to get you
guys up close this is the 25th
anniversary something worth
commemorating this is a big game a giant
game as you guys know and as you can see
here on the bottom you can you can see
the logo The Legend of Zelda Skyward
Sword anyway guys if you enjoyed this
content hopefully you can like and
favorite this video as it does help me
keep doing what I'm doing and otherwise

about the products that are upcoming
