smartphone all right we got a fancy box
here it's from oneplus what a surprise
now at the time that I'm filming this
video I have not seen this device beyond
the leaks and rumors and whatnot but
when you're watching this the event has
happened so you saw everything so just
keep that in mind but let's go ahead
let's have the experience let's see what
it's all about okay kind of a cool
unboxing experience never settled okay
this looks like a 1 plus 7 over here we
have the new bullets Wireless bullets
Wireless 2 is the reviewers guy go
beyond speed okay so this is gonna have
all the specs you see 1 plus 7 Pro
there's your first look oh my goodness
we were right snapdragon 85 up to 12
gigs of ram ufs 3.0 6.67 qhd+ AMOLED it
has a 90 Hertz refresh rate display a
516 PPI there is a night mode I'm gonna
test that out see what that's all about
48 megapixel triple camera with an ultra
wide-angle lens and a 3x optical zoom
warp charge 34,000 milliamp hour battery
dual stereo speakers Dolby Atmos haptic
vibration and a 10 layer liquid cooling
system Wow my model by the looks of it
nebula blue with 12 gigs of ram and 256
gigs of storage that's a lot around it's
of course on par with flagship level
devices and when it comes to the
processor Snapdragon e55 I mean what
more can you ask for right now in this
day and age ok phone goes there bullets
wireless - these are of course wireless
earbuds okay so the headphones are 109
so they went up in price as well warp
charge 30 car charger so you can bring
your warp charge into the car not just
at home that's kind of nice to have the
warp charge will charge up close to 50
percent of battery life on the four
thousand milliamp hour battery in about
20 minutes of charge see that jack the
special unbox therapy knife little
teaser right there so last year's one
plus sixty came out at 549 and this one
obviously one plus seven Pro it's
starting at 669 whoa that is a cool blue
actually it's a matte blue like a kind
of Samba
the glass look what do we see we see the
camera situation triple and setup on the
back a wide-angle lens we have a zoom
lens this is the thing now you want to
be in a flagship territory which this
one is getting awfully close with the
price now at 669 it's very close for
example to the galaxy s 10a which I
think a lot of people are going to
compare this to and so now it's like
okay we're gonna throw all the camera
modules in there to compete at that
level of course the one plus motto has
been flagship killer I mean not
officially but that's sort of how people
have referred to this device throughout
the years so they try to bring those
flagship level specs into a lower price
point and if this one can replicate a
flagship experience or spec list then
that might be the move for you who knows
USB type-c is on the bottom we also have
a speaker unit there this thing
apparently has stereo speakers which I'm
quite curious about this up here this is
gonna be the pop-up front-facing camera
of course not the first time we've seen
it but the first time we've seen it on a
oneplus device and the first time we've
seen it at this price point over here we
have the three-stage switch that you're
used to with oneplus devices I like that
it has a texture to it it allows you to
quickly switch between your audio
profiles all right before I boot that up
also inside the package
warp charger power supply unit it's it's
a little hefty but you know what it
brings to the table very fast charging
in the past
oneplus has had some of the fastest
charging if not the fastest charging
devices on the market so you're
definitely willing to make that
sacrifice for the speed iconic red USB
type-c cable and that's that alright
let's boot this guy up that is a full
screen display it does have a slightly
you know slightly more of a chin and a
forehead which is maybe they designed
the wallpaper to hide that a tiny bit
but it's really I mean it's relatively
insignificant as you can see on this
page right here never have we seen a
smartphone targeted specifically at the
North American market with no knotch
no weird cutout scenario at the top at
this price you don't have to worry about
any distraction now you can also sort of
see the speaker grille up there it's
very
subtle maybe Jack can get a better look
at it there boom right there we gotta
check out the motorized front-facing
camera option here so flick this to the
front camera it should pop up there it
is very smooth very quiet there I am I
doubt the mic even picked I don't think
the mic pick up anything there but you
know how moving parts you have a motor
in there if this is an important thing
to consider this is where it gets a bit
weird I've been a fan of face unlock on
oneplus products for a while now because
it's so fast now it's not the most
secure but it's really fast so if you
want to make that exchange speed for
security you could and you can have
maybe one of the fastest if not the
fastest face unlock in the game with the
pop-up camera not only does it take a
second to pop out but now you're
utilizing that motor a lot and maybe
you're more inclined to go with the
fingerprint maybe this is the compromise
maybe this is maybe this is your next
phone I don't know
alright let's test out these speakers I
kept talking about doing real curious
just before I pop off a few shots with
the camera
there's also Dolby Atmos in here now
it's in dynamic by default Eve it there
of course mmm little little monthly a
little bit monthly most of the sound is
coming out of the lower speaker here if
you cover this speaker grille you're
left with mostly high-end out of the
other side so again it's this thing
where manufacturers are saying okay this
is stereo speakers but in reality it's
two speakers doing different things
let's just I I just I got to get to the
Bauman's because I is it my ears I
should I should know for sure huge and
you want something sweat resistant well
this has although nine hours of Wireless
played 24 hours with the charging case
sweat components and attributes that's
all I think I would give the clarity
award here to the iPhone maybe there's a
little bit more low end on the oneplus
but possibly at the expense of clarity
the iPhone wins in a sound Department
tried a couple different scenarios I
think the music setting on the Dolby is
a bit better like when you have that
engaged versus dynamic mode on the
oneplus now we might as well pop up the
camera while we're at it
okay so 0.6 this is what I like this is
cool this gives you a really wide field
of view as Jack can kind of showcase
their boom now if I switch to the
standard focal range you can spot the
difference and then of course 3x zoom
what's the difference going to be so
there's one there's two there's three
and this is the best excuse for jamming
a bunch of cameras a bunch of lenses
into your smartphone is to give you
different focal ranges that allows you
to have a different perspective and
ultimately create different photos as
opposed to in the past where like these
extra lenses were capturing extra data
for various portrait modes and whatnot
this is just immediately useful as you
can see let's go ahead and grab the
plants so once again we're gonna go wide
we will move to standard and all the way
up to 3x zoom look at that so wallpaper
right there we're doing wallpapers with
the famous fake grass these results look
kind of promising right now there's
still a portrait mode in here so we have
our famous model here and we will focus
in here she's in focus the plant is
blurred the shoulder this is what you
look for the edge detection in the
portrait mode and it looks okay now
there's also a night mode they're
calling it night scape and it kind of
have to have it these days like you've
got to have a night mode let's go dark
oh it's staying bright Wow okay you know
you can see how dark I am I'm barely a
shadow over here but the plant is still
there so Jack you can go ahead and pick
that up and of course you're in that
frame of course we got Kirk in this
frame say what's up Kirk there you are
it's in here and that's a promising sign
that's a good thing
I think at this price point pretty much
everybody's gonna want to have it now I
can't forget that pop-up fancy
front-facing camera it's a fairly wide
selfie situation
as you can see their HDR mode seems to
be engaged here by default but Beauty
mode off by default oh not the most
friendly there on the contrast it blew
out my cheek now keep in mind I take the
same selfie with almost every smartphone
that comes across here so it looks have
a bit of an issue with dynamic range
here now maybe I can get it zeroed in on
my cheek a little bit better it's very
sharp the beard hair test is there but
again this cheek is blown out whichever
cheek is facing the light so we're gonna
have to wait and see how this works in a
real-world environment but right now I'm
feeling like that software has to be
tweaked a bit now they claim to have
improved the fingerprint scanner on this
model so I'm gonna go ahead and and
register here since I think this how
most people are gonna unlock their to
fight ooh it's faster it is absolutely
faster it might be the fastest in
display I think it's the fastest in
display I've used ooh
this technology is finally getting
perfected now to the point where you're
not gonna be thinking about face unlock
to the point where you're not gonna be
thinking about fingerprint scanners they
still have face on lock on this as well
if you want to use it but the question
is how quickly does this front-facing
camera pop up now in the past
oneplus face unlock has been crazy fast
I've shown it off before but now you're
dealing with the pop up camera so let's
see how long it takes huh it's not
terrible but it's definitely not as fast
as it used to be now keep in mind that's
strictly optical based right it's just a
front-facing camera comparing your face
to the image that's stored inside of
here so it's not going to be as secure
as other technologies that are out there
and then you take into account now that
it's a little bit slower than if you
didn't have to pop the camera up and
again I just feel like you're just gonna
use the fingerprint I would turn that
off
I don't think I will use that frequently
it does work but you're going
be stressing out you'll be using that
motor on a front-facing camera a lot the
display qhd+ fluid AMOLED six point six
seven inches it's a big display bigger
than six and a half inches so here's the
main advantage I mean this is why you
want the bezel list design there's no
distraction it's all video and this is
the trade-off that they're asking you to
make they're saying okay
your front-facing camera it's gonna pop
out it's gonna use a motor it's gonna
hide most of the time in exchange here's
what you're gonna get you're gonna get
all video all the time and when you
think about video consumption and
content consumption on a smartphone
that's the thing that most people do
frequently but I think most of you are
spending more time watching video than
taking selfies could it be a huge issue
if the camera didn't come up from you
one day maybe and I actually needed it
but this right here is everyday if
you're looking at the same frame that I
am that's a lot better than any kind of
notch or even a hole punch that I've
seen so the display on this unit by the
way is ninety Hertz which is kind of
unusual we've seen some gaming phones
with increased Hertz ratings in the past
what this means is I mean it's not just
for gaming it's also your input like
when you're swiping through a list for
example it's the impression of
reactiveness and responsiveness it's
just a little bit more twitchy when
you're using it you do notice it I don't
think it's the reason to get this device
but it is cool to see it in an OLED
panel so this could be an interesting
target device for gamers when you
combine the OLED display at 90 Hertz
along with the stereo speakers and no
knotch to cover up any element of the
gameplay you could imagine this being a
popular choice of course all the RAM and
the snapdragon 855 doesn't hurt either
this is worth noting as well it's
available in other colors so I have
nebula blue it's also going to be
available in mirror gray and almond
almond kind of looks like a champagne
gold they claim the pop up cameras
elevator mechanism has been tested over
three hundred thousand times that's a
lot this means if you were to use the
camera 150 times a day
you'd still be able to use it for five
years they also say here that the camera
module in a fraction of a second will
retract if the device is in freefall as
detected by the accelerometer and
gyroscope so it's gonna go in there and
protect itself like some sort of a
turtle in its shell turtle in a half
shell turtle power all right so what can
I say about this device it's one plus
continuing their trend upwards
continuing to get more premium with a
more premium price tag to match the
bezel list display which has been a
relatively nice thing we're gonna give
you top-of-the-line specs you just got a
pony up 669 now the X Factor on this
device is going to be the camera you saw
here in the demo especially on the front
facing it's like mmm maybe something
could be done in the software you saw
into portrait mode it's like hmm are we
really a pixel level here now the only
way for me to get to the bottom of that
is to put the SIM card in here and hit
it up on the daily snap it off those
photos and seeing what I'm working with
the rear camera looks promising even in
this environment I thought the plant
shot for example look pretty good so
here's the thing if the camera can
exceed my expectations in the real world
we're gonna have a serious contender on
our hands here I think there's gonna be
a few people upset that oneplus is
demanding more of your dollars but this
is one of those cases in which I feel
like they really are giving you more and
they're being more ambitious in what
they're delivering I'm actually a bit
more excited for it having it in my hand
because what it represents for me is a
different is something different from
what the other flagships are doing I
have experimented with bezel s devices
in the past but never daily drove one
whether you hate that term or not is the
best way to describe putting your sim
card in a smartphone this time around
I'm gonna do it because I'm happy with
the software in the oneplus package in
general I've used oneplus devices in the
past exclusively so I'm gonna pop my sim
card in here and be excited to do so
just because of the fact that the front
of the display it's all display and it's
just not that many devices out there
right now offering that opera
unity and definitely not a lot of
devices targeting North America at 669
that offer up that opportunity so I'm
gonna be happy to slip my sim card in
here I'll let you know about the camera
later but for now that's the one +7 Pro
669 starting price nebula blue Worf
charge Snapdragon 650 5 up to 12 gigs of
ram four thousand milliamp hour battery
OLED display at 90 Hertz it's an
interesting package</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
