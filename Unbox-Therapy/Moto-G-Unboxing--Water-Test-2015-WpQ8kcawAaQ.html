here back with another video and today I
am excited to bring you the new Moto G
from Motorola this was shown up
yesterday for the first time and now we
have the retail packaging right here on
unbox therapy this is a very exciting
device for a number of reasons but for
me the biggest one is the package the
overall value what you get for your
money this retails for a hundred and
seventy nine dollars unlocked so this
device is actually ipx7 water-resistant
that means it can withstand immersion in
up to three feet of fresh water don't
get salty on it for up to thirty minutes
if you drop it in your toilet you're
still good to go
water damage kills a ton of phones it
ain't gonna kill your new Moto G it is a
five inch HD display so it's 1080p
it's got Gorilla Glass for a little
extra durability there got a new 13
megapixel camera on the back and a five
megapixel front facing camera these are
really interesting specs for this price
point it's also got a relatively pure
Android experience Motorola calls it
pure Android there are some Motorola
pre-installed functions though they are
fairly lightweight and they don't really
interfere with the overall OS so inside
the box you're greeted with the device
first it is LTE capable also that ipx7
that I mentioned before 2500 or just
under 20 500 milliamp hour battery
microSD expansion on the back is a new
material just like here that does this
make me a DJ and there are some
instructions here for removing the back
part of the case it's got this nice
little dimple it's a design touch that
motorola has been using for a while here
you can see the dual tone flash which is
going to help with color correction as
we flip to the side a volume rocker very
slender as well as a power slash lock
switch which is a different texture this
is really nice when you reach over on
the side you just know immediately which
one is which fairly familiar design
headphone jack on the top this is also
protected from the elements so you don't
need to use a flap you know I'm not a
big fan of flaps same thing goes for the
bottom where you have your micro USB
slot this one it's also for
against moisture there we go very
similar to the previous gen there's your
forward facing camera up top M pulling
off the back of the device you'll see
there are a couple of rubber gaskets
these protect the susceptible areas of
the device the micro SD card slot as
well as SIM tray this is the 8 gigabyte
model of the device but who cares when
you have that affordable microSD
expansion let's check out the other
items inside the box motorola charge
brick a little bit of paperwork that's
about it new little intro screen here
very nice one of the best things about
various motorola products that have
released recently is that they have a
very close to stock Android experience
this means two things you're going to
use Android as it was intended to be
used but also you're going to get
updates faster than devices from
manufacturers that put really heavy-duty
skins on there now the only alteration
that happens is this Motorola specific
icon here you can have it gauge how you
use the device on its own do so
automatically by adding places and
activities and the settings that you
might want on the phone given those set
activities you can also have it react to
motion for example there is a chopped
twice feature which enables the
flashlight oh I'll just be here for a
while and then also twist for capture
simply by twisting your hand like that
you can enable the camera really quickly
ready set
Oh booyah
now notifications is another thing that
Motorola has done well on this device in
previous ones where you can simply look
at your display tap it and see your
notifications without having to turn on
the whole screen which can drain some of
your battery life now this screen is
1080p yes there are quad HD displays out
there however not usually in the $179
range at this screen size 1080p is
really fine now the next big question is
the camera and as I said before it has
been improved it's now a 13 megapixel
shooter on the back snap a few here it's
pretty quick front facing camera looks
pretty high quality too so it'll do
1080p video at 30fps no 4k but again how
dare you complain the device is 179 oh
wow that's like some kind of a inception
situation there there's me there's me
again there's me recording me and me
recording me again alright so the
package looks pretty compelling at this
point 179 bucks which really puts it in
a class that's much different than the
flagships that are out there as I'm sure
you're aware but you're still getting
most of what makes modern smartphones
good including some things that aren't
even on flagships like that water
resistance so speaking of that water
resistance let's go ahead and test that
theory why does this feel so exciting
right now okay so before you do this you
want to make sure that that back cover
is installed correctly all right Oh
my goodness still playing just dumped in
there half an hour add up to three feet
this thing's surviving right now it's
playing video and look at that the
screen is still functioning correctly
shake it out a little bit so there you
have it motorola has put together a
fairly compelling package in the new
Moto G and when you try to think about
value what you're getting for your money
think this thing is going to be pretty
tough to beat anyways thanks very much
