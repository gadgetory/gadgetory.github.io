therapy and this is my iOS 5 review the
first thing I want to talk about is
notifications which are much improved
instead of interrupting what you're
doing you see how they just show up
along top here whether you're in a web
browser or whatever it is that you're
doing now this is Apple's new messaging
system the notifications can be accessed
at any time much like the Android system
for notifications and Apple's new
messaging system is real nice real quick
actually
it's been called the bbm killer and what
it what it does is it's basically
instant messaging for any of your Apple
devices right now I'm communicating
between my iPod touch with iOS 5 and
this iPad 2 you can send images
multimedia so on and so forth everything
happens really quickly and smoothly and
with that new notification system it
makes it even more usable more friendly
to use there you go you can see
instantaneously that image has been
transferred over to the iPod Touch real
cool for households that have multiple
iOS devices the next thing that I want
to talk about is Twitter now you may
think hey that just looks like the
regular Twitter app and it does but
what's changed is the integration in
other places within the operating system
when you click on settings you'll notice
that there's actually a Twitter icon
right within the Preferences panes the
settings pane on the left-hand side and
basically what you end up with is a
one-time login so that whatever it is
that you're doing
you've got Twitter options so for
example in the web browser you can tweet
web pages directly from there without
having to go to you know twitter.com or
into the Twitter app same as within
YouTube again you can tweet a video via
the share menu so really cool stuff a
big improvement now on the iPad version
of iOS 5 you've also got tabbed browsing
finally and obviously that's
self-explanatory it's gonna allow you to
set up a number of different tabs just
like in Firefox or Chrome for that
matter
and you know a real a real useful
addition as far as I'm concerned within
the web browser you may notice as well
everything is really quick loading up
unbox therapy com there it's got a
couple of ads big thumbnails so on and
so forth the next thing is this reading
list which I really like it's kind of
like
instapaper which was an app before that
you can add pages to your reading list
instead of say bookmarks you may not
want to keep them there forever
it's like a temporary reading list and
then from there you can sort of jump
back to them and check them out when you
have more time to read so you can have
all of them show up or you can toggle
the unread items so that you can get up
to date a very cool addition that might
be my favorite besides notifications the
next thing is newsstand and this is kind
of like the book application except for
magazines there's a number of them
available one thing I noticed though is
I couldn't seem to find the New York
Times for the iPad even though I could
get it on the iPod touch
I saw it show up there for a quick
second but I couldn't find it actually
with within the selectable options here
so let me know if you guys have
installed that on your on your iPad or
maybe it's just because I'm in Canada
I'm not really sure now most of the
books available or so I should say
magazines available the app is free but
then you've got to go ahead and buy the
individual issues of the magazine for
example Autoweek they're 99 cents an
issue and then you got to click Buy Now
and then I guess it'll be within there
for forever from that point forward
so the notifications are a little bit
more advanced you can actually go into
the notifications preferences within
settings and you can select the way you
want them to look as well as how often
you want to be notified and whether or
not they show up in your lockscreen
whether or not they have an audible
sound this is really nice I like the
ability to customize notifications
depending on the application the next
thing is reminders and this to me is not
really that big of a deal it's it's a
way of setting up little reminders
little notes and you can check them off
as you've done them or something that's
interesting is with Siri on the 4s you
can actually make them you know verbally
and it can also be location-based so you
can tie different tasks into specific
locations set up different lists so on
and so forth for the organized bunch
that you are next is the photo
application which has added a couple of
features when you select the Edit icon
here some of them are are what was there
before but others are new like redeye
reduction and otherwise you know you can
all
enhance the image get some better color
in there or at least the appearance of
more color and of course the crop
feature is there which I guess it's
pretty self-explanatory as well you can
crop there you go beautiful so moving on
I want to show you the difference in the
notification bar in the iPod Touch this
is what its gonna look like on the 4s
once I pick it up tomorrow I guess and
when you click on something from within
the notification bar it brings you
straight there so whether being a good
example but also male if you have a met
message or an email it'll bring you
right into that application from the
notification bar
real quick real smooth and the other
thing is lock screen notification so now
you don't actually have to go in to see
what it is and when you unlock with a
notification there it'll bring you
straight there so you go right into it
instead of having to unlock click on the
app and so on and so forth to take too
many steps brutal stuff that it used to
be so anyways these are all welcome
improvements no major kind of overhaul I
suppose Siri is what people are most
excited about and that's not really
available on these other devices yet it
looks like it's gonna be exclusive to
the 4s so for all of you other people
with devices all the way back to the 3GS
that are upgrading the iOS 5 these are
things that you can start to use
immediately improvements that you're
going to see immediately so anyway guys
if you like this content if you found
this helpful hopefully you can like and
favorite this video as it does help me
out a bunch and definitely stay tuned to
the channel for the iPhone 4s unboxing
and review which is going to be coming
up tomorrow as soon as I get my hands on
it if you haven't subscribed yet you're
gonna want to do that and anyway guys
until next time and as always thanks for
watching I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
