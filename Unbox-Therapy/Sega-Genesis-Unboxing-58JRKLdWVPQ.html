another video and today we're gonna do a
little throwback a little old-school
unboxing and that's what the backwards
hat is for this is my new uniform for
retro unboxing videos anyways we have
the Sega Genesis in front of me some of
you may have never seen this before if
you're younger if you're a little bit
older you probably have fond memories of
this console obviously it came out a
long long time ago but at the time this
was state-of-the-art equipment and if
you're my age now you probably really
really wanted one of these or maybe you
even had one you can see on the front of
the box join the 16-bit revolution the
best of the best in terms of graphics at
the time 16-bit color graphics built in
digital sound and stereo music
synthesizer on my extensive library of
hit games no games included in this core
system package I was lucky enough to
find one in amazing condition obviously
the box is intact we'll find out when we
get inside how how nice the system is in
terms of its quality and whether the
condition is good or not but yeah what
else is there to say about this let's
see I don't know let's take a closer
look at the back before I open it up on
the back of the unit you can see here
only Sega here's the Sega CD connection
issue to get at the time which the core
system sat on top of which is pretty
wild menace er look at that badass
looking weapon mega fire a controller
arcade power stick has it all here's
some of the games that you could
purchase for the Genesis Sonic the
Hedgehog 2 young Indiana Jones
chronicles Streets of Rage was one of my
favorites look at the classic x-men over
here anyways you guys get the idea some
boxing while Batman Returns never had
that tailspin home alone it was a home
alone game anyways you get the idea you
can figure out what we were working with
back then in terms of games and quality
and there's really a resurgence right
now of classic games where a lot of
people are going back and playing some
of these classics and having a lot of
fun you know obviously playing local
multi
there with two people just like we used
to do me and my brother on the left hand
side you'll notice that this version of
the Genesis has a separate headphone
output as well as a volume slider so you
could use this in privacy without the
need to have the sound being output via
your television which was unique and the
next version actually didn't feature
that so this is sort of the more
sought-after of the two popular Sega
Genesis consoles alright enough about
the preamble or enough with the preamble
let's go ahead get inside and see what
this thing looks like so this has
obviously been open before a lot of
people on Instagram were worried that I
was gonna open this for the first time
and like ruin the seal now I found this
at a used game shop and it's just just
happened to be in good condition but
it's not like it's never been opened
before this is actually pretty cool
though they have the original plastic in
there still so anyways we have the
console the power adapter
you know the Xbox that has a bigger
power adapter than this this looks like
it's not original this this isn't to
good condition is powered I don't know
maybe if you guys are connoisseurs of
retro wow maybe not actually says Sega
on it
I just don't think this particular
system was used all that much so there
you go says zeg on it not sure if you
guys can make that out in the camera
there but it says Sega I think it's the
original cool or maybe they replaced it
with an original manufacturers item here
is the controller what was special
obviously about the Genesis controller
is the three button layout so you have a
B and C buttons just a little bit of
dust on here so you have a d-pad nice
mushy B pad and a B C buttons so three
independent buttons over on the
right-hand side for your thumb and a
start button very simple what I do like
is it is a little bit ergonomic
obviously controllers have gotten
insanely ergonomic recently but for the
time this was surprisingly ergonomic you
see your fingers sort of fit on the
inside there and you have some decent
grip
but Wow have we ever come a long way of
course you're going to have some kind of
proprietary connector on the other end
as well for connecting the controller to
your console and then this is important
right here this I believe is called an
RF modulator I can't remember the name
switch you guys tell me down in the
comments but this is so that you could
connect to a television via the cable
port where you normally put your
television antenna back in the day or
your cable TV into and this RF switch
would take your oh wait a minute okay so
the RF switch is going to give you a
standard video output no no no no no I'm
messing up this video output I believe
is going to go into your system and then
you're going to put this part out to the
TV and you can still have your antenna
or cable coming into this box here so
that you don't need to disconnect it or
you know people obviously didn't have
multiple inputs on really old
televisions so you would need to have
this extra input here so you can still
have your TV coverage while you had your
console connected yes that is right
these are crazy-looking cables the NES
had something similar and basically I
mean it's tough to remember but
everything connected in this format once
upon a time
okay so last up we have actual console
this is the coolest part obviously let's
take this baby out very light
surprisingly light so original yeah
original plastic wrap you can see a
little masking tape there used to hold
it together temporarily wow this is in
decent shape for sure you can see
there's a little bit of dust up there
few scratches but otherwise pretty clean
so here's that dedicated switch for
volume the headphone output is also on
good front what a classic look it's the
black with the gray in the red is it me
or did gadgets used to look a lot more
masculine maybe not I don't know maybe
it's a nostalgia thing but this thing
looks pretty badass on/off switch well
not too refined on the on/off switch and
you hardly even remember these and a
reset button dedicated reset button
there's an LED to indicate the power
being on 16-bit in case you forgot Sega
Genesis in that location right there
let's flip it over on the back wow this
is in really good shape you can see on
the bottom here no scratches at all that
comes out no that must be for the Sega
CD attachment I guess Sega Genesis
system console serial number Sega of
America made in Taiwan if you need help
etc on the back is where all of your
connection points are in this location
here you have your channel switcher for
channel three or four once again that
goes back to that RF switch RF out AV
out so obviously there was a third party
table for alternative outputs if you
didn't want to use the standard cable
connector and then your power adapter
fits into that slot right there so a
fairly simple device obviously you know
back then they didn't have built-in hard
drives or anything like that but every
once in a while when I'm installing an
update or something on the PlayStation 4
Xbox one etc it makes you remember a
time where you just put in a cartridge
and play it immediately when you bought
it I mean you basically have to update
your system with every new release at
least it seems that way to me we're
updating a lot I almost forgot on the
front there's your headphone connection
point so like I said you can play in
privacy with your favorite set of
headphones and then you also have your
controller connectors like I mentioned
before control one and control two and I
think there's an adapter you can
purchase hmm maybe not for the Genesis I
can't remember now but I think I recall
an adapter to add extra controllers you
guys can correct me if I'm wrong down
below in the comment section so anyways
there you have it the original Sega
Genesis a throwback hopefully I sent you
guys into a time warp and you can
member some better days when life was
simpler but definitely bringing me back
and I can't wait to hook this up I have
a couple of games I have Streets of Rage
I have any child 94 in absolute classic
very fond memories of playing that game
with my friends my family members
brother cousin etc so I picked that one
up as well and I don't know I might
start to get into retro games a little
bit more not not because I believe
they're better or anything like that but
just to sort of rekindle some of those
innocent moments playing games back in
the day as a child I'm an old man now
wearing a backwards hat ready that
wraps this up thanks as always for
watching guys if you enjoyed this
content make sure to leave a thumbs up
down below and I almost forgot to
mention I have some other retro consoles
specifically one from Sega sitting right
over there the Dreamcast which was a
very important console in my life it was
not the most popular but I put an
enormous number of hours into that so
we'll talk about that one in an upcoming
video another throwback video let me
know in the comments if you guys like
these throwback videos I do enjoy making
them but after this I'm gonna move into
something a little bit more modern so
those of you that are only into the
latest stuff stick around I've got
something for you as well alright now
that really wraps this up I already said
thanks for watching and now I just say
catch you on the next episode that's the
usual line catch you on the next episode
later guys
