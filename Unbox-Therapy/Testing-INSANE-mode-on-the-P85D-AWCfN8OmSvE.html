brand new video and today I am excited
to share with you my initial experiences
with the Tesla p85d you are about to
encounter my test drive my acceleration
test this thing does 0 to 60 in 3.2
seconds but that's not the whole story
this is a utility vehicle in many ways
in fact they had snow on the test track
to show you what this thing is capable
of in a harsh climate and I have to say
I was very impressed but you don't want
to hear it from me let's let the footage
do the talking but before we get into a
big shout out to will from Tesla for
hooking up this test drive and
potentially an upcoming extended test
drive to find out what the p85d is like
in daily use that's potentially but
anyways enough about that let's roll
into the damn video driving I think
everyone's in a very familiar with our
insane acceleration mode that's the
block
that's the the money shot so my
instruction is to slam the gas pedal
seller accelerator no gasps what okay
but in Drive you gotta put it in Drive
first they can't do everything for you
you know how much dough is here it only
gets better I was just saying it's like
video games in real life driving around
that slalom they're continuing to
accelerate you gotta try this for
yourself I can only show you so much and
tell you so much alright guys so that
wraps up this video thank you as always
for watching and all of your support if
you enjoyed this content please be sure
to leave a thumbs up down below but
before I take off I have one more thing
I did some special videos for the AT&amp;amp;T
YouTube channel to bring some of that
unbox therapy treatment over to their
space and I shared one with you
previously it was the note 4 for AT&amp;amp;T I
also did one more which is now gone live
it is the LG G watch R so if you want to
see me checking out that device and
showing you some of the features and
whatnot and also including some
beautiful visuals I will drop a link
down in the description to that video on
their channel please head over and show
some love leave a comment leave a thumb
you know how it goes alright that's it
thanks guys later</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
