finger on the pulse I'm always looking
for that next gadget that thing you
didn't know you wanted yet so when HP
hit me up with their new sprocket and
they said hey Lou we would love to
sponsor an episode we'd love to send you
out our brand new device which takes
digital content and allows it to exist
in the real world and you hit a button
and an actual image a physical images
you could give to somebody prints out
well that's what this thing does put in
a kind of modern way the sprocket comes
along with an app for iOS or Android
which lets you take your images from
your smartphone social media and
otherwise and make a nice little 2x3
image from your smartphone you
understand what I'm saying now you can
hand that to somebody and be like hey I
want to commemorate this moment in a
real way not a digital way you want a
physical representation you want to
upgrade your sentiment so how does it
all work how is it so small what's going
on here Lou all right this has 10 sheets
included in the box it uses no ink he's
got a brand new printing technology from
Zink the printer look at how small it
that thing is tiny that looks like a
power switch and on the top here we have
a micro USB port here are the sheets of
paper sprocket
there we go I can picture you know the
kids at high school they got the binder
the notebook with the sticky images on
the back all those special moments so
now we're connected via bluetooth so I'm
gonna go ahead and launch the app and
what you'll notice is you have some
options here the ability to take a photo
or select the photo from various social
media so that's kind of cool you could
go back through your collection and
print stuff that's already up there
since it's always a party here in the
studio what better thing to photograph
then how much fun Jack is having say
cheese Jack 3 2 1 beautiful picture of
Jack over here a little editor that you
can use to enhance your photos put some
text on top of it moment of truth ah
load paper Oh
you've got this important sheet here and
that's going to identify to the printer
that is now loaded up first ever picture
of Jack here printed sending the printer
the smart sheet comes out first
Jack attack it's you man oh it Jack
attack now that is cool and now that's a
sticky back so I can stick that to
something to just remind myself of Jack
but what is actually more exciting to me
is the ability to print straight from
social media
that's my Instagram right there now I
could select any image I want on here
maneuver it here we go again round two
it's the racing simulator in real life
right over here they're like little
trading cards look at this so basically
you've got Instagram Facebook Flickr and
then your own camera roll so you can
select from any of those some filters in
here so let's let's give it that to you
right there all right we'll put that
filter on we're gonna put the old-school
Polaroid type frame on there that's like
some shades on top of shades action
right there that's the thug life shades
the diamond goatee you can put some text
as well anywhere you want deal with it
it's like a mini little Photoshop in
here haha this is one of one limited
edition it's probably worth like a
million dollars at least
oh that's artistic look at that right
there that's special by zinc zero ink an
HP sprocket I leave a thumbs up down
below if you want me to give this away
to some play one of a kind like I said
