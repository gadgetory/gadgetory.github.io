what's up guys Lew here back with
another unboxing video and today it is
the Apple watch not the Apple watch
sport the legit stainless steel Apple
watch this thing has been anticipated by
many different people I think they sold
10 million or something already so there
are some advantages to the Apple watch
over the Apple watch sport as I flip the
box here you'll see it has a stainless
steel enclosure 316l it also has a
sapphire crystal Retina display and a
ceramic back now in this case I've got
the black leather classic buckle so
let's go ahead and open this up as you
know with anything coming from Apple you
get this really nice presentation Apple
they really know how to do an unboxing
experience look at this look at that
unveils this fancy box here okay I'm not
gonna open that yet first let's look at
what else is inside here a manual in a
couple of different languages showing
you how to get the things set up how to
use it how to charge it so on and so
forth I actually ordered one of the
first charging docks for this watch so
expect that on the channel very soon we
have any standard looking Apple power
brick the magnetic charge cable which is
quite long longer than the lightning
cable that you get with the iPhone for
example and then on the other end you
have the magnetic portion that will
connect to the back of your Apple watch
a lot of the docs that are coming out
still utilize this cable you just run it
through the dock instead of having to
get a completely different set up
alright watch itself mmm that's a nice
box so I've got like a suede on the
inside here here's the watch itself oh
wow there's an essence of quality here
in the experience so far most definitely
so leather band with the classic clasp
classic clasp
Wow looks looks really nice in this
stainless steel again with the ceramic
back this is the 42 millimeter size
let's go ahead and try it on and and see
compared to this g-shock oh it's not too
bad I probably could handle a larger one
to be completely honest with you so you
just put it on like a standard watch
this like I said is the classic wrist
band so that's what it looks like
mounted up on my wrist it looks like it
has a bit of a charge so let's see if it
boots up here okay so we're doing the
setup process right now as you can see
you first start by selecting your
language and you can get a sense right
now for how this digital crown works for
scrolling through lists okay so now it
wants to pair up immediately hold the
Apple watch up to the camera okay cool
okay very cool pairing process it's
asking me for my wrist preference so
left is where I will wear it select left
use Siri or don't use Siri alright
serial give no chance I'll give you a
chance Siri add a password do I need a
password on my watch now I'm gonna say
no for now so it says I'll get an alert
when it's done syncing okay we are on I
got a haptic buzz on my wrist and I am
greeted with this watch face right here
no events today not a big calendar user
it's got the time which it found from
the phone obviously the weather I guess
yeah the weather up there I can change
the watch face there are plenty of
options in here you've got it was set on
one called utility followed by modular
simple skipped one their motion
astronomy color solar chronograph Mickey
course we're gonna go with Mickey
tapping his foot periscope look at that
I just got a periscope notification
right on my wrist as we are making this
video so this button here brings up my
contacts here I've got the weather I
like this modular watch face gives you a
few options in one spot this button here
brings up all of
different apps you've seen this probably
demonstrated on the official keynote and
whatnot but this is essentially how you
navigate camera wonder what that does
oh I can activate the shutter cool I can
activate the shutter from the watch
that's very cool so since it's a
SmartWatch its objective is to move
notifications from your phone onto your
wrist
that means text messages emails but
let's go ahead and take a closer look
around the hardware instead you can see
on the front here we have what they're
calling the sapphire retina display
again this is different than what you
would get on the sport model if you
haven't seen my sport model scratch
video scratch test video I'll link it
down in the description I know a lot of
you have but this is supposed to be an
upgraded version or a harder surface
which should be less likely to be
scratched you have a stainless steel
enclosure as I mentioned before here you
can get a closer look at the digital
crown very smooth operation and then the
other button on the device on the back
here you have your heart rate sensor in
this location here for health and
fitness people if you can't tell I'm one
of those people this is also where you
charge the device to this is where your
charge cable is going to connect let me
go ahead and test that out there you go
but just it just kind of fits right on
there anyway that's also where you have
your heart rate sensor and there's a
little inscription around the outside
which has your serial number as well the
watchband
identifies itself as natural leather and
the 42 millimeter version as I
understand it this clasp down here is
once again stainless steel 3
oh hi lunch guy you know what I like
what that he does he honks the horn like
a wild man right but then he gets out of
the car and goes in checks
case you didn't hear the me honking my
horn okay for a quick size comparison
here I have the Apple watch on the far
left this is the LG G watch and this is
the LG G watch our LG G this is one of
the biggest smartwatches I've ever had
but as you can see the Apple watch does
trend on the smaller size as far as
overall dimensions are concerned okay so
there you have it the Apple watch 42
millimeter stainless steel it's a pretty
looking thing no doubt about it the
unboxing experience as you can tell very
special very elegant this is by no means
a review video I just got the thing I'm
looking at it for the first time if you
