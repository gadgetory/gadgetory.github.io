cameras now are their phones but there's
some issues with having your phone as
your main camera raised very slim it's
slippery
ergonomically not so friendly so if
you're doing any kind of serious camera
work with your phone it could be a bit
of a headache there's all kinds of
attachments and adapters that have come
out but most of them focus on the lens
today I have a product in front of me
that doesn't do that instead it attempts
to give you more of a DSLR but on the
grip side while maintaining the lens
that you've currently got on your 7 plus
6s plus or 6 plus you don't want to get
another camera because you can't share
instantly and then it's another device
to carry and charge and so on maybe this
thing is the solution five external
buttons for much easier control and
better pictures 10 preset modes ready
for any type of scene with the click of
a finger and a dedicated app powered by
ultrasonic OS so is there a battery
inside of this thing that maybe little
extra juice for your phone four to six
months of battery life holy smokes
a cool little package here with the door
it opens up look at the happy people
over here it's a day out on the town
shopping you could still use lens
adapters along side it has a tripod
mount and it even has a cold shoe mount
so you could put a dedicated LED or
flash in there you're getting all
professional
there's the unit Louie does remind me of
a proper camera kaboom I took
photography class in high school old
school photography class it's a cool
class Tom how old you get on you a
dedicated shutter button that's kind of
nice exposure compensation on the back I
think this wheel in the front might be
zoom cold shoe for those of you that
don't know just refers to the fact that
there's no electrical contact points in
there otherwise it would be a hot shoe
get it cold hot a full-size tripod
mounts on the bottom that's where the
battery is wow that's a okay that's a
half that's one of those fancy half
double-a batteries
next wrap the wrist strap there's two
straps one for the neck one for the
wrist a travel case water resistance I
know you're on that you want to take it
to the beach now the all-inclusive the
umbrella in the drink the pina colada
you ever had a pina colada never okay
all right let's drink beer and whiskey
Jack look at that your world is about to
change man I have an iPhone 7 plus
remember this is for the seven plus 6s
plus or 6 plus any of the plus you gotta
have a plug
oh it's spring-loaded check that out
whoa this spring will grip on to the
phone
kablammo picked our app downloaded KL
out you can kind of already see a
preview of what its gonna look like
now half press on the shutter button to
lock focus and exposure okay press on it
fully to capture your first image Tom
say hi but congratulations your first
picture with pic guards Tom he's in
there somewhere
trust me the meta picture find the zoom
ring and roll it okay the zoom ring is
here exposure wheel roll it to reduce
her ad light oh that's cool so this
smart wheel will change modes for you
action nature video mode front facing
camera rear facing camera so there's
your interface now you can see my hand
underneath there but you'll notice you
have your exposure in the bottom here
you want to be near the center but you
can make those adjustments on the fly
with the exposure compensation
I can select anywhere on screen to grab
focus as opposed to just hitting the
half shutter automatic flash no flash we
can adjust our aspect ratio we can set a
timer we can see a histogram that's kind
of cool a horizon HDR mode and then
filters what are these filters about
let's see here filters ooh
so we have filters for saturation
contrast exposure this is a macro mode
you can get a really close focus with
this manual macro now video I want to
check out let's try video real quick
let's see can I trigger the recording
right from the shutter of course I
should be able to there you go so now
I'm recording on the picked our with the
iPhone 7 plus we've got big Tom of
course we have Jack we we wouldn't know
what to do without him you know what
let's go over let's talk to Tom real
quick we're just gonna see what tom has
to say right now because he's really
been wanting to talk to you guys and so
the main thing here though is the
ergonomics right you can do a lot of
this on the iPhones app on its own but
the ergonomics here are so different I'm
still recording let me just camera here
Galaxy s8 it feels like a camera feels
like you're operating a camera maybe
you're a vlogger type cuz even on the
forward-facing camera if you think about
it I got a real good grip let me try
that out for the drama of the situation
one of the great dramatic unbox therapy
selfies but having those wheels the
Wheels of Steel you're just more
inclined to make those tweaks on the fly
that's the idea here this episode of
unboxing brought to you by IOT lights
which it's a complete different take on
the light switch the thing up and down
on and off it's not cutting it anymore
this one connects via Wi-Fi it has an
app to go with it you can put these
things all over your house and all of a
sudden you can control the action of
those light switches wherever you happen
to be even if you're not home this thing
can react to proximity so if you roll up
to the house and the lights come on to
welcome you can go on or off depending
on the weather outside it's completely
up to you it's really it's incredible
look at this okay you can set up
notifications for certain types of
alerts because these have proximity
sensors on them as well somebody walks
past starts to glow it also helps you to
track your energy consumption away mode
make it look like your home when you're
not so the lights will randomly turn on
and off it's a DIY installation it's
three wires and that's what the light
switch will clip on to three simple
wires very elegant type of design
certainly more modern looking than the
generic switch you probably have
the wall right now so there you go you
want to upgrade your lights which your
smart home this is where you're gonna
start more information on the IOT light
switch
visit the link down in the description
pick one of these up for yourself let me
know how you make out I mean the light
switch it's time for it to be disrupted
it's very low-tech that ain't good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
