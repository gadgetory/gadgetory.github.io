and today we're looking at a real cool
device this is the mobi magic charger
for your Apple Wireless Magic Mouse now
if you're an owner of that particular
device you know that you've got to
replace double-a batteries from time to
time when they run out now your
alternative up until this point up until
this device was to buy rechargeable
doublea's but that's a headache as well
because you then you got to pull them
out charge them somewhere else and put
them back in well this will change your
life it's an induction based charger so
all you've got to do is take your magic
mouse and put it on this little platform
and boom it's charging now it achieves
this by replacing your bottom plate on
your Magic Mouse with one that they've
manufactured which has batteries
pre-installed very cool so here is the
platform that's where you're going to
place your mouse on top of once you've
installed the new base plate and then
you've also got a USB cable it's a micro
USB cable of course it's white to match
everything around your Apple environment
and it's not proprietary which is nice
if you lose it or have to get another
one it's just a standard micro USB to
USB and here is that platform with the
built-in batteries that are rechargeable
and the bottom of it is metallic so it's
going to take a charge straight off the
platform so the first thing to do is to
get your Magic Mouse and remove the
internal batteries remove the double-a
batteries put your base plate in a safe
place in case you have to get it at a
future date because you're not going to
be needing it anymore so get rid of
these old nasty Energizer's those boring
regular doublea's and go ahead and
install this new faceplate here which
has the batteries pre-installed and it
installs and basically the exact same
fashion as the baseplate that you
removed so all you got to do is slide it
in here and after you get it down you'll
hear a click a little click to let you
know that it's been installed correctly
so that's about it on the Magic Mouse
end of things now it's going to behave
just like your regular Magic Mouse it
won't change the functionality at all in
fact you won't even notice a difference
it feels identical so as I mentioned it
comes with a micro USB to USB cable done
in the Apple fashion of course and you
can plug this in either to your laptop
or into a USB wall charger
depending on how you want to charge your
device as I mentioned earlier it is
microUSB and the micro USB end just
plugs right into your mobiie base
station here so after you've got that
all hooked up you want to remove the
little sticker that they've got on the
front here obviously that won't you want
if you won't be able to charge if you
leave that baby on so you want to go
ahead and remove that and as you notice
there's a little LED on the front and
I'll show you guys in a minute how that
LED behaves in order to let you know if
you're charging or not and as I
mentioned before if you choose to plug
it into the wall that will work to wall
computer does not matter
so once you've get it plugged into some
power source the default color and the
light is this orange sort of red that's
what lets you know that the device has
power and as you bring your mouse closer
assuming you've installed the baseplate
booyah you've got the green flashing
light that lets you know that you're
getting an active charge through to the
mouse so that's about it very cool very
straightforward really a device that you
know Apple should include or think about
including with their product because it
really improves the functionality not
having to worry about double-a batteries
and just being able to you know put it
on a little dock it's real nice a real
perk anyway guys if you enjoyed this
