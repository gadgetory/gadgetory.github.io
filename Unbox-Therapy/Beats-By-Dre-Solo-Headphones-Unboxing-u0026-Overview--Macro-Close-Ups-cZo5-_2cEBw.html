new episode unbox therapy
it's the beats by dre solo headphones
today and I got to say just by looking
at the box alone I can tell this is
going to be a very special unboxing
experience I'm happy to have you along
for the ride
first things first we got some wonderful
red cardboard material here
it's a trifold style a box you see we've
got two compartments in the first
compartment here we have some
documentation
on behalf of Beats first it looks like a
product catalog some promotional
material possibly some warranty
information a cleaning cloth that's nice
next we got our first cord now this is
going to be the cord you're going to use
if you're wanting to control the music
in line this is something nice you get a
right-angle gold-plated connector and
here's the remote
it's got volume controls play/pause
controls pick up your phone calls if
you're going to use it with an iPhone or
some other smart phone let's get into
the headphones as you can see it's a
fairly compact package they actually
ship in the travel case that you'll be
using when you take them with you so we
unzip it here and we see that this model
a headphone here actually folds up real
compact
here's another cord this is going to be
the same style of cord it's got the same
right angle connector but it's lacking
the remote function if you don't you
know require it you don't need the mic
and whatnot let's get a closer look at
the headphones they got a nice matte
black finish
beats by dre along the top
they're light they're light in my hands
you know I like this matte finish
actually you know it's less prone to
fingerprints you see you seen
everything's getting glossy now but the
matte is nice you see on the bottom of
the one ear cup there's where the cord
connects it's nice to have a detachable
cord gives you the ability to swap these
two and also if you have any problems
with a cord simply just swap it out
anyway we got some nice macro shots
coming up stay tuned</div></body></html>
