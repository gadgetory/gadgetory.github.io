therapy and we got a real cool device
for you today this is the zo sleep
manager now what this baby does is
tracks your quality of sleep it it
allows you to evaluate how well you did
the previous night that's crazy I mean
most people don't think they have any
kind of problem they're like I slept
what's the big deal here but for those
of us who are up all night insomniac
types too many midnight launches you
guys know the drill it's a little bit
difficult sometimes to fall asleep or to
know why you don't feel well rested the
following day this thing aims to make
sleep competitive it it aims to sort of
identify the things that you do that
provides you with better sleep versus
the things that you do that provides you
with worse sleep so the first thing
you've got to figure out is what is
yours EQ that's their like name for the
kind of figure that represents the
quality of sleep you got it's gonna be a
number figure and every single day
you'll have that kind of readout and the
way that this device comes up with that
figure is by looking at how many times
you rolled around how many times you
sort of partially woke up how much how
many hours you were in a deep sleep and
how many hours you were in REM which is
that that really rejuvenating kind of
sleep so just lying there for eight
hours a night doesn't necessarily mean
that you did the best that your body
could have could have done so anyways
let's talk about what's going on in
front of you let's talk about the
unboxing the first thing they included
was a little chart to figure out how you
compare to other people your age because
as we all know as you get older in life
you don't necessarily sleep the same you
know I'm the same kind of sleep patterns
or the same amount of time next we have
a manual that shows you how to get it
set up and here you can see there are
smartphone applications for analyzing
the data after you've got it so you
whether you're on iPhone or Android you
can you can plug this baby into that now
there's the clock that's the very first
and major item and then below that as
everything else you need to get this
baby up and running and the next item is
kind of the geek item the nerd core item
it was a headband that you got to put on
to use this thing but don't be deterred
you've also got a SD card reader and
this baby is obviously if you don't have
an SD card reader in your computer
that's how you can offload data to get a
look at better charts higher quality
graphs etc so you've got this travel
style adapter you can take this thing
with you of course and on the other end
it's not USB or anything it's a standard
sort of regular power plug now here is
the clock this is the main unit this is
where all the magic happens and as you
guys can see it's got a real big nice
display on it and a number of controls
across the top this ain't your
grandmother's alarm clock so here it is
it's all laid out you get a little bit
of a description on how to use you got
regular alarm stuff on the right hand
side more complicated sleep pattern
stuff on the left hand side the headband
that you're gonna wear has to charge up
top and you've got an included two
gigabytes and disk SD card once again
that's for offloading your data now you
can look at data right on the device or
offloaded if you want a more graphic
sort of appearance via your computer or
smartphone or whatever so here is the
headband and as I mentioned before this
is the nerdy part can you imagine
sleeping with this thing on I mean
that's obviously not ideal but I sort of
envision this thing as something you
don't wear every night but you know
those those nights are times in your
life when you don't feel like you're
sleeping really well you can pop this
baby on and get real-time feedback you
know investigate it no more sleep clinic
I think or hey you if you just want to
get real competitive with it then maybe
you want to rock it every night so who
knows now it's adjustable so you can
wear this if you're you know big small
you name it I don't know about a child
it might not quite quite do that but
nonetheless most people are gonna find
it to fit just fine here's a better look
at the device when it's powered up from
from the front and as I mentioned before
the right side of the device most of
controls their control regular alarm
base stuff you set up different alarms
for different days you've got backlight
controls in the center all pretty
straightforward stuff wake up to two
different tones however you want to set
it up and on the left hand side is more
where the configuration is available for
sleep pattern related stuff or to look
at your percentages see the quality of
sleep you got stuff like that your score
etc here's a better look at some of that
stuff within the menu you can see the
best time how
many times you woke up the percentage of
light sleep versus deep sleep versus REM
sleep so again you can just use the
clock and never offload the data to your
computer if you want but if you want a
more graphical sort of representation
than you can offload it so there's a
magnetic sort of connection point at the
back here for charging the headband it
has to be charged because it's it's
tracking your movements as you sleep and
anyways I mean it's it seems
intimidating I mean it is an unusual
thing but it could be very interesting
to use just to figure out you know those
kind of kind of data that you really
haven't been able to look at before
unless you have some major issues and
they sent you to a sleep clinic or
something who knows anyway guys if you
