the latest episode of deal therapy as
usual I've been scouring the web looking
for the best deals on tech gadgets and
in this case even a little bit of
apparel so without wasting any more of
your time let's get straight into
today's deals off the top we have a
macbook sale at bestbuy every single
MacBook from the macbook air all the way
up to the macbook pro is on sale right
now now the savings will vary depending
on the cost of each MacBook so like the
macbook air has savings somewhere around
70 or 100 bucks all the way up to the
macbook pro which has the largest
savings at around 150 now the reason
that I pointed this out even though
these savings aren't huge they are
important because macbooks don't go on
sale very often they usually maintain
their suggested retail price so if
you've been in the market for a new
macbook just could be an opportunity to
save a few bucks the next deal is on a
logitech wireless gaming headset the
g930 which has 7.1 Dolby surround sound
emulation this headset is 108 bucks
which is 51 dollars off the retail price
it is a wireless pc gaming headset it's
not for your consoles but it has really
great reviews on amazon and of course
because it's wireless that means that
you can you know get away from your pc a
little bit and not be tethered by a
cable this is a really high-end gaming
headset and a significant savings thirty
two percent off the retail price next
another Logitech product I'm a big fan
of logitech products in general I use a
Logitech mouse on a daily basis I'm a
fan of their keyboards anyways the next
item is the logitech wireless gaming
mouse g700 this is a pro level i guess
pro level as far as Logitech's concerned
this is their highest end gaming mouse
it has recently been replaced by a new
model but the g700 is still an awesome
device and it's a lot cheaper than it
originally retailed for right now so it
was around the 99 bucks normally it's on
sale for 68 and not too much has changed
between this version and the
one so you can save a bunch of money by
going for the slightly older version
which is the g700 next we have a deal
from JBL you guys know I'm a fan of
their products as well I featured a
number of different JBL products on the
website they're having a sale on their
website and the way it works is you're
going to get ten dollars off of a
purchase of 150 thirty dollars off of
purchase of 350 and fifty dollars off of
purchase of 550 so you can pick up
something like the JBL flip wireless
bluetooth speaker something like the JBL
micro those little tiny speakers which I
featured in the past for your smartphone
tablets or other mobile devices so
definitely head over there and check it
out and if you do decide to purchase
something remember they're having that
sale next we have a deal on the
hauppauge HD PVR 2 gaming edition now if
you're unfamiliar with how Game Capture
takes place and how people put game
footage on the Internet you need a
device like this in order to do so and a
lot of progression has been made
recently on making these devices better
from the way people used to do it on PVR
SR past so the gaming edition hauppauge
HD PVR 2 gives you the ability to input
either a ps3 xbox 360 and you can use
hdmi cables with pass through and the
reason that's important is because it
means you can play your games with no
leg while recording so if you're you
know trying to record competitive
multiplayer or something like that lag
can be a big issue and this gaming
edition allows you to play with no lag
it's on sale right now for 150 bucks the
MSRP is around 200 though you can
normally find it online for around 160
170 but even still 150 is the lowest i
could find and that deal is available at
amazon right now that link is down below
as well the next deal is a little bit
more unusual for this deal therapy show
but important nonetheless everybody
needs to wear some clothing this is from
adidas and they're having a thirty
percent off sale on their website on a
number of different sneakers gear
apparel sporting equipment etc so all
you need to do is click that link down
there to check out what's on sale I
actually found a couple of sneakers I
like one thing to mention is that not
every single pair of sneakers is
available in every size so you will need
to check that out for yourself but you
could save some dough if you're in the
market for some new
speaking of gear the last link today is
another apparel deal coming from six
dollar shirts com which is as it sounds
a site where you can buy graphic
t-shirts for six bucks if you want to
buy a bunch at once you can actually
pick up 10 shirts for 50 so they're even
less they've got a few of my favorites
on their including there's a beast mode
beast mode equals on t-shirt there's
also a slender man t-shirt if you don't
know what that is check out I don't know
the million videos on YouTube about
Slender Man and another one of my
favorites probably my favorite of the
bunch is one that says classically
trained and shows you an old school
nintendo controller because I'm
classically trained I came up in those
Nintendo years those NES years anyway
guys that wraps up this episode of Geall
therapy as we did in the last episode I
