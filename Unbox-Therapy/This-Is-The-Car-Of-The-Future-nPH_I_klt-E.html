got something big to show you and it's
unusual for the channel to be honest so
follow me here and take notice
look at the symbol on the hood look at
Willie do on the couch this my friends
is the model 3 performance edition from
Tesla it's here in the studio ready to
be unboxed I mean it's not a box blade
it's Tesla right there you see the shape
now I haven't seen this vehicle yet the
only person to see this vehicle was
Willie do because I wanted it to be the
real true first impression it's what I
do so without further delay let's peel
off the cover and check this thing out
well is this gonna blow my mind or what
man oh yeah oh boy whew Wow looks so
futuristic just right away you can just
tell how futuristic it is you know
though in cakes there it's just
futuristic kind of front end what do we
got LEDs up in here uh-huh
the roof is crazy glass extending
essentially the whole way now this is
the performance edition dual motor so we
got the spoiler over here as well carbon
fiber that's nice these ones are the
performance wheels with the brake
calipers that's how you know performance
when you see the red calipers yeah
the exterior touches that are gonna give
away the fact that you had the dual
motor version you got the extra little
boom hit the old pedal not a gas pedal
not a gas pedal it's so simple inside
spaceship vibes outside inside it's got
the self-driving you get a trunk in this
thing or what
two trunks actually - yeah so here's
number one oh that's pretty significant
that's a decent sized bin to go with a
decent sized trunk now well weren't you
telling me that this thing the only one
of this version in the country right now
pretty much yeah pretty much I'm believe
with a little second one driving it
unbelievable we got the white vegan
leather gluten free gluten free so you
can see on the app we have range on the
battery and you can see it also
showcases the fact that the
front trunk is opened up oh that's light
so a little bit more storage up here in
the front as well okay let me get in the
driver's seat you tap here and then all
the music is on right away
whoo that's a comfy seat it starts to
feel to me like I kind of need one of
these I'm starting to think I might be
because you should sorry to think that
maybe we look at the display I mean holy
like of course
Tesla's have been around for a while he
had the Model S but the layout in there
was kind of more like what you were used
to seeing in a sedan now this time
around what is a smart phone on wheels
that's fast what is that like this right
here is probably the closest name he's
got to be the closest thing on the road
right now so what that is the
interaction here is bananas like it's so
responsive is reading the street signs
your vehicle represented here as well as
the obstacles and obstructions that get
in the way of it got this awesome spot
to put your actual smartphone I mean
this thing is thinking its living its
breathing it's smart it feels smart when
you're in the fog lights that turned on
to today they just came on in there now
of course since this is the performance
edition you have this part - oh dude
it's like a roller coaster
the steering wheel I really like it it's
kind of a little bit fatter I also like
that it's not overly busy I mean that's
another thing about this vehicle is it
doesn't seem like there are things that
are unnecessary anywhere because
everything leads back to this display
there's no clunking around it's just
it's just you know it's just you can
dial in the airflow on the chin cool the
beard no issue this is a very easy car
to drive everything is mapped out well
where you want it to be you're not
looking at anything that you won't use
super quick very snappy
no transmission it's just instantaneous
and so far everyone that I've shown the
acceleration to has the exact same
reaction I'm sure you've seen these
reaction videos I'm testing out the
navigation here because I'm taking a
trip to a supercharger this will be my
first supercharger experience this model
that I'm in has around 500 kilometers of
range or just over 300 miles of range we
can do the auto pilot is it autopilot
I'm top it twice oh this is indicated on
a display by the blue lines here on the
lane you also see the blue dot on the
steering over here oh man that is so
weird
apply light force to steering okay wants
to make sure I'm nearby the steering
wheel which is good I'm not doing
anything though it's completely driving
itself right now
so if I you just indicate over there oh
my goodness
it'll detect that it's safe and then
he'll turn and then if I want to go back
go for it Oh even with that guy over
there that's wild come on now
come on now there's a really
sophisticated system oh let's see oh oh
oh I know that's not me that's not me
that's not me wow this guy's really
testing out our autopilot right now in
this Corolla up here he sees the model 3
he's like let's see what it's about
let's see if we can slow this man down a
little bit oh we're super close 16 of 20
years still available just like a
regular parking spot it's nice man it's
more friendly than a gas station look at
it try to back in well I got it back in
I got it back in
open up the charge port okay let's go
check this out
so this supercharger station a lot of
stalls here 20 stalls what do you think
fresh yeah and thankfully not too busy
for us right now yeah take this off boom
line her up that's it we go over to Cal
C's we have a bite to eat or or we have
a coffee or I mean we do whatever it's
no big deal right now we're just getting
juiced up flashing yeah that means it's
charging
mr. Tesla over here huh I'm getting it
alright guys so I gotta be honest here
like I don't own a Model S been driving
gasoline-powered cars for a very long
time this car was so highly and hotly
anticipated people were buying it sight
unseen it's like sign me up for the
pre-order the future not too many knobs
and dials autonomous driving for
everyone what do I think how do I feel
but it is so hard to compare this car to
other luxury brands cuz it's so
different it's about being a part of of
progress to a certain degree it's it's
about having the vision to be a part of
a transition early you're taking part in
something ambitious is everybody ready
for them people like you guys who watch
tech videos you guys are all over it
because you want to be early and that's
good and when you think about it if
you're gonna place your bet why wouldn't
you place it on the innovator I think
the model 3 you know when I heard about
I'm like I don't know can they do it can
they deliver then I grabbed the steering
wheel on this thing and I was like you
know what it's polish it feels like a
finished product it's not gonna be for
everyone to be clear if you're a real
heavy price shopper you're looking for
absolute value and availability and not
going on to a wait list and not
outfitting your garage with the charger
and so on if you're not in for that
whole deal but I don't think that's why
people are buying this car anyways at
least not people like you that are
watching this video those of you that
are interested that are watching this
video you just want to part
paid in the future you want to have that
smartphone on wheels where you reach for
the Google Maps and it reacts the way
that it does it is the most futuristic
car on the road if you are into the
future then it's probably for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
