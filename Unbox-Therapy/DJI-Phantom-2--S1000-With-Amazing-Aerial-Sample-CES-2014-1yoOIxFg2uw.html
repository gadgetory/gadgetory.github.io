brought to you by Squarespace
so a couple of the coolest items I got
to check out at CES 2014 came from a
company called DJI and as you can tell
in the visual right here they create
quadcopter similar to the commercially
available parrot ar.drone
except in this case slightly more
professional capable of carrying your
own camera and giving you very beautiful
in stable shots from the sky it's very
very cool I'll show you samples as the
video moves forward you get a analog
remote to go with it so you don't just
have to use your smartphone that's gonna
give you slightly better range and
better control although there is still
some smartphone integration for
controlling various parameters this is
the bigger brother the spreading wings
s800 which comes of course with a bigger
price tag as well this one is around
3,000 bucks compared with the $500 entry
price for the Phantom 2 I will of course
try to link them down in the description
if I can find them but the purpose of
either of these is to get amazing aerial
shots that used to cost a lot more money
when you would send say a helicopter up
to get them now you can send these
things up instead along with any kind of
consumer camera and since the cameras
are mounted on a gimbal they kind of
float there that helps to stabilize the
end product what you're looking at here
are some samples that were given to me
by the folks at DJI to help illustrate
what these things are capable of as
you'll see aerial video is incredibly
powerful and when you pair it with some
music it gets pretty intense so instead
of me continuing to talk I'm gonna let
you roll out on some beautiful visuals
courtesy of DJI along with some music
check it out
