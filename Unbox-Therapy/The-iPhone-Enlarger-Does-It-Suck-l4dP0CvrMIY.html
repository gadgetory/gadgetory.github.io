here on unbox therapy it's called does
it suck cup in which I take a look it
usually an unusual product usually an
unusual it's true though the way I said
it I take a look at something weird
generally in the tech world in the tech
realm today's no exception except for my
expectations
am i speaking English today what I mean
to say is that at least with this one
this product I'm pretty sure I know how
it's gonna work
kind of confused about whether or not
it's useful but I suppose that's the
entire purpose of this video in this
series and possibly this website this
just showed up here and it was wrapped
in Christmas wrapping paper which is
always a benefit a benefit it's a go-to
method to make sure that you end up on
the show all right so people take know
if you're gonna send things to the
address a little bit of wrapping paper
goes a long way I think it might have
had something to do with the name of
this thing as well it's called Jack up
which on its own deserves a video a
product called Jack up with the most
famous Jack in the world yeah that's
right I said it get old jakhary beans it
really prefers to be referred to as
beans not Jack so let them know in the
comments hi beans what exactly is a jack
up it is a smartphone screen magnifier
raise and enlarge your smartphone screen
whoa it magnifies the screen seven point
eight inches enlarge your smartphone
screen now you're laughing right now
thinking what kind of senior citizen is
this for but I'm thinking like people
watch a lot of video on their phones the
clutter got on the nightstand beside the
bed now you got three times bigger
screen orient your smartphone in
portrait or landscape position and it's
case friendly which is good the moment
of truth
is it any good whoa that is immediately
super strange it looks like those I'm a
hold it up there for you guys whoa am i
magnified right now I am Oh are we just
having fun with magnifiers now Jack
that's a huge magnifier though Hey
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo okay
there's - for some reason - oh okay so
this kind of rests like that
I guess holds the phone in place so you
can line it up now this is kind of weird
but it seems like you have to be at the
same level I'm gonna show it to Jack
you're probably too high up as well can
you pick up that magnification like
where would you have it so you were oh I
guess if you're like you're on the couch
and this is on the coffee on a coffee
table the video is bigger but like if
you are close enough to this thing it's
like a big image it's kind of like
turning your phone into an iPad Mini or
something like that now keep in mind
this is a 7 Plus that I'm using and I'm
noticing that it kind of is getting cut
off on the sides so I'm wondering if in
a sense the 6 or 7 might actually
require less of a lean yeah it kind of
does of course because it's a smaller
device but it'll work with either I
don't know I mean it does what it says
is gonna do let's let's put it that way
I don't think that's official only
that's an official way to do it but that
kind of works too and then at a desktop
height you can see it better this is
like this is like the strangest way to
turn your old iPhone into a new one it's
time to magnify your life it's like the
infomercial small phone screen got you
down have I got the solution for you
for three easy payments of three dollars
and 33 cents I don't know why but
there's something compelling about I
mean I just like that it's simple and it
does what it says it's gonna do an image
looks reasonable granted if you're gonna
go through all this trouble why not just
like chuck it up on your TV screen maybe
you've got to manage reading like giant
documents with small text I don't know
maybe your vision is just garbage to
meet all the magnifications you can get
this is one of the weirder items does it
suck there's no way I can say it sucks
because he does what it says it's going
to
I don't know something tells me if you
see a use for this you probably have
already figured out why but if I come
over to your house and this is what
you're doing it's like a Friday night
you invite me over and it's what you're
doing I'm gonna look at you a little bit
sideways listen somebody's got to be the
Trailblazer no gadget prejudice out here
whatever gets the job done for you that
gets the job done for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
