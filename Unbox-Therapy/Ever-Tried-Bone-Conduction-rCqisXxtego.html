another video and today I've got
something that I wanted to try out for a
long time but haven't had the chance to
this is bone conduction audio from a
company called aftershocks these are the
Blues 2s Lou what is bone conduction
audio essentially these things sit in
front of your ears what no not in them
in front of them and you got some fancy
anatomical action going on inside of
your skull right here that somehow
allows audio to be transferred via your
bones never thought I would want that
the future premium pitch stereo sound
sweat-resistant six hours of battery
life they are Wireless it's what they
look like there
the benefit here is that you don't have
something obstructing your actual ears
these guys a little bit of a first here
look at that Ferrari red right there
they also have a noise cancelling
microphone they're really even work with
glasses let's see here
look at that Jack you see that there so
it's a one-size-fits-all type deal
that's your power switch as well as your
USB port for charging these up volume
controls are there as well I guess all
the bone conduction magic happens on
this section right here interesting
micro USB to charge it up a weird
rubbery thing I'm guessing this is to
give you a stickier fit stickier maybe
tighter
I guess it's somewhat adjustable little
traveling pouch honestly the most
surprising thing about these to me was
the reviews on Amazon people were people
liked them apparently these are the way
to go
so of course this is the moment of truth
this is why you tune in to your favorite
show here on YouTube
oh wow letting me know that they're now
in pairing mode whoo this is exciting
guys blues 2s let's go ahead here hmm
there's something interesting about not
having headphones in your ears but
instead in front of them
look at me I'm moving I'm boxing what
about what else I'm playing basketball
maybe and I can hear the real world whoo
oh there's like a vibration to it whoa
that is an odd sensation it's like
somebody's tickling me not that I don't
like that
Jax stay away from me okay so it's not
obstructing my hearing I can hear what's
around me are we getting a lot of bleed
out of them
no but it's clear I mean it sounds like
they're in it's very odd it sounds like
they're in my ears but they're not you
know I'm also interested in these not
just for music but for listening to
podcasts this is so weird for a podcast
it sounds great but I can still talk to
you it's very bizarre whoo
listen they're not blasting my head away
like a pair of real but there's a
different kind of thump to it because of
the vibration I don't think I'd use them
to like replace my actual headphones but
there's something about him I like would
it be weird to say that it tickles in a
pleasant way I can hear my surroundings
but it's like there's a soundtrack going
on along with it and it's tapped into my
brain it's like the sound is it's
already there it's in my brain well if
you're like some kind of mastermind
surgeon you like to have classical music
on but infinitely
Mozart or something this is way more
fleshed out than I had imagined not a
gimmick very cool and as I said earlier
tickles in a pleasant way
huh</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
