another video and today is going to be
the second installment in this new cool
series where you and I are together in
virtual reality looking at the classic
gadgets that made up my child like this
one today the Nintendo 64 a classic and
something that helped to shape my 1996
picture the 11 year old me jumping into
a box like this or what Nintendo calls
the fun machine yes you were allowed to
have fun on the back of the box can see
some of the games you could have played
on here super mario 64 of course Killer
Instinct cruisin USA how about some that
aren't even on here Goldeneye I know you
know Goldeneye multiplayer local
multiplayer when you won you got to yell
at the guy sitting right beside you how
satisfying that was this was
pre-internet pre online gaming or your
friends had to deal with you gloating in
person let's jump inside the box and
take a closer look at this classic as
you can see preserve beautifully in the
original packaging oh my goodness that
my friends the ends or let's kick it off
with this controller right here
very unusual for the time you had the
analog thumb stick and a trigger button
of course key components in the earliest
first-person shooters as well as flying
games and so on still have the a B
button PC buttons were new and of course
the shoulder buttons also this unusual
section here which could be used for
memory cards or maybe more interestingly
the rumble pack who remembers the rumble
pack it's shaken on the controller there
that was an experience that you hadn't
had before so a big move a big step into
a strange direction on the original
controller now take a closer look at it
here it is represented in perfect 3d
thank you jack for placing that there
and we are gonna move on
the next component in the box the power
break now this power break looks kind of
big but believe it or not they're
consoles to this day that have far
bigger power bricks than this looking at
you Xbox 360 Xbox one and so on even the
original Xbox I think had a bigger brick
than this and this one even slides into
the back so most of it is covered
alright get rid of the controller show
them the power brick right over here
Jack let them take a closer look next up
we've got the system the most important
component in the entire box look at that
beauty with the switches how classic is
that I know that sound is turning you on
like this for me the reset button is
much the same for controller ports on
the front of course that was important
for that local multiplayer games like
Goldeneye completely changed the
environment and what you could do on a
console 64-bit graphics and 3d how about
3d what a perfect way to talk about one
of the original 3d graphics powerhouses
but in a 3d video the one you're
watching right now so get rid of the
power brick and take a closer look gaze
upon the beautiful n64 and take this
trip down memory lane with
eleven-year-old Lou Yeah right there let
it spin now this console of course used
cartridges but the cool thing about that
is when you had a cartridge in the top
you could see which game it was so when
people came over your games kind of
lived there as a point of pride to tell
people and show people what you were
playing of course that was lost on all
the optical drives that existed in
consoles that came after this so there
it is the n64 bringing 3d gaming to the
masses so take a look around actually
move around you'll notice that these
items that made up the legendary n64 are
floating around your head right now I
know it's amazing the 3d console of
champions now being enjoyed by you in
actual 3d thanks for watching guys and
trust me I'm not done with this retro
series keep it locked for the next
so
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
