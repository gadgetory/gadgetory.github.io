the Google pixel bud sort of Google's
answer to the Apple earpods it has its
own charge case but there's still a
cable involved this cable goes around
the back of your neck would have been
nice to see a fully wireless design
comes in two different colors to match
the phone this is the just black version
my understanding is this is gonna work
really well with the pixel device we got
to try it out
there's the little case that's small
that's portable type-c connector over
here pretty straightforward boom there's
two contact points on each of the two
ear buds for the right and the left
adjust the amount of slack kind of cool
so it fits in this area here and then
you close it do you unlock your phone
and turn on Bluetooth Bluetooth is
already on open the case next to your
phone where the buds still inside right
within the OS shows a picture of the ear
buds yes I'd like to connect now it's
explaining the fit to me this way so
I'll meet your Google assistant here
your messages calendar events and other
important info all I do is touch and
hold the right earbud hey Google what
can you do
she said you can say things like play
music or what's the weather what's the
weather nine degrees Celsius partly
cloudy
nailed it did the Raptors win their last
game No the Raptors lost 120 to 119
yesterday versus the Wizards that's nice
the real killer feature here beyond your
notifications and Google assistant is
also Google Translate for obvious
reasons
hi my name is Luis I am your friend okay
let's bring in our special guests okay
everybody round of applause Barry our
helpful Mandarin speaker today you must
have used an app like this before you
but you would just hold it up to the
other person and then pass it back say
something in Mandarin back to me me home
Eugene into my own hello how are you
today it I just heard that in the pixel
bedroom so I could say back to you hi
there I'm doing very well and thank you
very much for helping me out with this
video right here
what the how a child I see means a
journey punctual you took a ship here
it's pretty good I mean there's color
missing words a little bit but I
understand the whole content this is
convenient right here because the other
person doesn't need to have anything I
could just pass my phone here and I
would have the headset and you and I
back and forth what do you think not bad
now what would happen if we both had
pixel buds what would happen if we both
had pixel puns
I didn't translate the pistol pose
you're not happy right now you're not
happy right now okay let's get more
complicated then it's preposterous how
intricate making an unbox therapy video
is for our extravagant audience
no no preposterous magnificent you got
to kind of adjust a little bit slow it
down a little bit if you are a pixel
owner they integrate really nicely
there's nothing better than Google
Translate I mean it's got so many
languages in it I realized I didn't
listen to music onions
I think they probably sound a little bit
better than air pods you can't really
put them on par with like some dedicated
over ear headphones or something they're
not really there but I was recently in
India although most people speak English
there but in the event that they did I
could have been I could have done I
could uh that's right so I gave this a
little bit more thought it's an
expensive pair of earbuds a lot of
promise with the whole translation
aspect it all sounds very good there's
actually a lot of drawbacks to this you
don't have a fully wireless design I
don't particularly find them to be the
most comfortable earbuds either they
don't fit in my ears that great they
don't block the surrounding sound at all
so don't expect some kind of isolation
here also this this big compelling
feature with the translation it's cool
but really you're just using Google
Translate for now it's not quite
real-time the only difference is one
person's audio is being heard privately
I can't help but feel at this point that
this product here is sort of like a 1.0
and there's a lot of room to grow there
it doesn't seem like a legitimate air
pod competitor as it stands right now as
of right now giving the price giving the
1.0 status of this product I can't
recommend it to you I'm gonna say do not
buy the pixel buds wait for the next
version they gotta get better happy
Chinese New Year get out of here no
chance how do we short name just be like
senior pilot
she knew a lot to nice indian well I
can't get Julie Julie Julie again quite
la did I nail it
he said perfect do need ah don't need
seen yin quite la you happy do you want
to say anything to the world
okay mom hey daddy see you gotta say hi
to somebody all right it's not easy all
right
