so this is the new MacBook Pro and this
is probably not the first video you've
watched about it 2018 core I 9 the most
controversial MacBook Pro I can think of
in recent memory the hot garbage is my
pal Dave 2d likes to call it my overall
thoughts on that are that I'm
disappointed this thing gets hot
apparently and there's some there's a
whole thermal throttling conversation
going on John got his hands on it you're
thinking about this all wrong
hear me out because there is a lot to
talk about this piece of hot garbage in
front of me is actually six thousand
seven hundred US dollars and this is the
farthest they will let you take it they
call this a pro machine so why not order
it for you guys this is definitely not
the value point though how much is the
core i7 well so the core i7 just that
upgrade to the core I nine is three
hundred more maybe save that three
hundred just get the i7 based on the
information that's out there right now
it seems that some of the throttling
issues have something to do with the GPU
and CPU working in tandem and heating
this baby up you want it to be thin and
light you want it to be powerful you're
asking a lot could Apple make a fatter
MacBook Pro I would still buy it maybe
the i9 model it bumps up a little bit in
scale regardless of which tests you're
looking at this thing has been hot oh
look at the presentation you feel
special
six grand on the throttle master
throttle or no throttle it is a bit
incredible that there's a core i9 in a
form factor like this at all we reserved
this one is 87 watts USB type-c from a
form factor perspective this is the same
stuff as the old ones I also had my
criticisms of the previous version I
don't like to touch bar that much and
then of course no diversity of ports at
all it's just type C you get one
headphone jack
yeah Thunderbolt 3 on this side times 2
Thunderbolt 3 on this side
the keyboard apparently has changed
there were some issues with the previous
one dust issues keys were getting stuck
so this new one now has a membrane in
there that can supposedly protect from
it and maybe it makes it a little
quieter
smells like almost 7,000 USD there is
something else that's new on the new
model here true tone display your Mac
automatically adapts to ambient lighting
conditions to make colors appear
consistent in different environment
people who are into photo editing video
editing possibly as well any kind of
color correction a more accurate
representation and therefore
interpretation of colors now I do have
my old version so new one old one here
and let's check out this keyboard thing
if I can feel the difference or not oh
yeah yeah the new one it's a little more
muffled there's a little bit less clack
to it
typing feels the same it's a bit quieter
if that matters to you okay so this is
obviously a very pretty machine and I
open this video up by calling it hot
garbage
obviously I'm having a bit of fun absurd
this is a top spec model if this here
wasn't going to constitute an
investigation of sorts there's no way
that I think that level of spec is
justified that is just way too much
money for what this thing is the i9 in
general is not well suited for this
particular form factor as is the case
with many Apple products there is this
compromise but you want something that's
thin and light and stylish but then you
kind of want it to be powerful to how
powerful where will I add and where will
I subtract and when you spec something
like this out to like sixty seven
hundred bucks u.s. you're nowhere near
the value point you're nowhere near the
right amount of compromise because
performance probably trumps everything
for you you could have a multi system
set up where you have a desktop setup
and then a laptop at sixty seven hundred
dollars you could have that in the PC
realm there's really nothing with a form
factor like this with an i-9 chip in it
but ultimately I understand why people
are upset
Dave's video came out to tested this
thing with Adobe Premiere this things
started to cook and so people were like
man if I'm paying that kind of money I
don't want any type of thermal
throttling I never want that to be the
case Apple can't do magic here if it's
gonna be in this form factor software is
gonna utilize this hardware differently
and your results are gonna vary
depending on if you're in an Adobe
product and Adobe software product which
isn't optimized and an Apple software
product like Final Cut which is more
optimized I don't think we're breaking a
ton of news here Apple doesn't really
represent value that's not really what
it's about form factor thinness build
quality is going to be as important if
not more important for example as John
mentioned in his video the founder and
developer of Geekbench had a completely
different use case scenario in which
this thing performed better from a
thermal perspective he was using it to
compile software so it had nothing to do
with video editing at all nonetheless I
don't think this thing is complete
garbage okay but I definitely think it's
pricey and possibly unjustified in this
specification as well I think the value
point might even be in the 13-inch model
what price did that start at well 1,300
no touch bar and then 1,800 with
starting price and I really do believe
that a lot of people are thinking that
they need more horsepower than they
probably do is a lot of users out there
that are buying overkill hardware to
begin with they want to make a form
factor that's suitable for Jack and Kirk
and will and me and then they also want
to make a MacBook that a student wants
it's hard to figure out what that form
factor should look like and maybe what
we really want is a product that doesn't
even exist maybe the real solution is a
another product for that group of people
we might potentially be held back by a
design decision here a slightly fatter
Pro MacBook hmm what are you going to do
with this thing the Mac Pro hasn't been
touched since 2013 2013 there does seem
to be this sense of neglect for the Pro
Group when you think of MacBook do you
think of Pro I've got plans to do more
with this system
keep it locked stay tuned that's a very
expensive laptop that's a very expensive
laptop
