therapy and as soon as I woke up this
morning I found out about the Amazon
Kindle Fire yes kind of a funny name but
you know as soon as I started to read
through the details I realized this is a
device that you really need to be
excited about 199 dollar price point
it's really going to give you a lot of
functionality that you got to normally
pay a lot more for it I think it's going
to do a great job of bringing the tablet
market all the way down to a more
affordable place for everyone so what
features got me excited first and
foremost it has an IPS display a 7 inch
IPS display and you know IPS is going to
give you those real wide viewing angles
that are important on a tablet style
device and the other thing to it being
7-inch is it offers a good alternative
to all of these 10-inch devices that are
on the market for anyone looking for you
know more portability next it's got this
really cool Amazon silk web browsing
experience and what that is is it
basically uploads some of the processing
taking place on your tablet when you're
browsing the web to some super powered
computer in Amazon's
you know computer labs server farms and
what that means for you is an overall
faster browsing experience more of a
desktop like experience even though
you're using obviously an underpowered
tablet device so really excited to see
how this works it's basically cloud
computing to a sense think like that
what was that game service game live or
online where you know the gaming digital
processing of the game is taking place
elsewhere and what you're actually
seeing is a video representation of
what's being processed somewhere else so
really cool I thought that tablets could
have you know benefited through
something like this for a long time and
it's finally coming so something else
you're getting free cloud storage you
know you're getting what they're calling
an extra durable display which as we all
know most of these displays in these
tablets are pretty good and scratch
resistant you get a free month of Amazon
Prime which offers up about 10
in movies and shows and it also offers
up free two-day shipping on all of
Amazon's different products so you can
start to see how the integration of
Amazon Services and Amazon hardware is
going to give you some exclusive
benefits that you can't get from just a
hardware company you know like say
Samsung or even Apple for that matter
Apple doesn't sell you all this stuff
like amazon.com does so anything else
that I want to mention there was
something else well obviously it's got a
dual-core processor that's something
that you know we expect these days
obviously you've got the whole Kindle
repertoire the whole Kindle library
available for it and there were actually
a couple of other Kindle devices
announced today they got a $79 reader as
well as a $99 reader which is
touchscreen so you know Big Ups to
Amazon some really big announcements and
some incredibly aggressive price points
I've got mine pre-order like I said I'm
expecting delivery in November the 16th
like everyone else I got my confirmation
so this is the channel to be at once it
arrives I'm going to give you guys the
best quality unboxing and review that I
can do and I'll also stack it up against
whatever is on the market at that time
because nobody knows right now but
anyway guys i got i got more unboxings
planned for today i know i said that
yesterday but today i definitely mean it
got caught up with a few things
yesterday so definitely stick around the
channel for those and as always i want
to thank you guys for your continued
support and for watching my content
because that's what makes it possible so
until next time thanks again see you
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
