as military-grade inside I know there is
something very special being protected
it is from mass drop they were like Lu
we want to sponsor a video we have a new
keyboard coming out I said take that
keyboard and make it insane and send
over the most expensive keyboard I've
ever seen so apparently the keyboard
that's in this package right here it's
kind of like an upgraded version of a
new keyboard they're selling just for
unbox therapy I'm kind of excited
apparently the keyboard in this package
is customized up to like 1,500 bucks I
haven't seen it yet I just told them to
go wild this could be the keyboard to
end all other keyboards here we are Oh
what are you talking about holy Wow
so apparently these things are made by
you know these craftsmen hand-carved and
stuff and there's even extras up here
would you look at that that's a key cap
ladies and gentlemen whoa it's also
super thin the actual construction here
this is all metal it is the control
mechanical keyboard now they do sell
this less customized at an actual
affordable price point to type-c
connectors on the back so you can line
it up whichever is more convenient you
got a connector on the left as well as
the right that's a fidget spinner on the
Escape key fidget spinner on the escape
key well that's that's a first this is
for someone who really wants to make a
statement with the keyboard they're
gonna put on their desk that's a moon
landing key cap Ironman some precious
looking stone now this is a showcase you
you might not necessarily design yours
like this but this is a showcase of
what's possible also included in the
package are some interchangeable extras
how about that the the ROS spaceman
astronaut bearded
Gai me on rhyno who doesn't want to be a
neon rhino the golden dragon that's like
a moon face moon face assassin right
there we have these elevated feet if you
like to have a bit of an angle to the
keyboard in here ooh magnets yes that is
solid wow that's a keyboard okay also in
the package we have the key cap remover
type-c cable
another key cap remover different style
there definitely the craziest keyboard
I've ever looked at it's just a totally
different level when it comes to these
custom keyboards it's a whole world you
need to learn about a gadget capable of
expression customize it to a point where
you could be certain that no one else
has a keyboard exactly like you okay so
it does say it's featuring customizable
RGB backlighting and under lighting it
can put on a colorful show 87 keys
anodized CNC machined aluminum frame
custom PCB hot swap switch sockets
cherry style stabilizers you can get
cherry MX KY hua or halo switches holy
smokes you can really configure this
thing even if you're at the baseline one
hundred and ninety-nine bucks on the
standard version oh my goodness it
really glows are you seeing that that's
wild so you have the backlight of course
coming up and through that's capable of
its own RGB but then the under light
also maybe we should turn off a couple
lights to get the full effect Wow so
some of these key caps the ones that are
more translucent than others will emit
more of the backlight through that's
pretty wild
this is the craziest keyboard of it look
at the top keys oh my goodness the quick
brown fox oh my goodness
there we go I believe the key switch I
have here is the halo true I mean it's
nice the whole thing feels so solid
that's the crazy part anyway so there
you have a it's obviously the craziest
keyboard I told them to blow my mind
a major conversation starter people walk
over to my desk and see something like
this like we're having we're gonna have
to have a chat I got to thank master up
for sending this out this is this is
totally unique this is a one-of-a-kind
type of product now with this selection
of key caps it's the craziest it's also
the most expensive keyboard I've ever
featured here on the channel
it does start at 199 bucks this drop is
active right now I'll have the link down
in the description it's like an action
movie it's like a sci-fi movie inside of
a keyboard holy smokes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
