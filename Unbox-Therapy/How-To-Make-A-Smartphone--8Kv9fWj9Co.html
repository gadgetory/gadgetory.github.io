well I mean almost straight up on
Instagram right now seven years feel
like an old man right now seven years
I've been talking about gadgets intact
with a focus on smartphones and yet I've
never seen the other side of it until
now I had the opportunity to visit the
production facility for the one plus six
I've never seen how these things are
manufactured and I have all new
appreciation for the process involved I
got to see everything from start to
finish it's not just a fabrication
process it's also a quality process
people are checking to make sure that
the components are as expected and
functioning properly a lot of these
tasks that people are doing are then
being checked again immediately by the
individual standing beside them and this
is necessary to make sure that your
things don't slip through the cracks so
that you don't end up with the device
that's not functioning as soon as you
turn it on now the thing about hardware
is that hardware it's hard ware another
thing that was a huge shock to me or at
least something that I should have known
existed but I didn't was the number of
machines involved in making sure that
everything was going correctly pushing
down various aspects automated things
for various tiny little solder points
the machines themselves I'm sitting
there thinking who makes the machines
that make the machines are always asking
for innovation in smartphones we want to
see a lot of changes but one of the
difficulties with that is quality
getting quality with a particular format
is hard and it takes time to make sure
that everything comes together in a
package that you would want to pay for
and you would feel good about owning
over a long period of time so asking for
drastic changes is kind of unrealistic
in a way when I talk about having a new
respect for these products that's kind
of what I'm saying they have to put
these systems in place they have to
implement these systems train these
people to make sure they're delivering
quality first
because nobody strictly wants an
ambitious product
doesn't work or is DOA they also had
testing for durability I witnessed a
couple different tests that concerned me
the one plus six here is all glass glass
on the back glass on the front I was
nervous watching these things drop from
various Heights we received no damage
but there's other tests that are really
cool too like a test that inserts the
USB cable an enormous number of times
and then another test which puts strain
on that port to make sure that it's not
going to loosen or eventually disconnect
itself and these are the types of tests
that are done thousands if not tens of
thousands of time 28,000 they also had
giant machines to expose this device to
various weather conditions the
equivalent of being left on the dash of
a car so they could elevate the
temperature to what it might be like if
you lived in I don't know Phoenix
Arizona and you left your 1 plus 6 on
your car - what it damages would it
remain operational and - what exact
temperature they did the same thing
actually with moisture even though they
don't state that this device is IP
rating for water resistance it's
actually more water resistant than you
might think and they do test for it the
camera was kind of funny because I
jumped into one of the photos
do various camera tests as well there is
a machine that they first insert the
phone and subsequently the camera into
to make sure that everything is sort of
on axis you can see these weird
geometric patterns that they attempts to
capture the displays get tested and
calibrated they get put into this really
dark box where it can be evaluated and
they can run a color test on it to make
sure that it's displaying images the way
that it's intended there's other far
more technical things to like when it
comes to the communication aspect of the
device where they'll stick the device
into a box which aims to kind of
restrict the transmission and reception
of signals to make sure that it can
still behave as they expect within that
suboptimal environment there are so many
procedures in place skilled people
putting these things together hopefully
through this video you're able to gain a
whole new respect for what goes into
this how many people are involved and
how hard it is to deliver a quality
device to you as a customer on your end
now you might look at your smartphone a
little differently especially after
you've been using it for a while and it
keeps holding up and it keeps doing what
you want it to it's because of people
like this and processes like this that
aim to deliver you quality it's because
of this constant nature of checking the
world and making sure things are being
done properly it's this level of
precision that puts quality in your
pocket I know I have a whole new respect
for it I hope you do too a much
appreciation to oneplus for letting me
behind the scenes to see how this stuff
is made and ultimately letting you do
the same through this video so there it
is a one plus six like this you just
witnessed the birth process of a brand
new smartphone and I hope you enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
