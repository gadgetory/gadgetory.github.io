another video today we're looking at a
toaster I know it's crazy and unexpected
but this is not any toaster what is so
special about your toaster that you
should be in front of the unbox therapy
audience they said to me we've got a
transparent toaster my friend we've got
a toaster where you can see the progress
of your toasting in real time the
thermal glass technology you can see
through it and you can see the level of
toast toast Ignis toast is an important
part of people's days it's in the
morning kick off your day with your
toast and perfect toast god knows what
it might do for your life automatic rise
and fall countdown timer thermo glass
technology perfectly even toast what is
the back set oh my goodness look
intelligent glass panels browning
control defrost and reheat functions
countdown timer removable crumb tray
sound notifications and illuminated
control buttons you can even use it at
night night toast might be better than
day toast let's jump inside this box and
toast some toast this is a big boy this
is the toaster for tech heads everywhere
people who want more who demand more
that's not your Grandpa's toaster right
there it's got like a little tint to it
okay crumb tray it looks like we've got
ourselves a European appliance here you
know what that means time to pull out
the trusty transformer ooh
oh it's already calibrating itself or
something here now you know the real
move here is you never take the end
piece you reach in you grab something
something fresh from the middle
protected by the other bread it's a
technique it's been used for decades
controls are over on this side right
here I don't you can pick those up jack
defrost there's a reheat button you can
put it back in here and like rejuvenate
it that seems strange apparently you can
do it then of course this button
probably the most important is where you
select the amount of toasting I think
I'm gonna go for a medium a four I've
been told that there are other glass
transparent transparent toasters on the
planet I like infrared
transparent what's up guys Lou get
anyone but this one is different because
it's thermo glass the glass is doing the
toasting which gives you that crazy
balance let's I don't know let's boot it
up let's do it
level four or four minutes for something
in order to give accurate feedback on
this
toasting quality I will not be tainting
my taste buds with any kind of extra
spread there will be no butter
there will be no peanut butter there
will be no jam and most importantly
there will be no cinnamon sugar a little
bit of cinnamon sugar on some freshly
toasted bread probably change your life
oh we're done now that's a little
lightly toasted for me super even
obviously but we're going to have to
we're gonna have to take another bath
let's give it a three this time I think
it's gonna be perfect right now no I
think that's flippin perfect what do you
think very hot
mm-hmm
hmm that's a hell of a toaster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
