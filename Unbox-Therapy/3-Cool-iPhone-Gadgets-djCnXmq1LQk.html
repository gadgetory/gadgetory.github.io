accessories I've got three of them in
front of me I think they're pretty cool
I ordered them off Amazon of course
that's what we're gonna do in this
videos find out just how cool they are
the world of iPhone accessories is vast
this one the lay light the light what
this is as I understand it is a case for
your iPhone that also has a
forward-facing light in it and a battery
wow that's kind of weird looking how its
translucent like that to illuminate
yourself possibly for a selfie does it
clip in what are we doing it starts with
a clip then a slide it's a clip and
slide kind of like a slip and slide the
micro USB port there to charge it up and
this looks like the power switch down
here so as usual no juice when I need it
no lights up this bar along the top you
know a lot of people they're out with
their friends or something or you're at
a party it's not gonna be the brightest
environment okay but you still want to
take your selfie so let's do it
I'm going to trigger this guy on and
here we go
that's scary as that is you've got a lot
more detail now so unlike a flash which
would be triggers for a still image this
just stays on right and that's going to
work for video or photos the low-light
or lay light in this box look at the
nice little ladder I've gotten here from
the seller this is actually not iPhone
specific so this one I guess everybody
can be interested in it's called what
picah gin it's a little clamp and it's
for the back I guess the back or the
front of your device there look it's a
pretty powerful LED right there
truthfully I'm not that big of a selfie
dude but what I do do is use my what I
do do when I do it if I do choose to do
it take some video on your phone like
this but as you know once again dark
environment you're not seeing much
regardless of smartphone iPhone or
otherwise that's going to illuminate the
scene once upon a time there was a boy
named Jack nobody liked him there once
was a boy named Jack a happy childhood
he had until one day that evil overlord
mr. Lou himself forced the poor Jack
into eating silica gel for lunch now
Jack has a rumble in his dungeon here's
with nothing turned on level 1 level 2
level 3 ooh spooky I don't know it's a
little upgrade it's a relatively
inexpensive way to get some lighting at
least I don't even know what it's called
I mean it says mr. Pro on it a lightning
to magnetic connector this guy this
little piece here turns your lightning
port into a magnetic connector similar
to a MagSafe on a macbook for example so
this slides right in here once you've
got that in and you're charging if
somebody then walks by right and trips
over the wire it just it just breaks
free if it were plugged in there it
might yank the device off the table
completely somebody comes by maybe it's
a pet maybe it's a cat or a dog or maybe
it's a malicious sibling somebody comes
running by you put it on hit the
vibration goes to blue couple little
accessories couple cool accessories
nothing here is too expensive
accessorize your phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
