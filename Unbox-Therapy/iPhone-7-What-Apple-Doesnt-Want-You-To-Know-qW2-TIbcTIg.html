front of me they look to be exactly the
same right
I mean iPhone sevens matte black finish
for the most part they are or are they
hmm
okay fine they're a little bit different
this one over here is a 256 gigabyte
model this one over here is a 32
gigabyte model now when you walk into
the store and you decide which version
you're gonna purchase you think the 32
gigabyte model is cheaper I just want to
get in at the cheapest price point
because I don't need all that much
storage but the story's a little bit
deeper than that Apple might not be
giving you the whole picture here turns
out that the 32 gigabyte model might be
substantially slower than the larger
capacity models not all storage is
created equal not all of it is the same
speed and what happened here Apple
probably went a little bit chintzy err
on the lower capacity models in terms of
the quality or caliber of storage hence
a speed difference now I'm going to test
this out today to open your eyes so this
one on the left over here capacity to
forty eight point eight gigabytes of
course that's the formatted size that
makes this one the 256 gigabyte model
twenty seven point eight five gigabytes
that makes this the formatted size of
the 32 gigabyte model you can see there
I've got something on here called
performance test from your CPU to your
memory to your storage which is the
thing we're interested in today if I tap
on storage right speed you can see 359
megabytes per second the read speed 851
megabytes per second now over on the
right here let's go ahead and hit the
storage right you can already see how
much slower that was just by watching
the bar move along that's forty two
point four megabytes per second the read
is not such a big deal right the less
expensive SSDs almost always get hit in
the right performance this read speed is
in the same neighborhood as the 256
gigabyte model but the right speed all
these smokes you're talking about almost
10 times faster right speeds on the
larger capacity iPhone 7 let me paint a
picture I've got a laptop over here this
laptop has some movies on it some movies
and iTunes Star Wars being one of them
never mind the synthetic
let's transfer it over like any normal
user would do so let's kick it off the
256 gigabyte I'm going to plug it in I'm
going to begin to transfer and we're
going to time it nothing else is sinking
on this iTunes
besides this movie file for comparison
it's a 4.2 gigabyte 1080p video file
Star Wars a new hope I'm going to use
another device just for the purpose of
having a clock running three two one
okay two minutes 34 seconds around two
and a half minutes for a 4.2 gigabyte
file let's eject this device and replace
it with the 32 gigabyte model select
Star Wars and New Hope 4.2 gigabytes in
three two one now keep an eye on this
one guys
there we go three minutes and 40 seconds
the evidence is there so the bar finish
and I bet if you walked into an Apple
store and you asked the employee what
was the difference between the 32
gigabyte model and the 256 gigabyte or
128 gigabyte model they would tell you
Oh sir ma'am miss it's just the amount
of stuff you can store on there not
exactly true if you're a media head
you're constantly transferring large
files pictures videos there's all types
of scenarios we're having a slower write
speed on your device could affect
performance as you've just seen I don't
think it's worth the performance hit
considering the savings it would be nice
though if Apple was a little bit more
transparent about that performance
difference I don't think you'll find
people saying it in the Apple Store so
that's why I'm doing it for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
