another video and today I'm hoping to
calm you down a little bit I saw this
thing I said I have to try it
it's called Muse the brain sensing
headband excuse me
meditation made easy there's a guy that
needs meditation it's right here and
fired up
amplified doctor ring Jack's neck out
enjoy the benefits of meditation in as
little as three minutes a day so it's
sensing your brain activity to determine
how to feed you audio I don't know
that's what I'm thinking
there's an app to go with it let's crack
this open I'm pumped and it is so
different from anything else that I've
ever featured here
that's an unboxing experience the way
they've done that with the old look at
that
whoo here's my brain sensor whoa micro
USB to charge it up case to travel with
I don't know why I smelt that if you
have longer hair use these hair ties not
gonna be a problem for me download the
app yes
welcome to the commute look that's me
this is cool tink it's like a rubbery
feeling there let's see if it has a
charge on it hello
okay I'm gonna charge this up and
download the app while it's charging
what should i type umm use seeing all
these people meditating it looks amazing
got my cord crunchers the tangle free
earbuds
look out tranquil it already is this you
got waves swipe up or down to change the
environment oh now I got little that's
more my style actually oh oh man
something tells me I'm about to be
relaxed oh we're starting something's
happening here Oh your brain is
different every day she's talking to
calibrate itself Muse will take a
snapshot of your brain in an active
state incredible voice she has an
incredible voice sit in a comfortable
position and close your eyes they're
trying to calibrate my brain right now
and the way it's been described to me is
the weather like I'm hearing some
rain right now and I'm supposed to focus
on certain things as they're presented
to me after I start it and if I begin to
move off the task the weather will get
louder and the storm will increase and
that's to do with my brain activity
moving away from the focus point calm
the environment by calming and settling
your mind
great job tap the arrow to see your data
wow you can see how much more active my
mind was at the beginning and this
little pocket of calmness right in there
towards the end you're venturing between
these points of like stormy weather all
the way to like sunny day and birds
chirping and the only time those birds
are coming out is when you're at maximum
calmness anyway I got 63% comm 387
points I could get into it the key is
you got to remember to do it that's the
thing you still have to be the one to
put put this on and do that session I'm
into it if you're stressed out
not even if you're stressed out I don't
know maybe you're an athlete maybe this
can improve your focus I don't really
know who it's for maybe it's for
everybody give it a try I guess you give
it a try</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
