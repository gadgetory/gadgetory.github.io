are rolling on you I'm at McDonald's
right now I'm about to show you possibly
the most high-tech way in the world to
create your own burger to customize your
burger whether whether you like an old
classic maybe maybe you've been a Big
Mac that hmm mm-hmm
maybe it's maybe you're all about the
quarter pounder oh my goodness no
problem it's a nice looking whatever
that is or maybe you want to get with
that new stuff
the signature stuff maybe you like a
little bit of barbecue sauce there's
nothing wrong with that and the best
part for you tech heads you do it all
yourself on this giant touchscreen over
here to kick it up you can tap anywhere
and then first things first you got to
select eat in or take out for me I'm
gonna eat in today how about with the
classic Big Mac I'll start with the Big
Mac but I'm not I'm not gonna leave it
stock cuz that would be born it's kind
of like you're doing some kind of online
shopping but it's all happening right
here now the best part is this edit
button you could change anything cheaper
for me for example I like to go easy on
the max I'll hit the minus button now
I'm gonna have a little bit less onions
I'll take a few extras pickles cheese
let's get crazy with the cheese maybe
this is the ultimate Big Mac five slice
is achieved Oh an extra pad you could do
that too maybe you want to do something
different from a sauce perspective
Chipotle ebq honey mustard
sweet chili sucker Ryan over here he's
advising me I should stick to the secret
sauce we're gonna make a lot of people
upset so that's what I do in this case
apply the changes now that Big Mac my
very own Big Mac is now in the car this
is the signature crafted section and
there's a few recipes that by default
are recommended to you maybe you're in
her you just want something signature
quicker the Pico guacamole and maple
bacon Bijan and sweet barbecue with
bacon I'm gonna go with sweet barbecue
now you're gonna notice an unusual bun
over here the artisan roll give him a
look at that artisan roll look how
beautiful it I'm gonna select it why not
the patty itself it could be beef could
be chicken could be grilled chicken
crispy chicken it's up to you so I went
with the classic beef but I'm not done
what do we have for bacon one baking nut
cut it you go up two three go do your
hair one patty no we're gonna double it
up between you and the touchscreen you
get to keep it between you and the
touchscreen now the best part here is
when you actually confirm your order
you're gonna get one of these guys right
here you never expect it to get
table-service at McDonald's those days
are done cuz you can now I put my little
62 in here enter go over to my table and
they're gonna track me down
maybe I just created the unbox therapy
Signature Series coming to a McDonald's
near you
I'm actually gonna get this all right oh
yeah okay we're sweet sweet I think you
should keep that so we want to reference
it you know what that's a nice Instagram
post right there right there there's my
work there's my Instagram post right
there we should Scout a spot yeah let's
go with we should Scout a good spot that
my friends is $23 and 2 hamburgers did I
set a record maybe it's possible will I
be able to finish these two Ryan you
might have to help me out on this all
right what do we have to do now nothing
absolutely nothing there's some key tech
inside of there which helps them
navigate the right order to the right
table so they know where I am
better than I do take this home do they
show up at your door Ryan
I guess it's radio frequency I don't
know can I open this up anybody have a
screwdriver Ryan you gotta fill it don't
do this at your local McDonald's by the
way this is how they track you and
they're powered by a watch battery now
new ones gonna find some tech to show
you guys while I was here I cracked open
a new thing because I wanted to see what
was going on in there okay are you aware
of what's happening in you two
technology look at the extra cheese any
extra patty hmm mm-hmm
serving kind of comfort in the Big Mac
look we got some people we got some we
got some fans out here you'll turn the
camera check these guys out you're on it
man hmm
goofy that's giving the Big Mac a run
for his money go for the extra patty -
all right live a little bit official
recommendation step your game up
go signature all right guys before I
take off I had to show you this
there's wireless charging at this
McDonald's and apparently I spoke some
people they say it's gonna be rolling
out at more locations you know my huge
thin wireless charging right but it's
not just stop wireless charging like as
if your phone supports it there's also
these little pups here and they use
magnets to connect to this section here
I don't know if you guys have seen this
before I haven't and this one's for
iPhone this one is micro USB you plug
this guy in at the bottom of your device
and then just slide that over the
wireless charge spy your charging now
they'll never get rid of you over here
I got a VR headset here that's because
it's experience I just had you can
actually have that experience yourself
through VR so there's a link in the
description of this video where you can
click on it go over there if you have a
headset use that otherwise you can look
around using your smartphone and you can
see what my day was kind of like so I
definitely recommend you go check that
out
thanks very much for watching guys and
I'll catch you in the next one notice
you might need some extra napkins
