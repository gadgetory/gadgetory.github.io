it's called the woo Joos trap moocher
Luger I don't even know if I'm
pronouncing that properly now this thing
is kind of like something I featured
here a little while back you feel the
bass and then I got a lot of feedback
from people specifically music producers
that were like man I can replicate what
a mix might sound like on a big sound
system even though I'm only using
headphones and now this company they
have their own take beyond the realm of
sound where it feel it feel it that's
the key part won't born
to feel in the box strap audio cable
micro USB charging cable user manual and
carrying pouch playing video games
watching movies and of course VR as an
early adopter you're making history
straight on your chest it can be around
your waist if you like to Rumble down
there or you can wear it kind of like a
messenger bag intimate contact with the
body it's very important here is the
strap yes quite portable in fact looks
kind of cool as well
power up down plus - probably volume the
headphone output the audio input so this
is how you will attach it I guess you
could wear it underneath the jacket or
something and then no one even knows
you're vibing out micro USB cable and a
mini jack connector a very convenient
little carrying pouch and the whole
thing goes in there Oh baby it does and
that was a fairly strong vibration let
me grab some headphones you see what
this thing can do and then headphones
connected to the headphone output what
am i doing I got to get the strap on now
are we cool wearing like this this to me
is the most reasonable because at least
then you have your controls here and
your headphone output if I wanted to
hide it a little bit more I could have
it on underneath
prepare for liftoff is that it is it
just gonna all of a sudden start oh
absolutely it's going straight in there
whoo
it's like amping up my headphones to
weigh more than the phone would be doing
on its own and I'm assuming that these
controls it lets you control volume but
I think also the power of this thing
this is worth mentioning it does support
bluetooth also I could be on an electric
skateboard just flow in through the
universe sensation up sensation down so
they're calling it sensation I'm calling
it vibration tons of volume to play with
whoo ah man you know I just I'm feeling
it right now
you don't really recognize what you're
missing when it's just the sound when
it's no vibe I mean it's like standing
beside a gigantic bass cabinet and a
bass guitar they hit you in the chest
how much is this well 170 bucks Oh
oh wow oh it's not just like
first-person shooters but any of those
suspenseful horror type games oh man you
know that kind of anxiety where you feel
like you're vibrating that is Wow
yeah very tense huh imagine I had a
giant display here I'm on another planet
right all right so the way that the
Bluetooth works is it syncs up to the
strap and then the strap outputs via the
headphone jack
this gets a rally having to sync
multiple Bluetooth devices and then
maybe even just using a basic set of
earbuds into this port so I could see
people doing this so what we're really
checking here is the performance gonna
be as good as with a dedicated like a
nice headset and the wired connection
when we're going over Bluetooth and we
have a crappy headset can it improve
even these simple Apple earpods let's
find out
it sounds amazing these are not even
good what they're lacking this gives you
it does give the effect it makes you
feel whoo it's good it's good this thing
is good not everybody in the world is
gonna own one it's 170 bucks you've got
to be an enthusiast if you are into
making music producing music gets you to
that kind of euphoric place faster at
the end of the day it is a vibrating
strap and it's not gonna be for everyone
because of that reason it really serves
this very specific function I would be
very surprised if it didn't put a smile
on your face and if it didn't put a
smile on your face I would also question
whether or not you're alive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
