where I will put all of the necessary
details in order for you to participate
pretty sweet deal 12 total Xbox ones so
a great shot at winning big thanks to h
h greg and let's get into the video
what's up guys it's Lou from unbox
therapy and today we're taking a closer
look at some new speakers from simple
audio these actually perform a couple of
different functions by that I mean there
are a few ways to get your audio into
these speakers and I'll be demonstrating
that as the video moves forward so
definitely stick around but of course
let's get started with the unboxing and
see what they've included the first
thing we're going to talk about is this
little extension cable at first I was
unsure of what it was for I now know
that it's if you need to place the
speakers a great distance from one
another you can use the extension cable
you've also got a little miniature
remote and of course the speakers
themselves the construction is very
solid
you've got metallic sort of rails around
the outside there's some nice weight
here and if you have any experience with
audio you can pretty much understand
that you can't have great sound without
having some weight there that's because
you have to have the nice driver
components on the inside as well as a
sturdy cabinet to resonate that audio
you've also got this box here which
includes a power cable as well as a
little power brick and then a couple of
different interface methods for audio
including a USB cable a micro USB to USB
and then of course the standard mini
Jack connector for just basic audio in
here you can see the audio import that I
just talked about as well as a headphone
out and then on the
back of the speaker you will notice the
speaker out a subwoofer out if you want
to add a subwoofer the mini or sorry
microUSB and then the power port here's
a closer look at the tiny little remote
which is very convenient believe it or
not it looks kind of funny at first but
you know I ended up using it and it's
really nice when you're sort of walking
around the house doing some you know
different activities and you just want
to quickly control the volume you know
like you would use any remote I'm not
gonna use any of the cables to connect
to my MacBook Pro here for this demo
instead I'm going to use the Bluetooth
functionality that is the other way to
connect to this device and all of the
controls occur on the top with this nice
sort of capacitive touch element here so
you can control the volume it is very
responsive you can also control the
interface so whether you're using
Bluetooth or using the mini Jack
connector you can select it there so
anyways here's a little demo make sure
to stick around because this song
actually picks up and I'll give it a
little bit more volume
so just like on any other audio product
that I have to make a video on it's
tough to accurately portray if the
in-person sound to you through a video
because I don't know what kind of
headphones you're wearing and of course
it was recorded using the in-camera
microphone so it's just really tough but
you could take my word for it that these
things sound great they have a lot of
power in a small form-factor and they
look really good especially beside a
macbook pro or some other aluminum
component they fit right in and they're
versatile because you can just take your
smartphone and connect via bluetooth and
stream to them while leaving it
connected on your desk so you could have
multiple audio devices connected at the
same time and with no need for any kind
of external components or receivers so
that's definitely a plus anyway guys
