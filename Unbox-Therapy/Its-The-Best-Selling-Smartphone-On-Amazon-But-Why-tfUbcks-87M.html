would you look like what they're going
for something way different here this my
friends the xl4 from blue smartphones
you probably won't believe it but this
is the best-selling unlocked smartphone
on Amazon I looked this up and I was
like I need to investigate why is it
this one what's so special about it
of course it has a very attractive price
it's around one hundred and fifty
dollars so I ordered it up it just
showed up I've got the spec list on the
back here on this crazy box 6.2 inch HD
plus nineteen by nine display a bizarre
resolution 720 by 1500 for a 271 PPI not
the highest resolution display that's
for sure of course you got to give up
something to get down to this price
point you see as a mediatek helio p22
processor in there 32 gigs of internal
memory three gigs of ram 13 plus 2
megapixel main camera 13 megapixel
selfie camera microSD expansion of
course 4G LTE built in and a four
thousand milliamp hour battery also a
fingerprint scanner now that doesn't
sound that special we're talking about
that upcoming redmi note 7 we were
talking about the Samsung Galaxy M stuff
so this segment is heating up but for
now at least in the United States in
North America this is one of your few
options for an unlocked device with
relatively modern specs at this
particular price point hundred fifty
bucks so let's open this up let's see
what we're working with Android 8.1 Oreo
as well if you're interested
so we are met with the device you can
see it has a notch design that's right
you want to get in on the knotch party
you're in there for 150 bucks the
fingerprint scanner is on the back there
I love this spot I became so accustomed
to it this location for the fingerprint
scanners is natural it's right there
it's convenient it does the job you can
see the camera unit up in this region
here dual camera setup I'm wondering if
this is the speaker of course we'll find
out otherwise a pretty familiar setup
you have a power switch volume rocker
above that there is a headphone jack I
think this is an imperative feature at
the lower price points like 150 bucks
you gotta have one of these SIM card
tray and then that's about it
unfortunately you're looking at micro
USB no USB type-c love here 150 bucks
how much complaining do you want to do
about that I guess like I said if you're
looking at one of those new red-meat
device maybe you want to do a lot of
complaining but nonetheless that's the
status of this one at the moment also in
the package extras we have the power
brick we have the micro USB cable
they're gonna give you a headset a wired
headset oh my goodness I haven't seen
one of those in a box in a while they're
gonna give you some silica gel for Jack
that's been a minute also a SIM card
tool which gets its own plastic baggie a
sticker
holy smokes this is comprehensive two
cases what that's crazy how is it that's
that when you spend less you get more
you know you know one give me cases on a
thousand dollar smartphone they're like
now you've got enough money
get your own case hundred fifty bucks
they're like take the case it's on the
house this is just your standard clear
look and then they also included
absolute Funkytown as Willy do would say
holy smokes look at that you rockin that
when we do or what oh they give your
screen protector as well holy smokes
look at that a tempered glass screen
protector as well included in the price
here's a phone let's get the plastic
peeled off here all right let's boot
this up and see what blue is all about
bold
bold like us Jack you missed it you're
too late Oh bit of a laggy animation
bolt like us not terrible so far I'm
just that was a little laggy it's not
it's not fast it's not super snappy but
the look of it
the display is a bit vibrant if you if
you get real close you can tell I guess
you can see some pixels yeah you can but
I mean look at the package it's a
relatively stock looking experience it's
installing a bunch of updates right now
but or you know okay so it's on 8.1 a
couple of unusual things I mean they put
opera on there out of the box and next
radio but how does that compare to bloat
on other devices it's not terrible wait
a minute they put prime video what else
did they put on here by default blue
help data clone I mean obviously you
probably won't use most of this stuff
but you're gonna get a couple of things
like it's not gonna be a completely
stock experience obviously okay we get
that so this is what its gonna look like
with the notch off now since it's an LCD
you can kinda see where the gray tone is
there
unfortunately it pushes down your time
and various other icons instead of
leaving them up in that extra real
estate so this is not my favorite
implementation but it's 150 bucks
remember remember the price point like
there you go one plus 60 boom alright
there's a notch here it's a small one
but as you can see you can fill the
header with all your various icons that
you would normally want to see your
battery percentage your time and so on
so that's the ideal implementation
anyhow that Haley
there it is you can cover that
accidentally not the best location one
thing I will say there's no low end
though I mean it's not a quality sound
it's pretty tinny not that I had not
that I had high expectations for it but
nonetheless get the little plant it's
not the sharpest image to my eyeballs
compared to what I'm typically testing
here on flagship devices I mean it's not
in the same territory not that I expect
it to be now there is a beauty mode face
Beauty so he's Jack's favorite moment
here smoother whitening slimming eye
enlarger are you ready we're gonna max
them all out okay oh that's oh my god
this is what people are looking for this
is it this is a glimpse into the future
what is that who is that is that a human
barely do we have some beard hairs it's
not terrible you know what
but it might be better by comparison to
other front-facing images then then the
rear camera was on the plant there look
guys it's gonna be a little bit of a
little bit of everything that you need
at a hundred and fifty unlock then it's
a thing that's readily available and
we'll work on your North American
Network you're just gonna slap your sim
in there and you're gonna live your life
and you're gonna have a headphone jack
you're gonna be okay you're gonna be
alright
the hard thing here is to compare this
to the type of stuff we're seeing coming
out in those emerging markets and price
points like this that are probably gonna
be a step better or a few steps better
in the meantime a decent package there's
something that'll get the job done for
you looking at this thing if I had to
decide what what the biggest drawback
was it's probably that processor you
know it's a bit laggy here and there and
possibly the camera the display I feel
like I could get used to the notch I
could live where
it's got a four thousand milliamp hour
battery that's another plus right there
there are other players in this space
though not just internationally but also
domestically I know Motorola they play
in this kind of price point as well but
nonetheless this is the champ this is
the one that that one out this is the
current best selling result on
amazon.com so you let me know what you
think if you had one hundred and fifty
bucks to spend on a smartphone
what would your choice be this or
something else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
