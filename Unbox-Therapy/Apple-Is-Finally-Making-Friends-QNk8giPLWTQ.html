will ya
so apparently Apple is deciding to
collaborate Cola they're gonna make some
friends things are happening that is
good news I think it's imperative I
think it's important especially right
now so here's a story LG's new TVs will
support Apple's AirPlay - and homekit
also Samsung had their very own
announcement in which they said that
their TVs will not only have airplay -
but also iTunes built-in that will allow
them to deliver the inventory of movies
TV shows and so on that for now have
only existed mostly almost exclusively
in Apple devices Apple doesn't do this
kind of thing you know called making
friends no little sign deals they don't
show up on Samsung TVs well now they do
and the reason it's particularly
important at this moment is because
Apple needs to lean into their services
business phone sales we all heard about
it you read about it Wall Street can't
shut up about it
the sales of iPhones Apple's bread and
butter is slumping in China prompting
Apple to slash its revenue forecasts for
the first time in more than 15 years
iPhone sales are not what they used to
be people's phones are good they're
chilling they're hanging out hardware
isn't gonna be what it was until there's
some some gigantic shift in how we
compute it's not happening immediately
smart phones are what they are so Apple
needs to become more like Amazon Google
and start really leaning into its
services business this is a step in the
right direction here shake hands with
Samsung get on more screens get your
ecosystem out there and and allow people
to start building their inventory of
content that belongs to your services
also some recent news broke about Apple
investing a lot more money in content
yeah billions billions
they want to start a streaming service
at the same time this happens Apple
starts to target let's say Netflix
streaming possibly even YouTube they
want your time they want your eyeballs
well who else wants that Amazon wants
that Google wants that Disney wants that
as well
Disney might even want this yeah a lot
of players in this space for your
attention will my eyeballs are hot
property glued yeah booth the streaming
service everybody wants those eyeballs
well now this is uncharacteristic for
Apple we all know Apple likes to keep
things tight the walled garden their own
space their own environment they can
control all the various aspects the
experience that you have on their
hardware the only other way I'm aware of
to interact with purchases through Apple
for content on a piece of hardware that
doesn't belong to Apple would be on
iTunes on Windows and I don't know how
many people use that this on the other
hand seems like a better move because
when you boot up one of these new Smart
TVs you have so many options for
services that are sitting right there
are you really going to go out and buy a
separate box an Apple TV box when you've
already got Netflix coming coming on the
TV to begin with not to mention the
Apple TV is like 150 bucks yeah that is
expensive especially compared to the
competitors in that space the Roku's and
the Amazon boxes yep and the airplay
thing is just super convenient if you
are an Apple user already if you have an
Apple device in fact right now you are
using airplay to broadcast to this
display from your laptop and it's super
seamless and to have that baked into the
TV without the need for a separate box
means I think a lot more people will use
it and I like that because the TV still
remains a relatively social screen yeah
you could be showing me you know photos
of OTUs which I do from time to time
right up here yeah in a social kind of
setting you could be showing me pictures
of your vacation you could be showing me
a sandwich yeah exactly
I would now there is a question as to
why Apple didn't just go out of their
way
to make their own TV I mean they're
buying screens from Samsung for their
phones why not just have a screen by a
large scale screen for the home put an
Apple logo on it have it boot straight
into an Apple TV like interface maybe
they'll do that one day
but I feel like this is actually more
important right now it signals a change
a shift in the company's personality and
I like that especially in an environment
where Apple isn't necessarily increasing
their market share so in other words new
customers are coming on to the internet
especially in emerging markets and they
are looking for ways to potentially
interact with all the things that Apple
can do previously the only way into
Apple's world was via hardware which is
primarily fairly expensive yep by them
opening this up you start to wonder
about the other ways in which they may
shift their culture could we potentially
see iMessage on Android yeah that could
be a big one I mean I'm not saying
that's gonna happen but this opens those
doors those kinds of conversations
building an infrastructure that if Apple
isn't so strict about things like this
maybe they start to play nice in the
playground make more friends and just be
a little easier to get along with if
that happens I think it's a win for tech
fans I think it already is with this
announcement right here and it means
that people are gonna have more access
to more content by these guys shaking
hands every so often yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
