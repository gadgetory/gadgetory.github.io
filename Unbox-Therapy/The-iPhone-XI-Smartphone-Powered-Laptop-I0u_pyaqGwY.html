pushing it pushing though it's still the
same degree of precision like it's doing
a waviness on purpose mm-hmm
could the next iPhone by the way are
they gimme yeah the name first of all
what is that 11 I kind of think they
have to do this whole Roman numeral
thing cuz they switched from numbers but
I don't think anyone can hold them to
that it's losing its luster yeah could
the iPhone 11 power a laptop okay right
off the bat yes right it could it could
but should the iPhone 11 power laptop so
there's this this patent application
here which looks a lot like something
that was it razor showed off at CES a
few years back I'm gonna forget the name
it was either Linda or Linda like kadjic
Linda in which a phone slotted into the
area where you would normally have a
trackpad it was a cool idea it was a
razor phone so obviously a lot of hype
around the performance of the phone
razor wanting to show off something
having to do with that performance you
get the touchscreen as a trackpad which
is kind of cool what I was thinking is
it's getting harder and harder to
convince people to spend like a thousand
bucks on a phone if you could make the
proposition that the phone can also be
their laptop are you looking at the iPad
application yeah yeah that's the thing
is they've already tried selling people
like me on an iPad replacing their
laptop and iOS is not quite there yet
kind of been that like last hurdle
they've had to get over so trying to
slot an iPhone into that application
might be an even harder so I understand
what you're saying about spending a
thousand dollars year after year not as
convincing mm-hmm what if you
slaughtered it into the spot and then
rather than have iOS you had OS 10 what
Samsung did with the Dex setup yes is
that the interface is completely
different from Endor own whole different
UI yeah it kind of looks like Chrome or
something you plug the iPhone or the
iPad in to the specialized Apple doc and
you get this OS 10 light or some version
that the eight twelve or eight thirteen
can power that could be actually
interesting yeah I mean anything is we
keep talking about just how powerful
these new Apple products are and mobile
products the phone
the iPad and so on it's almost like in
their current environment they're not
really using the hardware that's sitting
there like for a lot of people a lot of
people are buying these things and
they're not really maxing out the
capacity and it's obvious that Apple has
a real advantage in that department when
it comes to mobile processors it's
almost like they're under utilizing that
advantage and this could be a way to
kind of showcase just how powerful those
mobile processors are if they did it
well it would be a great showcase of it
because we've said that for a while like
not only is the a12 so grainy a 12x is
so great but you have so much more
headroom performance wise that the phone
last super long time you get a new OS
update it works fine showing some
application to a normal person that
could actually take more of a use of
that processing power instead of just
Instagram and Twitter Gmail like most
people never actually use that extra
power you put that in the hands of a
student and then taking notes on it
there suddenly I don't know multitasking
- apps open at the same time right kind
of thing let's say Apple does go ahead
and create a product like this I mean
really it's just an accessory it's just
a shell it's a screen in a keyboard but
you know Apple Apple's gonna do the
premium way which is it's gonna be a I
mean ideally a great screen I'm not a
fan of Apple's keyboard cases by the way
talk about the iPad keyboard case yeah
yeah I couldn't get used to it it's not
that great in fact I had trouble
recently with the the chiclet style keys
on the new MacBook Air as well we're
using a think pad the x1 carbon and that
keyboard I love that keyboard right in
awkward
I'm clacking away and he's not like a
mechanical keyboard but just getting
some travel back yeah what Apple do that
or what Apple be stubborn and put that
chick oh no not a trackpad yeah touch
bar maybe something like that
I don't know I'm curious I think some
people would do cool things with that
yeah typically do with Apple stuff yeah
as long as Apple can justify it as being
a legitimate replacement for a laptop
then fully expect them to charge laptop
prices for it I'm just getting ideas
about it now if like if they build
wireless charging into it generally
laptops have much bigger batteries that
you don't worry less charge but if the
phone's powering the whole thing kind of
have just like space for battery and
then laptop and you just wirelessly
charge the whole battery do you think
Apple will do something like this yes or
no is this just a rumor is this
just garbage is this just fluff I don't
think it's iPhone 11 I think they're
considering it for a future iPhone maybe
but even razors project Linda was kind
of an indicator that it's cool but most
people aren't actually gonna use this so
I'm gonna vote no for iPhone 11 no for
iPhone 11 I think I agree with you I
don't think we're gonna see it in the
next version but it is cool and as a
gadget head and a tech fan isn't it kind
of thing is it starts to get interesting
you start to reconfigure your mindset
about like what computing devices should
be and I had a bit of that dilemma with
the latest iPad where I gave up a laptop
completely and I was just using it I'm
like wow it's interesting like some
things it does really well
other things I feel like I'm missing a
laptop so some sort of a hybrid and of
course the success of Microsoft Surface
products which at first were weird and
now they're everywhere so I mean coming
out here to Toronto I brought my iPad
and my MacBook Pro and I haven't opened
my macbook pro yet but I've used my iPad
so I'm like a hybrid where I don't
necessarily have to buy both things is
always appealing could be cool think
about it Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
