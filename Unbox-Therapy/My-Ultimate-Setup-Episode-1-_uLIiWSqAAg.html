follow me on instagram you've probably
seen this setup or at least part of it
I've been working on it for a while
this has most of the things that I hope
to use and it's actually kind of cool
story how it came together I never
intended on putting together something
so crazy but a few brands reached out to
me and said hey Lu you want to
experiment with some of our stuff and I
said sure and then this happened the
first thing I want to talk about and the
purpose of this video is to focus on
these LG displays that make up sort of
the core of the setup now there's a lot
to cover here so I'm probably gonna
split this up into a couple different
videos but this one is about these
monitors so these displays are not quite
4k and that comes as a consequence of
the aspect ratio which is of course
unusual super wide angle and curved if
you come in a little bit closer you'll
see on the top edge they actually curve
in a little bit and this is to give a
greater sense of immersion whether
you're using one of the displays or
using all three like I'm doing right
here so the back of the display is
covered by this panel which helps it
look a little bit nicer done in this
champagne color which I think isn't it
is a nice look now this panel pops off
you see to expose all of your i/o do you
have your DC in for power as well as a
power switch a headphone output because
you have HDMI IN options here there's
actually two HDMI so DisplayPort in the
Thunderbolt ports two of them so you can
daisy chain these monitors together USB
up port and then two USB outs
essentially this thing can behave
as a USB hub for example my tiny little
mouse receiver and you're benefitting
again from those Thunderbolt ports
because they're not only carrying the
video signal they're also carrying the
data signal for USB and when you're
sitting in the cockpit in the center and
you see display sort of in your
peripheral vision it really gives you
that immersion that I'm talking about
and that's that's the objective here or
as I've done in this case match it up
with another monitor this giant 50-inch
4k display that I'll be talking about
more in the next video another thing
you're probably wondering is how the
hell could you possibly power those
displays or push pixels to all of them
now what's amazing here is that I'm
actually using these with a Mac Pro it's
powering all of these pixels not just
the LG displays but the big 50 inch 4k
as well you can see the brain the
workhorse so that's a 12 core Mac Pro
that is running the d700 graphics card
so it is the top of the range for the
Mac Pro lineup I do want to give a quick
shout-out to my pal Justin malar who set
up this background here which is amazing
as you can see it's custom for this
resolution for these three displays as
well as the display up top and if you've
seen this guy's artwork you know he does
amazing stuff check him out I'll link
them down in the description anyhow what
is it like to use this many monitors in
this particular case it is a ton of work
space that's the bottom line
this is the most work space that I've
ever had and it means that I can set up
a ton of tools and leave them open this
is one of the few ways that you can see
a lot of films in their native aspect
ratio without black bars think about
that this is also like I said before
from a gaming perspective some of the
best immersion that you can get there's
a number of things I do on a daily basis
and so I do various setups depending on
what that day calls for I could have
social media over here I could have
twitter over on this display for example
I can
my web browser with way too many tabs
open let's say for Facebook or something
and put that up on this display here so
I can track my posts to Facebook over
here I put box my Media Player of choice
I put Sparrow my email client with way
too many Gmail addresses Skype goes over
here so you could tell this is the
command center and I'm absolutely loving
it but this has just been like opening
the gates to heaven I don't think you
guys understand how many hours I
actually sit right here a ton of hours
and so this becomes like a second home
and you want it to be something that
inspires you so that wraps up this first
portion of my explanation of what
exactly is going on in my setup I I
probably rambled for way too long
definitely rambled for way too long in
the next episode it'll be all about this
vizio 4k television and how I fit that
into the workflow because I don't just
use it as an extra computer monitor
that's the way it's set up right now so
I'll go into more detail about that the
speakers and some of the other
peripherals all right now I have
definitely rambled for too long like I
said before that's it thank you
everybody for giving me all the crazy
feedback on Instagram Facebook Twitter
regarding this setup hope I didn't take
up too much of your time leave a thumbs
up if you enjoyed this content and like
I said I'll catch you on the next
