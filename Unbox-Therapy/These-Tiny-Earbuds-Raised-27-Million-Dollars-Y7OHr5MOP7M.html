Apple earpods all the rage this little
dental floss looking thing this
particular product isn't perfect for
everyone look at that little guy there
it's not the greatest headphone now for
some people just fits really well other
people it's falling out of their ears
it's it's a different kind of look but
they work seamlessly with your iPhone
and for that matter your Android phone
and the case charges the earbuds
themselves but that didn't stop this
company crazy baby from taking a crack
at the fully wireless earbud and maybe
dethroning the air pod so they have
something here called air it does come
in two colors but I can tell immediately
that you have a larger earbud and it
sits deeper in the ear it's an in-ear
style not just sort of on the outside 15
plus hours the latest Bluetooth 4.2
apparently these are the only ones the
only earbuds that have carbon nanotube
membrane they're sweat proof so the
Fitness people are gonna be happy and it
looks to me like they charge up over USB
type-c now these things raised a ton of
money on crowdfunding like I think it
was two point four two point seven
million dollars at least in this case
this company crazy baby they do have
other products and in fact we made a
video previously on this levitating
speaker thing that they made which is
which was actually pretty nice so can
they execute it's certainly a nice sign
oh I got to move this way look at that
ooh that's a nice little capsule I would
still consider it to be quite portable
whoo that's where the earbuds live it
looks like it's illuminated in red so
that might light up red contact points
there for charging the in-ear style
earbud sits deeper inside your ear gonna
be more secure for fitness running
things like this a better seal inside
the ear canal it's very comparable it
almost looks more like a normal
headphone it's just sliding in there you
hardly even notice it why does the
charging tube have to be so huge then
look at that that's nice small medium
large whoa so this is a cover that
appears to go around the entire earbud I
think this is kind of like a hygiene
thing here if you know you're gonna be
sweating it up what was that guy Richard
Simmons sweat into the 80s or 90s
lots of different ear tips they have
included a cable no need to be worried
they're a nice little short one USB
type-c that's a power button these are
power buttons I'm hoping that they go
straight into pairing mode there it is
air by crazy baby we are paired up so
that's it that's all it takes all right
how's that looking Jack we have a nice
fit there that's a slightly nicer look
than the air pod it looks more like a
traditional earbud just without the
wires these things have created a
significant seal for my voice is like
very muffled what I'm hearing let's try
them out
oh they feel very secure I'm gonna walk
away from the phone a little bit just
arrange my time I got oh I don't know 30
feet away every so often to one year but
would cut out it is so strange talking
when you hear when you have the muffled
version so they sound pretty good
every soft I got I just blast I got to
get motivated and they didn't really go
there to the full extent that I'm
looking for we did a video recently on
something called the IQ buds these
things are for real Tom I can't hear
anything he's saying now watch me I'm
gonna go back home yo oh I'm alive again
kind of looked a lot like this you could
mix in the audio of your surroundings
with the audio that you were listening
to through the microphone on the unit
there's really nothing else that I've
tried like those and they do a lot of
what these do and then a bunch more
these might be the most comfortable of
any truly wireless earbuds that I've
used it does not feel like they're gonna
fall out at all and I feel very little
tension like I'm shaking my head like it
doesn't it's in there the air pod is a
one-size-fits-all scenario for a lot of
people these are just gonna fall out of
their ears right for me they're not bad
when you go to an interchangeable system
like this one with all these various
little ear tips in one you get a much
better fit which results in much better
sound
shout out the mobb deep prodigy you'll
pass away recently I mean I grew up
listening that stuff so rest in peace
how much won't put that up there they
sound good man like they do they
actually do sound good man where we
started from with the truly wireless
earbud the nightmares that I've been
through here on this channel things have
gotten a lot better but for me and from
my money
probably one of the coolest truly
wireless experiences that I've had is
those IQ buds that I mentioned go watch
that video it's called these ear buds
give you superpowers we'll look who's in
