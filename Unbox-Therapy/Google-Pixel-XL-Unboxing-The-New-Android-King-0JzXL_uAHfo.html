videos ever here on unbox therapy the
pixel unboxing video the Google pixel
Google's first Google phone with the
name and the brand Google on it stepped
it up a notch I got four of them in
front of me why four I don't know you
could probably guess can I do with all
these extras hmm I've got the pixel XL
and the standard pixel so let's do the
XL first now this device is widely
available
unlike the Nexus devices have passed a
number of different carriers as well as
directly from Google ooh this is the one
I think I'm gonna switch over to from
the iPhone 7 plus which I have been
using enjoying actually from a
form-factor perspective very close
google claims that this device is the
best camera in the business I've been
told that the reason for this glass
portion is to actually help in some of
the signal transmission and that of
course is also where your fingerprint
sensor lives cameras in this location up
top flashes there as well a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack it's going to
be USB type-c going to give you quick
charge 15 minutes of charging can give
you 7 hours of battery life jack and can
you fact check this for me 2 cables
Google you've outdone yourself here type
C to type C and adapter as well as type
C to old-fashioned so option here is
your quick charge brick 5 volt 3 amp we
also have the other color here the
silver think of this as the standard and
this is the plus now there is a third
color as well there's a blue color this
is unusual okay phone by Google made in
Taiwan that's interesting so not made in
China here we go lift and tap and that's
it how can I help okay ok Google ok
Google ok Google that's it it's trained
how simple is that ok whew we're in
let's see how quick it happens
instant swipe up for the app drawer now
that's a very natural movement super
snappy as well the camera is what this
is all about right oh that's fast that's
a nice camera photo I don't think
they're making this up in terms of it
being the best I can adjust color temp
which is nice real quick
video here hello everyone you're now
watching unbox therapy you will get a
sense for the image stabilization
there's a jack hard at work as usual
self be camera demonstration showing all
my various uh beard hairs there what can
you do I can help you with lots of
things you can say things like I'm bored
or rest idath home so I have to see more
options I'm bored boredom doesn't stand
a chance against us
what do you do if you see a spaceman you
park your car man
get burned dude ok Google what is unbox
therapy hum box there who is Jack from
unbox therapy here's a result from
YouTube bitch tell me some sports news

how much coke does coca-cola sell
according to the coca-cola company
during the first year sales of coca-cola
averaged nine drinks a day adding up to
total sales for that year of $50 today
products of the coca-cola company are
consumed at the rate of more than one
point nine billion drinks per day
what unbox
PS there goes the canal of YouTube ah

you can embed Google assistant in to a
chat that you're having with friends you
know I'm saying to add layers to that
conversation man will study yeah then a
don't ask anime fat oh yeah Space
Odyssey 2001 hopefully she's not as mean
as how that's one area I feel like we
could juice it up a little bit
mono speaker type of performance here
maybe in the next version a boost in
audio that'd be my only feedback on that
what can I say I mean this is tough I'm
getting sentimental right now like I
said I've been on the Nexus grind since
the early days and I was that guy
standing around in the parking lot being
like guys check this out this is believe
it or not this is the way Android is
intended to be used and people looking
at you sideways like you're crazy saying
where's your Galaxy at bro where's your
iPhone and it's like nah there's more to
it it's a pure experience it's a way
that it was intended
it's the latest freshest updates it's
the latest freshest software now we've
got this validation in the form of the
pixel product now it's like never mind
that kind of side fringe situation there
here's a flagship model premium
materials to go up against all the big
boys I gotta say I feel kind of like a
like a proud dad or something Google
