unbox therapy today a rather
straightforward unboxing of the new
Apple Magic Trackpad which from what I
understand is very similar to the
trackpads were used to on a newer
MacBooks and MacBook Pros except
significantly larger first thing we
noticed pulling it out of the box is
that it's heavier than it looks like
it's going to be it's really nothing
else in the box here with the Magic
Trackpad except for a very
straightforward manual it's a simple
packaging like you'd expect from Apple
so when considering the purchase of the
Magic Trackpad I basically see two
separate use case scenarios the first
would be to use a trackpad in
conjunction with a mouse alternating
back and forth in order to use each one
for particular functions the reason why
I like this scenario is if you're
fatigued from mousing around it gives
you an alternative input method which
could potentially relieve the muscles
used to Mouse the other use case
scenario was obviously independently on
its own and I picture that being perfect
in environments where desk space is
limited and a traditional mousepad and
mouse might not make sense since it is a
heavy device it doesn't really move
around on the desk too much here's a
size comparison against my samsung
galaxy s and next up against the iPhone
4 so as you can see it's fairly compact
even though it's a big mousing surface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
