here and welcome to the latest episode
of unboxed a repeat this is going to be
used as episode number two number two
not one number two of the ultimate
gaming PC project now if you missed
episode one you should go check it out
I'll drop a link down in the description
but I'll give you a quick recap right
here as well we are raising five
thousand dollars in order to put
together the ultimate gaming PC and at
the end of it after it's all done it's
going to be given back to the community
in the form of a giveaway so very
exciting and unusual project right here
on unbox therapy up until this point
we've raised three thousand two hundred
and thirty five dollars I'm staring at
that amount right now there are 24 days
left on the campaign so lots of time to
get up to our goal and I want to use
this opportunity to go over some of the
perks with you guys
for those of you unaware of how the site
works those of you with questions I've
had a lot of questions about the
campaign and so I'm gonna use this
episode of unboxed era P right here to
go over some of that stuff with you guys
so first things first you have a number
of perks available a number of different
ways that you can contribute to the
project you've got to go to IndieGoGo
comm slash unbox therapy that link is
going to be available to you in the
annotations of this video as well as
down in the description but if you're
watching on a platform where you can't
see the description right now then just
remember it's indiegogo.com slash unbox
therapy so once you get to that page
you're going to be greeted with my
beautiful face or ugly face depending on
your perspective and you'll see our our
funding goal on the right hand side
along with the contributions up until
this point and as you scroll down you'll
see the different perks available to you
now the basic perk the easiest way to
get involved in the project is the perk
that's $5 it's called the price of
admission and that $5 perk is just going
to get you involved it's the simplest
way and the most affordable way to be
involved as you can see 18 people have
currently claimed that perk as you move
along the list you've got a $15 perk
called the silver contributor at this
level here you're going to have your
YouTube channel or name featured in the
credits section of the
ultimate gaming PC build videos whoo
when the official build video comes out
after I've purchased and unboxed all of
these different components then your
name and youtube channel is going to be
featured at the end of it for eternity
the $25 spot there's two $25 spots one
of them is called the gold contributor
now 14 out of 15 potential slots have
been purchased at this point so if you
are interested in this perk you have a
limited amount of time to pick yours up
there are 15 spots total that were
available it'll allow you to have your
channel featured in my other cool
channel section right on my youtube
channel page which as you guys know gets
a significant amount of traffic so on
the right hand side of my youtube
channel page there's going to be a
section called other cool channels and
you have the ability to get yours
featured in there for $25 this also acts
as your contribution into the ultimate
gaming PC project so you get a little
something you give a little something as
I said before 14 out of 15 of these
spots have been claimed so there's only
one left for the gold contributor level
you also get your name in the credits of
the official build video as a gold
contributor the other $25 perk available
this has been a very popular one in it
it's pretty new the newest perk that
I've added it is the first edition need
therapy t-shirt now there are only 50 of
these t-shirts available in the first
edition the first run that I'm gonna do
and after that I don't know what will
happen with the design I might make more
in the future but for now this is all
I'm going to do and out of those 50
shirts 23 have already been claimed and
the campaign has only been open for six
days so a $25 contribution not only gets
you the shirt plus shipping in North
America but it also gets you a
contribution into the project so you can
help out and get a pretty cool shirt if
you guys want to check out the shirt
it's under the gallery tab on the
project and you guys can get a closer
look as you'll see the front of the
shirt says I need therapy the back of
the shirt says unbox there because
that's the type of therapy you need and
I think it's a pretty funny sort of
tongue-in-cheek a little joke there
people are gonna ask you what are you
talking about you're gonna say it's
unbox therapy how can you not know about
the hot show on YouTube right now I'm
just kidding with you guys
then you get up to some higher-level
perks that are also available on the
campaign $100 platinum contributor perk
gets you a one-on-one session with me
for an hour on skype where I can go over
your channel with you your YouTube
channel and give you some tips and
tricks I can also give you a one-on-one
tour of my production area where I can
show you how I shoot the equipment that
I use things like that five out of ten
spots have been claimed at that
particular price point and on top of
that you'll be listed as well in the
official billed video as a platinum
level contributor and then there's some
really big contributions below that
which have some special perks as well
but that gives you a basic idea of how
the site works the site accepts both
credit card and PayPal so there's a lot
of ways to contribute and I'm really
excited to get started to start buying
components you know that I'm going to be
featuring independently on the channel
as components get compiled components
compiled I'm gonna be unboxing those and
keeping you guys up to date you're gonna
get the full details on each component
as it arrives in my house and you're
gonna be able to follow the project as
we get up to the official build video
and giveaway so a lot of excitement a
lot of content to watch you get a lot of
value for your money and if you think
about it your $5 contribution wouldn't
even get you in to see a movie and yet
you're gonna get probably at least 15
videos total I would guess around there
for your contribution into this project
here and as I said before there are
other options available there for you
now some questions that have been asked
regarding the project people have been
asking about t-shirt sizes for those
people interested in and teeth in a
t-shirt contribution or the t-shirt perk
I should say don't worry about sizes for
now what's gonna happen is at the end of
the campaign I'm just gonna send a mass
email out to all the contributors at the
t-shirt level perk and I'll be asking
for sizes at that point make sure your
shipping details are correct because
that's gonna be too much information to
exchange you can put your shipping
details directly into IndieGoGo when
following through with that particular
perk purchase so make sure the address
is correct but for sizing I'm gonna get
that from you later if you're wondering
what kind of sizing is available I've
been talking to some different t-shirt
fulfillment companies and we're gonna be
able to have everything from very very
small to very very
big so don't worry about sizing for now
what other questions have been asked
some people have been saying listen I
don't have a credit card for you
PayPal is an option as I mentioned
before PayPal does give you the ability
to connect a debit card to your account
so if that's your only option you can
definitely do that and then lastly guys
I want to say if for whatever reason you
can't contribute to the project if it's
just not a possibility for you for
whatever reason doesn't matter
then the next best thing you can do is
share this particular project you could
like favorite these videos just like
this one right here this is episode
number two like favorite and share every
video in the ultimate gaming PC project
leading up to funding because that can
at least help get the word out and maybe
help us find other contributors that can
help us get to that goal now the reason
I'm so concerned about the goal is not
because I'm gonna personally benefit
anymore like I said before this this PC
is going right back to you guys but
because I think from an entertainment
perspective the more money we're working
with the more ultimate this PC will will
be and therefore the more people are
going to want to watch the content that
gets made during this particular build
and every independent unboxing as you
guys know some of these graphics cards
are not cheap today by today's standards
so we're probably going to need the full
budget to make something that's going to
be you know completely impressive
so consider that when you're considering
your own contribution to the project so
that's about it for today guys that's
just a quick update this is the ultimate
gaming PC project episode 2 hopefully by
episode 3 we'll be even closer to that
funding goal of 5 grand and as I said
before if you haven't visited the page
yet links are in the description as well
as up in the annotation so you can go
and check it out for yourself and I want
to give a huge shout out and a huge

this point especially somebody who
contributed at the maximum perk level at
$1,500 that's for the executive producer
position within this particular campaign
his name is Gary big shout out to you
Gary for taking a huge stake in this
project and I'm gonna be communicating
with him very often on some different
component decisions etc that's part of
