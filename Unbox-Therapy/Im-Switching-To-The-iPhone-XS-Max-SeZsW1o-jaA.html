been a long time since I exclusively
used any iOS device as my main device I
mean they only come out once per year
really and if you recall last year I
switched over to the iPhone 10 because I
had to because it's important that I'm
aware of this whole ecosystem it's
important that I have exposure to the
things that are happening in this space
and many of you guys you want to know
what my take is on these particular
devices but because they don't refresh
that frequently it means I spend a lot
of the year full disclosure I spend a
lot of the year on Android devices cuz
I'm constantly switching so switching
over to this one is always a little
extra painful there's no quick switch
you know some apps are not available
it's a whole different operating system
unlike switching from Android to another
Android where I put a launcher on and
then it just feels like the last one
with some small discrepancies of course
in the hardware not the case here this
is more ambitious this is more
nerve-racking for me personally because
I got to go back to the old ecosystem
and see what's going on see what's going
on with the new software and of course
just adjusting myself back to iOS
important to note this whole thing for
me started on iOS in regards to
smartphones I mean as a technology fan
you have to appreciate the significance
of those early Apple devices and that's
how this thing's started for me it took
a while for Android to catch up in my
opinion nonetheless you guys need to
know the truth and I intend to bring it
to you so as you see on the table here
right now I've got my sim card lined up
shivering shaking stairs and I have the
iPhone 10's max because I feel like I
might as well use the device that's all
new for me it's like if you're gonna get
one of these iPhones this is probably
the one to get if you're spending this
premium amount of money this $1,100 you
might as well get the extended extras
unless you're completely against the
idea of having a large phone now if
you've been following this thread as
I've been switching between devices then
you probably know I have recently
experienced life with a very in
offensive device the polka phone f1 if
you didn't catch any of those videos I
suggest you go watch them because I was
amazed at the cost of performance ratio
of that particular device starting at
around three hundred dollars this is
going to be a completely different
experience and evaluation because the
starting price here is eleven hundred
dollars so fresh off of that budget
experience I go all the way to the most
expensive device on the planet from a
very inexpensive one at least in North
American terms to a very expensive one I
think it's going to be an interesting
contrast and kind of the perfect way for
me to evaluate this thing against what
else is happening in the marketplace ok
let's go ahead pop out the SIM card tray
here so this is Apple's first
potentially dual SIM device they'll be
doing a combination of a hardware sim
and actual physical sim and an e sim in
certain markets but anyway there you can
see my old fashioned non e sim and it's
going into this iPhone holy smokes this
is a hole this is gonna be a whole
process app store voicemail immediately
oh my goodness guys I'm I don't know I
might even have to put on an Apple watch
who knows but as I told you in the past
I do this for you that's the idea you
nominated me you put me in this position
you want to know the truth and so do I
I'm gonna try I'm really gonna try
there's some things that are promising
about this phone already in the unboxing
video I was impressed with the sound the
display looks good how's the battery
life gonna be what am I gonna miss on
the Android side and most importantly
should anyone be spending $1,100 on a
smart phone in 2018 that's what I intend
to find out and then I'm gonna bring it
to you I'm gonna tell you so stay tuned
for that subscribe I'm on the iPhone
10's max right now it feels weird jack
but I'm doing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
