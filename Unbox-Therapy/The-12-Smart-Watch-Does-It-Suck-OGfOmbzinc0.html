suck video about an inexpensive
SmartWatch 15 not 50 trying to determine
if anybody should be buying these things
but of course that was two years ago I
need to revisit this subject matter and
purchase some inexpensive smartwatches
from Amazon and see if they're any good
this one on the right I believe I paid
1199 for and then this one over here
closer to 20 incredibly inexpensive
let's find out if these cheapo
smartwatches are any good or do they
suck let's start with the cheap one
1199 how do they make this Perla even if
it even if it's terrible
it feels so lit already man it's got
like this bronze color there's a button
on the front it is a camera up on the
top microUSB over here to charge it up
that looks like a microphone beside the
camera and there's a speaker in it too
they put that all in there for 11 bucks
charge the watch pair the Bluetooth
watch to use some apps on the watch
insert a sim my Jack are you seeing that
a sim and/or micro SD card what is this
a phone as well yeah I see an IMEI
number here you're also making phone
calls with this thing does this thing
have any juice in it something this
cheap is gonna have to be charged let's
be honest with ourselves here so that
one's charging up let's check out the
second unit here this one is twice as
much money but the question is is it
twice as good oh this one is kind of
more like the Apple watch I think yeah
it looks a little more like an Apple
watch different style class also a
camera speaker unit over here a digital
crown I'm not so certain that this
operates the same way likely no but the
back of this one comes off also inside
it looks almost identical same kind of
internal setup something tells me this
one's dead too
alright this guy has some juice now this
is the cheapest of the cheap let's boot
it up let's have some fun who knows this
could be the killer do mine yeah yeah
that's sound like Radiohead for a second
it has a strong vibration to it also
look at this touchscreen add some
contacts yes it has a dilute because it
has a SIM card slot so you could this
could be your whole phone right here
messaging phone book call log remote
capture here's the camera was this is a
little calculator in here remember a
calculator watch how does that guy get a
bring on into the test I know who you
were who you are you haven't changed one
bit
started out with those tests and now now
what are you calculating huh camera
there's the camera right there oh my
goodness it points like pop or is it
point no matter what I do look at that
angle insert a memory card no storage at
all the old premium 8 gig there we go
8 gigs of storage here we go the elegant
watch face right there I am I did it
it's the worst quality photo I've ever
taken in this entire in my entire
history little spy cam on there
how was it $11 your quote wow sound
recorder we try that check check one two
hello there welcome to the Dark Side of
the Moon population jack that works you
get an idea you're out and about you get
an idea you know a little brainstorm
session pedometer sleep monitor Facebook
Twitter whatsapp Friesen sourcing so
this thing doesn't have Wi-Fi Bluetooth
what happens if I link up to this is it
just show up as a Bluetooth speaker
should we try that yeah
connect oh my phone call from Jack hello
I said hello
naked noise any noise this thing is so
worth 11 or 12 dollars
I mean he's ridiculously worth it it
means obviously not as good as the
premium stuff I'm not saying that not
trying to compare it to some Android
wear watch I mean it's 11 or 12 bucks as
a gift or for a kid or something okay
let's check out this other one real
quick this one's about 20 bucks
like I said this one is more trying to
look like an Apple watch why did it go
so dim though you can also make phone
calls on here you know it takes microSD
it has the camera to the interface you
interact with this crown oh but you want
to have the like little apple watch kind
of look to it that's what your that's
what you pay for I guess huh so you oh
we look at my little bubbles no forget
this one get this guy right here you're
gonna find this particular product under
a bunch of different brand names on
Amazon I will link the one that I
purchased basically what you're looking
for is this form factor the one that has
this kind of shell that's a steal for
$12 it's not a replacement for an
Android wear device or even an Apple
watch no it's not on that level is it is
11 or 12 but it's a bit of fun I like it
for 11 it doesn't suck how about that
not at that price point doesn't suck how
well that you thought I was gonna say it
sucked spend your 11 skip the Big Mac</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
