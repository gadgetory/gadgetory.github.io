got a very special presentation for you
two copies two different editions of
grand theft auto 5 which just launched
of course we have the collector's
edition as well as the special edition
one of them for the Xbox 360 and the
other for the ps3 wanted to show both
platforms a little bit of love in this
video right here I was at the midnight
launch for the game and of course this
video is going up in the morning so you
might be wondering Lou what the hell
have you been up to have you been
playing this game secretly and not
finishing up this video no that is not
true at all in fact we just wanted to
put together a proper unboxing video
rather than rushing something out we
want to go into detail as we normally do
here on unbox therapy give you those
beautiful visuals and of course those
quick cuts that you are accustomed to
anyways enough about that enough
preamble let's do the actual unboxing
starting off with the collector's
edition for the Xbox 360 inside you've
got a number of different items some
physical others DLC you're gonna get a
steelbook with exclusive artwork but
you're gonna get the same steelbook I
believe in the special edition we'll
find out in a moment you've also got a
blueprint map but there is a new era 950
snapback cap let's let's talk about this
steelbook though before I get into all
the details of this unboxing as you guys
can tell it looks pretty much like any
other xbox 360 steelbook except for the
fact that it's got this exclusive
artwork on both of the front and the
back and in the case of the Xbox 360
you're gonna receive two discs instead
of one like the PlayStation 3 of course
this is because blu-ray is not something
that exists on the Xbox 360 and there's
a lot of data to go along with this game
in fact the installation is about 8
gigabytes I believe and it took close to
half an hour so you will be waiting a
little bit when you get this game home
but don't worry it's worth the wait
you've also got this map here of course
of Los Santos but
because we've got the collector's
edition there's also going to be a
blueprint style map as well as you can
see it's very detailed and if you want
to put this up on your wall somewhere
then hey you can you can quickly glance
at it and maybe remind yourself of
specific locations or I don't know maybe
you just want to put it up because you
are a proud fan of the GTA series also
inside the case you have a very basic
user manual most people aren't going to
need to read this but hey it's in there
nonetheless let's go ahead and take a
closer look at the artwork on the
exclusive steelbook case as well as the
artwork on the game discs themselves as
mentioned earlier we like to get you
guys as up-close and personal as
possible with the items that are
featured here on unbox therapy so
following up the steelbook case we've
got a number of other items included
inside the box but first let's talk
about the DLC and I'll give you guys a
closer look at this actual slip but you
can expect to have stunt plane trials
bonus outfits tattoos and more custom
characters special ability boost for
vehicles unique vehicles and garage and
also additional weapons all part of the
DLC coming along with the collector's
edition this here is the blueprint map
that I mentioned earlier and I found out
just before filming this video that
there is some exclusive or secret
content accessible on here only when
putting the map underneath UV light I
don't have any UV light on hand so I
wasn't able to do that but if you guys
have seen the message and know how to
decode it let me know what it is down in
the comments section I think other
people would be interested as well next
we have a key with a logo on it at first
you might wonder what would a key before
this is part of a combination of items
so it goes together with another item
which is of course the security deposit
bag now having seen pictures of this
particular collector's edition I didn't
know what to expect in terms of quality
for the deposit bag but the thing is
very robust I'll give you a closer look
in a moment it actually seems kind of
like an actual deposit bag not that I've
ever handled one before but this is what
I would expect it to be like - the giant
grand theft auto 5 logo on the front
here's a look at the Hat this is the new
era 950 snapback cap you have a couple
of different logos on there of course
Los Santos on the front you got the nice
flat brim and then over on the side you
have the GTA 5 logo to go with it I'll
actually be modeling this hat during the
initial 10 minute gameplay video that's
coming up after this one so if you want
to see how it looks on somebody's head I
probably wear it backwards but anyway
stay tuned for the next video because I
will be showing off the Los Santos hat
in action so next and last I guess we
have the security deposit bag to go with
that key that I showed you earlier and
as I mentioned it's pretty heavy it
feels fairly secure and the way that it
works is by locking in the actual nub
but that's on the zipper so what is
called a nub I don't know you know the
portion that actually slides back and
forth on the zipper teeth and the only
way to gain access to loosen it up is to
use your key to remove or lift up this
clasp right here and that gives you
access to the zipper I had to play with
it for a little while to figure out
exactly how it works but basically you
got to push it all the way back in and
then snap down this lock one more time
and then you are back locked up and
people can't get access guys in the
office we're like what's the point of
this can't you just cut through the bag
I don't really know maybe someone can
explain to me how these bags work
someone who works for a bank or I don't
know a retail store maybe you would use
one of these I guess it's just gonna
slow people down they're not gonna have
as easy access to the money inside it's
a little bit more secure than oh I don't
know a paper bag I'm assuming that's how
these things work before we wrap up this
video I want to give you guys a closer
look at the special edition for the ps3
you are getting a number of inclusions
very similar to that of the collector's
edition but this edition here is
actually quite a bit less expensive
it's only 79 bucks instead of 150 and if
you guys are interested in checking out
the availability on either of these
versions I will have the relevant links
down in the description so you can check
that out now in this case you're not
getting the Hat you're not getting the
security deposit bag and logo key but
you are getting a bunch of DLC and
you're also getting that nice steelbook
case and as you can see you're also
getting the blueprint map so pretty much
everything I believe everything except
for the cap the hat and the deposit bag
so if you don't want either of those two
items then I guess you might be better
off going for the special edition rather
than the collector's edition I guess the
box to the box is really nice on the
collector's edition so that has some
value to a collector as the name implies
regardless of which version you're
personally interested in the collectors
special or even the standard edition you
can't deny that this is a very exciting
title we've been waiting a long time for
a brand new GTA game and it has actually
convinced me to do a little bit more
gaming and share some of that with you
guys so immediately after this video
will be the first ten minutes of
gameplay with myself and will do so
definitely be on the lookout for that
video and then after the fact that we
will likely be doing more gameplay
videos on my second channel if you
haven't subscribed to that channel yet I
will put a link down in the description
it's called the beast feed it's where
we've been uploading our podcast and if
you haven't checked those out you might
be interested in them but I also think
it's just gonna be a really good home
for anything else we do besides unbox
therapy including gaming related stuff
and I know you guys have been requesting
it for a while so I really hope to
deliver on some of this GTA coverage
anyway guys that wraps up this unboxing
and first look at two very cool versions
of a very cool title GTA 5 of course if
you enjoyed this content please remember
