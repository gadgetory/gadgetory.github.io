what we get for our hard-earned cash in
unusual style box let's see here this
looks like the device mm tougher then it
looks to remove keep trying we'll get
back to that let's get to the other
things first a box inside a box okay

HDMI cable now that's pretty nice you
don't get those from every manufacturer
our ever important paperwork and
warranty information and the remote that
everyone's been waiting for with the
unusual keyboard on the back side let's
slip it out of the plastic here there
you can see that keyboard looks pretty
good on the front we have a more
traditional remote layout that'll be
interesting to use

wonder if I can get it out of this
strange secure cage it's in well that
wasn't a problem apparently you just
have to tip it here we see the unusual
shape of the Boxee Box that everybody's
been talking about let's get it out of
this plastic and get it closer to look
so here's the way it's it's sort of
off-center shape of it
this plastic away to reveal a glassy
surface on one side as we spin it around
we see not much there and here is all
the action we've got two USB ports
Ethernet port our audio ports of course
an HDMI port and on the side there we
see the SD card slot Beauty can't wait
to use it</div></body></html>
