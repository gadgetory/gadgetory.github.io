for this video is to to tell you guys
about something I recently bought now
obviously this is not an unboxing video
I've already unboxed this product I
actually needed to use it really badly
and on top of that it would have been
really clunky to try and pull it out of
the box on camera because it's so huge
but it is of course a multifunction
printer scanner copier blah blah blah
and I know those are normally pretty
boring I don't personally get all that
excited about them but I've gone through
so many of them now
you know they're practically disposable
the quality is normally so crap in terms
of construction that I decided you know
what it's time to get some some decent
quality spend a few bucks on one that I
can have for a little while and I'm
hoping that this can be the one up until
this point I'm pretty happy with it of
course I've only used it for a couple
days now I've done quite a bit of
scanning probably more scanning than
printing and it's been really convenient
mostly because of the wireless
functionality and how easy it was to set
up etc so before talking any longer the
name of the product is the Epson Artisan
837 and it has some pretty cool features
including as I mentioned before wireless
capability you can also print from
mobile devices as you can see down here
like you can print from your smartphone
etc one thing that I do like is its
ability to scan to PDF and also straight
into email wirelessly to any system that
you designate so let's talk a little bit
about it here I'm gonna try and give you
a quick rundown of the specs etc so
first of all you've got this little
drop-down door here now that's actually
motorized so if you have it closed to
keep you know the clean look the clean
appearance and you're away from your
printer and you send a print to it
that's gonna drop down on its own you've
also got of course your inserts for your
different memory cards and a USB port if
you want to print directly that way your
paper tray is here one thing that this
printer claims is to be
the fastest high-quality 4x6 photo
printer on the market it'll do a
high-quality 4x6 photograph in 10
seconds supposedly so that's pretty cool
and as you guys probably know with Epson
you get a bunch of different ink
cartridges now that can be a plus or a
minus it means you've got more to
replace but it also means that you only
replace what you need in this case you
can find these cartridges for a pretty
affordable like 10 to 15 bucks etc
closer to 10 if you're willing to order
off Amazon or something like that but
anyways probably the most interesting
aspect if like don't have too much glare
here is this screen on the front and
it's a resistive touch screen and only a
portion of it is an actual LCD but it's
really intuitive and really easy to use
because when you're within a menu for
example only the options that are
available to you will light up on the
resistive portion of the touch panel
meaning that you're not weeding through
you know information or menus that you
don't necessarily need something that
I've been using quite a bit as I
mentioned before is the scan
functionality allowing you to scan too
straight to a memory card to PC or to
PDF
say for example I select PDF you'll see
two options there there's the USB
connection or you also notice my
computer there says my name but that's
the name of my macbook pro I can select
that and boom straight away I can start
scanning documents whether they be
individual or a bunch of pages together
this will actually do up to 30 pages in
the document feeder and this is probably
my favorite feature I know it's
superficial but a lot of these things
are really ugly these multi functions
and this one I don't think so because
you got this nice sort of curve along
top here and it sort of hides the
document feeder if you look up top here
you're probably wondering where the hell
did a pages go right well you flip up
this little tab here it pushes this
other portion down and boom just like
that innovation you can put 30 pages up
here and you know make some wonderful
PDFs of your different stuff so that was
sort of the killer function for me
that's what I mostly needed I needed to
sign some documents and send them back
over email and this baby allowed me to
do that it's really built like a tank
it's probably like twice as heavy as
previous multi functions I've owned and
I got it for Half Price
there was a deal at Staples I think I
paid 159 which was half of the MSRP if
you can pick this up for the same price
I did I'm gonna go ahead and recommend
it even though this is just a first look
I haven't used it for a long long time
so take that with a grain of salt but up
until this point I am happy you do some
other stuff with it like make coloring
books you know the kids are gonna love
that one but the main thing here guys is
that it's super easy to set up it
integrates with Mac or PC it's all
wireless and everybody in the house can
use it if I had other computers set up
with the driver installed they'd show up
here as well you can send that document
to any computer in the house let's see
if I can give you a quick look around
back you've obviously got a flatbed
scanner as well built in and then your
different ports and whatnot are over
here so you got you know regular
Ethernet if you choose to use it I think
it has a fax built-in
- yeah it does not that anyone uses that
anymore and of course regular USB so
anyway as you guys can tell it's hard to
get excited about a multi-function but I
have managed to get somewhat excited
about my Epson Artisan 837 you know if
anything goes wrong with it I'll let you
guys know how I'll take back my
recommendation but up until this point
it's been fun to use and it feels like
it's a solid multifunction if you need
one you might want to look at it one
more thing to talk about kind of
unrelated but I got this retro radio up
here that I'm real excited about it's
like a world radio and both G's Big Bang
net and I think it's pretty badass check
that baby out you can actually like tune
in stations from all over the world this
was actually my grandfather's and once a
once upon a time this was you know one
of the hottest pieces of tech you could
have on your desk and you guys know I'm
into the retro tech look you can even
like if you lift this baby up here
there's like a little light built-in for
looking at your maps and stuff that's
pretty hardcore right so I've been
trying to tune in stations from all over
the world
I think I tuned some from South America
earlier but anyways you guys know I'm
into the retro tech let me know if you
want to know more about that old-school
piece of equipment right there but
anyway guys that's just been a very
quick overview of the Epson Artisan 8
what once 8:37 if you enjoyed this
content hopefully you can like and
favorite this video hopefully I did not
ramble on for too long but otherwise
stay tuned for the next one I got a
couple more products to unbox so you
might want to stick around I'll see you
guys around a channel okay later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
