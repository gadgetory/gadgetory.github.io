taking a closer look at the newly
released Nokia Lumia 1020 this thing has
a beast of a camera especially for a
phone we're gonna take a closer look and
do some test shots so check this out
first things first I want to give a
thanks to 80 for sending this Nokia
Lumia 1020 out for me to take a closer
look I don't get very many chances to
look at Windows Phone devices so I'm
very excited to get started with the
cream of the crop the 1020 this thing is
beautiful it comes in a number of
different colors I've got the yellow
unit inside here the most exciting part
is this gigantic enormous 41 megapixel
image sensor I expect it to produce some
incredible imagery but don't take my
word for it stick around because towards
the end of this video I will be testing
that theory first the unboxing after all
this is unbox therapy we've got some
paperwork from Nokia as well as some
information regarding taking better
photos and then you have a message from
AT&amp;amp;T reminding you to never text and
drive at the same time not smart not
cool don't do it the phone is beautiful
as I mentioned before I mean I knew this
before I got it I've obviously seen
pictures and whatnot but once you
actually get to hold it it's quite nice
all the materials are very smooth very
soft touch and the industrial design is
very very impressive I also like the
fact that it's available in colors it's
not just another boring black slab like
some other stuff that's on the market
finishing up the unboxing we've got a
little bit more paperwork from Nokia
followed by your power brick although in
this case it's not much of a brick it's
somewhere between a rectangle and a
cylinder
maybe there's a name for that shape I'm
unsure anyways this microUSB cable will
plug into the brick and charge up your
device you've also got a wrist strap and
lastly there is a SIM card tool for of
course inserting your SIM card into the
device taking a closer look at the
physical attributes you can appreciate
this large flash that's on the camera
module
that's going to be amazing for
illuminating people in low-light
environments all of the buttons are on
one side of the device keeping the
design very clean-looking you have your
power switch there as well as a
dedicated camera button and of course
your volume rocker for guess what
adjusting your volume on the top is
where you'll find your headphone jack
right in the center there's also a
microphone up there and that's where
you'll insert your SIM card as well this
is a very beautiful looking phone as I'm
sure you can tell it's available in a
few different colors but I just lucked
out I guess because this is my favorite
and it also happens to be what AT&amp;amp;T sent
over as I mentioned earlier I'm a bit of
a noob when it comes to the Windows
Phone interface but it's actually pretty
easy to pick up I didn't experience any
lag it was really smooth I launched into
the web browser and just picked a random
site to check out unbox therapy com
anyways yeah it works just fine and
Scrolls very smoothly so as a phone it
seems to function and it seems to be
pretty capable but really what this
story is all about is this gigantic
image sensor that this phone has 41
megapixels of power that's tons of
resolution and it means that you're
going to be able to zoom in to pictures
without having them bust up into pixel
madness instead you still maintain a
very usable image that you can then go
ahead and share so you could just take
these huge images and then crop them at
a later date and basically recompose
whatever it is you're trying to do it
gives you creative freedom after the
fact instead of just before there's a
little tutorial to get you started after
all this is a fairly elaborate camera
interface as it should be
when you're working with this kind of
hardware but you just go through this
little tutorial and it'll pretty much
teach you everything you need to know
you can use the device in a simple
automatic mode and it'll figure out what
to do in order to give you good results
or if you're like me and you want to get
a little bit more technical you can go
into the manual settings and adjust all
kinds of different things from is
so two shutter speed more on that in a
moment but I want to get started with
the automatic mode as many individuals
we want to get great images right out of
the box without having to get too
technical right away and that's fine
you'll see here that you can take
pictures with your thumb right on the
screen by tapping the camera icon or you
can use the dedicated shutter button on
the top of the device that's completely
up to you whichever is more comfortable
you can also touch focus by tapping on
any object off in the distance but what
I'm really excited about is this manual
functionality and the first feature I'm
showing off here is exposure
compensation which gives you a really
quick ability to dial in the correct
exposure so if your image is
underexposed just dial it up and if your
image is overexposed dial it down very
simple next you've got shutter speed to
play with I could give you some awesome
motion blur if that's what you're
looking for you have manual focus
controls ISO sensitivity as you can see
here it's sort of like having a lens
that you turn the focus ring on lastly
we have white balance this is very
important for getting accurate images
and it's something we focus on in a big
way here in the studio so to have it on
this device and have it easily
accessible is always a very welcome
addition as mentioned earlier this 41
megapixel sensor gives you the ability
to zoom into your photo to recompose
your image to give you more creative
control after it's already been shot
you've got so many pixels to work with
that you can zoom all the way in and
still have a completely usable shareable
photo outdoors the imagery is intense
it's insane it's really really good as
you can tell here I mean the images
speak for themselves and video follows
right in line you've got optical image
stabilization and as you can see that's
what helped me follow this little bee
around in this particular garden but I'm
more impressed with the purple on the
flowers here it's just so vibrant and
impressive I mean as I said the video
and the images they basically speak for
themselves I don't have to say too much
about it and this pizza it also speaks
for itself
I'd have to say too much about it all in
all had an amazing time going out and
shooting with the No
the Lumia 1020 I want to give one last
shout out to AT&amp;amp;T for sending out the
device so that we could carry out this
test and have some fun with this
brand-new 41 megapixel sensor this
device isn't exclusive as I said earlier
check out the description for more info
so that wraps up this unboxing first
looking test of the Nokia Lumia 1020
this thing is a ton of fun to get out in
the world and shoot with it produces
some amazing images as you can tell from
the samples in this video if you enjoyed
this content please remember to leave a
thumbs up down below and I will catch
you guys on the next episode have a good
one
later
