looks like a serious product like that
instrument thing the other day with the
Japanese writing this one positions
itself kind of is a real product but
immediately you look at it you're like
what exactly is going on there why would
you want an integrated keyboard with a
smartphone I think I message you will we
got to get our hands on this thing maybe
it's gonna blow me away maybe it's just
what I'm looking for I doubt it but it's
possible that's why we make these videos
it's called the evo type from tech 21 it
is a keyboard case for your pixel 3 XL
it's almost like laptop status Wireless
NFC connection
we got a silica gel jack that's been a
minute it's actually kind of a nice
material it's it's a soft what is it an
it kind of thing going on it's chunky
though that is a big that's a commitment
right there pop it open and this is Wow
that's actually that keyboards a bit
bigger than I expected it to be of
course the pixel 3 XL it's a big phone
it's touch based you're just tapping on
top of where the key is so it's not
particularly satisfying let's see how
two phone fits in ok so I have a pixel
three XL now you're committed to that
situation forever the way this piece
flaps off it keeps part of it
you have glued to the case portion a
little less satisfying clicking on these
buttons versus the actual phone's
buttons let's see how does this thing
work specifically that right right like
that you could have an angle there there
all the way to there basically it's like
a tiny little laptop at that point so
let's power it up when you hit the power
button on here it launches you to the
Google Play Store and but then it says
the Evo type case unreleased and then it
says you've got early access to the app
did they send us this or do we buy this
oh they sent us is so this is not
available yet let's keep in mind this
thing doesn't officially come out to the
spring so that probably indicates why
the set up process is a little bit
bizarre right now but anyway at least I
have yeah let me open it up and see what
happens
switch it on okay
oh wow that's actually pretty easy to do
start typing now Evo tidy oh wow
all right good huh quick brown box
whoo that does not look good right now
you really have to hammer these keys
look at the new my line there the quick
brown fox no space jump no you over the
easy dog doc you have to really hammer
it it's not worth it look look up here
it missed the space the space bar in
particular you have to hammer it since
this is an evaluation unit the product
is not out at retail possibly this
improves via software but it's not very
promising right now on box P you know
where I really think this thing actually
has some function is as a stand so
that's almost upright it actually kind
of sticks there reasonably well you can
see even if it gets wobbled around a
little bit and then the various angles
in between there now if you're sitting
at a table this one actually works kind
of well because it's facing mostly
upright it's actually quite an angle
that's on there and of course I guess
with any flip case in general it's gonna
protect the screen when you close it so
you've got this situation I guess it's
very protected what's the elastic band
for well oh just to keep this closed
yeah alright that's your travel package
or any dere ladies and gentlemen I mean
it's a cool enough thing for me to make
a video on it I mean the typing
experience is not better than the actual
phone as it stands out out of the box
for me it's more of a headache than
anything else like it's definitely not
it's definitely not a substitute for
typing on display in fact it's it's less
satisfying then you're asking yourself
why am i adding this accessory in the
first place okay well wants to talk come
and say it then you want to put your
face behind those words what wills
telling me right now is that really
what's compelling here is not
necessarily the keyboard which I mean
how can it not it's kind of the whole
purpose here but it's the way that it
connects and interacts so it's using NFC
the phone is powering the keyboard I
mean there's no there's no charge port
on the keyboard so that is right that is
cool
well as far as accessories are concerned
but unfortunately this particular
implementation is lacking I don't know
what kind of version of this would
change that for me some tactile feedback
or maybe something that's just a bit
more sensitive if they can tweak that I
really don't see it right now this is
not the case for me maybe it goes
somewhere one day but as of right now
you're better off type it on your own
screen and having a way less chunky case
I'm just I'm just keeping it real for
you guys I'm just being honest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
