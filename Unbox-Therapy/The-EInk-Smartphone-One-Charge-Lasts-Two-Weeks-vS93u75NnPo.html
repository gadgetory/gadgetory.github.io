smartphone that's in front of me Willie
do set this up he ordered it up
apparently inside this box is an e-ink
smartphone which is like how does why
does that how does that exist why does
it exist so many questions
yank of course the screen that's in like
the kindle e-book reader it reflects
light rather than rather than projecting
light so it could be good for eye
fatigue battery life could have some
crazy battery life the Box very
nondescript just this little logo right
here it's a prototype whoa whoa
power off so it's really given me Kindle
vibes here that is so big
very contrast if I could get into this
the outside of it feels like a
smartphone from like 2012 something like
that like an early galaxy device but it
is sort of modern because there's a
type-c USB connector on it
a traditional headphone jack SIM card
tray so is it on right now oh I see the
problem though it's this it's the speed
jack to go from screen to screen as a
whole just like on an e-reader
is this Android well maybe we should
just bring well in Britain well you're
coming into the show
mr. e-ink smartphone the founder of the
company well the company is actually
called King row the King row k1 a
smartphone for optimized eye health so
they're playing up the angle yo you're
worried about your eyes mm-hmm you're
damaging your eyes all the light is
coming in yeah the blue light this of
course you can stare at it forever go
ahead yeah exactly I'm I'm not even
tired all right so I'll give us the
breakdown well since you're the founder
of the company so it is running Android
Android 8.1 nice it's got a 3100
milliamp battery that must last forever
on this screen yeah so this claims to
last for two weeks in one charge whoa
yeah two weeks can this play video it
could play video yeah where where are
the apps how do I like all inked I Inc
displays it's you know now you make an
excuse
as well yeah hang on a second let me ask
something is it so slow because of the
screen only or is it the processor as
well what's it say yeah that's true mtk
six seven six three see I don't know if
the processor is slow or if the display
is slow here but displays on ink is
typically it's a whole yeah cuz the rank
has to refresh the whole thing even on
scrolling I guess it's a whole new fresh
situation so let's go Raptors know which
is your favorite logo classic that's so
easy from you okay how about you I like
this one
remember this come on this guy cuz it
looks so funny
this guy yeah the Raptor spy yeah let's
bring up a Lulay derp video why don't we
you see what's happening to the video
here it looks fine it's gotta be
polished you know what I mean I just I
just don't will are you insane what do
you mean are you out of your mind it's a
display that's battery life okay hang on
hang on
dual-sim somebody who reads a lot on
their phone probably somebody who how
much is this 300 u.s. hey it's a phone
smart phone you know
okay well we can't do this these people
these people matter too much well we
can't do this what do you mean we can't
do it to them we can't pretend any
longer you can't pay $300 for this well
there are some people who would like to
have a heating display the blue light
that's a big thing I get it I'm not I
don't like the blue light either but if
I'm gonna I can't be the same price as
an actual smartphone yeah maybe the
price is a little high or it's double
its double what I think it will have to
be like I could see keeping this beside
your bed for example maybe you are
really worried about your eye health
like a dummy folder so so you would pick
this up prior to bed and you'd be like
look it's tea time I'm relaxing
chamomile chamomile chamomile that lets
go chamomile and this is your nighttime
phone mm-hmm the move only makes sense
if you're mostly reading at night it's
like 15 10 FPS I'm glad it exists yeah I
don't know if that makes you happy I'm
glad it exists yeah it's it's a cool
little product yet 400 hours standby
time allows you to read longer
anti-glare glass enables you to see the
screen more clearly the screen like
looking at it dude if I had to do a lot
of reading on my phone like a lot yeah I
was hoping this could be a waterproof
I'm not really sure if it is maybe take
it out for camping you know going out
there in the Sun hiking like I mean this
would be great for you know reading out
in the open the Sun the only thing this
is good for is reading and we have
readers that are cheap and light and
readily available alright maybe the
camera will be able to save it what year
is it well
it's so weird that I think this product
is basically ridiculous but I like the
fact that it exists that's where I'm in
the weird zone like you don't ever want
to discourage some new take and it's
obviously a new take this idea and and
and sometimes you wonder if you are
really capable of perceiving all the
potential customers and their issues and
why this might be useful to them do I
mean we sit here we try we go okay what
if you're you have this condition in
your eyes and like maybe for someone
this is exactly what they needed their
eyes only see in contrast or what
they're so sensitive to light they're
like they're like thank God a smartphone
I can actually use it all $2.99 is the
entry price and they sold 66 out of 400
and then the eventual price is 350 I
can't recommend people I'm easing up but
I can't recommend people spend that kind
of money on this kind of product unless
you have a very specific reason ailment
even if you could make the case you
would get so sick of making the case to
everyone I never thought I'd be
interacting with Android YouTube on an
e-ink display it's a fun thing it's got
a crazy battery life it is not a
replacement for a modern smartphone in
my opinion okay all I can agree with but
it's fun yes it's a bit of fun let's
like we're lightening up so you guys can
lighten up - everyone's gonna lighten up
it's a bit of fun let's just lighten up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
