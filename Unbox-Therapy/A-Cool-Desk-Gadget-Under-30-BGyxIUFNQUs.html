another video today I'm bringing you a
knick-knack patty-whack give a dog a
bone but Oh weird intro I'm calling it a
knick-knack because it's like sometimes
people in the comments are like glue why
are you showing me these things that are
thousands and thousands and thousands of
dollars I want something more
approachable that also happens to be
cool so I'm hoping that this is one of
those things it's called the shark
hangover something you can put on your
desk a place to keep your headphones so
that you can you know have them
organized especially if they have a
cable or something and you can display
them you know nicely but it's got a few
USB ports she can allow you to charge up
some devices it's got audio pass-through
so if you have a desktop computer or
your audio source is some somewhat
hidden behind the desk somewhere and you
know changing out headphones and whatnot
requires you to reach down behind and so
on this is an alternative it's gonna
allow for you to connect and disconnect
right at the pace all right so let's uh
let's crack this baby open gonna need a
knife for that okay some weight to it
which is probably good I'm gonna put
that there for a moment here's the base
cool is it a hub or is it just power
let's see here it is a hub not just
charge things but allow you to have more
peripherals connected to your system
essentially one goes to your system the
other three sit out front here are those
audio ports I mentioned before and what
looks like a power button and then a USB
cable slide it yes that was easy the
back for your cable I've got some
headphones here let's see what this
thing looks like if you caught the last
video which of course you have you still
have time it hasn't self-destructed yet
then you probably saw these slick new
headphones from Odyssey look at the
is what they look like that's a bit of a
look right there wait I want to do it
the other way there we go I like that
look better on your desktop you always
know where they are look at that so now
it's plugged in quickly try to charge
the device what we didn't charge how
about this iPad right here iPad so I try
to plug the shark into a power brick and
for some reason it was behaving like it
wouldn't it wasn't passing through
charge to the other devices but the
minute that I plugged it into my laptop
all of a sudden everything was charging
up correctly so the intention here as
the manual states Lou why don't you try
reading the manual first as the manual
states this should be hooked up to your
system and then it can actually act as a
USB sound card as well so these audio
ports they don't require direct
connection near the microphone and
headphone the sound card is like in the
base so the USB is transferring the
audio and now I can plug directly into
those locations there so again now you
have access to your ports through the
USB hub as well as your audio through
the built-in interface so all you got to
do is connect this end here to an
available USB port on a on a computer
could be Mac could be PC doesn't really
matter so you got this like cool this
cool little gadget on your desk
multifunctional unlined
sorry as I'm just I'm enjoying myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
