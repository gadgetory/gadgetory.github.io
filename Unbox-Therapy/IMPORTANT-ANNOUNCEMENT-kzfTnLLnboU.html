for my super special important
announcement I'm starting another
YouTube channel Oh No
yeah but it's not gonna change anything
here nah not gonna change anything on
unbox therapy in fact I'm gonna keep
producing content like a maniac on this
channel because this is my baby this is
my heart and soul and you're never gonna
have to worry about that being taken
away but this new channel is something
different and I really think you're
going to enjoy it and I'm looking for
help I'm looking for viewers I'm looking
for subscribers because I've got none at
the moment and I need you guys to come
over there to help me get that channel
partnered nice and quick so that I can
start to do some extra things over there
that are impossible to do without being
partnered for example make it look
pretty because right now it looks pretty
crappy it looks like a very basic
YouTube channel which I don't like but
anyways
without further ado I'm gonna let you
check it out here it is youtube.com
slash beast feed obviously I'm gonna put
a link in the annotations here as well
as a link down in the description the
show is called the beast feed and don't
ask me why you got to figure that out
for yourself but what we do on that show
is we basically chop down some of the
news items that you know interested me
over the course of a day or a couple
days I don't know how often I'm gonna do
it yet if you guys like the show after
you go and watch it tell me in the
comments of the new video there if you
want me to do it daily because I don't
really I really don't mind I'm looking
at so much stuff on the internet all the
time I basically live on here if you
want me to do it daily I'll do it daily
you just let me know anyway guys I'm not
gonna take too much time on this video I
really want to take the conversation
about the new show over to the new
channel so definitely check it out

we got 11 subscribers right now 10
upload views I'm sure you guys can
obliterate those figures that's right
you guys had a unbox therapy army and
and believe me I ain't gonna let you
down I'm sure you're gonna love this new
content on a new channel and you're
probably gonna want to you know catch
both shows all the time because they're
very they're very
harmonious beautiful just like me and

waste any more of your time until next
time and as always thanks for watching
