video what's up guys Lew here back with
another video and as you can tell I've
got a few items today it's not just one
this is a big chunk of the lineup as far
as the Ultimate Ears portable Bluetooth
speakers are concerned
AJ actually put me on to it he was like
dude these are these speakers so you can
hold him accountable if these things end
up sucking which I'm pretty sure they
don't popcorn in my teeth we've got 100
200 and $300 price points on this one
this is the top dog in the food chain
over here it has ipx7 waterproof
functionality 20 hours of battery life a
hundred feet of range and you can
connect multiple units to create a
stereo experience now the other ones
have similar features as well this
little guy here which is called the role
is also IP
x7 waterproof it's got a little bit less
battery life in a little bit less range
because it's smaller of course and less
expensive but there is an accessory to
actually make this one a floatable
speaker floatable floatable is that even
over floating but maybe you're in the
lake or something or on a boat or even
in your pool and you want your music
closeby got this little guy floating
around it's kind of cute this one on the
left is probably the most boring it also
happens to be the one that AJ owns and
raves about every day it doesn't have
waterproof capabilities but it is water
resistant which is better than nothing
still got decent battery life decent
range and it fits kind of in between
price-wise I assume it fits in between
sound wise as well I'm gonna I'm gonna
do this big one first me see if I know
what I'm doing here
oh yeah the names this is the mega boom
boom boom mega boom and roll look at it
whoa
is this also a carrying case whoa
okay that's Wow
there's a little sticker here this hole
oh look at this got a little flat cable
nice and bright USB micro USB for
charging it up and it fits right in
there this thing feels solid as well a
couple of flaps one for auxiliary and
one for your micro USB you got your
power on this side here as well as a
Bluetooth button giant buttons for
volume the power brick look at that
bright you're not gonna lose that that's
gonna be tough to lose let's do the
little guy here real quick there are
applications for each of these that you
can install on Android and iOS I'll be
booting those up very shortly they ship
the whole thing in like what wow whoa it
feels solid oh cool same cool cable no
power brick let's pair this up the three
applications installed up here UE boom
UE roll and make up I'm going to launch
the role app oh look at that loading
there's nothing better than bluetooth
pairing bloopers shows the battery life
that's useful I like it pretty
straightforward simple app power button
simi volume double up if you want to add
another speaker EQ how does it sound
sorry I'm gonna flip it over what do you
say Jack sensual
okay I'm impressed
I feel like sighs - sound ratio is
actually pretty impressive the design
may be not for everybody but they do
come in a number of different color
combinations and the fact that it's
waterproof I mean who can hate on that
take a look at this guy here which is
the boom the boom the boom this is a
different color combo than last
obviously much different than the bigger
one you still have these nice oversized
volume buttons which I like
just like before it's a question of
sound hello critical battery please
charge hands-down the best
critical battery warning I've ever heard
in my entire life AJ probably has that
on loop AJ critical battery warning man
the sound is way better on this way
better forget about that thing this is
not that much bigger this sounds way
better than that now I am insanely
pumped for the big boy the mega burrito
more depth more low-end step up in a big
way in a bigger way than I expected this
though look at this you have the flap to
protect the auxiliary port and the
microUSB and we are fully waterproof for
how much money AJ $300 that's expensive
most people they spend that kind of
money on their phones I don't know how
many people in the market for a speaker
that's this price that said it's about
the sound right so let's pair up same
song same song same song
you already know what do I need to tell
you at this point you already know you
heard it this is the one to get I don't
know what you have to do maybe you have
to borrow a few bucks from your parents
maybe you have to ask for it from Santa
Claus Hanukkah ask for it for Kwanzaa
listen a lot of times this is like not
your main music setup and it's something
you want to take with you and this is
this is cool I'll get this one over this
one
I'll take sound over the water proof put
away a few extra bucks get get a paper
route right get a paper route Wow
when you hear them in this kind of
environment one after the other you
really start to appreciate the
differences you're sitting on the picnic
tables outside your high school with
this joint and then someone comes along
with the mega boom you're out you're out
of commission they send you home you're
suspended you might even be expelled you
show up with this one you're expelled
all right let's listen to it one more
time but you heard what I have to say
all right this is my this is the one
we're gonna roll out on the mega boo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
