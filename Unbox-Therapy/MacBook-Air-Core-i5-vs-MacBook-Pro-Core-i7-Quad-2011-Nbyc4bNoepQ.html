therapy and as promised we're going to
have a little showdown video my 15 inch
MacBook Pro this is a 2.2 gigahertz
quad-core up against the newly released
MacBook Air this is a core i5 13-inch
model at 1.7 gigahertz now these two
machines are definitely designed for
different users but we're going to throw
them up against each other anyways so
here we have it this is the side of the
macbook pro and as you can see you got a
number of different options for
interfacing you have a Ethernet port a
firewire 800 audio in and out as well as
this battery indicator those are all
things that are unavailable on the
MacBook Air you're also going to get a
Kensington lock and of course that super
drive for reading writing DVDs etc now
on the air you're going to give up a
couple of those like I said you just got
the MagSafe one USB a headphone jack a
microphone and on the other side you've
got an SD card reader another USB in a
new thunderbolt port now what you lose
in expandability I guess you'd say you
gain in organ a'm --ax this 13-inch is
super thin and light as I'm sure you
guys know and if you got to work with
one of these things on your lap for an
extended period of time not only is it
thinner and lighter it doesn't get
nearly as hot as the pro does and to be
honest with you guys my pro basically
sits on my desk most of the time so
that's not a huge issue for me but if
you got to travel with with this thing
you're going to want to definitely take
a hard look at the MacBook Air so next
let's talk about the screens they both
run the same resolution although you
can't upgrade the MacBook Pro screen to
run a higher one - stock and I have to
say guys as soon as I opened up the air
the first thing I noticed was how
beautiful the screen was it has less
glare than the MacBook Pro screen and
that high resolution display being in a
13 inch form factor actually gives you a
tighter pixel density so I definitely
prefer the MacBook Air screen one
downside though is it's got the
old-school iSight camera it doesn't have
the new HD one
and another difference is on the f4 key
you've got a new shortcut button that
doesn't exist on the Pro and it's lion
specific since the MacBook Air ships
with Lion now talking about sound this
is hands down for the pro I mean this
thing has decent speakers on it compared
to the almost non-existent ones on the
MacBook it I mean it sound is fine but
you not buying it for that so let's run
a few benchmarks get an idea of the
performance difference now this is
Geekbench it's going to take a look at
your cpu performance
now the first number you saw was not the
real number because the capture software
was running but the real number is here
5457 is the cpu and ram score via
Geekbench for the MacBook Air now let's
take a look at the quad-core Pro and as
you guys might imagine this is going to
be significantly higher it scores just
under 10,000 with the capture software
running and without it's up over 10,000
so these are synthetic of course in
everyday use you probably won't see
double the performance on a MacBook Pro
but they're they ought to look at
nonetheless now this is your disk speed
test and as you guys know the MacBook
Air is all ship with SSDs now
solid-state storage that is and here you
can see some definitely impressive
numbers 240 245 plus on the right and
265 on the read now if we look at the
MacBook Pro I've upgraded this I threw a
vertex 3 in here so this is not fair it
ain't fair by any means you can see the
right numbers are up around 450 and the
read number is even higher
just under 490 right around 490 once
again this is an aftermarket upgrade I
did a video showing how to install one
of these vertex drives into your MacBook
Pro so if you want to watch that I'll
put a link up in the annotations here so
you can go check that out but I'm going
to recommend you guys put an SSD in
either of these if you do it in the pro
then definitely do it aftermarket next
we're going to look at another
benchmarking tool this one is called
Cinebench and it's going to gauge the
graphics performance of both of these
laptops now as you guys know the
MacBook Air has got an integrated
graphics solution
it's the Intel HD graphics 3000 and it's
pretty hard for integrated graphics to
hold their weight when stacked up
against a dedicated graphics solution
like the MacBook Pro has that being said
integrated graphics have gotten a lot
better over the years and they sure beat
out some older discrete graphics
solutions so the other element to
Cinebench is it's also got a CPU
benchmark and basically the way this
works is it throws an incredibly high
resolution image at your machine and
waits to see how long it's going to take
to render it now the MacBook Air is
running a dual-core processor
whereas the MacBook Pro has four cores
so the results of these kinds of
benchmarks are pretty obvious you don't
have to be a mathematician to figure out
that four cores are better than two so
here's the OpenGL figure the graphics
figure is about ten frames per second on
this test and the CPU figure is at 2.1
four points keep those figures in mind
because next we're going to put up the
MacBook Pro and see what kind of figures
it can come up with so first things
first we're going to run the graphics
test and as I mentioned before the
MacBook Pro has a dedicated graphics
solution from ATI
it's the ATI Radeon HD
6750 M I was about 'fl but anyways the
idea here is that you've got a dedicated
solution so that it can free up your RAM
and other system resources to do other
things and it can chew through that
video data itself and you can see that
figure already came in almost three
times higher than the fps number coming
out of the air next we're going to run
the CPU benchmark and once again you can
see that that image is already rendering
significantly faster and this particular
benchmark is taking advantage of those
four cores and eight threads at a higher
clock speed so anyway guys this is
pretty obvious you know these results
are probably what you expected to see
but which computer is right for you well
that depends on what your needs are if
you're going to use a lot of multimedia
if you're going to do a lot of video
editing or 3d rendering then I guess the
choice is pretty obvious you're going to
go for the MacBook Pro and you probably
already knew that you needed it but if
you're trying to replace a productivity
computer something for everyday life
internet email a little bit of YouTube a
little bit of unbox therapy here in
there then the MacBook Air is the way to
go as far as I'm concerned great battery
life incredible form factor and way
faster than the previous generation so
anyway guys I hope this helped and if it
did then maybe you'll click that
subscribe button and follow me in the
future and until then until I see you
around
thank you for watching later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
