here I have a special smartphone in here
it's an LG V 30 the new color the kind
of what is it well raspberry rose that
sounds appetizing when I was at CES I
got my first peek at this particular
device and I was like how is it that I
have not unboxed an lg me 30 as you can
see I've got a nice little card here
happy Valentine's Day as well let's get
this open what oh my whoa that is kind
of cool that's cool be a no play this is
one of the last remaining devices that
cares about the headphone amplification
on the headphone jack so that's really
cool see and this is the way a seal is
meant to be the last video we did the
sticker was just like somewhere over
here boom oh baby
dual lens system up here this is one of
my favorite implementations because one
of the lenses is a wide-angle lens
landscapes or architecture you have that
ability oh cool Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen headset
right there that's in the box guys Wow
not only does this device keep the
headphone jack but it's actually
supposedly one of the best headphone
jacks on any smartphone they're using an
upgraded DAC in there
Oh fingerprint scanner this is also a
button as well no need for a power
switch on the side this one feels
immediately a little bit lighter is this
thing lighter than 158 grams let's say
an iPhone 8 plus 202 grams and this is a
hundred and fifty something so it is
quite light alright so fingerprint setup
time so fingerprint unlocks with or
without a click and boom it's fast it's
nice actually if I click down on it then
that locks the device it makes a lot of
sense like why do you have to have a
power switch and a separate fingerprint
reader pixel to excel right here why do
I have this extra button here why
wouldn't this on the back just be a
button
okay now this is a P OLED display what's
the resolution well 1440p it actually
looks pretty good you'll see if I scroll
down here on the settings I can turn the
hi-fi quad DAC on or off right from that
location now I'll show you what I'm
talking about regarding the wide angle
the way it's represented over here is
with a single tree or three trees it's
not a software effect it's not a crop
effect actually shifting to the other
lens let's say you're trying to take a
picture of your friend single tree mode
that's a pretty decent image right there
I switch to the wide lens and whoa look
how much more is in frame it's night and
day
standard focal range and there's the
wide one often I will carry around a
moment lens just to have a wide angle
shot this should be talked about more I
mean it's really cool what you can do
with this
why not wide I mean it's really truly
like having two cameras on you at all
times it's unfortunate that the dual
camera setup it became this thing that
it turns out software can do a good job
of replicating but this implementation
here this is the real reason it should
exist two unique focal opportunities in
your pocket at all times average I would
say nowhere near the razor phone
acceptable let's put it that way
be you know earbuds if you're into music
audio I can't think off the top of my
head if someone who's putting that much
focus and certainly not at the flagship
level experience high quality sound via
hi-fi quad DAC and look at this various
sound presets normal enhanced detailed
live I'll select bass there's a digital
filter here a left-right balance as well
I mean this is something guys that
you're not seeing out of the box on a
lot of phones
I kind of want to compare to the pixel
to Excel switching Dax I'm gonna play
the same song too it might sound a
little bit better but expected that to
be louder the volume is almost identical
can we get like an over ear style
headphone when you pair this with the
higher caliber headphones they included
in the box there's no doubt it sounds
good it's it's very clear but there is
something here kind of where it hasn't
met my expectation and that's in overall
volume you might be expecting a kind of
punch you in the face type of sound the
volume is comparable to the pixel 2xl it
if anything the pixel 2xl might actually
be a little bit louder
I do wish it gave a little bit more
juice there's a little bit of talk
online about whether or not this DAC is
being limited for some sort of safety
reason so that's a possibility as well
okay from a display perspective here's a
quick comparison pixel to XL to V 30
you've got a galaxy s 8 followed by an
iPhone 10 a little bit more blueish this
is maybe a little more greenish we're
talking about OLED and once you make
that move to OLED that's the biggest
jump you have the four displays you tell
me down in the comments which is the
most pleasing to your eyeballs alright
so there you have it s the V 30 alright
the special color for that special
person in your life the thing about the
cameras probably speaks to me the most
my expectations for the DAC were a
little bit higher v 30 are you gonna
switch over what about the pixel you're
gonna take the SIM card out is the dual
lens worth it it's hard for me to
imagine that right now but man that
wide-angle thing it's kind of compelling
for me I believe I would hardly ever put
it on the other lens about everybody
gathering there we go kablammo
nice looking proper optical wide image I
might pop my sim in it for a little bit
but as of right now I don't think it's
gonna be able to displace the pics will
choo excel in my pocket there it is
keeping it real with you guys alright LG
v 30 nonetheless some cool stuff going
on today's episode of unbox the repeat
as been brought to you by the new 2018
Ford EcoSport

immediately catches my attention here
is this large 8 inch display with
capacitive touch his features sink 3 and
the option for apple carplay and android
auto so just like that I have all of my
touch controls mapped to this 8 inch
display this vehicle has a 10 speaker
B&amp;amp;O play audio system check this out
take the peak in the cupholder 7
different colors ice blue orange soft
blue red green blue and purple so this

occasion which is very helpful if you're
a guy like Willie do this has also got a
Wi-Fi hotspot in here using 4G LTE

thing that that connection allows you to
do is to use an app on your smart phone
to control some of the car's features
and functions you could set up a remote
start you could lock and unlock the
vehicle all remotely from the app on
your phone its covert handle you open it
up and check out the cargo space fit one
