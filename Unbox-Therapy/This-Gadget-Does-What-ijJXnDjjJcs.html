interesting what like you're gonna know
what this is I've looked at something
similar to it way back in the past feels
like a really long time as all the
amplified everything is a speaker but
this one is more supercharged it's
called the thunder puck it's one of
these suction kind of vibration drivers
you stick this thing to a surface and
the surface resonates the sound and
depending on which surface you stick it
to you'll get varying performance can
actually get a ton of sound in a
relatively small package by utilizing
the surfaces that you have around you
line-in lineout from multiple unit
performance so you can daisy chain six
to eight hours of playback from a
company called sound vibe sound vibe
gears to hoping that this one can blow
my mind as well okay whoo I'm excited
now that's pretty small touch controls
on the top play pause microUSB there's
an on/off and Bluetooth switch aligned
in and the line out this is where the
magic happens
little suction cup looking thing on the
bottom just like that and all sine my
tables a speaker does it have some juice
right now it does and it lights up
that's kind of cool I'm guessing that
means it's impairing Thunder puck
twenty-six watt
oh my joy I don't know they can hear
this it's rattling this it's like
nothing ok the audio is like nothing
when you're just holding it in your hand
and then you stick it to something are
you ready what else you got well
[Laughter]
not that good
check out my boombox you know that's the
future we have this is glass it's just
an iPad oh that's nice
it smoothes it out a little bit it
doesn't clip on the low end that's weird
no low in the backside of a whiteboard
that sounds good let's be honest most
people just gonna put them on the table
like that's loud better not double that
all right
you double down imagine you had like 20
of these that's a freaky table
it actually turns the table into a huge
speaker this is loud
it's about maximum sound in a tiny
little package you got a vibrate a
little bit like that's just it's part of
it uh Willie do really do it all this on
their way really doing all this on their
way is that your theme song now sure you
as a shot then start your free trial
today no
I dig it I dig it
it's smooth I agree it's a small
portable package you can bring it
anywhere in your backpack and stuff so
much are they well they're 90 bucks
which I think is still a pretty good
package the next time you go to a party
this is you the thunder puck yes you
show up to a party you're like you can
stick a 10 think exactly a couple teams
who knows where that takes you Yeah
right to business Willie do a notice
they're on their way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
