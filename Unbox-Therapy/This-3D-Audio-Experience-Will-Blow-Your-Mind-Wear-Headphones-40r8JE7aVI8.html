environment that you might not know
about the world of 3b sound now this is
something that I've been interested in
for a very long time searching up
binaural audio and these different sound
scapes and experiences that you could
have in your headphones if you've ever
experienced some of these videos it is
incredible how much detail you can get
just using your ears I know exactly
where this is right now or what this is
right now or I feel like I'm there you
see most audio recordings that you hear
are single channel audio like this
microphone right here but you have two
ears one and two we hear things in two
channels not just one you know you get
the little in fact I want you to put on
headphones for this video put them on
right now from this point forward
because some interesting things are
gonna happen this is the product it's
brand new it's called the ambient from
Sennheiser you know Sennheiser obviously
been in the game forever now I've got a
bunch of them actually look at this very
exciting I'm gonna put some details on
Twitter I'm gonna give these away to you
guys so go follow me there and look out
for the tweet a microphone on each
earpiece for 3d recording audio
converters powered by Apogee I have
their products sitting on my desk 3d
recordings reproducible on any other
headphones so you use these headphones
to get the recording and then everyone
else gets to experience those
soundscapes on regular headphones
transparent hearing is a feature that
lets you hear what is going on around
you to amplify your sound while you're
wearing these so they still work as a
high quality set of headphones and it's
also got a remote control in it there's
a picture of the remote control so you
can record at any moment and they just
look like regular earbud that is the
setup I feel like you guys need this
type of visual so you can understand but
that's what it looks like a nice little
carrying bag here what is this
this is a very soft I can tell her Eddy
silky that's how you know it's a legit
equipment they're very soft so this is
what they look like this is the
microphone on the outside your speaker
unit your earphone on the inside the
magic happens in here this is your
converter apparently this indicator here
will identify when the surround
microphone is on it'll work in the
native video recording
app on your device and everything
happens over this single lightning
connection some extra ear tips depending
on the size of your ear canal this guy
on the bottom here is for transparent
hearing you can have the microphones on
the outside set to minimum so you hear
no noise no surrounding noise you can
have a kind of mix in the center here so
you can hear your surroundings a little
bit or you can have a maximum effect
where your surroundings are amplified
and you can kind of have this hyper
awareness like a superhero of course I
went into video mode on the camera the
red light came on to identify that we
are in surround sound 3d audio recording
territory talk now yeah okay so you know
how your own voice is amplified when
your ears are plugged all right then I
plug it in top that is so weird that man
that's wild I hear you a little bit
better than when I had them completely
out you're able to be more aware of your
surrounding that's kind of the effect
I'm having here I'm gonna go back into
the camera app and begin a recording I
need you to put your headphones on right
now to truly experience this properly
it's almost like a physical experience
almost like a visual perception but only
using sound that you can place it even
with your eyes closed in a way we almost
don't appreciate our hearing enough all
of a sudden it's like there's so much
more nuance to it that brings me to the
next part obviously this was a
simulation of those sound effects here
in the studio these are really meant to
be used in environments so in this next
part of the video you're gonna go to a
few different environments and you're
not going to know what those
environments are not at first I want you
to use just your ears in order to
determine where you are roll the
environments
was it generally known that you are a
piano player and they do know how to
write songs not until I joined the band
don't you think - of being in a band
it's way more secure for a performer
employed yourself it's not you just out
there on the alleged sub that mean why
did you leave the band why to keep
so how about that experience huh what
your ears are capable of finally the
audio can match the immersion of the
video quality that our devices are
capable of shooting if you made it
through this video without headphones on
you did not experience the true
capabilities here go back rewatch with
your earbuds in and you'll see exactly
what i'm talking about this is the kind
of product that gets me excited this is
actual binaural 3d sound recording that
you could put in your bag in your pocket
connect to your phone and you're ready
to go so don't forget I got three more
of these
I can't wait to send them out to some
lucky people you guys can use and show
me how you're using them upload your
clips do some crazy 3d audio stuff I'm
sure we just scratched the surface but
this it's a whole new world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
