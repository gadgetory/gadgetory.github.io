fidgeting fidget spinors these days I
know you know it it's the YouTube thing
it's the prevailing I can't tell you
what's happening beneath the surface
that created an environment with the
fertility necessary to be inseminated by
fidget spinners copulate
there he is look at him go look at him
go but this is the universe we're living
in now it's the fidgets era prehistoric
Jurassic but now we're in the fidgets
era that's how it will be remembered
where everyone was fidgeting but here's
the thing you don't know it doesn't end
with fidget spinners it goes a step
further because you cannot fidget enough
and in enough different ways you got a
fidget like this you see that fidget pad
pen dhamma skill toy fidget roller thumb
chucks excuse me it's all getting weird
now we're all weird in our own way if
you're jack weird in every way here we
go you don't have to be a gamer to enjoy
the unusually satisfying gliding action
of this joystick what I mean is it is
this the type of impulse that you really
want to nurture I don't know all right
okay that's kind of satisfying I guess
bins around that's that that's it okay I
don't know imagine what it's like to be
a teacher at this point excuse me yes
teacher
next up Tan Gama skill toy catch it flip
it spin it stall it
if you like of adapted Daft Punk song do
it like it you know what I'm saying
catch it the fits finding solace
Lucky's right tom technologic
technologic welcome to the world of pen
domino pandava is highly addictive skill
toy based on the ancient Japanese
pastime the kendama we've heard enough
oh it's a pen catch the cap on the pen
it's called a spike it doesn't the the
cap does it oh um man I don't ah what
does this come to like there's videos on
YouTube it's like dudes are like
technologic technologic means I guess
listen it's all part of it you
understand the game I'll be here all day
that's the pandava next up how about
that the fidgets roller no need to do
work no need to do class and no need to
do home it doesn't look like much does
it
ooh kind of like this one okay here we
go I have to try to get to do a perfect
Oh
Hey
Hey that was kind of satisfying I guess
man the noise it makes I kind of like
this thing what's going on here
I know I'm not really supposed to like
any of these I like this thing because
at least there's a game to it and then
they can scream like I did when they get
there and they get it to stand up
correctly maybe this is the fidget thing
that should have blown up not a spinner
thumb chucks I mean I'm looking at this
back here one two three four five six
and it's to me I'm I couldn't be more
lost it's obviously quite strange
looking I don't need to tell you that
there's a spinning aspect to it look at
that there you go
okay this is one of the ones I saw
online and people are doing tricks and
it's a whole there's a whole thing going
on are you focusing are you having a
conversation while you're doing that are
you gonna you might get arrested I guess
some people can do tricks with that but
I that's not my speed right there that's
aggressive your that's aggressive anyway
oh oh I almost set a record
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
