about my laptop of choice you may have
even seen the previous video in which i
showcased this laptop here is the x1
carbon from lenovo then light but really
the reason I choose this over other
laptops for the day-to-day is because of
the keyboard I'm a huge fan of the
keyboard and I really feel like
keyboards on laptops have been going
downhill over the past couple of years
past few years that's what opened the
gates for me to test out some various
pcs and move over to Windows but the
ThinkPad line is not gonna be for
everyone I mean it's a utilitarian look
to it you see it's got this like matte
black finish but that's not gonna be for
everyone a lot of people are gonna look
around this and while my thing to be a
little bit flashy err possibly a little
bit more modern-looking this one is
called the s 940 it has an i7 1.8
gigahertz eight gigs ram 256 storage a
14-inch
u HD IPS panel well what's the retail
cost on this one 1800 bucks
USD but the s 940 starts at $1400 for a
lower spec I found this particular
laptop to be exciting you have a kind of
really polished looking laptops but with
some of the attributes from the ThinkPad
that I like it's a 14 inch laughter
that's a tiny little box by the way it's
pretty tiny that's a 65 watt USB type-c
connector I found this charger which is
like this tiny little brick capable of
charging these laptops via USB C and
that's my travel that's my go-to travel
charger of choice now here's the laptop
this is the box that's wild that is
super tiny Wow
so it's 2.6 pounds in the x1 carbons 2
and a half so it's about the same maybe
it's just the metal playing tricks with
me here so it's a bit darker than Space
Gray I think I actually left it more to
be honest it's kind of into charcoal
territory look at the form factor that's
why that's a 15-inch MacBook Pro and
this is the s 940 the carbon is a bit
taller because the aspect ratio on the
screen is different in this case and
this guy is gonna be a bit wider if I
place it on top oh it's actually it's
almost exactly the same it is
okay so most of our gains then in the
display Department display size
department are the shrinking bezels the
bezels are tiny on this smartphone esque
they even went so far as moving the
front-facing camera above it's kind of
notched out into the top part of the
display if I hold my hand behind there
you can see it actually jumps up a
little bit now the other nice thing this
is a single handed lift this is pretty
nice guys the keyboard the keyboard is
not is not ThinkPad level there's just
not as much travel in the keys these
ones are more like a traditional
keyboard this is more like a like a
chiclet style that you would be used to
on a more modern keyboard deck alright
so I also see the dolby atmos speaker
system logo here and it looks like the
speaker grilles are here so that could
be an improvement either way I like the
fact that they carried through a similar
a similar scale with each key and
curvature to thunderbolts on this side
over here lots of potential
expandability there and speed over on
the other side you got your power
connector in the form of a USB type-c
connector and a headphone jack
you're losing lacking a little bit in
diversity of ports when compared to the
ThinkPad lineup which is gonna give you
quite a few connectors on here an hdmi
port on this guy the display is wild
there's almost no bezel around it it is
crazy slender on each side including the
top with the expanding front-facing
camera now the reason they did this
you've seen other manufacturers that
want to have a really slim bezel on
their laptops you've seen them put
cameras in all kinds of crazy places
including down below here Huawei has
done that in the past but then you get
this weird front-facing camera for video
conferencing that like looks up people's
noses so you got to appreciate the
engineering on that front you'll see how
crazy different it is when compared to
the ThinkPad I mean this baby triple the
size of a chin maybe now this display
the UHD display on here is definitely
better obviously than the FHD one that I
have on that x1 carbon over there I mean
the range from the black to the white
they're deep blacks over here too it's
just a better display and of course it's
got more resolution as well that's a no
contest in the display zone I mean this
looks look at this this looks great
I mean that's like all display that's
pretty wild
this is the main advantage this is if
you spot this thing at a coffee shop
you're like wow I want one of those and
this is probably the reason why
everybody wants portability but they
don't want to give up visibility you
don't want to give up the multimedia
component and immersion and productivity
that comes with having a larger display
I can't say that the keyboard is
competing in any way with the ThinkPad
keyboard so you got to decide like what
what is more important to you and why so
let's go ahead and turn up the volume
have Apple and iPhones that's all they
need it's all they want they're set for
life there's definitely a customer base
that believes that and then also yeah
the speakers are much better than my
finish it's it's a nice thing to hold in
one hand sorry clear I honestly do not
even need to play the speakers off to
act upon carbon to you
yeah I'm happy with the speakers anyway
so if you're wondering why it's
important to have the camera the webcam
up at the top and why they had to design
that in there I mean that would have
taken tremendous effort to get that to
fit in up there this is the purpose this
is the reason I'm looking directly into
it if I happen to be on skype if I
happen to be doing a video conference
Kirk you just did a video conference in
fact if the camera was popping up from
the bottom then it's gonna be more like
this Jack can you see this can you get
there it's more like this now you're
looking up my nose now it's not the
greatest camera me it's like a little
720p webcam up there so keep that in
mind but still to cram it in up top this
is where we're at on smartphones it's
the same story where do you put the
front-facing camera it seems to be the
one characteristic that informs so much
of the design and now you're seeing the
same thing in laptops where they're
trying to figure out where to put into
trying to figure out how to minimize
bezels so the trackpad I'm probably
gonna say that it's maybe it's even a
little bit nicer to use then on the
ThinkPad it's it's responsive it's
acceptable so it's not a substitute for
me I wouldn't say I wouldn't even say
it's particularly special I would say
it's a pretty typical keyboard but as a
package deal I think it's a pretty slick
laptop to be honest it's got almost no
bezel they found a way to fit the
front-facing camera in the right spot
the keyboard is usable the trackpad is
nice it's got enough IO for most people
with the double thunderbolt and a
headphone jack so there's advantages and
disadvantages the overall look I mean I
think this thing probably crushes for
most people it's a very slick and
slender design a lot of times or the
reason you end up liking a particular
laptop has to do with your own personal
preference around form factor or
economics it's a bit more difficult to
put your finger on why you like one
better than the other so really in this
case I'm gonna use this a bit more
extensively and see where I land but
something's telling me I'm just a think
pad guy I don't
if I can get away from it now the
keyboard it's been so rewarding me it's
a place I like to live I mean I just
can't wait to like respond to emails and
I hate email so that's got to tell you
something about what lenovo has been
able to package up in the x1 carbon it's
a that's a crazy popular laptop and for
good reason but this thing's slick it's
more modern it looks more futuristic I
think it's gonna be appealing to some
people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
