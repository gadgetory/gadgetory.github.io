the heavily requested show deal therapy
this is where I give you guys some great
daily deals on some of the consumer
electronics and tech products that you
guys care about so without wasting any
more of your time let's go ahead and get
right into today's best deals so the
first one that I found is on a monitor
but it's not just an average everyday
computer monitor this is the BenQ RL 2 4
5 5 H M now that's a terrible name that
doesn't really tell you much but what
you need to know is that this is the
official monitor of major league gaming
specifically the official console gaming
monitor for competitive gaming in MLG
and the reason that matters is because
for a lot of people they game on big
flat panel displays not knowing any
better those displays have a lot of
input lag if you want to get the most
out of your console gaming experience or
PC gaming experience you need to be on a
smaller display so you can shift focus
quicker and more often than not they
have less input lag as well so this is a
professional monitor for top-tier gaming
it's on sale right now $1.99 from $2.99
so $100 off do not miss that link down
in the description the next thing I want
to mention is not exactly a deal but it
is worth mentioning you can now bundle
games with your ps4 pre-order on Amazon
so if you haven't pre-ordered yet and
you want to secure a specific title
along with the console to make sure that
that title is available to you and not
unavailable at the time of launch you
can do that there are bundles available
with watchdogs battlefield 4 Killzone
and more you can also get them bundled
with PSN perks as well so check out that
link down below to see just how you can
bundle your ps4 if you haven't
pre-ordered one yet next this is an
interesting one it's not a specific deal
but it's something I found for students
Best Buy is having student deals that
are exclusive and if you use the link
down in the description you can sign up
for an email and what they'll do is they
will give you exclusive coupon codes
leading up to the back-to-school period
now that you're on summer this is for
college students high school students so
if you're looking for some great deals
on consumer electronics coming up to
back-to-school
then I would recommend signing up to
that form down in the description it'll
be titled best by student deals or
something and the link will be beside it
next we have a very popular one which
you guys like to have me mention here
very often which is headphone deals and
in this particular case we have the
audio technica ath m4 TFS these are $59
down from a hundred and fifty and I was
comparing this particular model of
headphone to the very popular and 30s
and they actually are the same price on
Amazon right now even though I think the
m4 TFS are actually better headphones
and I'll tell you why there's a little
bit more padding they have a very
similar driver inside both 40mil drivers
but the headband has more padding and
the ear cups rotate so if you happen to
be a DJ or you happen to want to have
conversation with somebody while keeping
the headphones on your head you can just
flip an ear cup around so that's that's
a perk it's a positive it's a plus and
they're the same price as 2m 30 so
probably the best $59 you can spend on
headphones right now the ath m4 TFS if
you click on the link down below you'll
see amazing reviews as well so you
really can't go wrong with that
particular purchase the next one I'm
looking out for you guys on things other
than tech there's a website called
PacSun and they sell clothing shoes etc
from a lot of top brands popular brands
brands like RVCA
early diamond supply Volcom and more so
if you're looking for some new gear for
the summer I know it's hot as hell here
in Toronto so I'm looking for some new
shorts myself there's a coupon right now
which is 20% off of $50 or more on their
website all you need to do is type in
the code beach bound use the link down
below and then when you're done sort of
adding things to your cart use the code
beach bound and you'll get 20% off of
$50 or more on a bunch of new gear
that's good until the 27th and they ship
the USA and Canada one thing I do want
to mention is this promo is stackable so
if you see other promos on the site like
30% off of a particular shirt or
something like that or shorts or
whatever you can stack this one on top
so it will still be eligible that's
definitely worth checking out and that
get down in the description as well the
next one once again not 100% tech
related but interesting nonetheless I
found a site called Big Shot bikes and
they do you know custom fixed gear bikes
as well as a couple of prepackaged fixed
gear bikes and they look pretty damn
cool and they're surprisingly a decent
value right now there's a promo code
that I can give you for 10% off of a
custom model if you actually want to get
the colors and things you have them
build it for you specifically you just
need to use the code fixie sale ten at
the end of your purchase but on top of
that they have five set models starting
at just $2.99 so some pretty cool
looking bikes for really a reasonable
price that link is down below as well
next one this is an unusual one it is
tech related but I've never mentioned
them before on deal therapy it's a
company called next worth and this is a
site that will allow you to get an
immediate quote on the trading of your
gadgets electronics games video games
they'll even do portable gaming consoles
phones tablets they will buy a lot of
stuff off of you from the consumer
electronics arena and right now they
have a 20% trade-in bonus at the end you
just use bonus code bonus 20 that bonus
to be more specific is on iPhone iPad
and iPod so if you're trading in one of
those three items you can get 20% extra
on your trade-in by using the code bonus
20 that link is down below if you're
wondering sort of roughly what you would
get for different devices I looked up a
couple popular ones
I think the iPhone 4s is still worth
close to two hundred and fifty dollars
depending on which model and it's like
super simple to sell it to them as well
you know you could obviously get more on
the classifieds if you meet up with
somebody on Craigslist or something but
this is like insanely simple if you just
want a quick upgrade and you want to get
some value for your old device you
simply like click in the specs it takes
like a few seconds you get a quote
immediately and then they will send you
to cash they give you a prepaid shipping
label you really don't have to to very
much and you'll get money for your old
gear for your old gadgets so that
pretty cool next we have the UK deal for
people in the UK I know everyone's
nagging me in other parts of the world
for deals you know that apply to them
the UK deal is from the Amazon UK
website and it is 10 pounds for a pair
of sweat proof Philips headphones and
they are regular 20 pounds so half price
essentially and the reason I like sweat
proof sport type headphones is because
well for obviously obvious reasons they
do well in an environment where you're
exercising or something like that so
really everybody you know should have a
pair especially if they're only ten
bucks and you can bet that they're
probably an improvement over the stock
headphones that you're using and they're
not gonna get all nasty because they are
sweat proof you can rinse them off the
last deal is for Canadians and this is a
$39 from $99 SanDisk Cruiser 64 gigabyte
USB flash drive so a really large flash
drive for 39 bucks instead of 99 bucks
for storing whatever the hell you want
to store so anyways all the links for
all the deals that I talked about are
down in the description as I said a
million times and I just want to make
sure that you know where they are I know
you guys enjoy this show if you want to
see more deal therapy episodes make sure
to leave a thumbs up or even do better
and share this show with your friends so
that we can get some more views and
hopefully continue to do them anyway and
that wraps up this particular episode
and I will catch you guys on the next
one thanks as always for watching and
I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
