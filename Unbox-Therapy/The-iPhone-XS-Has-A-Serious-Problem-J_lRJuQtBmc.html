there's a good reason for it I woke up
this morning to an email saying Lou I
need your help
big-time and I was like what could this
possibly be about this one seems
significant I'm ready to make you aware
of a huge issue with the new iPhone 10's
max when the phone is idle in asleep it
will not recognize the Lightning jack
and therefore will not charge the phone
it is only after you wake the device up
that it recognizes the cable is plugged
in I'm trying to reach someone on a
bigger platform to make this issue known
to Apple so they can at least let
customers know that they are aware of it
now this email came along with a link to
the discussions Apple calm that's apples
official forums where there are many
many messages of people experiencing
this same issue and when I saw this I'm
like I have to investigate what's he
talking about I've been using the iPhone
10's Max and I didn't notice anything
but I've been using it exclusively with
wireless charging so I was like oh man
this could be a big problem are people
really unable to charge their new
smartphones are we on the verge of some
kind of charge date situation so I got
all the iPhone 10s and 10's maxes that
we have in the studio to figure out how
widespread this issue actually is I've
also got an iPhone 10 here running iOS
12 to see if it's strictly related to
the operating system this issue that
people are supposedly having I'll give
you a quick breakdown on the complaint
as it stands some say that when the
lightning cable is plugged in to an idle
iPhone an iPhone just sitting on a table
it will not charge others are saying
that if you tap on the phone and wake it
up after the insertion of the lightning
cable then it will begin to charge
others are having an even worse issue
where just won't recognize the cable
they have to flip it over and even
waking the device up with the lightning
cable inserted will not create an
effective charge this is some crazy
stuff I haven't seen something exactly
like this definitely not on an iPhone
launch that I'm aware of I noticed that
there were a cup
of individuals in fact many requests for
someone like me to make a video on this
because up until now it appears that
Apple doesn't really have an official
response in some cases it looks like
they have replaced devices but then
those new devices have exhibited the
same issue so responding to those people
on a platform like this should bring
light to it and hopefully some sort of a
software fix if possible to address this
sooner than later first things first
let's put all of these iPhones into
their locked state in the top corner
here I have an iPhone 10 that is of
course to compare what usually happens
or should happen when you plug in an
iPhone to the wall outlet now we have
standard power here straight from the
wall to this extension cord followed by
this power brick this is the one that
ships in the box with the iPhone 10s and
10's max and this is the lightning cable
that is also in there that said we have
tested this issue with third-party
bricks third party cables as well as
Apple's own 29 watt more powerful charge
brick the issue is not anywhere here
regarding the charger or the cable
itself so here we go
iPhone 10 regular iPhone 10 we've all
seen this we're used to it this is what
you would expect to happen when you plug
in an iPhone boom pops up right away
you're aware you're confident that your
device is charging you can go to sleep
now you'll be fine now if I come down
here to the iPhone 10 s this is the
first in our group now the reason we
have so many phones because we want to
see the behavior of each one to maybe
get an idea of how widespread this issue
actually is so this is the first iPhone
10 s I'll plug it in starts to charge
right away that's what you would hope to
see ok cool how about the next one
the 10s max no charge it should pop up
of course if it was charging it even
makes a tone and you see the icon to
indicate now what about if I tap on this
one it starts to charge so there's
something to do with the sleep mode or
the idle mode that for some reason is
blocking the charge current from coming
through or at least the battery from
receiving the charge this is the most
common version of this issue that I've
seen this is the exact issue that's
affecting people because they're just
plugging it in going to sleep and waking
up it was never charging the entire time
this is another issue that's happening
when plugged in look at this it refuses
to wake up I've noticed this happening
also so sometimes it will effectively
get to charge but the entire phone will
freeze and this will just be in some
weird state for a while now plug it back
in another 10 s max no charge what if I
tap it boom starts to charge right away
as soon as it jumps out of sleep the
charge can take place let's keep it
moving next one up another 10 s max that
one charges immediately for some reason
who knows why let's move down to the
next one no charge another 10 s max with
the issue let's see if we can get a 10s
to behave like these maxes where it's
actually not taking a charge upon
insertion of the cable okay this device
right here no charge what if I pick it
up starts to charge very bizarre it
appears it's not isolated to 10s maxes
let's try this next one instant charge
next one
no charge that's another regular 10s not
charging what if I tap it then it starts
to charge this is so weird there are
some people that have stated that it
won't start a charge later on it will
look like it's charging temporarily or
say that it's charging then it'll stop
and it won't kick back in some people
are saying they have the issue to the
extent that they'll have to reinsert the
cable or flip the cable around to
actually get an effective charge ok this
10's max has been asleep for a bit let's
plug it in even though I'm holding it
still not alive I tap it still not
charging so this one has actually
exhibited the worst problems of the
bunch and I think if you have a phone
like this one this is a nightmare
you're now plugged in the phone's awake
and it's still not charging show them
that it's plugged in jack plugged in is
it a software problem is it a hardware
problem my gut is telling me a software
I sure hope it's software you can read
up on this it appears that Apple does
not have an official response as of now
and a lot of you guys out in the
audience you're like Lou why do you keep
coming at us with these various
smartphone issues what what are you
doing bringing this stuff to light
there's a lot of Apple fans out there
this is in no way condemning the entire
device that's not the goal here the fact
is there are real humans experiencing
this issue who spent their money good
money to get these devices and they're
not behaving in the way that those
people expected the ability to recharge
your phone confidently I mean that's
like step one that is a key ingredient
to your smartphone experience and if
these people aren't getting a response
or a refund or some kind of solution
many of them who got a replacement they
continue to experience the same thing
then it's up to platforms like this one
people like us to escalate the situation
so that it gets a better response
eight devices on the table and they're
all exhibiting some form of the issue
some worse than others this 10s max here
is the worst of the bunch where it
usually exhibits a no charge situation
followed by no charge even after waking
it up if you
are an owner of one of these devices the
new tennis or tennis max do this test
yourself see if your device is charging
in a weird way
if so hopefully this comments section
can act as an update a conversation
about what's happening maybe there are
workarounds that you found leave those
comments down below look this is my job
I gotta call this stuff out you got to
hold these companies accountable
ultimately customers you guys that's who
I answer to you nominated me for this
position I'm not gonna help them sweep
it under the rug you guys need solutions
if you're experiencing this issue that's
why the original email was sent that's
why the threads are out there hopefully
this can elevate the situation and we
can find a solution you nominated me for
the job so that's what I'm gonna do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
