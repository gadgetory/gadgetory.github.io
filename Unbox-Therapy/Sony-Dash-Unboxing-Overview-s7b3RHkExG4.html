and today we're taking a look at the
sony - otherwise known as the hid c10
for those of you who are into
alphanumeric product codes anyways the
reason I picked this up is because it
just took a major price dive I was
originally released a while ago at 200
bucks and it's down to about a hundred
now depending on where you buy it to me
it's a totally different product at a
hundred hundred dollar investment than
it is at two hundred at two hundred it's
like you know do I really mean the
internet beside my bed at all times etc
but at 100 it's like it's not that
much more than an alarm clock at least a
fully-featured one yet it can do so much
more so anyways that should give you
some idea of consumers perceptions
depending on price point at a different
price point it's a totally different
product anyways enough about that let's
get to the unboxing we get a bunch of
Sony paperwork a dash pamphlet as well
as what looks like the instruction
manual next we've got the device itself
now it's supposed to be the brown model
but it seemed to me like the brown is so
dark it's almost black you can take a
look for yourself
now obviously the front bezel is black
but around the sides this rubberized
coating is supposedly Brown I mean I'm
not sure so we got power on the bottom
and then on the side here we've got this
little flap which houses a USB port as
well as our headphone jack now the USB
port will accept any mass storage if you
want to load up or look at some JPEGs or
listen to some mp3s or however you want
to use it next we've got the power
adapter which is actually a little bit
bigger than I expected especially
considering the device is super light
but anyway not a huge problem
straightforward
stuff it will supply power I'm sure and
lastly it looks like we've got some
legal documentation from Sony can always
count on Sony to be incredibly thorough
legally anyway here's a little startup
of the device this is what you see when
you first boot it up it's telling you
about what it can do from whether to
Twitter feeds to Facebook and there's
also about a thousand different
third-party apps everything from
internet radio to social networking of
course traffic there you go anyway I'll
know more about this once I get a chance
to play with it the only issue I foresee
right now is that the screen doesn't
appear to be extremely responsive at
this point especially compared to some
of the stuff we're used to from
capacitive touchscreens like on your
iPad or iPhone or smartphone or anything
with a touchscreen this one doesn't feel
like it's of the same quality some other
specs it's a seven-inch screen it's not
super high resolution it's only 800 by
480 but it's obviously got Wi-Fi built
in that's how it's gonna hook up to the
Internet and so it's obviously gonna be
cool beside the bed or maybe even in the
kitchen anyway thanks for watching and I
hope you'll check out our Channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
