blue Here I am back in Toronto back home
from the fanboy rap video shoot which
was amazing incredible if you haven't
seen the video yet please go check it
out I will link it somewhere down below
until the fingers are sold they are
fanboys yes I know you know they are
ready this far on the interwebs if you
went out a bunch of incredible people
came to help out it was completely
unexpected and I'm just amazed at the
way it turned out so please show your
support go check out the video and if
you want to go one step further then
purchase the song on iTunes or Amazon
and help support those amazing
collaborations and hopefully we can do
more of them in the future but that's
not what we're here for today today
we're talking about some headphones
these are the hd8 DJ from sennheiser
very excited to take a closer look at
these they are the top of the range
DJ style headphones from sennheiser i
have heard that they are very
comfortable i've heard that they sound
very good as well you know what first
let's take a closer look at the box so
HD a DJ unleashed a sound rule the club
you heard it here first rule the club
with these headphones if that's what
you're looking to do
exchangeable cables twist and pull ok
that's it that's a good deal that's a
big thing because obviously if you need
to exchange the cables at some point you
have that option here you can see how
the ear cups swivel on the back you have
the standard position or of course the
DJ position made popular by all of your
favorite DJs 8 to 30 thousand Hertz in
terms of frequency response impedance at
95 ohms sound pressure the SPL 115 DB
and total harmonic distortion point one
percent one kilohertz 100 decibels
alright on the side we have one coiled
cable as well as one straight cable and
it is of course in around
ear style headphones so we're going to
go ahead and cut these tabs open take a
closer look at the hd8 DJ from
sennheiser very exciting here we go one
tab two tabs
three tabs there's a little blue pull
here very luxurious Wow nice box
straight away this is unbox therapy
after all so of course I am concerned
with the packaging and this has been
done very very well
foam everywhere as well as a traveling
case for the headphones then a little
box over here it appears to have some
accessories in it so let's get to these
first I'll pull them out and then get
the box out of the way the bigger box
alright so there we go put this down so
here is an extra cable this here's the
street cable I'm a fan of the coiled
cables you get a little bit more
flexibility there if you're listening at
a desk but if you are traveling or you
know you're using them for portable use
then you're probably going to want to
use the straight cable here you can see
the detachable end that goes into the
headphone and then the other end which
goes into your player your multimedia
device your phone etc standard mini Jack
here's the Emmanuel which I'm not going
to read right now but if you are
interested in finding out more if you
happen to buy these you can check out
the manual a quick note if you're
interested in pricing availability on
the HD 8 I will have a link down in the
description hopefully I can find a
couple of international links as well
instead of just the US one so if I can
find those I will link them down below
and you can check out the pricing and
availability like I said so next up we
have the main attraction this is a nice
hard case here it has
nylon I guess like a kind of durable
nylon on the outside which is probably
going to be water-resistant really nice
pulls on the zipper high-quality zipper
so they've really gone all out here and
then the headphones Wow you guys are
getting the initial reactions this is
the new style here on unbox therapy you
get the legitimate first impressions
first look I have not opened it up I
have not looked at them before so these
swivel down Wow smells fresh too props
to Sennheiser for that factory fresh
smell so the construction here is Wow
quite nice these are built like a tank I
can tell all right I mean I haven't even
used them and I can tell so this is the
key factor here this is where the ear
cup pivots and you can see it says
Sennheiser DJ on there this little
metallic ring and that allows for this
pivoting action to take place gives you
that DJ appeal but if you're someone
like me not necessarily a DJ sometimes
you just want to have a conversation you
know talk to somebody nearby while
you're listening to something this is
very convenient and comfortable and
gives you the ability to do that without
taking the headphone off of your head
over here on the inside of the headband
you have an enormous amount of padding
as well that's really nice and it looks
like you can connect the cable to either
of these depending on what your
preference is if you like the cable to
going to the left or the right hand side
it looks like you have that option also
inside of the case we have a coiled
cable as I said I'm a fan of this one it
gives you a little bit more slack
without having such a huge pile of cable
obviously get some spring ability there
and this Cable has pre-installed 1/4
inch adapter and this is going to give
you the ability to interface with
professional audio gear amplifiers etc
mixing boards so it's removable and it's
screw on it so it locks on there it
won't come off if you don't want it to
and this adapter can also be installed
on the other table the straight cable
over here so you've got options you can
use this however you want so I'm going
to go ahead and just for the sake of
this video show you how to install the
straight cable here so I'll put it on
this ear cup I believe you just go up in
and then it should lock yet then it
locks over and it won't come out by
accident at that point so you spin to
the left pull out straight up and in
spin to the right lock it in place oh we
have some ear Cup options so these here
are a velour style a soft style ear cup
of course over here you have the
synthetic leather like material so
depending on your preference you may
want to install these obviously that's a
subjective thing some people are going
to prefer this feel on the side of their
face and ears and some will prefer this
over here this is a more traditional
what you're used to seeing but having
options is always a good thing there you
have it the HD 8 DJ from Sennheiser
can't wait to try these out potentially
use them when recording another rap song
who knows I'm just joking but let me try
them on actually might as well since you
guys have a view of myself here let's
see what they look like on I can't hear
myself very well right now
ok so actually the pivoting ear cups
have a secondary effect of also allowing
you to make some minor adjustments
depending on the shape of your head and
the where your ears are located I think
I'm pretty normal I'm not 100% sure so
there that's what they look like when
they're on they're not actually that
huge not as huge as I expected them to
be when I first saw the Box the sound
isolation is really good my own voice is
heavily muffled here so even though
these aren't a noise cancelling
headphone they are using passive noise
isolation which I'm a fan of because
that means they don't need a separate
battery or anything like that but they
just do a really good job of sealing the
ear cup around
your ear of course all right well the
next obvious thing to do is to go and
test these things out with some real
music this is difficult for me to show
you in video like how they sound because
of course you'll be listening on your
own headphones and and that's kind of
impossible but I had an idea a long time
ago about building a new system for at
least giving you guys a sample maybe a
slightly better idea of how they sound I
might still get around to working on
that depending if the opportunity comes
up you may recall a video a long long
time ago called Betty the headphone
junkie in which I was going to construct
a listening device to give you guys a
little bit more detail on how a
particular set of headphones sounds I
might still do that like I said if I can
find the time to sit down and construct
such a beast if you guys want to see
something like that please let me know
by leaving a thumbs up down below as
always thanks for watching and if you
have any questions be sure to leave a
comment I have been actively perusing
the comments on recent videos so I will
try my best to respond if you're not a
subscriber now's a great time to become
one and like I said go back a watch
fanboy crap we put an enormous amount of
time into that so if you watch it a few
times share it with your friends
download it on iTunes Amazon Google Play
listen to it on Spotify any of those
things helped out a bunch and help to
support crazy amazing ridiculous
projects like that alright thanks again
guys catch you very shortly on the next
video and I'm going to go listen to the
brand new HD 8 DJ from Sennheiser see
how they sound all right later guys
