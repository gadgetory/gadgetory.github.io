therapy and today we're taking a look at
the wireless keypad for your PlayStation
3 this device here hooks up to the top
of your ps3 controller and gives you the
ability to input text in a much more
timely fashion and probably with more
precision as well as you'd expect
there's not too much included in the
package here you've got the device as
well as a little bit of paperwork so
here it is and at first you know I took
a look at it and I thought it seemed a
little bit awkward like I didn't know
how it was gonna work to type up over
top of your controller and hopefully
once I get it installed I can see what
they're thinking is so the device is
simple it's not heavy and it's
rechargeable so it charges up on its own
rather than taking power from the
controller now that's that could be a
positive or a negative thing depending
on what you think if it took power from
the controller then you couldn't charge
a controller with the thing attached
obviously and also you're probably not
gonna get great battery life out of the
controller had to poor power both
devices so I suppose this was the best
way to do it so here's what it looks
like installed up over top it doesn't
add too much weight so still feels
pretty comfortable some of the buttons
here are actually just mechanical remaps
those buttons press on the buttons below
them and you know I have I say average
to large-size hands and for me typing up
here feels actually a lot better than I
expected I can't wait to use this thing
and get away from that on-screen
keyboard which I'm sure all of you hate
you got the power switch which is also
accessible a couple of shoulder buttons
up along the top the only thing I'm
thinking is if you have small hands I'm
not sure how small but if you have small
hands it might be a problem so we've
also got the PlayStation 3 wireless
keypad manual paperwork whatever you
want to call it who cares
and here's a closer look at in and
around the device some of the buttons
etc you got the power on/off switch
here's one of the shoulder buttons this
is where you charge a device of course
it's mini USB just like the controller
itself we've got another shoulder button
on the other side and the keys are
actually round keys which
actually works pretty well gives you
some good space between each one and you
have some shortcut keys down along the
bottom to speed up your entire ps3
experience the last thing I want to show
you is that you can still charge your
controller with this thing attached
