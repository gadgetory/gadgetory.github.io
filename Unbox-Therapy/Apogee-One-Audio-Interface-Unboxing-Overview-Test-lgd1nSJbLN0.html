Apogee one professional interface this
baby is going to make you sound good I
think I sound good I'm using it right
now you tell me let me know in the
comments anyway it's another unboxing
just like the millions that you've seen
before this time there shall be
absolutely no surprises we get
everything that we expected to get
inside here is our breakout cable for
connecting audio devices to our audio
interface surprise surprise
next we've got our USB cable which maybe
this is a surprise has a micro USB
connector on one end
that's right micro just like some of
your phones at an old BlackBerry's my
Galaxy S has a micro USB anyway next is
the least important thing which says
important on it and that is your
software which is probably outdated and
you can get something better off their
website so listen up manufacturers stop
giving a software we have the internet
we can get something more current save
the money give us the money you pass the
savings on to us save the goddamn
environment I don't know forget about
those things anyway on the top we got
our ports which are a pretty explanatory
breakout cable USB connector spin it
around bottom side headphone jack use it
for monitoring use it for audio playback
sings beautiful check it out go out get
one say goodbye to your shitty audio
you're heard peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
