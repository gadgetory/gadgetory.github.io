another video and today we are looking
at something unusual it's unusual
because it's a $59 phone full fledged
Android phone you might not have even
known that it was possible to buy one
for that amount of money but this is the
advanced 4.0 from a company called blue
who appear to specialize in budget
Android smartphones anyway I kept seeing
this pop up on Amazon and I was like you
know what why not grab it buy it and
tell you guys
whether or not it's any good or if it
sucks the box is a lot of fun stuff on
the front here you can see it says
advanced 4.0 and it looks like a
relatively stock Android experience from
this background we'll find out when we
get inside that's a party on the back
right there 4.0 capacitive touchscreen
good thing it's capacitive 480 by 800
res 3d gaming that's important record up
to 720p video it has a 4G HSPA+ 21
megabits per second no LTE here
dual-core CPU 5 megapixel camera it's
running jelly bean it has a micro SD
card expansion slot Bluetooth and of
course wireless connectivity wireless
LAN Wi-Fi whatever you wanna call it
pretty comfy no one it reminds me of a
lot is the Nexus S the Nexus S which I
actually own so this feels really
familiar
so volume rocker over here on the left
hand side removable back let's go ahead
and try that a little bit stiff
incredibly stiff Wow come on come on
blue
can do it blue oh holy moly there we go
success whoa we are looking at dual SIM
card slots Wow and a micro SD that's
pretty cool we've also got a power brick
of course a micro USB cable to charge it
up they give you a headset here's our
battery 1600 mil and half hours not huge
but you're dealing with a smaller device
smaller screen we'll see how that works
out
whoa a case getting a case for 59 looks
like blue is no joke it's kind of like a
smoke smoke flavor to it but I can't
speak to the flavor but all right so
capacitive buttons on the front here's
something different the microUSB
connector is on the top so you charge
this device on the top it's also where
your headphone jack is nothing on the
bottom except for a microphone so let's
go ahead now the screen is not the best
I've seen it's a little bit washed out
and there is like a visible gap between
the glass on the top and the actual LCD
panel below it has haptic feedback by
head over to brightness I am at full
brightness so that is any major drawback
there you go that's a $59 phone against
the I don't know it's just like $650
phone you know what given the price
difference you can have like what is it
a hundred of these for the same that was
a joke by the way here's the camera okay
I don't know if you guys can see that I
mean the image is okay it's about as
much as I'm willing to say about that
image it does take pictures that's a
plus truthfully I expected it to lag
more and be a little bit slower around
the the UI into the forward-facing
camera oh there's me this one's even
worse you're not gonna be getting the
hottest selfies off this I don't know if
you can see see that there
here's YouTube let's see how snappy this
is if I try to open up a video real
quick you guys see that there here we go
you're not buying it because it's the
best camera in the world you're not
buying it because it has the brightest
or most beautiful screen to look at
you're buying it as a phone to
communicate for texting to have a basic
web browser on the go and I think
there's some bonuses in here like the
dual SIM card slots that you don't see
everywhere it's not gonna be the fastest
phone either and it probably won't have
the best battery life but for $59 it's
really amazing the point at which we're
at maybe it's your first cell phone this
is an interesting place to start and
it's only fifty nine bucks so to answer
the question about whether or not it
sucks I would say no it doesn't suck I
think for $59 this entire package is
better than I expected if you want to
check out the device for yourself I'll
drop a link down in the description but
as of right now I think it's $59
well-spent granted this space is
becoming more crowded you've got things
like the Moto e that come in under 100
bucks and then you've got a number of
phones under 200 bucks I'm happy that it
exists it doesn't suck it's surprisingly
decent for 59 bucks the blue advanced
4.0 so there it is if you guys enjoyed
this content make sure to leave a thumbs
up down below also I'm thinking about
doing more videos like this with this
title does it suck maybe things that you
see on Amazon that are inexpensive that
you think should suck that you assume
suck but actually don't that they might
be a good value if you have any
suggestions leave them down in the
comment section or hit me up on Twitter
all right that really wraps it up thanks
again for watching and I'll catch you on
the next episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
