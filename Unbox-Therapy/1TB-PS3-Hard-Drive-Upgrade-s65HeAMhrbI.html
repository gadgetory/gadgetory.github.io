therapy I want to show you how to put
one terabyte of storage into your
Playstation 3 this is a standard laptop
size harddrive two and a half inch drive
I'll put a link to the model I used down
in the description you're also going to
need an external hard drive to backup
the data that's already on your ps3 so
you don't lose your game data game saves
so on and so forth after you've got
those two items you want to turn on your
ps3 and scroll over to settings followed
by system settings from there you want
to scroll down until you see backup
utility that's going to allow you to
backup all your game saves and all your
game data from there you've got a couple
of options you want to select the top
option which says backup it'll warn you
whether you're about to to and then you
click yes it'll say connect your storage
media that means it's time to connect
your external hard drive after you've
done that and done them back up
successfully you want to install your
1tb drive of course as you guys can see
I'm working with the old-style
PlayStation 3 these are the ones you're
really going to want to upgrade because
they have small hard drives you're going
to want to get a quality Phillips screw
driver because these screws are really
well set in there and you don't want to
strip them which I pretty much did
anyway and then you got to lift this
little panel here this HDD panel that's
your hard drive panel you can use your
fingernail just to flip it up and out of
there and the first thing you're going
to notice is this little blue screw the
blue screw and that's the one that's got
to come out actually pretty
straightforward stuff spin that little
baby out and after you've done that
you're just going to have to slide the
drive over there's a little tab there a
little metallic tab that you can see on
the top you flip it up grab hold of it
and then slide away and just like that
you'll notice a little gap there after
that you can pull it up and out and
you'll notice your old hard drive inside
of this little cage in my case this is a
really old hard drive a 20 gigabyte
drive this was the very basic first ps3
saw really in need of an upgrade as you
guys see there's four screws that are
holding the drive into this cage those
obviously need to be removed so you can
get the drive out of this adapter once
you've done that
you can put this piece of crap 28 off to
the side and grab this new beast the 1tb
beast and slide it the same in the same
fashion back into that cage zip those
four screws back on in and then reverse
the steps slide it down into the ps3 and
then lift that tab and engage and from
there you'll notice that that screw hole
lines back up you want to grab your blue
screw and slide that baby in there and
then put that HDD panel back on the top
it just clips into place very easy very
simple now all you've got left to do is
boot up your ps3 from there it'll ask
you to format the drive I've already
done that you're basically just clicking
yes and then yes and then scroll back
over to that backup utility the exact
same place you were before this time you
want to select restore instead of back
up and this will warn you you're about
to restore everything you click yes and
then from there it's the same deal you
just got to connect your external hard
drive it will ask you to connect it and
then you click ok a couple more times
it'll take a little while depending on
how much data you've got and once that's
all said and done then you can go into
your settings and check how much storage
you now have you see in my case I got a
lot more than I did before there's about
eight hundred and sixteen gigabytes of
free space I don't know why it says
slash 931 I guess that's of 931 so
that's all my game saves and of course
the system data everything that's
necessary so lots of head room to store
whatever I want if you guys do this then
you can do the same thing you can
basically never have to worry about
running out of space again anyway guys
