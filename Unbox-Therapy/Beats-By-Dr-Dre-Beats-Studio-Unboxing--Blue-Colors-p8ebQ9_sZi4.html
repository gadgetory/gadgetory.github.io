therapy and today we're looking at the
beats by dre studios in blue they have
recently been released in a number of
new colors blue orange there's a
metallic version and as with all studios
they're going to get that inline
microphone if you want to use these
headphones with your cell phone or other
device that will allow for microphone
input and that's convenient because it's
kind of hard to find a nice set of
headphones with a inline mic that
doesn't you know stick out like a boom
for a gaming headset or something
now with all Beats products you know
you're going to get a real nice on
boxing experience feels like a high
quality cigar box and inside there's a
lot of stuff that goes with this headset
the first thing you'll notice on the
right is the nice carrying case you're
going to get with it and on the left is
where everything else lives you're going
to get a set of batteries because these
are obviously powered noise cancellation
headphones so you're going to require a
couple of batteries you also get a
couple of high-end monster cables these
actually are real nice upon further
investigation they've got real nice gold
tips one a right-angle connector which I
always like because it's less likely to
get frayed at least in theory there's a
look at that right angle connection
that's that's the part you're going to
want to connect into the device and
there you can see the monster branding
on the outside of course you also got
the inline microphone on one of the
cables if you choose to use it with like
I said before a cell phone the other
cable is lacking the microphone in the
event that you just want to use it with
an audio device like a mp3 player or
something along those lines so there's
that secondary cable that I mentioned
before they've got a couple of velcro
straps if you're not going to be using
them if you want to store them so that's
kind of nice you've also got this inline
adapter for Airlines inline airline and
that's if you're traveling on some
old-school airline that's still using
those and then you've got this quarter
inch adapter for higher-end audio
equipment DJ equipment and so on and so
forth and here's an even closer look at
that particular adapter that baby just
clips on to the pre-existing mini-jack
connector
let just like this and then all of a
sudden you've got a brand-new DJ headset
if you choose to use it that way or even
high-end audio equipment sometimes uses
the quarter-inch connection now the only
thing other thing on the left side here
is the documentation if I can get it up
out of there
you've got turn it up a little catalog
of the different beats products that are
available some of which i've unboxed
definitely check out my channel if you
want to see some of the other beats
products that have been unboxed on here
and some more documentation and of
course a cleaning cloth which is nice
let's get the headphones out and get to
the the product that everyone's been
waiting for I spend a lot of time on the
extras that you got to go through them
so here it is the nice hard carrying
case with a carabiner up top for
clipping it on to stuff I don't know if
I'd want to wear these on the outside of
my bag though a lot of people be hoping
to clip them off of there so you got an
exit around the outside and there's the
headphones themselves now say what you
will about beats by dre is a brand as a
product you can't deny that they make
some of the nicest looking headphones on
the market and now that they're
available in different colors you can
get whatever pair you want to suit your
taste buds and this blue color to me is
one of the most impressive out it's got
that automotive grade paint on there you
can also get a metallic version which I
really do like as well here's that power
switch on the outside of unit as I
mentioned earlier in a video the reason
these are powered is because they use
active outside noise cancellation to
drown out you know noise you don't want
from the outside the materials in use
are real nice got leather some metallic
finishes down here is where the
headphones connect I like having a
removable headphone cable that's because
if if it breaks you can swap it out you
do have that secondary cable and also
when you're traveling it's easier to
keep them untangled when you can just
remove them untag them from both sides
so let's get you even closer to the
headphones here in and around the
appearance after all this is unbox
therapy we try to get you closer than
anybody else and there's a closer look
at that power switch down below the
leather finish and padding on the
interior which feels real nice and after
all these these headphones are a
portable headphone right they fold up
that's one of the main
features when you're traveling on an
airplane or whatever it is that you're
doing when you want to take them off
they just booyah just like that and
that's really one of the main selling
features as far as I'm concerned you
know a lot of other high quality
headphones don't do that so anyway guys
