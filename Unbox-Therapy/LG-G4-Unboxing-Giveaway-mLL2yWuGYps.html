here back with another video and today
we are checking out the brand-new hotly
anticipated super phone from LG this is
the LG g4 but I don't just have one of
these here I've actually got two one -
as you can see that's because one of
these is going to be going back to you
guys a lucky viewer and it's going to be
really easy just make sure you're
subscribed on both my channels that's
right I have two channels this one here
as well as my new top five channel
called more top five subscribe to both
and then leave a comment under this
video
and the latest more top 5 video saying I
want to win the LG g4 or something to do
with the LG g4 so I know what you're
talking about and then I'm just gonna
randomly select somebody and send you a
hot new LG g4 isn't that beautiful
alright so enough about that let's jump
inside this box and take a closer look
at the new LG g4 I don't believe this is
retail packaging it says not for sale on
the side here is the device and as you
can see a very large screen this is a
5.5 inch display also inside the box we
have a charging brick a USB cable and
then a standalone battery that is
because the LG g4 still supports
removable batteries so you can carry a
couple of them isn't that nice looking
at you Samsung but in this case we have
a 3000 milliamp hour battery milliamp
milliamp milla at milliamp which is
pretty big to begin with but the idea of
carrying an extra one and having double
the battery life that is something that
a lot of power-hungry users will be
interested in as I pop the back off here
you'll notice that you also have
expandable storage so you can put a
micro SD card in and double your storage
triple your storage might as well go
ahead and install the battery might have
a little charge we shall find out now
the device has a slight curve to it but
it's not nearly as significant as the
curve on the G flex and kind of make
that out there just a subtle curve
G stands for lucky gold star so as you
know LG is famous for putting the
controls on the back of the device this
is right where your index finger is
going to live when you're holding it you
have up-down as well as your power
switch the camera is also in this
location along with your flash on the
bottom of the device you have your USB
charge port as well as a microphone and
a headphone jack now the front of the
device is occupied by this gigantic
piece of Gorilla Glass 3 as well as this
nice 5.5 inch IPS display with a
resolution of 2560 by 1440 for an
effective pixel density of 538 PPI that
comes stock with three gigs of RAM and
32 gigabytes of storage but that
expansion slot is going to allow you to
take that up to 128 gigabytes plus the
internal storage
now while the device is booting up let's
take a moment to talk about this new
camera this is a 16 megapixel shooter
with both phase detection and laser
autofocus some of the samples I've seen
out of this so far have been quite
amazing it can also shoot 4k video at 30
frames per second or 1080p video with
optical image stabilization one more
thing to mention while we're on the back
of the device as you can see this is a
plastic back with a ceramic looking
finish and you can see it's in this gray
tone but the g4 is available in a
variety of different colors and finishes
for the back including a unique new
leather one in like four or five
different colors now the forward facing
camera on the g4 is no slouch either
capable of 1080p video recording at
30fps and also eight megapixel stills
it's about time that these
forward-facing cameras have caught up to
the rear-facing ones with all the video
conferencing and whatnot and of course
selfie taking I know you're taking
selfies if you're using a nice camera
like this go ahead and take those
selfies what's the average see
acceptable number of selfies first
impressions with this screen it is
beautiful very vivid colors are nice
here you're getting a ton of contrast
here of course a ton of pixel density as
well and it's an IPS panel
you can't go wrong so the camera app is
pretty well developed here many settings
available sixteen by nine HD are on
automatic mode you have grid if you want
it dual shot so you can take a shot
yourself
and what you're looking at it's like a
more developed selfie booyah
I should do a quick test on this selfie
camera for quality go there you go so
much selfie can you handle all this
selfie
neither gonna either get it okay so for
the sake of a quick comparison form
factor wise I have the new g4 on the
left here followed by the galaxy s6 edge
standard galaxy s6 and then an iPhone 6
so as you can tell it sort of scales up
and we're right in that wheelhouse for
the perfect phone size as you can see
here is the s6 in my hand that's how it
fits and then moving up to the g4 still
fits quite nicely now let's go ahead and
stack these up in order to gauge the
thickness of each make a little phone
sandwich right here of course if the
edge of the device is not always a great
way to inspect the thickness because
many of them taper off pretty comparable
amongst these four devices I think the
decision here is going to come down to
whether or not you can use the
expandability or you want the
expandability in your device and if
you're looking for the biggest screen
you get without having a phone that
requires two-handed use for everything
lastly camera as you know the camera on
the s6 and s6 edge is a really great
performer and this one is very very
close it's going to take some strict
testing in order to figure out which one
is better but I think you probably can't
go wrong on either anyway that's my
unboxing and first impression of the
brand new LG g4 don't forget I've got an
extra one for one of you guys as I
mentioned earlier really simple make
sure you're subscribed to both my
channels links will be down in the
description to both of those and leave a
comment on my latest video saying hey
Lou I want to win an LG g4 and you might
just win one I'll announce the winner on
Twitter so also make sure you're
