in a while it's in the comment section
I'm publishing videos people are like Lu
where is the K 20 probe the red meat K
20 pro people telling me it's the next
polka phone it's kind of crazy action
when you look at the spec list and then
you look at the price Snapdragon e55
top-tier chipset 4000 milliamp hour
battery full screen display AMOLED
pop-up camera you're like okay I hear
you I hear you this thing when you do a
conversion the starting price 360
dollars now quickly I should tell you
available in China first India next so
keep that in mind if you're in North
America you may have to import this
thing but that's a crazy spec list when
converted to the North American price as
far as I'm concerned now my version is
the top spec version which is a few more
dollars than 360s you can see on the
side this one is 8 gigs of ram and 256
gigs of storage starts at 6 gigs ram
smaller storage and that's what you get
for the 360 USD we have a case as well
to get you up and running it's a it's a
pretty simple I guess it's a little
nicer than simple sometimes you just get
that like plasticy clear case the TPU
case this one is thinner so I'd be more
likely to use that than the typical
freebee case that you get really crazy
pattern on it look at that I mean that's
the first time we see no that's like
some Game of Thrones thing right well
that's Targaryen so will he do he's the
in-house Game of Thrones expert and he
claims this is inspired by Game of
Thrones when it comes to differentiation
it's not enough to just be a color now
you've got to have color shifts and and
crazy sandblasting going on and this is
just the latest version of it this gives
you a look at the camera module as well
you have a 48 megapixel camera in there
same sensor Sony sensor same sensor as
the 1 plus 7 Pro and then a couple of
other modules including an ultra-wide
which that's a must for me something at
the 1 plus 7 Pro doesn't have a
headphone jack still on the device and
this also gives you a glance at the
pop-up camera that's because it's a full
display AMOLED and this is motorized
gonna pop up bottom of the device gives
you your SIM tray as well as your USB
type-c connector
and it's quick charge as well I believe
it's 27 watts I think I looked it up 27
watt quick charge okay very nice to have
let's go ahead and see if it has any
power okay so as I mentioned Xiaomi
device so me UI 10 pre-installed we
should do a quick comparison actually
with the 1 plus 7 Pro all right so both
AMOLED that's the main thing that's kind
of what you're looking for of course
that gives you the rich tones and the
dark blacks I should also mention on the
oneplus around the edge the glass curves
you don't get that on the K 20 Pro but
these two devices even though the specs
are quite similar the price is not now
as I mentioned before it's running me UI
so for me that's a bit foreign that's
not my typical operating system I'm more
of a stock Android or close to stock
Android guy and since I've been using
the 7 Pro it's been crazy quick there's
almost no animation in there in fact you
can turn it off completely but just by
default it's hardly there so I'm
probably not gonna be an immediate fan
of this UI comparatively but it does
feel relatively snappy at the moment and
let's check out the pop-up camera pop-up
camera so that's a lot for your money
it's actually kind of insane that that
set of features has now trickled down to
that price point this is just common now
all right let's try a selfie while we're
here and okay we are fully in beard hair
territory lots of contrast which is what
I look for as well as not blowing out
the brightness on a cheek here another
thing that I'm looking forward a
front-facing camera that said look how
black the black is it blends right into
the unused portion of the display the
black of my shirt I'm gonna try HDR in
this one Auto so it's obviously very hot
once again and there's not much you can
do about it this is a very bright
environment to shoot photos in but the
detail is there Amanda beard hairs are
there and again this is a kind of wild
that we're talking about anything
comparable to a flagship type of
performance in something that's nowhere
near that price point starting at 360
alright let's try the rear camera
so this is at 1x no HDR 2x no HDR ultra
wide we got to get my hand out of the
way so that's point six ultra wide that
rounds out your three different options
so this being the widest as you can see
it's an incredible frame I think it
should be sufficient for what most
people are looking for when they take a
wide shot and as I move through that's
your zoom that's pretty nice actually
quite detailed is only a 2x zoom so keep
that in mind nothing no crazy reach no
hybrid no 10x like the Oppo device I
featured recently or anything like the
p30 pro standard out the gate
there's your zoom there's your ultra
wide triple camera setup unbelievable
360 bucks next up let's give the
speakers a quick check that's a must
let's try some loo later first the
titles that are gonna be available on
stadia for those of you that have been
following along this of course is
Google's new gaming service yesterday's
show we speculated on what Google was
gonna say today particularly in
relationship to price expect it for
stadia it turns out the pricing is a bit
more complicated than we had imagined so
I would say volume is similar the k20
Pro may cut through a little more but
Jack just mentioned it could also be
perceived as tenure I also hear more low
mid low low-end kind of frequency in the
oneplus device but honestly I'd say
they're kind of comparable neither them
sound amazing
I might take away like considering the
price differences to each their own I
mean you guys heard it I guess you can
kind of try to decide for yourself but
like it's not a big difference three
different price points represented and
I'm like men the audio is very close
okay so let's go ahead and test out the
in screen fingerprint reader real quick
here so it works like those other
optical image based fingerprint scanners
rotate your finger around you try to get
the scan in now let's go ahead and test
that out all right it's about the same
it's fast enough I don't mind the look
of the animation there I turned it off
on this device on the 7 Pro I just
turned it off so it just takes me
straight in little race here three two
one you can see it feels faster on the
oneplus but here's the thing I keep
referencing and comparing this device to
the oneplus device like as if they are
completely targeted at one another and
while they are there are obviously
different price points you could almost
get two of these that's a lot of value
it's a ton of value this has so many
elements from a hardware perspective
that make the oneplus 7 pro special
there they're sitting in here at a much
lower price point if you can look past
the skin which might not be to your
taste at least for me in the North
American market I'm I'm sure people in
China completely used to me UI and
they're happy with in their gonna use
this in and so forth but me I like to
have the app drawer you know I like to
have something closer to a stock Android
experience it's just more where my head
is at but if you think about this from
the standpoint of like okay I'm gonna
put my own launcher on anyways now it
becomes hard to justify spending the
extra cash on the oneplus I get it it's
a bigger display the fit and finish is
probably step above with the curved
glass going around the edge the brand
name here in this market specifically
but then you make the argument towards
this one where you're like yo maybe you
want a slightly smaller form factor
maybe you want to have a headphone jack
and all of a sudden you're like hmm both
have the same chipset both have the same
battery inside
it's like that's becomes it becomes a
difficult choice to make especially
price considered so 360 bucks of course
this is just an unboxing video you know
I'm just looking at this thing for the
first time I'm just popping off the
cameras for the first time for me the
finish being glossy I mean that's gonna
be up to your own individual taste I'm
starting to feel like this might be the
value champion I'm starting to feel like
this can be tough to beat
I just keep referencing that price I
feel like people in North America we
don't get enough exposure to this type
of value it's hard to imagine that in
other parts of the world people are
getting all this for that money it's
like a whole different spectrum of
discussion when you get into the price
conversation and that's what happened
with the polka phone last time around is
it was like man we need to adjust our
perspectives on how we're evaluating
this stuff cuz it's no longer just pay
does it have the spec list I'm looking
for it's also how does it match up
price-wise because so many things have
the spec list you're looking for now
this one included so for me for the time
being my sim is gonna stay in the 1 plus
7 pro I'm not finished with it yet I
want to use it a little bit longer but
it's starting to look like I might pop
it in here next that's a crazy value
starting at 360 USD that is the redmi K
20 pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
