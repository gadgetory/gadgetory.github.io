therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Nexus 4 wireless charger now this
thing was announced a long time ago at
the same time that the phone was
announced but they're just getting
around to shipping these out to users
right now I finally got mine and I'm
pretty excited I mean it seems kind of
strange it's just a charger but I've
been a big fan of wireless charging for
a long time not necessarily because I
think it's such a big deal like I have
to have it or anything like that but I
think it's a good idea to push
technology into this direction I mean I
can picture all kinds of enabled
surfaces in the future you know you can
have your desk enabled or something like
that so we can finally get away from all
these damn microUSB cables and having to
remember to keep your device's charged
that's a big deal for me especially when
I have so many devices I'm carrying
around and believe it or not the Nexus 4
doesn't have the greatest battery life
so any incentive to charge it to place
it down on an active surface is good for
me so in terms of the unboxing it's
pretty much what you expect you're gonna
have a micro USB cable that goes into
the charger the charger itself of course
isn't Wireless just the portion between
the phone and the charger did I make any
sense well I'm gonna show you what I
mean in a second here so this little orb
here is special it's special in the
sense that there really hasn't been a
wireless charger quite like it for a
while I guess the touchstone that came
with the palm products was the last
thing that was similar to this one
there's also the wall plug that's
included so the micro USB cable it plugs
into the female micro USB port on the
back of the orb this thing actually kind
of reminds me of the Nexus Q at least
partially it also less round or
spherical if you will the front side
actually has a kind of sticky surface to
it so I'm a little worried things might
stick to it it's not sticky like glue
but just a little bit tacky and I assume
that the reason here is so that your
phone doesn't slide off of it when
you're charging it the Nexus 4 obviously
has that glass back as you'll see right
here making it a good fit for the type
of surface material that's on the new
wireless charger now that being said the
wireless charger is she enabled so it
may or may not work with other Qi
enabled handsets like the new Lumia for
example or others so you just have to
try that out and see for yourself if
that's gonna function if that's gonna
work
this is not a cheap wireless charger I
do have to tell you but it does have
some added functionality that I really
like and most of it comes from the form
factor that means that you can place the
phone down and be charging it but still
have access to the device and still use
it on your desk in a kind of in a way
that makes more sense than having it lie
flat like another wireless charger that
I also have on my desk which is a more
generic one from LG so anyways as you
can tell here it's all about the angle
you get this nice little angle to work
with so if you want to read your tweets
if you want to answer a phone call if
you want to even type out an email or
something like that you can do so and as
you can see the phone doesn't budge at
all you do have a fairly secure fit and
I don't know if the adhesive on the
actual charger overtime is gonna become
less sticky but I'm pretty excited about
it right now I'm not a hundred percent
sure if this is gonna live on my desk or
on my nightstand but I'm a big fan of
these things so this one is $59.99 so
it's a little bit pricey but if you're
looking for a wireless charger there are
cheaper options available so I'll link
those down in the description you can
check out all the information there is
to know on wireless chargers anyway guys
thanks as always for watching be sure to
leave a thumbs up down below if you
enjoyed this content as it does help out
a bunch and we'll catch you guys on the
