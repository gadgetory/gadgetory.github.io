coffee enthusiast I build you know one I
drink a lot of coffee
in fact and sometimes you know when it's
hot out and so on I want to switch it up
I want to go for an iced coffee I'm a
big I'm a big iced coffee but here's the
thing when you're out you go to the
Starbucks and so on it's really simple
you just order the iced coffee at all
coffee iced seems straightforward turns
out not straightforward try to make iced
coffee at home all right try to take
your hot coffee and turn it into iced
coffee because if you just add ice to
your hot coffee that just becomes watery
lukewarm coffee it's disgusting and of
course it's because the ice just dilutes
the coffee cuz the coffee is too hot
coming out of the machine that's where
this thing comes in I love coffee you
love coffee and now we can do our own
iced coffee
with the hyper chiller a very simple
little device that will chill your
coffee make it ready for ice without the
ice what excuse me okay let's explain so
it fits right into most single cup
brewers and has a deep lid for easy use
with any traditional method save time
okay sure I don't have to go to the
coffee shop I get it they say it'll pay
for itself in two weeks
it's a high-capacity 12.5 ounce cooling
chamber where the ice is separated from
your beverage by two layers of stainless
steel this gives you zero dilution of
the coffee itself or whatever beverage
that you put inside of here think of all
the beverages you add ice to to end up
diluted that you could pour in here
alcoholic beverages that you would
normally want to be cold you have a warm
beer you need to cool it down right
quick you dump it in there you're good
to go
whatever your beverage put it in the
hyper chiller you could cool hot coffee
by up to 130 plus degrees in 60 seconds
we're gonna test that of course chill
whiskey wine and iced tea all without
dilution and it's dishwasher safe all
right cool how has this thing not come
into my life okay ooh that's a that's a
mug right there you pop the top off like
this oh and that's the magic does this
come off now oh I think it does okay
look at that another chamber oh this one
comes off - holy smokes Wow would you
look at that okay so step one you fill
this up with water there's a mark on
that there then you fill up the larger
stainless steel top here and then the
two of them get twisted back on and then
the two of them go in here and you
freeze the whole package in fact this
device will just live in your freezer
and on that note let's fill this baby up
get it frozen and see if I can have a
nice coffee in one minute let's go okay
so I have the coffee machine here it's
an espresso this could be a Keurig could
even be some some old-school style drip
coffee it doesn't matter now
I have some ice here if you think you're
just gonna go ahead and add ice so hot
coffee let's go ahead and brew one of
these and I'll show you
see the ice
getting gobbled up
Wow when you see that in this press Oh
in a glass I mean let's be honest that
ice is already gone that ice is gone
isn't it look I put a giant chunk of ice
in there it's just it's melted in there
they're gonna melt so fast because of
how hot the substance is all you're
gonna get is watery lukewarm coffee it's
no good trust me I've tried this in the
past you have to take this and put it in
the fridge for a while before it was
cold enough to then add ice to it nobody
has time so ain't nobody got time for
that Jack you know that's true
everybody got to have today still super
hot to the touch and if I try to drink
it still hot still hot on my lips that's
not a nice coffee
it's no good now the question is does
the hyper chill work I have it here
look it's frozen it's sat in the freezer
now when you go to use this dingo just
you'll pluck it out the coffee will be
made right into the top here let's go
ahead we'll put another coffee in here
so I'm making around 8 ounces right now
and that will chill out in about one
minute according to the document here
and check that out jack we're making our
Nespresso straight into the hyper chill
the smell of fresh coffee you know
almost 403 at 4:04 I'm gonna pour this
into this glass right here now they
recommend you pour it over ice if it's
just hot coffee on the ice it'll melt
the ice instantly so the hope here is
that the ice remains frozen even after
I've poured the coffee on top of it 60
seconds for a small or medium coffee
swirling it can expedite the cooling
process and of course they have the
times listed here for wine and spirits
also okay cool we're there we're gonna
pour it in it's the moment of truth
mmm would you look at that that's like
Starbucks caliber iced coffee right
there unmelted cold to the touch in my
hands mmm-hmm
that thing is the real deal that's a
game-changer oh my goodness I might
switch over completely tight forget
about hot cop who needs it it's a summer
exceeds my expectation Wow we open it up
check that out
Wow solid ice and then this chamber on
the inside the stainless steel that's
what the coffee passes through and
around now what do I do with this
every so often rinse it out chuck it
back in the freezer it's ready to go for
the next morning afternoon evening

beverage like this Jack you're gonna
