therapy and today we're looking at the
MacBook Pro 15 inch this is the 2011
model with the quad core processor at
2.2 gigahertz and the upgraded graphics
card I was looking at some benchmarks on
Geekbench and I personally felt that
this was the best cost to performance
ratio considering the scores it achieves
it's about twice as fast as my previous
generation iMac and for a laptop that's
pretty impressive in fact this is faster
than most of the current generation imax
2 so this is really truly a mobile
workstation maybe more so than any
MacBook Pro before it but let's talk
about the unboxing because that's what
you're all here for first we got the
MacBook Pro and then our power extension
cable the same as we've received with
MacBooks and MacBook Pros for many years
they get your power prongs and this
little portion clips on to the AC brick
itself now here is the MagSafe adapter
and right now it's got the shorter
little contraption on the end as opposed
to the extension let's see if I can get
this plastic off apparently I've never
unboxed anything before hello Ridge
where are you there we go so anyway this
is pretty self-explanatory it's an 85
watt the Mac books use a 60 watts so
they are not interchangeable although
you could use an 85 watt on a macbook so
you can use the more powerful adapter
backwards but you can't use the other
one forwards I should say so here is a
little bit of documentation we got
everything Mac which is basically a
QuickStart guide a little bit of a
manual and next we've got everything
else which is our restored discs etc
unlike the MacBook Air we're getting
traditional discs bummer and we get a
cleaning cloth because this thing has
the stock glossy screen so that's going
to come in handy now let's see if we got
better luck taking this cellophane like
wrap off of the laptop itself let's go
ahead and bust that seal I guess I own
it now listen unless someone doesn't
want to pay that crazy Apple Store
restocking fee so it's pretty much what
you'd expect if you've handled any of
these unibody models you know what
they're all about I mean it's not too
light but then again when you consider
the power it's well worth it
we got a little bit of a charge I have
phone jack we've got a microphone jack
SD card a couple of us B's Thunderbolt
firewire 800 Gigabit Ethernet and our
Meg safe adapter the other side has our
Kensington lock and our super Drive of
course we got that new HD camera up top
and let's go ahead and check out the
virgin boot now this is gonna be you
know slower probably just because it's
the very first time and not really
booting into the OS but instead just
into the installation procedure but I'm
probably gonna swap in an SSD and move
the traditional hard drive over to the
optical drive bay I'll probably make a
video of it so you guys know what I'm
talking about but I don't use the
optical drive too much and I'd much
rather get the speed associated with an
SSD while keeping that 750 gig drive for
media etc so here we can see it thinking
about to say hello to us for the first
time here we go we got the beautiful
leopard colors coming right up hopefully
we'll get lying in a little bit and I'll
load that on here too</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
