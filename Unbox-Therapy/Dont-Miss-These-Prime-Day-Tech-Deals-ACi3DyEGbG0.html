tech heads it's prime day while prime
day it starts at 9 p.m. I'm not sure it
feels like it's starting earlier than
usual I'm gonna kick it off with some of
my favorite deals that are coming up for
prime day starting at 9 p.m. so you
could be prepared and have a few
different products on your radar if
you're not a prime member there's
actually a 30-day free trial so you
really have no excuse I'll put that link
at the top of the description to all the
products I'm gonna talk about they'll be
below that one but here are 10 products
and I think you should keep your eye on
for prime day they're all gonna have
deals
ok so product number one I featured this
thing a long time of this is this
thing's a lot of fun a beanie a toque
whatever you want to call it that allows
you to play music in it there's
headphones in the Hat and it's blue - so
it's wireless you actually do charge the
Hat up I made a video on this a while
back you could even do one here see that
so I could be having a conversation a
jack I'd like to have a coffee please
I don't want any sugar in it it's
actually surprising how functional it is
look at this person - jogging over here
you're into snowboarding or skiing or
something like that you put this thing
on the headphones are built into the
beanie at first it looks like a gimmick
but it actually works it actually
functions pretty well and you can tell
from the reviews on Amazon they backed
up that sentiment now it says that it's
on sale right now for $20 off or 33% off
when the prime day Deal kicks in it's
gonna go even lower than that and I know
that because this product and the
remaining products are all listed in the
prime day section with deals starting at
9 p.m. so it's $40 now it's gonna be
even less - check this one out
ok next up this detachable Universal
charging dock we use this thing in the
office I've even featured something like
this in a video previously as well all
your gadgets with a nice little hole I
need my iPad right now boom today it's
all about the s7 edge Oh a nice
organized way to charge up all of your
devices you can see they have the image
here with three iPhones and an iPad but
the universal USB ports there you could
be charging up Android devices anything
that charges over USB and then you have
one single power
or going to your power outlet and in the
case of this one the little dividers are
removable depending on the size of the
gadgets you want to put in there
very simple little organizational gadget
it's 30 bucks so it was already
discounted as of right now that's gonna
go even further
once Prime day kicks in at 9:00 p.m.
next up we have a really practical thing
once again these are called ear hooks I
actually have some of them sitting over
here ear hooks these are designed for
Apple earpods
or air pods the purpose here is to get a
far better fit I know a lot of people
with ear pods is that are nervous about
them falling out and then losing them
you know you're moving around you're
bouncing around myself I like to play
basketball what if I want to have the
air pot in it gets nudged it falls out I
lose the air pot they're expensive so
these ear hooks give you a much tighter
fit now these things are already
inexpensive they're $9.99 so when I saw
them in the prime day category there I
was like how much how do you discount
beyond $9.99 but I'm guessing there's
gonna be a few bucks off maybe there's
six bucks seven bucks who knows if you
have air pods or ear pods these could
give you a far better fit
next up sticking on the subject of
wireless earphones these ones here are
very similar in fact I think they're
kind of like a generic rebrand of a
wireless earphone that I featured quite
recently
oh it's helpful it's a nice fit though
too maybe a little less isolating I'd
say what about the sound they're also
gonna go on sale now I was surprised at
the sound quality of these things when I
did the video I did they were under $10
now when I featured them in the original
video they sold out instantly at the $10
price points I think the price went up
and now with the prime they deal maybe
it'll come back down you can even see
here certain colors are at 13 versus 16
dollars depending if you're looking for
a pair of workout earbuds these could be
the way to go fully Wireless next up
we've got this USB C hub I've been using
this exact model for a while now on the
MacBook Pro because as you know it only
has these four USB sea ports you're kind
of limited with all the other
peripherals you might want to use
flashing have you at this point solved
the biggest problem with the new MacBook
simply by adding this dongle I guess so
so this one right here is 59 bucks
regular again listed as a prime date
deal so you know it's gonna drop below
that very soon you've got to have one of
these if you have a MacBook Pro and you
want a greater diversity and the ports
available to you this one's got three
USB s an HDMI port and also an SD card
slot you might not be such a huge fan of
dongles but I'm telling you if you get a
new MacBook Pro you will be in a tight
situation at a certain point we're like
I just need that port right now and you
don't have it so this is a way to get it
I'm hoping that you see a substantial
discount on this 60 bucks but again keep
your eye on that link in the description
9 p.m.
check this thing out ok next up this is
one that I featured recently a really
cool retro keyboard from Ezio the MK
retro ooh it does a little dance just to
let you know it's booting up you can see
it's discounted right now 299 dollars
now this is that typewriter style
keyboard to create a certain type of
ambience if you just want a really
unique look mechanical key switches
I've actually been impressed with these
guys keyboards in general I'm using one
on my desk right now they're inexpensive
adjustable mechanical keyboards and this
one has a ton of attitude if you're
looking for something different the MK
retro this is a no-brainer right here
you've heard of these guys this is the
anchor power core you've heard of anchor
this is a big boy guys no joke right
there stick it in your backpack look at
that guy incredible reviews incredible
prices this is one of their most popular
it's 10,000 milliamp hour unit and of
course it's got the quick charge
built-in they claim there's 20 million
plus of these units out in the wild so
that just goes to show you how dominant
these guys are in the game three and a
half extra charges on an iPhone for
example you can see some of the other
numbers listed right there depending on
the type of device you have I mean who
doesn't want a little bit of extra juice
next up we have the M Pal bluetooth
receiver you might have like an old
vehicle for example that doesn't have
Bluetooth built into it you want to have
the benefits of being able to link your
phone
wirelessly to your car stereo well this
thing right here does that for you you
can see the mini jack connector on it
it's very small you plug this in and all
of a sudden any auxiliary audio
equipment becomes Bluetooth capable this
is the easiest way to do it it's like 13
bucks as I said earlier it's a
no-brainer we have well it's just a
cable it's kind of boring to be honest
but this one the nonde Zeus is a really
durable cable in fact if you look at the
image over here reinforced with aramid
fiber for superior strength they claim
you can like swing off this thing don't
do that I'm not recommending that you do
it it's military-grade it has like a
lifetime warranty this guy's not happy
with his cable of course
so he's upgrading over here yeah look at
that fifteen thousand bends
15100 bends
it's listed at 20 it's in the prime day
deals so it's gonna drop the beyond that
if you don't have an iPhone they do make
it for a couple of other devices as well
so check that out okay so for the last
product we have the lumetri time Wi-Fi
clock the way I use this thing you'll
probably remember the video is as a
social media information - this thing's
really cool you can program it to do a
number of different things oh we need
something more pleasant than that sound
there you go it's not just a clock it
can do the temperature outside it's got
a little speaker it can play music it
can it can show off your social media
metrics go check out this video if you
want more information on this product
maybe it drops to a price that people
are attracted to now but expect to see a
price drop from the $1.99 maybe to
something that's more manageable that's
gonna be up to you so there you have it
