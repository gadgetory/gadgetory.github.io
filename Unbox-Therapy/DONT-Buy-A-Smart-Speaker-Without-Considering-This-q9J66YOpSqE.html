different Bluetooth speakers and my love
for Bluetooth speakers it goes back
along the way I bumped into many
Bluetooth speakers from Ultimate Ears I
think I've tested them all in fact this
is their new one the mega blast with
Amazon Alexa so they have put Amazon
Alexa into their products now so what
does that mean for you well you can ask
things slay Road Trip playlists turn up
the volume it's waterproof ip67 that's
kind of important claim up to 16 hours
of battery life they sent this over to
power up charged up every single time I
reach for a Bluetooth speaker that I
haven't used in a while it's dead so
having this dock not only gives you a
way of ensuring that your portable
speaker is always charged but it also
gives it a home Oh fancy artwork there
look at that's cool look at this guy his
head is potato chips whoo very nice it
seems a bit bigger than the mega boom
what does this do
pull down on this section to charge it
up or what do you think you've popped
the whole thing off to use the charge
base right if you replace bottom hook
here with this one that comes with the
charge dot see here
oh wow so you can just leave that on
there all the time you get home BAM
you're charging flat style microUSB
cable power brick whoo
now in order to use the alexa
functionality obviously this thing's
gonna have to connect to the internet so
I'm gonna get the app for that component
uno momento por favor Alexa play 90s
hip-hop here's a station for 90s hip-hop
music 90's hip hop from Amazon music hip
hop tell me a joke what did the penguin
wear to the prom nothing can you laugh
sure I can laugh are you part of the CIA
no I work for Amazon well I'm glad to
know what's your favorite movie Edward
Scissorhands is fantastic and
bittersweet I guess for some being
semi-human doesn't always cut it oh it
was a joke as well set volume two three
well I suggested a volume I saw two
volume go down on my phone rap for me
connect sink link all the pieces of your
life I get it done at the speed of Wi-Fi
I'm the player the coach the arena in
the game if you want something done you
just gotta say my name let's do the
sound
Oh
yeah ryan hasn't been in town for a
little while so just give the man a
little love please you know what do you
think about the speaker dude nah it's
sounded pretty good
oh yeah oh you're not impressed no no
III mean sweet this has to be plugged in
it's a daughter just a doll I thought it
was dog
I thought you could charge this and then
bring this RIT not a battery man just a
dock okay on the road you would like to
just do like this this okay you're about
to leave for your trip kibou yeah you go
yeah you got 60 now this is plug in
somewhere in your house
it's a dock yeah a dark that's plugged
in them all docks are plug okay what's
an AA plugged in bumfuck I thought this
was some kind of way I get it Wireless
from this so this goes it's like I like
a wireless charger all right well I'm
not is savvy easy when it comes I don't
know man you strike me as quite savvy I
saw the moves earlier they look like
savvy dancing those look like some savvy
moves to me both the heads durable got
some bass to it portable enough now it
can substitute as a smart speaker you
can skip your smart speaker it's a
package you got a number of things and
there's one piece of equipment that sits
in your house boom both I like this now
now there you are there you are right
but we try their yard there you are
actually the echo where we really guy
Alexa and then you want to go keep going
the part I love it that's what I'm
talking about
Oh
this episode of unboxing is brought to
you by the crave plus external battery
charger featuring micro USB in type-c in
and out and quick charge 3.0 this is a
10,000 milliamp hour unit and that's
pretty slim actually I like how they put
the LED indicators on the side so you
can check your charge on a bottom side
you can see the micro USB in the type
seat in and out and the QC 3.0 port a
charge cable to charge the brick up
itself now one thing I like about the
design of this unit is its kind of the
exact thickness and shape of a
smartphone and the reason that's a good
thing if you do want to carry this in
your pocket while it's charging up your
phone you can kind of stack the two of
them together and look at that it's the
exact same size as my pixel to excel as
opposed to a battery bank that has a
more squared-off design you get a nice
slender 10,000 milliamp hour battery the
crave plus check it out I'll put a link
down in the description you can get it
on Amazon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
