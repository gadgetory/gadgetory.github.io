that dream of course is a notch list
future notch lists that seems strange a
strange word isn't even a word we talked
so much recently about all these notches
on smartphones some people don't mind
them
some people hate them but there is one
player in the game that has remained not
less and that is Samsung they've been
reluctant to adopt that type of design
and if you've looked at their recent
products s9s 9 plus note 9 you notice
there's still a traditional bezel
housing speaker housing from facing
cameras and maintaining a rectangular
frame so you can watch video without a
knotch
and not be distracted by it now
regardless of whether or not the knotch
is a big deal or bothers you a lot kind
of have to admit it if there was a way
to put the various sensors that you need
on the front of your phone if there was
a way to put them under the display that
would be a good thing there's been so
many different implementations and
potential implementations of how this
could happen the Oppo find X where it's
like a motorized thing that comes up in
the back the vivo necks which put like a
little cube with the front-facing camera
that came up but those were motorized
and required mechanical components
people were nervous that brings me to
today's video we have some evidence that
Samsung is at work that Samsung may very
well be the first manufacturer to
deliver on this promise of a bezel is
phone without the notch compromised will
it be the s10 will it be a future
version not a hundred percent certain
but I do have an article here from my
friend at Forbes Gordon Kelly Samsung
suddenly exposes radical new Galaxy
smartphones so there's a gadget leaker
out there ice universe and he managed to
get inside of a Samsung event at the
Marriott hotel in Shenzhen there were
some slides they were showing at this
event kind of exposing some of the
technology they're working on for future
products the first fod that is the
fingerprint technology under the screen
a fingerprint scanner
that lives in the location at the lower
end of the screen so you just you touch
the visual part of the screen and it
will read your fingerprint through the
display but Samsung is going to take a
different approach for how they
implemented they're expected to use
ultrasonic pulses which could use
reverberation to build a complex 3d map
of the users fingerprint that's quite a
bit different than the implementation as
it stands right now the in display
fingerprint scanners that I've used
those are optical they're taking an
image of your finger and those ones are
a little bit less secure for that reason
so if Samsung is successful with this
implementation it should be more secure
than what's out there right now
next up ups under screen sensor
including camera technology so you could
have some kind of ambient light sensor
and also potentially a forward facing
camera right underneath the screen a
chori touch sensitive technology this is
a type of haptic feedback that's
supposed to be different than what we've
seen up until this point it's better at
creating the actual sensation of a
physical touch or a physical button and
lastly s o D that is screen sound
technology this is how you get around
having to have forward-facing speakers
speaker for the earpiece in this
scenario the display itself the glass
would be emitting audio as this stands
this is just a slide from an event which
was intended for industry people and it
could just be evidence of an eventual
outcome it could just be it could just
point in the direction that we're all
assuming that Samsung would be working
on something like this or it could be a
lot more immediate this could
potentially come out in the next
generation or the following generation
of Galaxy products I think the fact that
Samsung has been so reluctant to adopt
the knotch is the important thing to
consider here as every other
manufacturer has modernized their design
by including the nuts Samsung's been
sitting back watching waiting maybe
there's a reason for that maybe that's
because they're further along
with this new technology then we might
be aware of at this point I have to say
from my point of view I'm excited I am
personally not a notch fan you guys all
know this and it doesn't matter which
brand the notch is coming from I got I
have equal hate for all notches of all
kinds so for those of you on my pixel
video that were like you didn't talk
enough about them I promise you I
disabled the notch on my pixel through
developer options I don't like the
iPhone notch and so on so this product
here if Samsung can make it relatively
soon it's right up my alley that's
interesting all scream all display
without the compromise now Samsung is
the right company for the job because
Samsung is responsible for the displays
that are in your favorite mobile device
they're making displays for Apple for
the iPhone they're making displays for
Google for the pixel so if anybody could
create a transparent display capable of
having a camera for facing camera hidden
underneath it it would be them and they
should be first because they're making
the tech they're making the hardware
where they may have weaknesses in the
software department having to just put
Android on there and then their own skin
on top of it they don't have those
weaknesses in hardware no they call the
shots in hardware so if someone can do
it right it's probably Samsung and it
looks like they're already working on it
so if you're a notch hater like myself
you might not have to be without an
option for very long let's hope that
this development happens sooner than
later all I have to say is thank
goodness somebody's working on it
we may have a notch list future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
