another video this one is specifically
targeted at owners of the iPhone 4 4 s
or 5 where pretty much anybody that's
looking to upgrade to the next
generation of iPhone products if you've
been living under a rock you may not
have heard that on the 10th of September
Apple will be launching two brand new
devices the 5s and the 5c and the rumors
right now are that the products will
actually be commercially available
towards the end of the month on
September the 20th what does this mean
for you the owner of a previous
generation it means that the private
market is about to be flooded with old
generation devices and that means the
value of your old iPhone is going to be
dropping significantly as we get closer
to that date of September the 20th and
then it'll drop even further after the
20th so this video here is to give you
some ideas on what to do with your old
device leading up to the launch of a new
one and there are a couple of options I
want to start out with the most obvious
one that's to sell your device privately
to a friend to a family member or on
something like Craigslist where you meet
a person locally and sell your device
that way now there are benefits and
drawbacks to this particular strategy of
course the benefits are you will likely
get the most money this way you will
likely get the money the fastest
hopefully but there are some drawbacks
too which are you have to meet somebody
you've never met before for a cash
transaction some people are
uncomfortable with that and of course
you have to have the time to go out and
do that now if you're a busy person like
myself that might not necessarily work
out so well the next option is something
that's been recently announced from
Apple in which they will actually buy
back your old device right in store I
believe this is being beta tested in a
number of stores right now but it has
been confirmed there are articles where
you can read about this although there
is one major criticism here even though
this is probably the easiest method
since you're gonna be in the Apple Store
anyways or you might be in the Apple
Store anyways it also rewards you with
the least amount of money people are
getting somewhere in the neighborhood of
two hundred and fifty dollars for an
iPhone 5 that doesn't sound so great and
you know that you can get more money for
that using other methods now there is a
method that fits right in between the
two that I've already talked about it's
called next worth this is a site where
you can trade in not just iPhones also a
number of other smart
devices gaming devices etc but what you
do here is you just head over to the
website I'll put a link down in the
description and then you put in your
device answer a couple of very quick
questions and they will immediately give
you a quote right off the top so this
strategy may be the best of both worlds
giving you a little bit more money than
what Apple is offering up but providing
a little bit more security than just
meeting somebody randomly through
Craigslist or otherwise doing the cash
transaction regardless of which method
you choose to use in order to sell your
old device and get some value for it I
recommend you do it quickly as mentioned
earlier in this video you will see the
value of your old device plummet as
these new ones get launched so consider
this video a bit of a warning lastly
I've got a cool opportunity for you guys
to win some brand new technology
including a 60-inch flat panel TV and
complete home theater setup this is
courtesy of HH greg in conjunction with
Samsung they're celebrating the launch
of a brand new app it's actually a game
on iOS Android and Kindle it's called
endless blitz and it's a football game
actually pretty fun you should
definitely check it out but it has that
added perk of giving you the opportunity
to win some cool stuff and the download
is completely free I'll have the links
down in the description so not only is
there a 60 inch 3d TV slash home theater
system that's up for grabs
there's also daily prizes including
Samsung tablets blu-ray players gift
cards and there's even a trip for two to
New York City to meet the former NFL
coach Tony Dungy so some pretty cool
perks for doing something you'd probably
enjoy doing anyways that's playing games
on your mobile device I know you guys
are big fans of doing that so I thought
I would make you aware of it all the
relevant links to everything I talked
about in this video are down in the
