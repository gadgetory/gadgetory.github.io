fancy here I'm very excited to check it
out this is the new incarnation of the
professional drawing tablet if you know
anything about drawing tablets and you
have probably heard of welcome before
inside this box is not just a drawing
tablet but it's also a complete PC it
operates like a laptop with the pen
input from the Masters at pen input
that's what the mobile studio pro is and
I'm pumped to check it out inside the
box I've got a 16 inch with the core i7
chip 512 gigabyte SSD that's the one
that I've got in this box which I do a
nice jacket
this is no iPad alright this is this is
not an Apple pencil this is sort of more
what digital artists are in tune with
using 3840 by 2160 pixels inside of a 16
inch display that's pretty incredible
getting in there nice and sight pixels
per pixel with the tip whoa that is
slick that is slick Jack you've got to
appreciate that maybe we can finally
start that animated segment on the show
so in here is a pretty slim power
adapter a type-c connector on this end
oh I guess there's a level of
personalization there so you can swap
out this silver ring down here for a
different color black blue green or red
a little personalization now here's the
thing think these guys know how to do a
pen look at that right there nice and
substantial couple of buttons on there
the eraser which is also a button I mean
you could use that for something else if
you want but make sense as an eraser and
then this here it keeps the various tips
if you have to change out this knob
right here you've got a couple of extras
right in there hopefully Jack can get up
tight he's usually up tight anyway yes
look at that that's where your pen lives
how nice is that you just slide it down
you might mistake it for a cigar a Cuban
cigar something like that check the
power extension for the power brick you
can put this little adapter here inside
the Kensington
of the mobile studio Pro and then keep
the pen attached to the unit itself you
see me working on thumbnails and stuff
I'm going to be telling the coach now be
like Leonardo da Vinci over Rembrandt
Pablo Picasso you know what the best way
to remember artists is is the Ninja
Turtle they're all named after famous
artists right I'd pay a guy named
Donatello to paint this entire place
right now oh man that doesn't get you
motivated to create something I don't
think anything will oh ho ho ho the
display does not have a glossy finish
very low reflection a number of cameras
and sensors here
I believe is before the Intel 3d the
real sense map out environment you can
do all kinds of crazy stuff with that xt
card slot headphone jack you have three
USB type-c connectors and then the
Kensington lock I told you about earlier
all right so I got this thing booted up
right now and I got to tell you it is a
lot of fun I go ahead and launch into
sketch pad real quick just maybe I want
it I want to get my inner Bob Roskill
Bob Ross is always all about like
crimson I see I'll draw their horizon
over here maybe I'll draw a little tree
up on there you know but Bob Ross always
says Jack he says there are no mistakes
only happy accidents wonderful greenery
look out look at this abstract beauty in
here some shrubs coming up over here
some flowers look at that you didn't
think I don't think I could do all this
yeah there we go my abstract sunlight
going on maybe there's some water now
listen I'm not going to win any awards
for this but I'm just trying to show you
the level of flexibility that the speed
like it's so responsive it's beyond
touch standard Jack in the house now
today he's going to be wearing a hat and
as usual though the man is miserable
you can see they're absolutely miserable
and you can see the thumb is going down
it's a thumbs down from Jack as usual so
the cursor begins to hover in the spot
that you're about to draw just so you
know that it's going to be accurate but
then you can trigger a line while not
actually touching the display see that
now let's get into something more
practical let's say I'm playing around
with a thumbnail for a video and I want
to make some modifications to it in most
photo editing apps there are tools where
you can kind of automatically select the
different color variances but things
always get a little sketchy in and
around the edges with a level of
precision that would be impossible to
achieve with a mouse you can see that I
can come in here and trace around the
outside edge now the other cool thing is
this little this little guy over here
actually acts as a scroll it's just it's
just a different level of precision than
what you're able to achieve with the
mouse and definitely not poking away to
touch screen with your finger I'm going
to head to that couch right now I'm
saying bye-bye to my desk for a while
you should be working
I'm just lounging back I'm just working
I'm just lounging pixel for pixel that's
some bang right there bang for the buck
buck for the bang and you know what you
don't have to take it from me the real
artist no I mean there's tons of videos
out there I even briefed myself by
watching a few of them people do
incredible things on these tablets it's
not just Jack alright it's not just
stick figures like this
check it out I'm curious if you have any
creative inclination this could be for
you you listen here and you listen good
this episode of unboxing has been
brought to you by the fine folks at
Casper look at this that's a mattress
they ship you a high quality mattress to
your door you throw out the junky one
take a look at your mattress right now
it's terrible you're waking up in the
morning at the sore neck you got to the
lower back so here's the cool thing
though you're thinking blue it's a
mattress in a bus how do i what if I
want to test it out get a little snooze
before I purchase it that's not really a
problem here because they'll let you try
this thing for a hundred days
you don't like it at that point it's
free shipping to you and then free
shipping back oh wow oh it's coming to
life you can slice the plastic
I'm going to kick the shoes off real
quick I'm going to enjoy this right now
oh oh you know what they weren't joking
then apparently you can get a deal on
this right now

box therapy or head to the link in the
description this will be like me and
