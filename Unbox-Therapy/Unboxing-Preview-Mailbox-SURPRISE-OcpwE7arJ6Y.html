give you a quick update I just got home
from my mailbox and every time I go over
there I'm surprised to find new products
and I decided to be a little bit
interactive I want you guys to choose
down in the comment section which
product I show you that arrived that you
want to see unboxed first featured first
on the channel so without further ado
let me show you what was there it's
always a very happy time for me heading
over to my mailbox so the first thing is
this boom box here from Marlene it's
called the bag of rhythm and it's kind
of a new take on the idea of the ipod
iphone boombox it's got your usual
docking area here you've also got
auxiliary I believe but this is going to
go one step further it's got a bag built
right into it you can also remove it but
making it very easy to take with you on
the road to bring audio with you now my
understanding is this can kick out some
pretty decent power too so I can't wait
to take a look at that and give you guys
a closer look at that also from Marley
they sent me some other things to you
guys are know that I'm big on headphones
they send me their highest and over ear
style headphone the TTR made out of very
high-end materials you've got aluminum
real leather so on and so forth should
be a really nice unboxing experience
plus i'll give you guys my take on how
they sound put them up against some of
the other headphones featured recently
on the channel they also sent me a set
of in ear headphones these ones are
called the Zion and they've got some
nice wooden components on there not sure
if you guys can see that as well as an
inline remote / Mike so two very
cool-looking headphones that are also
going to be featured on the channel
stick around for that plus I'm still
going to do that comparison that you
guys wanted about the regarding the
street by 50 headphones and the beats
mixr headphones you guys voted for that
hugely so I'm definitely going to do
that too and then I'll let you know how
the Marley stack up their highest and
offering so the last thing to talk about
very special this right here came from
the awesome people over at Pro mods if
you don't know who they are you're about
to know real soon because this is one
very exciting controller unlike any
other controller you've ever seen it's
been completely customized both in
appearance and also
functionality I think you guys are going
to be pretty amped to check out this
product right here once again from the
awesome people at Pro mods you're gonna
have to stay tuned to see what it looks
like it's in a hard case right now I'm
not going to give it away Oh lastly does
anybody play hockey I just picked up
some brand new hockey gloves I doubt
most of you do up here in canada it's
all about the hockey these are the 11 k
from Reebok really awesome gloves i love
them they're pretty high-end they cost
me too much money but anyway guys so
that's been a quick update little little
bit of information for you on what's
going to be coming up real soon on the
channel and as i mentioned before let me
know down in the comments what you want
to see featured first and i will go
ahead and feature that product first
alright guys I'll catch you on the next
one later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
