is the new Razer phone to the guys
behind the original gaming phone I did a
video on it last year got a lot of
attention from you guys and I think the
reason is that many of you are looking
for differentiating factors in the
smartphone space not just another phone
but another phone with some different
features and possibly a different focus
so that's kind of what this one is I do
expect it to be an improved version of
the previous one and that's interesting
because the previous one had some
features on it we're kind of
unprecedented be 120 Hertz display and
these stereo speakers which were
probably the best speakers I had ever
tested in this space on a smartphone
it's the best speaker I've ever heard on
smartphone I think I even did a
dedicated video comparing the razer
speakers to almost all of the other
flagship smartphones your focus should
be multimedia sound is a big part of
that it has a pretty big battery also
4,000 milliamp hours that's kind of a
must Gaming is very resource intensive
can drain your battery life quickly this
new model also adds wireless charging
supposedly so I'm kind of happy about
that it also came out with their very
own wireless charger with the RGB effect
going on as well show the world the
device that redefined the standard in
mobile gaming now meet the Razer - this
is very similar looking to the past one
giant speaker grills on the top and
bottom everybody's talking about screen
to body ratio in the case of the Razer
phone - it's a sound trade-off better
speakers in exchange for not the
greatest screen to body ratio this is a
very nice unboxing experience a razer
branded sim tool that is very cool so
unfortunately even though this device is
focused on multimedia there is no
headphone jack built-in but they have
given you this adapter right here Type C
- mini jack nice braided type C charge
cable quick charge power brick Razer
branded right there squared off edges I
mean you just don't see this very often
if you
get their laptops for example this
aesthetic it carries through to those
devices also there is a new camera unit
on the back as well that was one of the
criticisms with the previous version the
camera wasn't a huge focus for razor on
that particular device creating a better
camera which this one proposes to be
more attractive to people that want a
substitute for some other flagship
there's a new Sony sensor dual lens
setup so glass back which opens up the
wireless charging ability that's a
trade-off I'm willing to make personally
the location of the fingerprint scanner
baked into the power switch your thumb
kind of lands on it like this
there's no curved edges and because of
that design decision you open up the
opportunity to fit a fingerprint scanner
in this region right here round buttons
for volume control USB type-c port
capable of quick charge as I said
earlier and then of course if the
expandable storage which lives within
the SIM card tray that's kind of a must
for a phone targeting the group of
people that this particular phone is
targeting okay let's go ahead and power
this up so what is so special about this
phone why are people talking about it
first things first it is of course a
display it's not OLED I do need to tell
you immediately so you have to kind of
adjust your expectations but it does
have that as far as I know no other
smartphone has is a hundred and twenty
Hertz display it creates this incredible
scrolling effect here and you're not
gonna see this properly in the video
you're watching but when you experience
this in person it's like oh my god I
wish every display I ever used to scroll
like this it is so responsive it feels
like you're dealing with the more
sensitive touchscreen now unfortunately
there is no OLED display that I'm aware
of in a smartphone that's capable of
doing this to my eyes it does seem
brighter than the previous version which
is good but to really get a feel for it
I have to use it over a more extended
period of time outside in sunlight now
since this is a razor device you have
the chroma app baked right in and this
will allow you to control the logo on
the back and the chroma effects you can
customize this to flash
different colors for different types of
notifications so it's not just for looks
there's also some functionality baked in
now I do want to check out these
speakers as I mentioned the previous
version it totally changed my
perspective and my expectations in
general as far as what smartphone
speakers are capable of so I'm gonna
launch some YouTube here to start when I
saw this online and I saw the
demonstration I was like come on show me
what David Copperfield is this doesn't
look right that sounds good wow that is
that's loud initial impressions here a
lot of sound coming out of there because
you do have these configuration options
you can also kind of overdo it to
experiment with it get it where you like
for YouTube music and so on but the
capacity is there the capabilities are
there I'm gonna have to compare it to
some others in an upcoming video we'll
find out if it's still the sound
champion but it's definitely up there
that's for certain
okay now what about the cameras so you
have the one x and you have the two x
this image it's pretty sharp pretty
decent now by default it's got an
automatic HDR setting so it will take a
look at the image and try to determine
if HDR could help it or not
so because the new device has wireless
charging they have done their very own
wireless charger it's got three coils an
adjustable base and of course the Razer
chroma built-in charger which has some
weight to it there you go
glowing Razer green and then the cycling
the breathing effect now there's a
button on it which I think disables the
light it does that's a must all right I
got a snooze every so often regenerate
some cells and have some REM sleep you
know it can't be doing so with the
discotheque
there you go charging rapidly as well so
it's a quick charge Wireless charge now
the cool thing about this dock is it'll
work in portrait mode but it will also
work in landscape there you go charging
rapidly once again so if you do want to
use it to watch video on a desk for
example as I mentioned earlier that's
kind of a nice angle to do so okay so
this has been a preliminary unboxing not
a full review in fact it can't be yet
that video will be coming up at some
point in the future you know I love to
look at smart phones that are taking a
slightly different approach and this is
definitely one of them the exclusive 120
Hertz display it even has a special
cooling plate which aims to keep the
device cooler during extended gaming
sessions the one area that I'm a bit
concerned with is price especially
considering where we're at today I know
I keep talking about it but this thing
is gonna be around 800 bucks but where
we're gonna have to really figure out
whether or not that price is justified
is when we truly examine this camera
in more depth and check out this screen
and other environments outdoors and so
on so what do you guys think are you
interested in this phone should this be
one that I switched to exclusively at
some point let me know down in the
comments section I know I'm left with a
bunch of questions and I could see
myself testing some of this stuff to see
how it works in the real world and
basically to figure out if Razer has a
place in this flagship discussion in
this $800 starting price discussion
choose-your-own-adventure is this my
next smartphone switch coming up shortly
on unbox therapy it's the Razer foam -
would you personally buy a gaming phone
are you satisfied with the standard
run-of-the-mill smartphone let me know
in the comments down below there you
have it unboxing first impressions razor
phone -</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
