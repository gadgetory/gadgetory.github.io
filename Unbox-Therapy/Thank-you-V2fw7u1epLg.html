the channel a hit kind of like this
crazy figure this crazy subscriber
count'
10 million subscribers 10 million of you
guys to be honest I I just felt it
necessary to sit down you know and and
kind of address it and and just talk
about it and address you guys like
directly cuz I know a lot of you have
been around for a while in the past I've
done giveaways and things like that to
to commemorate those moments and I'm not
saying I won't do that that's probably
coming up very soon I don't know give
away some phones or something like that
to celebrate but I also just wanted to
sit down and kind of have a little bit
of dialogue as well now before I get
into that I know a lot of people like
blue you told us that Jack is gonna be
revealed when you hit 10 million
subscribers and that hasn't changed this
thing is in development it's progressing
there will be something very shortly so
don't go anywhere
you're gonna meet Jack but there's a
little bit more to it so I just wanted
to I guess half the purpose of this
video is to let you guys know that we're
working on it and we have something
coming up but to be honest the reason
that I wanted to sit down is more than
that I wanted to sit here and just maybe
speak to you guys in a slightly
different manner than I normally would
when I got a product here and I'm
talking about something and you've got
the antics and so on I've been
passionate about technology and gadgets
forever basically since I was a kid
since as long as I can remember and I
think somewhere subconsciously I always
wanted to turn that interest into
something professional something they
you know because sustained me could
could be my life and so on but I don't
know that I ever had any kind of direct
plan for that so I published a few
videos online on a different channel
before this one and and they actually
picked up some steam people were
interested surprisingly enough oh my
goodness like but people wanted to watch
this and I guess it made sense because I
wanted to watch it some of the early
inspiration you guys have to remember
this thing hasn't existed forever I mean
not just YouTube but like this segment
within it has not always existed so I
was watching people like soldier knows
best
I was watching John Rhett injure back
then the channel used to be called John
for Lakers these were some of the
earliest unboxing analysis videos that
were out there and it was compared to
now it was a small thing you know it was
a tight-knit group of people that were
interested in this at all it never at
that time felt like something that would
generate so much interest from from this
number of people from you guys but I
guess you kind of just invest in
whatever it is that you're interested in
or happened to be passionate about and
sometimes at least in this case other
people develop a similar passion and
then you end up connecting in this
strange way I mean that's ultimately
what YouTube enabled it enabled this
kind of two-way thing through this
camera lens I've said it before and I'll
say it again if I went to some
traditional media company to some
executive at a television station I said
listen here's what it is it's me it's
tech there's a box I'm unboxing it no
one's gonna go for it man they're not
gonna put me on prime-time alright it
wasn't gonna happen that way and that's
why this platform is so powerful because
it circumvented all that all the red
tape it allowed for me to just start
speaking for me to start making videos
to not need some gatekeeper to you know
unlock the door
let me through and then keep me on a
tight leash control what I wanted to say
or what I wanted to do and over the
years I got to be honest man it's been
there have been difficult these
difficulties in figuring out how to
navigate this kind of strange
environment going from somebody and I
know this kid this year could probably
sound obnoxious like who does this guy
think he is he's on what's he doing he's
on YouTube big deal or whatever just
with an interest in this stuff to
somebody
that's getting emails now from the
biggest brands in the world being like
hey man are you gonna be at our event
can we sponsor a video li these are all
things that are difficult to manage
especially when you were once a kid who
just wanted to get your hands on this
stuff now you have all these
opportunities in the world and you're
trying to navigate it
in a responsible way turns out that's
kind of difficult and so especially in
the last little while I've been really
considering some of the things some of
the steps some of the ways that I can
stay out in front of it some of the
responsibilities that now exist because
of the position and so recently I've
been trying to do a better job of just
being real of just bringing the realness
to the camera lens whatever that means
whatever my feelings are to just dig a
little deeper and be like you know what
I really have to let these people know I
have to tell them in plain terms what my
thoughts are and I don't think I felt
the same sense of responsibility along
the way I think when the channel was
smaller it was easier to just be like
well I don't know yet and then that
transitioned along with the
responsibility to the point where I was
like no you have this huge following of
people that are making decisions based
on what you say you have to think you
have to you know push yourself a little
farther a little push yourself a little
harder to come to some sort of
conclusion that can be helpful to people
and so that's been a bit of a push
recently and I'm not even there and it's
it's gonna continue to be difficult to
kind of balance that tightrope of like
how to operate and sustain this business
and everything else but still bring the
realness on the lens this is kind of a
weird thing to be talking about just
because of the 10 million subscriber
milestone but I just feel like a lot of
you guys have been along for the ride
and so it makes sense to give you a
little bit more background at this point
about sort of what I'm trying to do or
what's important to me or the things
that I consider before I say words we do
have a good time here it's a fun time
but there's a lot of analysis that goes
on behind the scenes that you guys
aren't necessarily exposed to and now
that we're sitting here at 10 million
and you're a part of it
I feel like hey why not bring you in a
little bit more
after all without you guys there is no
this without your viewership your
continued support there is no this so in
a way you kind of deserve to know the
mechanics of all of it and what the
challenges are going forward there's
never been a road map for this you could
probably find some people they're like
no I knew it was gonna happen exactly
like it did they're probably lying
though it kind of had to be carved out
and it continues to have to be carved
out but it's okay I'm not complaining
the process is exciting now obviously I
can't do this forever but I'm doing it
right now so I might as well do it my
best and for that opportunity I owe you
you guys are the one that put me in this
place so it's the least I could do</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
