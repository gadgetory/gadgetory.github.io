another video and today I'm gonna
explain something to you I'm gonna show
you something you may have never seen
before
Pringles and red okay I'm joking these
are not what they seem at all these my
friends are called diversion safes these
two are representation of a whole series
of potential diversion safes that you
can get on Amazon the opportunity to
hide something valuable in plain sight
could be jewelry could be cash some
super high-profile secret that we can't
talk about here on this video in the
comment section according to the Chicago
Police Department the average
break-and-enter burglar only spends
seven minutes inside of your house
they're looking through drawers for
valuables they're looking for a safe
they're probably not looking through
your Red Bull you don't have this thing
sitting out no it lives in an area where
you keep some Red Bull who knows it
lives somewhere where someone's not
gonna try to crack it open now I know
you're asking like show me something
what do you mean it looks like Red Bull
okay the top screws off boom put
whatever you need in there it weighs the
same amount as a Red Bull now what would
you put in here as I mentioned we pull a
few things over some cash
first and foremost keep this away from
individuals in their sticky paws a SIM
card maybe that's a very important
secret phone number a key to god knows a
ring as you can see this is very
high-class diamond ring right here an SD
card with important information
seriously though you can put some
Bitcoin this is to represent jewelry as
well it's not a very expensive watch but
maybe if you had one or a burner phone
that's the phone you don't want anybody
to know about Pringles
maybe you've got bigger stuff to store
looks feels shakes there's actually
Pringles in here as well if you try to
open the top and eat them but on the
bottom once again only those who know
now sure if you put a few things in here
you shake this around you might you
might feel that something's a little bit
off like you're gonna be late what's
going on here so don't leave those out
like for your for your friends who come
over and maybe most importantly you need
to protect something like this a high
profile treasure map got to get around
the crocodile is that a shark as well
there's a shark a relatively friendly
looking gorilla maybe you're some kind
of diamond dealer and you gotta find a
place to put your little tiny diamonds
well you could carry around I don't know
a couple hundred grand in diamonds right
inside this guy nobody's gonna be eyeing
you down you're just a Red Bull drinker
now you might be thinking Lou you just
you just exposed this to the world now
you have a safe people know you're
protecting something the whole concept
here is that these things are everywhere
so it would be impossible to assume that
there would be anything different about
one that you see over time and just
become used to seeing these things on
tables that's the idea hide it in plain
sight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
