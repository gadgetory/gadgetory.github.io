about it it's very manly
alright you drink coffee as you can tell
Ryan's back that's because I really I
need his expertise on this one maybe the
most skeptical I've ever been I made a
video a little while ago on a case for
these air pods
it brought wireless charging to your air
pods that was a cool case the video was
a hit it was a great accessory for this
particular product so I went down the
rabbit hole of looking at the various
air pod cases and of course I bumped
into this bizarre strange air pod case
called Zen pod this is a combination air
pod case / fidgets spinner I won now
it's gonna let that sink in for a minute
Zen Zen I can see how that plays a role
in the name because it's it's Zen you
know like the feeling this isn't them
like you're like calm and cool and
collective well the fidgets spinner
isn't it's supposed to calm you so this
is the Zen pod
I'm excited to see this thing
are you really though I mean if it
exists we need to know about it you can
see on the back here Zen pod spinning
case apparently it's actually a hot
product like people are buying this oh
really
it's also 30 bucks we showed off the
best selling wireless earbuds the
earbuds themselves were $18 this case is
30 yeah more than their buds
actually it's it's smaller than I
thought it was gonna be it's almost just
a little bit bigger than the actual air
pods it looks like a button obviously
it's not yeah it's a fidget spinner and
I always it making you feel physically
it looks like has a leather feel to it
which could be expensive so maybe that's
why it's 30 bucks but it's expensive
right right Kirk family whether it's
expensive I think is it getting cheaper
I don't know looks nice black is there
the colors will that's it that's all you
get in the case that is gonna cost you
30 bucks there's an insane product
it sounds pretty cheap that's not real
leather let me see
at all why is that $30 what a nightmare
smell that you know that's a satisfying
just snap show I think that's cool did
you see snapchat snaps back it's a snap
shut snap shut I'm smelling Kelly yeah I
mean it's not worth 30 bucks to say that
right now 30 bucks
it feels so for this look at this dude
spinner and dude look right over here
wait look where this is like where this
part meets the lid that looks like it's
gonna rip tear it's very thin doesn't
look well man I agree very thin in that
region I agree it doesn't look well me
it doesn't matter which way it goes I
guess doesn't matter it's just a case
right now it fits a lot snugger snugger
second folks through there you can see
the charger thing now it feels a lot
more quality like it feels like feel it
go ahead
touch that geez I actually kind of like
how it jumps up a little bit when you
open it they slide up a little tiny bit
oh that's kind of cool
so this is what you're supposed to do
yeah with your air pods because you you
weren't annoying enough we're in the
airport your air pods that you need to
be also spinning them around and it
works it's smooth and that's an to do
your folks know listen I can say without
a shadow of a doubt that this this is
garbage like this is a bad way to spend
thirty this is a bad way to spend $30 on
it with the thing in it I gotta try it
tell me this then why are so many people
buying their use you're the one that
said people are buying these things why
I'm just saying that you get a lot of
weird accessories that pop up in the
Apple ecosystem because the ticket
prices of the stock products is already
high enough you think you charge a
premium that the accessory market can
can Asuna a similar margin guy great
they could have given you real leather
for 30 Apple products already mean a
sense of let's be honest who's fidget
spinning NES I think this might be the
end of this product today you ever you
ever spun your fidget no no I don't I
don't fidget spin
Oh got time for that I'm busy guy and
good luck anyway I think you'd be
wasting your $30 on this thing you can't
recommend this for 30 bucks is all we
talked about it the other day the pizza
go get a pizza you know where do you put
your pizzas jack knows where I put my
pizzas well we'll come in here I I say
it's junk don't spend $30 on it Ryan
says it's the best $30 you could ever
did not I did not say that
what knew it no do you side with I think
it's all right I would use it but not
for 30 bucks it's way too much how much
would you pay well 10 bucks like 5 bucks
yeah 5 or 10 I mean even even there it's
a bit obnoxious you're spinning your
headphones around so it's an official
recommendation from Ryan and thank
goodness for me and will tell you it's
not to waste your money this episode is
brought to you by noir VPN we all use it
here unbox therapy and we think it's
pretty dope keep your data private get
all the Netflix regions and protect
