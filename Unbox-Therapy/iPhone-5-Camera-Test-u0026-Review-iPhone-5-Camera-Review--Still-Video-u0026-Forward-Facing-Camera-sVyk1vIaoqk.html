iPhone 5 camera test if you haven't
subscribed yet definitely click that
button right now so you don't miss out
on any of my iPhone 5 coverage or tests
there's a button around you find it
click it anyways this video here we're
going to be looking at the rear facing
camera as well as the newly improved
forward facing camera which now shoot
720p making it a viable option for
shooting vlogs and things like that
stick around till the end of the video
to get all the details on both cameras
but to get started on this test we've
got to do the most basic thing that
people do with their camera phones still
images so I took the iPhone 5 to my
local supermarket where there are a
number of colors that can be represented
you know through pictures I think it's a
good place to take a phone when you're
testing it plus you get to look at you
know cookies and things like that it's a
win-win situation so anyways as you guys
can tell here I mean the results speak
for themselves this is still one of the
top if not the top camera on a
smartphone as of right now now of course
the Lumia was recently announced which
is supposed to challenge this and of
course I can't say too much about it
until I've got my hands on it so I won't
talk too much about the Lumia right now
instead we'll stick to the iPhone and as
you take it outdoors you can even start
to see it perform even better as there's
more available light if you guys want to
inspect any of these images in more
detail just feel free to pause the video
and take a closer look at any of them as
you can tell the colors are represented
in a vibrant manner but they're not
oversaturated like some camera phones
and some cameras for that matter tend to
do with images like these and another
thing to notice I look at the detail on
the bark in this particular image here
and then you can see as the focus
changes it's really good at giving you
more depth of field than other you know
camera phones are capable of because it
does have that large aperture for such a
small lens but anyway anyways then the
next thing that I wanted to mention is
the fact that it doesn't really tend to
over expose the areas that you don't
want overexposed which again is a common
problem in camera phones so the sky
wasn't completely blowing out my image
you can see this is a good example of
that now it also shoots these new
panoramas which are awesome
and really easy to shoot the app is
really easy to use I guess you can call
it an app it's a feature within the
camera app and it's really easy to use
to make your own panorama so that's
always a positive thing now the next
thing to talk about after we get
finished up with the stills here is of
course the video mode which again is
incredibly impressive here you guys can
get a look at the sharpness you've got
lots of resolution to work with at 1080p
the colors again our vibrant without
being oversaturated and probably the
thing that stood out to me most was the
improved stabilization when walking you
guys have to remember most often when
walking around filming video especially
with a device as small as a phone it's
very difficult to keep the phone from
shaking now granted I do shoot video for
a living here and there so I do sort of
know how to hold it and to sort of allow
your knees to take some of the shock so
I was trying a little bit to stabilize
it and in this particular frame I was
actually leaning up against something
but as you can see you're getting really
nice movement really nice frame rate of
course it's not going to be as stable
when walking as a dedicated camera that
has optical image stabilization but then
again it's you know a third of the size
of your average camera to begin with and
it's a phone so you kind of have to curb
your expectations
just a bit but the coloring is really
nice and as I said before you've got
lots of resolution to go around and even
when walking it's completely usable so I
definitely recommend this device from a
camera perspective if the camera is the
most important aspect of your smartphone
purchase then it's pretty tough to get
better than the latest generation iPhone
5 you know for most people this is going
to completely overtake their need to
have a dedicated camera at all now my
case I own multiple cameras because of
the fact that I do video production for
a living so you know for me it's not
going to replace any of those cameras
for obvious reasons but for the casual
user I just can't see the need anymore
by today's standards to carry around
something like a point-and-shoot when
you're getting these kind of results out
of something as slim and light as the
iPhone 5 which is literally on you at
all times it sits in your pocket it's
super convenient and
you're getting this kind of quality out
as you guys can tell I'm a big fan and I
would say my expectations were exceeded
you know I did not expect to see these
kinds of results out of the latest gen
and to see this kind of improvement over
the 4s this is just really beautiful
stuff to look at so the next thing to
look at guys is the forward facing
camera so here's a closer look at the
new iPhone 5 as a vlogging camera I'm
using the forward-facing 720p camera
right now and I'm walking along a little
bit too so we can get a sense for the
image stabilization or lack thereof but
the quality is definitely improved over
the previous version I can tell already
just looking at the screen without even
seeing it on the computer so I'll go
ahead and upload this and hopefully
that'll give you guys a better idea of
what to expect from the forward-facing
cam on the brand new iPhone 5</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
