the 21 and a half inch version I opted
for this one because the 27 inch for me
is just overkill I was looking at some
benchmarks anyway and I think this base
model provides the best cost to
performance ratio of any iMac out there
and maybe any Mac out there I'm up here
in Canada and I paid $12.99 for this
model it is going to be leaps and bounds
faster than any sort of previous base
model it's also going to be
significantly faster than my MacBook Pro
which was a top-of-the-line 17-inch
model about a year ago so because of
that I think it sort of represents the
pound-for-pound champion of the Apple
world anyway here we go we'll spin it
around I mean that's it's not small in
person by any means you know and you're
getting decent resolution better than
you used to get on 20 inches so screens
this one's got 1920 by 1080 a lot of
pixels get your work done
anyway let's throw that junk out of the
way let's pull off this film that sort
of covering the screen you know Apple 2
always doing a nice job packing these
things up you can be damn sure you
shouldn't run into any along
the way although I do remember those
initial sort of shipping issues seem to
be isolated to the 27-inch but they have
imagine receiving a brand new iMac with
a smash screen on it I'm just going to
leave bad taste in your mouth anyway
let's get this other box out of the way
and let's get into the rest of the stuff
oh wait there's a power cord - forgot
about that you know that's the most
exciting item what the hell are we going
to do without power not much anyway here
we go
and as you can see we got the wireless
Bluetooth keyboard and uh that used to
be an upgrade now everybody gets it
Thank You Apple all the money I've given
you a better get a wireless keyboard
from here on out here is the new new
Magic Mouse which I was skeptical about
first at first but you know I'm going to
give it a shot in the past I've been
using you know Logitech mice I feel
they're a little bit more ergonomically
friendly but we'll see I'm going to give
it a chance maybe I'll let you guys know
after using it for a little while here's
a cleaning cloth which makes sense for
such a glossy screen and here is a
drop-in disc for iLife 11 because mine
was too shipped with oh nine on it I
here is the everything else anyway I got
some nice close-up shots coming right up
so stay tuned check these out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
