therapy and today we're taking a look at
the airport Express from Apple this is
the latest generation and many think
it's just a standard sort of slim
wireless router but in reality it can do
a little bit more and the reason we
bought it is not to behave as a wireless
router but instead to act as a wireless
interface i'll tell you more about that
as the video moves forward but to put it
in simple terms we've got a mac pro that
doesn't have a wireless card in it and
this is one of the easiest ways to make
it wireless enabled now this device can
obviously also be used as a standard
wireless router supporting airplay can
stream music from itunes or your iPad
etc it also has a print server so
there's a USB port that you can plug any
standard USB printer into and all of a
sudden it becomes a network printer so
let's go ahead and jump into the
unboxing it's a pretty simple one I'll
show you guys the device as well as the
other items included in the box now as I
mentioned earlier in this video our
function is going to be to enable a Mac
Pro the way that this works is this
device actually can connect to a
wireless network on its own so if you've
got a pre-existing router like we do
this thing can tap into it you just type
in the password and all of a sudden this
becomes an enabled device now maybe you
don't have a Mac Pro that doesn't have
Wi-Fi on it but say you have an older
games console or really any device
that's lacking wireless and you can't
install a dedicated wireless card this
will enable those devices it's also
pretty damn sleek and small for a
wireless device especially if you're
using it as a router it's got a simple
design on the front you have a single
LED light on the back is where you'll
find your ports you've got power as well
as some others I can be closer look at
that as the video moves forward other
than that I mean we're talking about a
simple unboxing here you have a power
cable which Apple always makes look real
pretty by coiling it up in this fashion
right here that's all you're going to
have to plug into it except for of
course the ethernet cable and lastly we
have a little bit of paperwork from
Apple this is a setup guide but you can
really do most of the setup just by
using airport utility if you're on a Mac
and you can also get this set up
setup guide in a digital format on their
website if you choose to but hey who
knows maybe you're not connected to the
internet yet
so having a set-up guide in paper form
is not such a bad thing so as I
mentioned earlier this is an incredibly
small device about the same size as an
Apple TV the latest generation very
similar in fact in many ways except for
the fact that it's white instead of
black on the back you have your power
port as well as a LAN port a LAN port
the USB port for that print server or
otherwise you have an audio port for air
tunes a wireless streaming of music and
of course there is a reset button to
completely reset the device and go back
to factory defaults so a pretty simple
thing to set up I just wanted to explain
you know how we were using it in the
office here's a better idea this of
course is our Mac Pro it's an older 8
core machine but now we just can just
put this little Airport Express on top
and all of a sudden it has Wireless some
of you might not know but getting a
Wi-Fi card for an older Mac Pro is
pretty hard to do and the prices get
jacked up on eBay etc and they're not
very versatile you pretty much just have
a standard card that can only do one
thing with the airport Express you can
do a lot of different things say we have
to repurpose it in the future as a
wireless extender or otherwise so
today's sponsor is Gamefly and if you
don't know about Gamefly that's where
you rent games online I have an
incredible inventory of titles to choose
from and you can sign up for a very low
monthly fee and get an unlimited number
of rentals it's pretty simple to use as
well you just pick a game they'll send
it to your house and when you're done
playing it you send it back and they'll
send you the next one in your queue it's
very very simple and you always have a
fresh title to play without the
investment of purchasing games you get
to try a lot and not spend a lot so it's
a pretty cool service and you can
actually get a free trial right now Oh
which will give you I believe two weeks
of the service and you can try it out
see if you like it and then sign up use
