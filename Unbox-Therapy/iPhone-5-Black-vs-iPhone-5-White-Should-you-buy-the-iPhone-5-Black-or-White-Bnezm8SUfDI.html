going to talk about the difference
between the white iPhone 5 and the black
iPhone 5 besides the fact that you can
see the ambient light sensor on the
white one and of course the obvious
color differences now right now things
are blowing up on the internet about the
black model in particular and the fact
that it scratches or scuffs pretty
easily now I don't know if this is
overblown I don't want to make any
statements that are untrue but there's a
number of sites reporting that the black
one is getting scuffed up scratched up
so on and so forth and I'll show you
some of the images I was able to collect
from those sites right now in extreme
cases individuals have even reported
pulling their device right out of the
box and having it scuffed straight from
the factory which I find pretty hard to
believe now they're made out of the same
material which is anodized aluminum so
in theory the same thing could happen to
the white one but I think the idea is
that the white one won't show it as much
as the black one does because the raw
material below the anodized finish is
closer in color to the white model than
it is to the black one so that's
something to consider if you are really
really concerned with durability the
same thing is true for the outer band
around the outside of the iPhone once
again you've got a more unfinished
coloring to the white model than to the
black the next thing to talk about is
multi media consumption some have
suggested that using the black model is
a more immersive video experience
especially when you've got letterboxing
around an image the black model just
sort of absorbs the black letterbox
whereas the white one highlights it
which could be an annoyance to some
individuals now from an aesthetic point
of view of course this is a subjective
thing you know some people are going to
like the black one some will like the
white believe it or not I like them both
you know I changed my mind from day to
day but I think the biggest
decision-maker for people is going to be
this durability issue and I think at
this point we can safely say the white
one will probably look better longer at
least if the current situation is not
rectified now I'm going to give you some
case options because you might want to
just put a case on this device but first
you got to sit through a quick message
from the sponsor you guys have got to
check out unbox therapy's newest sponsor
there
Jackthreads and they've got the latest
and greatest in menswear from brands
like Nixon
they've got Reebok and New Era and
everything is well below retail price in
fact in some cases it's as much as 80%
off retail so you're gonna save some
serious cash if you join up it's really
really simple to do all you have to do
is head over to jack threads.com slash
therapy that acts as your invite and it
also helps out the show for every person
that checks it out even though it's free
to do it's really really simple way to
help the show now they've even added
some iPhone 5 stuff that I think you
guys are going to be really interested
in they got some skins for the back of
your iPhone 5 to protect it a little bit
but to keep that sleek design so you
guys have to head over there and check
it all out
once again it's jack threads.com slash
therapy do to show a favor go take a
peek all right guys thanks so as you
guys can see here I pretty much picked
up all the cases I could find locally
I've got more on order as well so we're
going to be taking a look at a number of
different protection options in the next
few days on the channel right here these
are some of the ones I'm most excited
about the Griffin I believe it's called
reveal there's a couple of other options
here including one for the youngsters on
the far left but once again the reveal
is probably the most exciting for me
reason being is because it maintains the
design aesthetic of the iPhone 5 in and
of itself it just sort of you know gives
you a bumper as well as a clear panel on
the back so hopefully it can give you
enough protection to avoid some of the
scratching and some of the things people
are concerned about right now actually
I'll put a link to the Griffin reveal
down in the description as well if you
want to check out pricing and
availability anyway guys that's been a
quick comparison let me know in the
comments how concerned with you are you
about scratching and will you put a case
on this device if you buy it or if
you've already got one other than that
thanks as always for watching if you
enjoyed it make sure to leave a like and
favorite it does help out a bunch and
I'll catch you guys on the next video
Thanks later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
