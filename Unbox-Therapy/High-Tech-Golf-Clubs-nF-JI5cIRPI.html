normally associate such a thing with the
latest and greatest in technology but
when TaylorMade reached out to me with
their new RSI irons which were
unreleased I jumped all over the
opportunity to check it out test them
out call up my buddies have them check
them out and test them out as well
because there's some new innovation in
here that promises to make your average
everyday golfer poor golfer pro golf for
any golfer better so there are a couple
of key technologies that make the RSI
iron's unique including face slot tech
which actually slots out a portion of
the clubface making the heel and toe
more forgiving these cutouts go all the
way through to the back of the club and
then they're filled in with a durable
epoxy compound you've also got an
improved speed pocket engineered to
activate the lower portion of the face
so it helps to get a little bit more
lift under your shots by pushing the
ball up towards the sweet spot of the
club these two technologies together aim
to once again allow you to get clean
hits and to miss hit the ball less
frequently alright okay enough with all
of the heavy-duty specifications it's
time to actually use these irons so
let's head out to the driving range and
see what they can do
so in conclusion everyone had a great
time checking out the new RSI irons from
TaylorMade even some of my more seasoned
friends who golf on a regular basis and
are very connected and committed to
their current iron set they were amazed
at what they could do for like a
first-time trial of a brand new Club and
a brand new series so big thanks to
Taylor bait for sending these out and
really enjoyed getting out of the house
and doing something a little bit
different in this video if you guys
appreciated it please make sure to leave
a thumbs up down below thanks as always
for watching all of the relevant links
to this club and some more information
about it will be down in the description
and that's about it thanks again I'll
catch you on the next episode later Dan
and
Dannan and in a name</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
