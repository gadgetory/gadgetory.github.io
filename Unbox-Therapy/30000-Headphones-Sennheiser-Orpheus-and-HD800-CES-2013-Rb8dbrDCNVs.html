through my footage from CES 2013 and I
realized that I haven't shared this
video with you yet this is from the
sennheiser booth and the reason it's so
special is because I got to try out
possibly the world's most expensive
headphones I'm not really sure this is
them they are called the Orpheus they're
no longer in production but today if you
want a set of these you'll be paying
around thirty thousand dollars that is
correct I did not make a mistake they
are the price of a car and they ship
with this very special amplifier it's a
tube amplifier so completely analog
sound all the way through no digital
processing whatsoever and they aren't
made anymore that's the reason that this
is so expensive they were made in the
90s and originally retailed for 16 grand
so that was crazy enough to begin with
now in terms of sound they've got a very
wide soundstage on purpose as you can
see they've got an open ear open air
design which means sound is allowed to
bleed out of the ear cup on purpose so
that it feels like a very wide
soundstage like you might be in front of
a concert or something now a more
reasonable headphone even though these
are still really expensive the HD 800 is
a more modern version these retail for
about 1500 bucks they are still
available today in fact I'll link them
down in the description if you happen to
be a billionaire but I actually prefer
the sound of these a little bit to the
Orpheus because there's a little bit
more bass they're kind of the modern
sound that we're used to it's a little
bit open-air but a little bit more
closed than the Orpheus is so this
entire experience at CES is about
comparing the legendary Orpheus with the
new state of the art HD 800 and in my
personal opinion I say the HD 800 is
better although listening to the Orpheus
is a really unique experience now you
will need an amplifier for either of
these headphones because they have
gigantic transducers so Sennheiser was
also showing off some of their more
modern amplification products like this
one right here this is what the HD 800
was connected to if I can find a link
for this I'll put that in the
description as well so some insanely
expensive audio products in the
sennheiser booth I'm surprised they even
let us play with them my question for
you guys if you had the chance to listen
to the Orpheus or the HD 800 which song
would you play if you could only listen
to one song on
incredibly expensive headphones one time
which song would you pick let me know
down in the comment section anyway guys
if you enjoy my content from CES 2013

down below as it does help out a bunch
and subscribe if you haven't yet I'll

always later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
