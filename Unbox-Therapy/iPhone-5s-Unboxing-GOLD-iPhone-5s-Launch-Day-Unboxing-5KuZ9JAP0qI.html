from the Apple Store was lucky enough to
find an iPhone 5s in gold only the first
few people in line we're capable of
getting them they've been incredibly
short supply anyways let's do the
unboxing take a closer look and compare
it to the old iPhone 5 so I'm going to
be doing this one a little bit
differently we're going to try and
capture some of the excitement involved
in doing this live but we will still
have of course those beautiful visuals
that you guys love to check out as well
so complement this part of the video
right here so there you have it with the
plastic off you can see you've got the
fingerprint sensor there now force iOS 7
opening up the box we have the device
let's go ahead and pull the plastic off
of this device right now so on the front
and on the back you've got this this
brand new gold finish that you've seen
of course in those leaked videos etc but
now you have it in the completed form as
you can see right here and you've also
got the trim is in that same kind of
gold it's not really a gold I mean
you've heard people call it champagne
and in person that is also the way that
I interpret it comparative to the old
iPhone 5 over here is the black version
very similar to the new Space Gray one
but slightly different but as you can
see pretty much identical in form factor
you have a slightly different flash and
then the other difference is on the
front of course where you have this
brand new fingerprint sensor that I'll
be testing out very shortly
other components in the box exactly what
you'd expect to find you've got your
paperwork over here which you're
probably not interested in you've got
the Apple earpods headphones you've also
got a tiny little power brick and
your USB cable for charging the device
syncing the device etc so that wraps up
the accessories in the box but those are
never too exciting you guys are
obviously far more concerned with the
main device on the front here you might
be thinking hey that's just another
iPhone 5 but the most interesting
characteristic is obviously this
fingerprint sensor you have this gold
rim or metallic rim around the outside
of the home button there is no longer a
little square inside there either what
I've heard from preliminary tests is
that you have to put your thumb over top
of the entire metallic ring for it to
function it doesn't work so well if you
hit it kind of from the side like that
otherwise yes the design hasn't changed
all that much beyond the color one more
visual difference on the back is where
the new flash is you now have a slightly
wider space for it it is called true
tone now and it actually has two
different colors of flash in there and
if you look closely you could you can
make them out so that's a preliminary
look at the device but now it's time for
us to get up close and personal like we
love to do here on unbox therapy so sit
back and enjoy some up-close visuals of
the newly released 5s
so that wraps up this unboxing and first
look at the iPhone 5s in this new
metallic gold finish but before we take
off I want to give a big shout out to
the folks over at Squarespace for
sponsoring this video and all of our
iPhone 5s coverage and 5c coverage for
that matter if you haven't heard of
Squarespace before they make it
incredibly easy to get your own website
or blog up and running they've got tools
in place it's a visual experience you
don't need to know HTML or anything like
that
in fact I built my website unbox therapy
comm using Squarespace and I did so in
one day pretty much you can try the
service for free to find out if you like
it and if you end up liking the site
then you can buy it in the end there's a
link down in the description which will
take you over to their website to check
it out and if you do decide to purchase
there is a discount code as well for
unbox therapy viewers so it's a win-win
situation
definitely check out the link down below
alright guys so I guess it's time to say
goodbye and move on to all of the other
iPhone videos that we have to make today
