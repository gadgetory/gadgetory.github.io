think so now this is going to be
different its smartphone season you know
there's a lot of people in the comments
what is this smartphone therapy well
kind of because this time of year is
smartphone time of year there are so
many new smartphones that really deserve
to have some coverage they deserve to be
inspected this is one of those
smartphones this is the hydrogen phone
no red media machine a smartphone from a
company that's never made a smartphone a
smartphone from a camera company this
dilute immersion I ordered the titanium
version that was not ready yet so they
sent this one in its absence and they're
still gonna send the titanium version
anyhow who's complaining you get an
extra phone but this is so different
this is so weird this phone this thing
is like a weapon this is insane I mean
it feels like one of their cameras I
guess I should have suspected that it is
metal it feels like a weapon it probably
could be a weapon in fact it's got this
crazy grip you are not dropping this
thing accidentally it looks like one of
those power switch fingerprint scanner
combos over there of course this is
their camera unit on the rear of the
device you see these pins down here this
device is eventually gonna be modular
kind of like red cameras I guess our
camera company's gonna have to become
phone companies I don't know obviously
red things so this thing has
carbon-fiber metal its aggressive this
thing feels even less like a phone and
even more like a camera just the
materials in use alone there is a
headphone jack microSD as I suggested
before red branded USB type-c cable they
put some technology in here some kind of
a holographic display from what I've
heard it doesn't quite show up on camera
Wow hydrogen oh oh the display is
already the display is already doing it
it's very bizarre Jack probably won't be
able to see it it just looks like a
regular image to you yeah Jack can't see
it kind of 3d but not very far it's not
like out here it's just like a little
bit away from the display it's super
hard to what do I even I mean I can't
imagine carrying this thing imagine
pulling that out you're on a date you're
like yeah consider it done I'm on my way
what did he say to you I'm on my way
this device is definitely not concerned
with screen to body ratio it's super
boxy large bezels it works pretty well
the fingerprint scanner works it's not
the latest Android but it's Android you
know where everything is they didn't
mess with it too much which is a good
thing I'm assuming this is gonna be 3d
when I click this right now which it is
Oh God
they just see an image right now but I'm
seeing this I'm having like a roller
coaster in VR moments right now that's
just flat to you but you can see how
there's like a grid going on okay I fed
my eyes are tuning into it now a bit
more you might have to be right in front
of it
well cut getting your will he's always
begging me he says I got Lou you gotta
let me in the video he's always
screaming enough is enough already it's
my turn it's my turn now not at all
enough sit up already it's my turn now
look it's 3d so hit play I don't know
I can definitely see the 3d effect I
don't know if it's really useful on the
phone mmm kind of novelty but it's it's
kind of cool technology I kind of dig it
I think it's kind of like the 3ds yeah
that's what I do not like the 3d effect
yeah that's that's the kind of vibe I
was getting is 3d the thing that people
what happened on TVs as well the one
place where people remain into it is in
the movie theater it's because it's so
immersive Fred you got the big screen
you have the big sound are you doing
that no I don't like that at all because
I have to wear another pair of glasses
double glasses is the worst double glass
yeah I'm not really down with that are
you doing that Jack you go into the
movie theater you'll put the glasses on
you have a seat you're immersed that's
you that's you the TVs no one's buying
3d TVs obviously it just never really
took off yeah it's definitely not a
myself the one reason I could see red
possibly being interested in it because
they got that cinema background yeah so
maybe somehow we make those cameras so
therefore this becomes the future camera
then this is gonna have to be capable or
encourage 3d as well maybe that's the
angle yeah red cinema yeah just because
we could Haley do Haley who ladies and
gentlemen it's who time this product is
really a whole conversation about what's
happening to cameras this is a camera
company recognizing what's happening and
envisioning a future for themselves
within that environment I know they know
that this device is not gonna replace
their production stuff on a set anytime
soon but somebody over there is
envisioning a future in which something
far more portable may be capable of some
of the production stuff they are doing
right now I mean it's nice for them to
Behrman it's really bold ambition is
good ambition is good you would expect
that the camera would be a huge did you
hear that sound of that not good
everything is very blurry I mean if
you're carrying a beast like this though
what does it need to be doing for you
there's no count you're not counting
individual hairs there's it's blur the
hardware feels finished I'll give them
that it's solid I feel like this is a
thing that's gonna have to grow over
time the modularity the software sort of
buying into a bit of a beta that's fine
like it doesn't seem clear my thoughts
exactly I mean if you're gonna put out a
phone like this that's an absolute tank
with giant bezels it has that like the
speaker's half can't be like that are we
talking about 3d and 2018 if I'm red I'm
like let's chill on a 4d thing let's
make a smartphone that's durable rugged
maybe you can add extra lenses to it get
the best sensor you possibly can and
then just have great speakers and
multimedia functionality I don't think
the idea of red having a smartphone is
so outlandish I'm just saying if you're
gonna do it like let's do it mm-hmm like
let's do it how much is this 1,300 it's
about the future you're kind of
investing in the future you're banking a
lot on this modular type of setup that's
happy to invest in a company like red
for the eventual product that will
improve upon this one here take our
money we like the idea we'll put up with
some shortcomings in order to invest in
the eventualities in order to invest in
the future is software gonna win the
smartphone camera wars or is Hardware of
course you're always gonna need the
hardware are we gonna really be clicking
lenses
on two phones in the future or is
software gonna make those choices for us
I don't know that's a good question
what do you guys think you tell us there
it is red hydrogen one I love seeing
players in the smartphone game and I
love seeing different things and I
appreciate ambition always so let's see
what happens with red hopefully there's
space for a whacky product like this one
yeah
keep trying today's episode of unbox the
pea has been brought to you by singlet
