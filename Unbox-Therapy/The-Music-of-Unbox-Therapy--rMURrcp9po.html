little bit different video for you today
we're gonna do a little quick profile on
a music producer behind some of the
beats that you've heard on the unbox
therapy channel up until this point I've
been using exclusively music from James
D music for both the intros and outros
on different unboxings a lot of you have
asked requested information on where
this music comes from it was a mystery
up until this point but no longer now we
get to meet the man himself mr. James D
and this is where it all gets done this
is the studio right here tell us a
little bit about what you use to make
your music alright well first of all
just to make you know my beats right
here I just sequence sample pretty much
do everything on my machine which is
made by Native Instruments right here
and then over here I also do a little
bit of sampling a little bit sequence
seeing on my Akai MPC 2000xl as well as
doing a little bit of you know any key
work on my oxygen 25 keyboard MIDI
keyboard right there now I notice that
the machine is not just a hardware a
piece of hardware it's also got some
software integration with your Mac or PC
up here you get an actual visual
sequencer to go with the hardware you
know making it I guess
a little bit more interactive than the
traditional MPC for the purpose of be
making exactly now I notice you've also
got some nice big monitors over here
yeah these are the m8 audio CX aids and
I also got the apogee duet here which is
my interface I've got the firewire right
now for my videos guys when I do
voiceovers I'm actually using an Apogee
product as well mine is a single track
where this one is dual I believe mine is
called the apogee one this is the duet
which is firewire mine is USB you've
also got a little mixer up top yeah
that's the Mackie 1202 right mixer right
there it's got 12 channels and also
right here I got my another you know
keyboard control this is a bigger one
yeah correct it's 61 keys as opposed at
the 25 right right oh it's DM audio 61
you get the full piano feel up here if
you need if you want do some layering
for horns or bass line right or strings
anything like that it's good you know it
just gives you a little bit more
is there do some layering good stuff so
you want to show us a few beats up here
that's what it looks like as far as the
interface is concerned when you're when
you're playing some different projects
so here we go there you go now that's
some unboxing music right there folks

videos once they get completed but as I
understand it mr. James D has a big
repertoire of music in here different
