you I feel like you guys might not
believe me at this point because I keep
saying like I don't know what's in the
box but I promise you I do not know what
is in this box this thing arrived at the
mailbox they said there's something
incredibly heavy here you're gonna need
to bring the manpower the muscle so what
do we do we do the opposite we send Tom
here that Tom yeah you understand what
I'm saying here it's also screwed
together there's no seal on here ah
things are getting wild around here okay
and I can't say that I mind 50 kilograms
we have some details here the outside
wooden transportation box has to be
unscrewed totally disassembled to unbox
this aluminum cube safely solid cube of
aluminum milled 73 kilograms
ceramic blasted and anodized black
Oh
oh whoa whoa vessel and then the unbox
therapy logo here carved into the I
guess this is aluminum seriously cryptic
stuff going on here oh oh oh what is
going on right now
the box in a box in a box somebody's
playing games with me here oh that one
came up easier we have made it finally
and what we have are three boxes vessel
hand-finished iPhone 7 plus frozen gold
and oak iPhone 7 polish black and pear
and iPhone 7 plus frozen black and
walnut so let's crack these open here
whoo so as suspected we are looking at
an iPhone bumper that is made out of
wood and metal and look at that little
engraving at the top this is obviously a
premium case very smooth wood you can
see the metallic buttons it comes with a
little tool Wow tiny little text tip on
there also inside the package whoa
design and made by vessel in Slovenia
there's a 5 cent
euro coin in there on the obverse side
of the coin we have the sower that's
planting the seeds of the stars it's
getting deep right now as a single tear
falling on my face a cleaning cloth as
well look at that Jack that's a bit of a
microfiber right there oh I think I like
that one even better here you can see
the difference between pear and walnut
all right so this one might be popular
for a lighter colored iPhone I would
assume you have the anodized gold
aluminum on the frame as well as this
oak colored wood just fits right back on
check that out a little bit of style
access to the necessary ports you've got
a couple of grills volume up and down
pretty satisfying and with the grain you
just get a little bit more of a tactile
kind of grip on it
yo also it's elevated a bit so if you
did want to place your phone down on the
table like that your screen is no longer
touching I've shown you premium cases in
the past premium bumpers the most
expensive cases out there now we have
the heaviest unboxing ever the most
unexpected mysterious and it ended in
another premium option for an iPhone
case I know other companies are going to
see this next thing I know is going to
be an elephant on the table and all I
can say is keep it locked or you see
that little bell icon down there a
little subscription button get your act
together step your game up knowledge is
power</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
