back in full motion because in front of
me today I have some 3d print outs what
will likely be at this point the
upcoming iPhone at least the schematics
for it the scale for it it'll help give
you some insight on what Apple is likely
up to right now and how the iPhone is
going to change somewhat substantially
with the next generation so on the right
hand side over here these are those 3d
renderings and these are based on
schematics that case companies have
leaked out there's a few different ones
that have confirmed they're already in
production of upcoming cases for these
upcoming devices the storyline has been
corroborated from a number of different
manufacturers and also of course
websites over here you can see the dual
camera setup on the bigger one and then
a single camera setup on this one which
is slightly smaller for comparison the
current lineup of iPhones we've got the
iPhone 8 8 plus and the iPhone 10
supposedly this one here will be the
only one to stick around and your new
iPhone lineup is going to look like this
this one here is going to be the biggest
iPhone that Apple has ever made this
will be a 6.5 inch iPhone if you take
this and compare it to the current
generation 8 plus it kind of feels
archaic at this point holding that thing
up this has the giant chin and forehead
kind of dates it at this point if I hold
up this guy they are almost identical in
scale but the difference is this one is
almost all display but if you've ever
held on to an 8 plus you pretty much
know what its gonna be like to hold on
to the top of the range most expensive
most premium upcoming iPhone 10 plus
course that's a codename right now this
may be called that maybe not mean the
whole thing is so confusing the width of
the device is just over 3 inches the
length year 6.2 inches and then of
course the thickness which looks to be
identical to the current iPhone 10 very
familiar here SIM card tray in this
location here power switch up there of
course the elongated power switch now
volume buttons on the other side as well
as your hold switch the knotch looks to
be identical to the current generator
iPhone 10 already spoke about the camera
layout identical there as well there are
some rumors about this connector there
was talk originally of maybe Apple
switching to USB type-c would of course
be awesome because there's so many other
devices that use that connector as well
as quick charging and so on but the
current rumor states that they're more
likely to put an adapter a USB type-c
adapter in the box and a charger capable
of a quicker charge than you're used to
using the adapter this guy here is
expected to be the most expensive of the
entire new lineup probably breaking that
1000 dollar price tag all over again
now things get more interesting when I
pull out this other unit that one is
smaller and you're like what's going on
there well this mock-up is the rumored
6.1 inch the budget iPhone that everyone
has been asking for now this one here
gets rid of the OLED display and swaps
it out for a less expensive LCD panel I
flip it over here you'll notice it's a
single camera setup which is actually
more similar to the current generation
iPhone 8 giving you an almost iPhone 10
experience at a much cheaper price tag
the rumor on this guy is that it may
come in somewhere around $600 which for
a new phone is unprecedented from Apple
now there's some other rumors as well
that this device here will be
constructed a little bit differently
similar to the 8 and 8 plus now with an
aluminum body rather than the stainless
steel that you see on the fancy iPhone
10 that currently exists that's how that
price is going to be able to come down
now you're gonna need to decide of
course what that's worth to you and
whether or not this budget version makes
more sense to you but you'll be
sacrificing OLED a bit of the
construction and of course the dual lens
camera this one is five point eight
inches this is just over six inches on
the measurement as expected there's
obviously all kinds of market pressure
here especially in certain markets where
the budgetary restrictions may have held
people back I think this is going to be
the most compelling iPhone that Apple
has done an awareness of how the market
is changing and how a lot of people they
just don't want
spend a thousand dollars plus for a
smartphone and also the benefits that
happen for a customer beyond the $1,000
price point don't necessarily map
directly to your enjoyment of the
product they can all of a sudden insert
themselves into a marketplace where
they've been missing but I like to see
this tech becoming more accessible
regardless of which brand it's coming
from this shows a level of
self-awareness for Apple as a brand that
we should have a product to meet that
criteria now 600 is still a lot of
dollars but just the fact that they're
noticing is a good sign now let me put
the question towards you if you were
faced with the choice which is the most
compelling to you you can let me know
down in the comments I'm fairly
confident we're gonna see a set up
somewhat like this if not identical so
there you have it
where'd you learn about it unbox therapy
okay cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
