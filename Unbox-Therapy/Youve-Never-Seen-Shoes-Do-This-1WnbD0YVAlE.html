favorite places all right never been

t-shirt number two stitched here what
kind of a game is this
two zero four six it's a movie from Hong
Kong is this a promotion for it
underpants for the good death it's gonna
be a tight fit
why are you backing up this is black
soap this is some crazy marketing going
on right now you know what well done you
had me going lot is a subscription-based
service which distributes a basic set of
clothing footwear essential self care
products accessories and media content
the clothes are dispensable they can be
bundled and returned eliminating clutter
you know what well done to them it's one
of the most creative examples that I've
ever interacted with out of all the
boxes that have ever shown up cool
though
well done next up oh I can't show them
in cubes mood and utility light their
little mood lights color lighting

Germany hi Lois we are hoping you're
doing well we send you is a prototype of
the nano pad stick your phone to almost
any surface Ryan needs your brother the
nano pad suction being applied to Ryan's
phone now okay good okay let's see what
he can stick it to Ryan welcome to our
new segment stick your phone to anything
you can with Ryan and Jack it's not
super sticky to your touch doing their
hair with this thing stuck to the mirror
for fitness like people with the form
you have any form Ryan well let's just
can we I what is he doing what is that
oh yeah there's a form by every Sun I
think this is over oh I ordered these a
really long time ago these are
absolutely insane are you kidding me you
have a different setting for run and
walk look at lower right now like a bow
you know it's spring-loaded here they
included extra pads here when these ones
run out I suppose
the tension depending on weight these
running shoes aim to protect runners
joints Casey in his recent video you
guys are obviously gonna go gonna go let
him know now people love running the
body
it breaks down they fully absorb the
impact of each stride they are made for
road and path running not designed for
trail running sharp rocks can bust them
up they can run up to 2,000 kilometers
apparently I am pumped that these showed
up
like whoo good fit okay lots of padding
in the tongue first of all let's just do
walk mode I am NOT an avid runner I know
how to run I can tell you these feel
like no shoes I've ever worn before
they feel heavier so in walk mode it
seems like the springs are law so I
think I got to switch it over ah there
we go haha Wow so I push down and my
weight pushes it flat but as I begin to
lift my foot boom
look at that makes you feel super
springy too
I love when you take an idea and you
just reimagine maybe your problem
happens to be the fact that your needs
are giving out but you have a love for
running play the shoe did this or that
very rare that one comes in comes across
the table it's a completely
mind-boggling thing this is one of those
things and I appreciate that goodbye</div></body></html>
