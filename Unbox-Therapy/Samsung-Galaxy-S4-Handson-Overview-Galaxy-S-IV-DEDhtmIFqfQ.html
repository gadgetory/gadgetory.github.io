exciting one for you just got back to my
hotel room after getting a hands-on
first look at the brand new Samsung
Galaxy s4 this of course was just
announced here in New York City and I
got tell you don't play around with it
take a closer look at it and of course
share that with you guys
now it might look a lot like the s3 but
believe me it's different this one
features a 5-inch display and now the
form factor hasn't changed very much so
that display just extends closer to the
edge of the phone so you're getting more
screen less bezel which is always a
welcome thing it's incredibly thin and
light like it blew me away actually how
light it was you kind of feel like
you're not holding on to a you know a
real device it feels like a dummy device
it's an incredibly lightweight it has a
5 inch full HD Super AMOLED display 1920
by 1080 of course got 4.2.2 on there 2
gigs of ram you got 32 64 gigs of
storage with you know extended storage
up to 64 gigs through micro sd it's got
a big 2600 milliamp hour battery it will
also feature LTE taking a closer look at
the device you can see there's a
slightly different finish on the
components as you look around the top
there's almost like a little bit of a
honeycomb sort of pattern a little
texture even though you can't feel the
texture it's almost underneath the
surface on the back you have the new 13
megapixel camera which has a bunch of
new software features as well as an LED
flash and you can see this one has done
up in sort of the brushed metal look
your volume rocker is still in the same
place and your power button is in the
same place as it was on the s3 this sort
of looks just like a more refined s3 it
also comes in white so you can either
get it in that metallic finish or in
white whatever you prefer actually let
me know in the comments down below which
color you would get if you are going to
purchase the new s4 from Samsung there
was no release date mentioned so we're
gonna have to wait to hear on that but
it's good news that there's gonna be an
LTE model it's gonna be launched on like
a hundred and fifty five carriers No 387
carriers 155 countries I believe is what
they said so you're probably gonna see
one of these nearby anyway guys that's
being a quick hands on video stay tuned
for more coverage about the s4 I'm Stu
here in New York City I'm gonna try and
pump some more content for you guys so
stick around stay tuned subscribe if you
haven't yet thumbs up down below and
I'll catch you in a few moments all
right later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
