another video and today I've got
something that I've actually had my eye
on for a little while what we're looking
at is a Panasonic product the DMC - cm-1
from the Lumix line so everything so far
is pointing at camera but the weird part
is it's also a phone I for a long time
have been interested in kind of the
ultimate social Instagram Twitter camera
let me just let me just open it up this
guy features a one-inch sensor that's
the same size as the Sony rx100 that is
a substantial sensor and look at it but
it's not but it's still you know it's
kind of like the size at least from the
front of a phone now granted it's it's
fatter it's not crazy fat you got a nice
big aperture on the lens at the 2.8 you
have a dedicated shutter button camera
switch over here the power switch
there's even a little tiny forward
facing camera can you catch that there
jack kind of an unusual layout the
headphone jack is in this location here
and I assume this is where you'll put
your memory card no that's your USB port
there we go SIM card slot and micro SD
XC so what else do we have pretty
straightforward to charge a big charger
holy smokes oh it is a Qualcomm quick
charge or 2.0 okay so it's gonna charge
faster alright this is a quicker
publishing method for photography that
looks more like dedicated camera
photography look at my hands right now
there we go
update successful and we have actually
fairly a fairly stock looking Android
5.0 4k photo 4k pre burst so you see it
actually checked that out J it extends a
little bit it's not huge
I'm kicking it old school when I was a
little kid and I got a new gadget I
would take the user manual to bed as my
reading before I went to sleep this was
my nudie magazine right here Panasonic
is positioning this as a connected
camera not a smartphone the lens also
happens to be fixed so might have been
nice to have a little bit of zoom here
but they've opted for a fixed lens like
a lot of other smartphones in order to
protect the form factor now the camera
app is going to be what you're most
interested in you can launch it a couple
of different ways either just by tapping
the icon or this little slide at the top
which is gonna get you access a lot
quicker you can see the autofocus
working here as I move in boom boom boom
boom you guys hear that like that's
that's quick certainly a photo first
experience it's just different and of
course having complete manual control
you can map this ring on the front for
focus zoom whatever you want now I
wouldn't recommend using the zoom it is
a fixed focal length so you're working
what you're working with digital zoom
they're never advisable you're only
going to be using a portion of the
sensor granted you're looking at a one
inch sensor here which is about seven
times bigger than your average
smartphone sensor so if there were a
sensor to use digital zoom on this would
be it the 4k video is only operating at
15 FPS so you might hope at this price
point to be getting 4k at 30fps since a
lot of phones do that but again I feel
like this is mostly aimed at still
photos let's see how wide this guy is
one thing you can do here that you
couldn't necessarily do as easily with a
lot of other cameras on the market is do
like an automatic backup right you could
connect your Google Drive or use Google
photos with it whatever you want to do
because you've got an trade right here a
couple of 4k features here it's got
something called pre burst which is
going to actually be recording bursts of
4k resolution frames prior to you
hitting the record button if you're
anticipating action then you can set up
prefers and then when that action
happens actually go back in time so you
didn't miss it
what would you say like what is it
business on the front party on the back
or would it be the other way around
business on the back party on the front
I like seeing when tech companies do
something strange and vicious if you
will they're not gonna sell a ton of
these but they decided to make it
anyways let's say I got this thing in my
pocket let's do a quick boom slide over
to the camera shot boom and that's
that's like a macro focus situation look
how quickly look how quickly it gets
focus on me maybe I'm too excited about
this I certainly don't look excited in
this frame right here but anywhere you
want to you want to share still images
this is probably the best you're going
to be able to do immediately this is the
CM one DM c - CM one from panasonic i
think we're gonna have some fun together
we've obviously gone to the extreme here
what exactly went down i'm gonna pull
this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
