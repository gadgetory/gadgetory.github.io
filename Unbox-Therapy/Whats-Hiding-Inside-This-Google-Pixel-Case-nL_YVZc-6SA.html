I'm a huge fan of wireless charging
right the arguments always exist down in
the comments because I don't get it
Walled you want wireless charging Luke
oh you can joule with the cable it's way
faster USB type-c quick charge I'm
charged it up I'm always charged up what
about when I'm lying in bed Lou and I
want to be charging and watching at the
same time and I like cables and cables
and wires just so good you got a point I
I'm not saying it's for everybody it's
just for me I charge up at night when
I'm sleeping and then I charge at my
desk here and that's it those are the
only two places I charge and I love the
luxury of just dropping down my phone so
you've seen in the past I showed you
with the iPhone 7 how to add wireless
charging to it after the fact since
manufacturers don't seem to like
wireless charging right now I don't know
maybe somebody needs to get behind it
and get motivated maybe it's me maybe I
need to start making some wireless
charge cases so I don't have to be over
here like some kind of MacGyver hacking
this stuff together so anyway with the
iPhone I found a way to make it happen
but now I've been using a pixel excel
for a while it's in front of me right
now so what I did in the case of the
iPhone is I found a case that was a dual
layer style so that I could cut out the
interior section and put the wireless
charging receiver in that area
while keeping a phone flush in air it
works pretty well I did find this one
from spigen which is a 2 layer so I'm
going to try to do in this video is take
one of these USB type-c wireless
receivers and embed it in the middle
section here in between both layers it's
a DIY I've got a Qi charger over here it
works flat but then you can lift it up
like this and has a little base on it so
it's simply drop it on in charge listen
I've been on this wireless ramp for a
while if at this point in your life
you're not going to understand why
dropping something down on a surface is
easier than doing this I can't help you
at this point because I got these charge
pads all over the place now I'm invested
I'm yelling so let's go ahead and see if
we can do this a bunch of excitement
this back shell on this spigen case is
made out of plastic it's pretty thick
so might be an issue this wireless
charging receiver patch 5 volt 1000
milliamp hour yes it's not as fast as
wired charger but again it just sits -
it's your sleeping
one thing I like is it's a pretty big
receiver essentially is gonna sit on the
back so that should actually work now
what my plan is on this one from the
back here and then maybe I'll cut a
little channel there so that it can get
in there and up I don't think that's
going to get pinched too hard ya know
see this way you're getting is bulge
it's a little bit ball G for the purpose
of this let's see if it even works ok
drop it on boom charging logo up top
boom charging logo but I'm not too happy
with it the way that it is I think the
real move here is to cut a channel in
here that it could pass through so got
my trusty blade here don't try this at
home children take some cardboard or
something ok cool that should do it
ok there it is look so it did work the
way I hoped I don't know if you could
pick that up jack but all I have to do
is kind of slide it down see that there
into the spot pull back on it to make it
fit I may have solved your pixel
problems and then clip it down it's a
lot less bulging now you see Oh jack
does it still work the way I want lay it
down
boom charging I'd say that's a pretty
good makeshift solution there one day
I'm gonna make my own case I'm just
gonna go to China and solve this problem
once and for all but I haven't done it
yet so in the meantime I'm gonna keep
being MacGyver
I think this solution works pretty well
I looked around at different potential
cases that might work well this was
pretty much the best I could find
yeah if you want to do this to your
pixel I'll link the components down in
the description of this video but the
same principle would apply to any other
phone I'm trying to wireless charge the
world and guys if we don't pick up the
slack right now they're gonna stop
making it somebody's got to push the
movement forward I know it's not a
hundred percent perfect yet
but how else are we going to get there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
