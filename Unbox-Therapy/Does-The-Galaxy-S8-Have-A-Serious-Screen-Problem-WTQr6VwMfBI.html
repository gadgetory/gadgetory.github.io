you could probably tell taking a look at
this table right here we've got a lot of
Galaxy s8 and s8 pluses and there's a
reason for it because you saw the title
of this video so I woke up this morning
and just like any other smartphone
launched there was a news story breaking
news on the essay and specifically the
screen of the s8 so some of the first
people in the world to get their hands
on these devices were those in South
Korea this report emerged that certain
individuals were affected by a red
screen the red screen of death not like
their screen went red but instead that
the white balance on their display
trended towards a reddish tint I said
let me get my hands on a bunch of Galaxy
s8 so I can examine them myself so you
can decide is this a real issue or is it
overblown so let's figure it out now
first things first where did I even get
these 10 phones for my good friends at D
brand check it out look they got a new
skin look at that thing Jack give them a
look at that what's it called Dragon
it's unbelievable so D brand brought
these over so I can do this test and
inform the world and hopefully put this
thing to rest I don't know we'll find
out so you've been looking at these
displays for a while now and it might be
hard for you to even distinguish any
difference at all through the screen
that you're watching this it kind of
reminds me a little bit of when I do
head phone videos you're relying on my
reaction because you can't hear what I'm
hearing but in this case at least we
have some form of visual representation
now the reason that I'm booted into this
screen right here is so that you can see
that none of the color balance settings
have been modified this is the stock
adaptive display setting out of the box
with the default resolution now to my
eyes I can see ever so slight
discrepancies between some of the
displays that look a little bit more
reddish than others this is not a
gigantic sample size this is just 10
phones so take that for what it's worth
but this is 10 devices and they all
appear a little bit different so some of
them are a little more greenish bluish
and others a little bit more
this one for example is trending a
little more on the reddish side this one
up here a little more greenish blue and
then this one over here also a little
bit more pink you have the ability to
kind of tweak this display better than a
lot of other displays out there with
this color balance setting so if your
display is a little more red you could
grab the red value and bring it down a
little bit maybe into something that's a
bit more pleasing but what the articles
were stating even after the adjustment
still remain a kind of displeasing
reddish hue so what I've done is I got
this little device so this guy right
here is called the NYX and it's from a
previous video I did so that silica gel
is giant up from the inside and this guy
can sense the color of anything that you
pointed at and give you an actual RGB
readout of the various color values be
able to pick up those little
discrepancies it might not give us an
exact readout of that color because it's
coming through a screen and being
backlit but it should at least give us
some sort of representation of the
variance here so this thing's pretty
cool it comes with a little app so then
I click scan r67 G 108 B 124 of course
red green blue now this device next to
it to my eyes has a slightly more
reddish hue to it if I do the same scan
I get a different readout so here I have
our 72 so the red value has increased a
little bit the first one are 67 back to
the second one are 72 however little or
a lot that is to you it's going to be
subjective you can have a cooler white a
warmer white you can have some displays
that that trend more into the yellowish
tones to me it's not the hugest deal in
the world because I can go to this
reddish display toggle read down a
couple and what can we do we could go
from 72 to 69 now what Samsung has said
is that they are going to release a
software update which will likely give
you a few more stages on this color
balance tool here to potentially push
the red back even more if it happens to
be something that's bothering you there
will be a discrepancy in all displays it
has to do with the manufacturing process
and how
difficult it is to get absolutely even
tones across the board when it comes to
OLED panels that said looking at ten
devices here I have to say I'm pretty
impressed with how close they all are
even my little device here sense is very
little variation from one to the next
our 68 our 71 our 68 our 67
our 69 our 70 basically every single
display here fits between our 68 and our
72 but of these 10 devices I think
myself and you as well you would be
happy to use any of these and you
probably wouldn't grab any of them and
say hey what's up with this red display
so if you were at all concerned about
possibly bumping into a red display
issue as a potential Galaxy s8 buyer I
don't think they're gonna bump into it
sure I could have checked a hundred
phones but this is a pretty decent
sample size and if that's not enough for
you apparently Samsung has said that
even if the software update and the
increased ability to tweak the color
with this new software which by the way
is supposed to come out next week if
that's still unsatisfactory to you then
they actually will replace the hardware
from what I've read the red tinge is
probably not software related if it is
bothering you to that extent chances are
it's the way that the display was
manufactured but even if that is the
case apparently they're gonna swap them
out this might be one of those
situations where there's just a few
devices effected hopefully that's the
case if you've got a Galaxy S 8 or if
you've seen one let me know how yours
looks it's a little bit red or not down
in the comments there but this video
just serves to give you a glimpse at a
bunch of them all together because if
you were to walk into a store they're
not gonna have 10 side-by-side like this
there's very few opportunities to see a
bunch and to recognize hey what's normal
and what's not and what is the range
that it should be within and these 10
phones seem to point in the direction of
relatively decent consistency here and
just for fun let's do an iPhone while
we're at it so this is the iPhone 7 whoo
our value of 85 so there you go if you
always wanted a reddish display and
here's the 7 plus our 88 you want to
talk about red ish displays the iPhone
products not only trend a little bit
more
red but they're not even identical
between both models here here's one more
iPhone 7 plus if you miss this video
look at that 24 karat gold 8787 blue
these ones there may be exact
anyhow displays vary quite a bit and
while you're there squinting and staring
you're brand new si starting to wonder
is yours affected chances are it's not
as far off as you think from the other
ones that are out there did we put it to
bed maybe not maybe a bunch of red
displays emerge maybe we just put it to
rest for now I don't think you're gonna
have to worry about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
