Bionic chip with a built-in neural
engine to prosper Madison yeah we're
back
oles right great the perfect time to
talk about unlock now the neural engine
is specialized hardware built for a
specific set of machine learning
algorithms this is another example of
the incredible collaboration between the
hardware and software teams it's only
possible at Apple the neural engine is a
state-of-the-art ultra-fast processing
system it uses a highest density
computing ever it's a dual core design
it can perform over 600 billion
operations per second and it's used to
the real-time processing of base ID
recognize what's it but for all of us us
it's just super easy and fun to use Omar
- when you set it up I think in
instructions it tells you how to move
your head around in the camera so if si
he can recognize your face and that's it
you do that once when you set it up and
face Aidid learns your face even if you
change your hairstyle you decide to put
on glasses you're wearing a hat so you
do it up any way you do it face ID
learns your face it learns who you are
and it adapts to you as your face
changes over time let's say you start to
grow a beard it works in a day it works
at night and the teams work hard make
sure the face ID can easily be spoofed
by things like photograph what's that
hey Ethan gone and worked he little mask
makers and makeup artists in Hollywood
to protect against these attempts to
beat face ID these are actual yeah
there's no one like the engineering team
to train the neural networks to protect
against them in face ID says that it's
not edible
the team's worked hard to protect your
face thing guys yes
yeah I don't know should be there your
face state is protected with the secure
Enclave and Al everybody oh you put it
is unlisted processing is done on iPhone
10 and not sent to us but I can maybe
change it from here we require user
attention to unlock that means if your
eyes are closed you're looking away it's
not going to unlock now how do we
compare that to touch ID how secure is
it well there's no perfect system not
even biometric ones but as we said
earlier touch ID is the gold standard
for consumer device biometric protection
and the data for touch ID has been one
in 50,000 for a meaning said the chance
that a random person could use their
fingerprints online your iPhone you can
use been about 1 in 50,000 anything
glitters on those days so what are the
similar statistics for face ID one in a
million
the chance that a random person in the
population could look at your iPhone 10
and unlock it with their face is about
one in a million
okay of course the statistics are lower
if that person shares a close genetic
relationship with you so for example if
you happen to have an evil twin you
really need to protect your passcode
where your sensitive data with a
passcode hopefully you don't face ID
also works with Apple pay so to pay for
things you just double tap the button on
the side you look at iPhone 10 to
authenticate and hold it near the
payment terminal to pay it's that easy
fast intuitive simple base ID also works
with third party apps third party apps
already support touch ID and they'll
work with face ID so apps like mint one
password eat rave all work with face ID
so face ID it's faith on face
authentication for unlocking your iPhone
and protecting your sensitive data it
uses the innovative to depth camera
system it's trained with neural networks
it's easy to set up it learns your face
and it adapts to your face over time
it's aware of your attention
it works with Apple pay and it works
with third-party apps this - def camera
system is incredible technology and it's
gonna enable so many great new user
experiences the first one of course is
face ID but the team decided to create
another great experience with it as well
this is a fun one it has to do with
emojis and we use emojis to communicate
with others and to express emotion but
of course you can't customize emojis
they only have a limited amount of
expressiveness to them so our team
created something called an emoji these
are animated emojis
these are emojis that you control with
your face in emojis track more than 50
facial muscle movements they've been
meticulously animated to create amazing
expressiveness you just watch this can
you the way you create and share an
emoji are right from within Apple
messages you said a little late where
are you well you can pick from a dozen
different animated emojis to share and
express whatever you want Express for
family and friends though iPhone 10 is
packed with innovative technologies that
enable new user experiences I'm really
excited to invite out Craig federighi to
show you I phone 10 in 1 it's like to
use it for the very first time great
everybody Wow I'm absolutely thrilled to
be able to give all of you your first
live look at I phone 10 this is a phone
we've been dreaming about for a long
time but the reality of it in your hand
it's it's really something epic so let's
take a look here is iPhone 10 now
unlocking it is as easy as looking at it
and swiping up and you know let's try
that again
oh-ho-ho let's uh go to back up here and
get right in so here we are and you see
this expansive okay guys to be clear for
a second stream went down we're back
with part two so if you're coming from
part one just pick up where we left off
all that was really covered was the
facial unlock the way that you unlock
the new device is gonna be via your face
they have some new technology they claim
it's incredibly secure and unlikely to
be cracked that's what they covered in
the amount of time since the stream was
down swipe right up let's take a look at
web it just looks unbelievable edge to
edge on this display and your photos of
course are just gorgeous as well let's
jump into this one just amazing
now video of course is unbelievable on
the super Retina display it looks great
in portrait and in landscape of course
this is HDR video just incredible
looking now Phil told you a little bit
about multitasking on the device let me
show you I'm just gonna jump into Matt
if I want to move between my
applications I can just swipe up and
stop my apps all come in I can get out
of them with the tab just lift it's just
that easy and we have a great shortcut
as well you can actually move back with
clean apps just by swiping along the
bottom like this it's really easy now
you may be wondering about control
center and worry not right where your
status indicators are in the upper right
hand corner you can just swipe down and
get a control center from anywhere it's
that easy now let's take a look again at
face ID because unlocking your phone is
just amazingly intuitive you just raise
it look at it and swipe right up to get
started
but now it's also incredibly fast so I'm
just gonna do that again I just raise it
look at it
swipe I don't have to wait and it's also
really really smart
so let's say I wake my phone and I'm not
looking at it stays locked but once I
give it my once I give it my attention
well it unlocks and I can get right in
it's really cool now base idea is also
great for Apple pay so I've been at the
register I can just double click on the
side button
I'm authenticated and I can get in just
like that
now the true depth camera behind face ID
isn't just about authentication in fact
we've extended AR kit with some
incredible new face tracking
capabilities that provide a whole new
class of augmented reality experiences
now we've been working on one with
snapchat and I'd like to show it to you
now it's gonna launch in you see it
builds a mesh in my face and now I can
just select a mask the tracking is just
unreal check out this one now look at
the detail over the eyes incredible
metallic reflections the quality of the
tracking it's it's just stunning
now of course many of us like to
communicate with emoji and with an emoji
you can now breathe our own personality
into our favourites it's available as an
app right inside a messages I can just
go right in here and it immediately
starts tracking me so I can make
whatever expression I want like and just
pick that up and use it as a sticker
drop it on my message like that we also
let you manipulate these in full-screen
you can audition your favorite so
there's some really great ones like the
kitty cat is so expressive and ferocious
it's a happy puppy
check out the physics in the ears the
pig if we've got a chicken and the
Unicorn
mythical creature favorite of the
startup
and if you were by chance wondering what
humanity would do when given access to
the most advanced facial tracking
technology available you now have your
answer
now these can be so much fun you're
gonna want to share them unfortunately
we let you record messages I'm gonna
record a message here for Tim hey Tim
I'm not sure what the protocol is here
but I'd like to call dibs on the box for
my favorite emoji which one do you like
hey Tim I'm not sure what the protocol
is here but I'd like to call dibs on the
box for my favorite emoji which one do
you like now you can send it with just
just a tap and it appears there's a
looping video right inside the
transcript we're really lucky for our
grand finale we might just get a
response back from Tim oh here it is
let's uh let's take a look take me to
your leader
wait a minute Craig I am your leader
let's wrap this thing up
so that is your first look at the new
iPhone 10 and the amazing experience
with the true depth camera and an emoji
I think you're gonna love it thank you
very much
Thank You Craig now let's talk about the
amazing cameras in iphone 10 iphone 10
has dual well 12 megapixel sensors dual
cameras both a faster sensors wider
sensor it's just like an iPhone 8 as new
color filter these camera leaves been
getting used to the nephron 8 aperture
on the wide-angle camera and a faster F
2.4 aperture on a telephoto that lets in
36 percent more light to the telephoto
camera but the big news on the camera in
the iPhone 10 is it as dual optical
image stabilization that means is is
both the wide-angle in the telephoto
ends that's a lot of magnets moving
around in a very small space but it
helps with compensating for handshake
and to take better photos and videos in
low-light there's also a better quad led
two-tone flash that is twice the
uniformity of light on our subjects so
let's look at some photos taken from the
backside camera an iPhone 10 this is
absolutely beautiful great dynamic range
detail low noise is a beautiful photo
the textures are simply stunning
now there's zero shutter lag and that
helps to freeze motion so we can get a
photo like this look at that blue sky
with low noise it's absolutely to die
for
though is delivers low-light performance
so now you can get incredible low-light
images like this with the telephoto
camera as well as the wide-angle an
iPhone 10 is fantastic the portrait mode
feature that we all love the iPhone 10
you get great portrait modes especially
in lower light an iPhone 10 supports the
brand-new portrait lighting feature as
well that's again a photo taken right
off of iPhone 10 not retouched in any
way with a stage lighting effect
dropping out the background
iPhone 10 is great for photos it's
amazing for 4k video and like iPhone 8
it's tuned for a our applications as
factory calibrated cameras the new
gyroscope accelerometer the performance
advantage of the a11 Bionic chip cpu GPU
and ISP and IARC it is tuned for iPhone
10 now the backside camera that we use
so much is not the only camera of course
on the iPhone we have our front side
cameras well and people love to use
those for taking selfie photographs and
now with iPhone 10 and it's true depth
camera it really delivers a breakthrough
in the photos you can take for selfies
because now with selfies you can take
portrait mode photos as well and it also
supports portrait lighting all through
the front side to depth camera
and people gonna be blown away but the
selfish you can take with the iPhone 10
this is absolutely beautiful of course
everything we've seen is powered and I
contend by the amazing new a 11 Bionic
chip we talked all about an iPhone 8 but
it's worth hitting on the highlights
again because there has never been
anything like it
a 64-bit six core designed 4.3 billion
transistors to high-performance course
for high efficiency cores our new
second-generation performance controller
that uses all six cores at once our
first Apple design graphics processing
unit the brand new ISP that improves
autofocus the video encoder that has
real-time motion analysis while you're
shooting video the knurl engine and of
course the secure Enclave to protect our
face ID data all this performance
absurds you expect does come with the
histor battery life so I think it's
important to tell you that we've
increased it yes it lasts
gang hardware Socrates worked really
hard to deliver two more hours of
all-day battery life to us so Wireless
just like iPhone 8 iPhone 10 is also
built for a wireless world
it is cheap charging through the glass
back and it will work with the Qi
charging devices like the ones that we
mention away from Ophion Belkin it also
worked with third-party cheap devices
that our chief certified there are a lot
of great devices they're gonna start to
come to market particularly because of
iPhone 8 iphone 10 but we also think we
can make the wireless charging
experience even better our team wants to
create something I think all of us we're
gonna want to use I might actually help
move the entire industry forward but
we're gonna give you a sneak peak of
this idea right now I'm sure many of you
do this I do this have a lot of Apple
products I love them and use them all
day long I charge them at night you're
plugging your cables you plug in your
chargers you take those cables and
charges with you on the road when you
travel well we think we have an idea of
how to make this a better experience and
here it is it's a mat that you place
your iPhone 8 or iPhone 10 down and it
just starts to charge and there's a
beautiful new interface it doesn't stop
there you can place your Series 3 Apple
watch down on it and it starts to charge
as well while he's charging can place
your ear pods for the optional new
wireless charging case on it and it
starts to charge as well they all charge
in the Superman
why is charging finally the system has a
great interface they intelligently work
together and communicate with each other
to manage the charging through one more
efficient charging system this is not
possible with current standards but our
team knows how to do this we call it air
power
we hope people love it that encourages
others to create or advance solutions
based on technology like this we're
going to be working with the chief
standards team to incorporate these
benefits into the future of the
standards to make wireless charging
better for everyone so look for the air
power charger next year so that is
iPhone 10 it is the future of the
smartphone it is packed with many
innovative features huge list we won't
go through them all they add up to a new
better experience we're so excited about
iPhone 10 they created a beautiful video
to tell you all about it for more than a
decade our intention has been to create
an iPhone that is all will display a
physical object that disappears into the
experience this is iPhone 10
developing the Forman display together
defines a whole new integration making a
boundary between the device and the
screen hard to discern the custom OLED
panel was engineered to fold and
seamlessly combined with the external
surfaces mechanical buttons give way to
touching gestures there's no home button
a single swipe takes you to the home
screen a more responsive touch system
means the gestures in iOS 11 are more
fluid the polished stainless steel band
reinforces the water-resistant or glass
design this new glass formulation their
most durable ever in a smartphone
enables for the first time wireless
charging our new true depth camera
system contained within this tiny space
uses extraordinary depth sensing
technology to let you unlock your phone
with a glance we call this base ID
it Maps the unique geometry of your face
with over 30,000 invisible dots this
data is analyzed by the mural engine on
the a11 Bionic chip the first of its
kind your iPhone now recognizes you even
in the dark and will adapt to your
physical changes this makes your face
your secure password so with just a look
you can all enter Kate your phone or use
and will pay the true death camera also
enables new experiences like bringing
emojis to life by mapping more than 50
facial muscles in real time so you can
be happy or sad or cross both the front
and rear facing cameras now have full
train mode and for the first time you
can actually define the light in a scene
based on fundamental photographic
principles portrayed lighting produces
the effect of real studio lighting on
the back the dual camera system is
completely redesigned it's made even
smarter by the a11 Bionic chip with
machine learning the camera detects
elements in the scene to optimize the
image before the photo is even taken the
camera we use every day mail delivers so
much more and as iOS becomes the world's
largest platform for augmented reality
it will redefine what's possible
this is a fun time they know how to do
that maybe they know how to do that part
that's for sure throwing money throwing
money at the screen works hard to make
iPhone 8 an iPhone tendon the most
environmentally friendly manner possible
arsenic-free display glass mercury-free
displays their BFR free PVC free
beryllium free but now made with a low
carbon process for their aluminum design
and they're highly recyclable with their
materials really proud of that less so I
like to say it every time
iPhone 10 also comes in two
configurations 64 gigs and 256 gigabytes
the price here came tonight
all right well Bungie starting on
October 27th they begin to ship on
November 3rd so this is the future the
smartphone shipping this year so this is
our lineup for the holidays now every
year we say it's a great lineup for the
holidays and it is but this year is
really special
it starts with iPhone se iPhone 6s
iphone 7 the new generation iPhone 8 and
the futuristic iPhone 10
ten years ago when Steve introduced the
world to iPhone he closed with a quote
from Wayne Gretzky it said I skate to
where the puck is going to be not where
it has been Steve said that's what Apple
does we skate to where the puck is going
to be and that is what iPhone 10 is all
about thank you doctor
I found 10 this really is the future
we've made a great fun new ad that I'd
love to show it to you
that is iPhone 10
thank you thank you
poof
so what a morning we've had Apple watch
series three with cellular which gives
you the freedom to go anywhere you want
with or without your iPhone Apple TV 4k
brings the magic of the cinema straight
to your living room
with incredible 4k and HDR content
iPhone a a beautiful glass design
incredible cameras wireless charging a
11 Bionic ship and of course powerful AR
capabilities we think you're going to
love it an iPhone 10 the most advanced
iPhone we've ever made
the incredible new design face ID true
depth camera system and more powerful
technologies than we've ever put in an
iPhone before it really is the future of
the smartphone and we began this morning
with some inspiring words from Steve one
of the ways that I believe people
express their appreciation to the rest
of humanity is to make something
wonderful and put it out there we work
really hard at Apple to create wonderful
things and we hope you love what we've
introduced today I think Steve would be
really proud of them
I'd like to thank everyone at Apple who
made today possible I'd like everybody
an apple to stand up that are here
representing their teams from hardware
and software and services please stand
up in operations are amazing retail
employees
and everyone that works so hard on this
theater and on Apple Park one of the
great things about this theater is an
unbelievable hands-on area it is the
most beautiful hands-on area we've ever
had by far and I would encourage all of
you to join us there and get your hands
on these wonderful products thank you so
much for spending the morning with us
thank you okay
all right there it is folks clapping
applause the whole thing that you saw
there the whole thing I guess that for
the most part they did that that was
kind of expected because of the leaks
because of the rumors and all the
informations available to mock-ups the
videos that were made by myself and
others but you gotta say like you have
to admit when Apple puts on an event
like this they just they kind of know
how to do it right they very few mishaps
a few little stumbles here and there but
ultimately a slick presentation in an
effort to extract those dollars from
your pockets now some people have
speculated but that iPhone 10 X 10
however you're gonna reference it
they're calling it 10 anniversary and so
on they love the Roman numeral stuff it
wasn't the $1200 that that people had
rumoured it would be for a starting
price but you know even at $9.99 it's
going to be out of certain people's
price range of course Apple has those
other products that are available to
those individuals who want something for
a little bit less but it continues this
trend towards these very expensive
smartphones you guys saw my video about
the no date where I was like listen for
930 bucks you can get a devices 9/10 of
the way there maybe nine and a half
tenths of the way there in the galaxy Si
and the question here
like in this particular scenario it
feels like there's more of a gap between
if the new iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10
because you don't have the screen to
body ratio that you get on the more
expensive version and there you know
there's certain there's certain
aesthetic choices there that don't exist
you're kind of buying an old piece of
hardware at least from a design
perspective when you buy the iPhone 8
granted they put glass on the back and
it has wireless charging now it's faster
and so on but you're still holding on to
something that's essentially the same as
the old one so they've taken a different
approach in order to get that extra
money out of you compared to Samsung I
still don't think we're in a place where
we're a thousand dollar phone is a
possibility for everyone that's just
that's just the the truth of the matter
granted in places like North America
where many people have their their
devices subsidized by the contract they
sign they're not paying a thousand bucks
up front but if you if you do want to
own your device and buy it outright a
thousand bucks is a is a big number
you know it's especially when you
consider what's happening around the
five hundred dollar price point from
alternative manufacturers I've got to
hold this thing in my hand I've got to
evaluate it you know I'm gonna do that
and you know I'm gonna break it down for
you
so as soon as this stuff is available
I'll be featuring it here on the channel
if you're not a subscriber go ahead and
become one right now turn on
notifications because I'm gonna give you
the lowdown the realness when this stuff
actually hits the mailbox and I unbox it
for you here on unbox therapy thank you
for joining me on this live broadcast
this is part 2 if you missed part 1 go
check it out we had to split it up there
was a little break in the live stream it
went down for a moment but I appreciate
everybody who joined I appreciate all
the super chats that came in the chat
that was awesome and now it's up to you
let me know down in the comments what do
you think about these new devices will
you be buying one pre-ordering one and
if so why which of those is the perfect
iPhone or maybe no iPhone at all maybe
you got your eyes set on one of the new
Samsung devices I want to hear what you
have to say then
again and we'll catch you on the next
video later guys
