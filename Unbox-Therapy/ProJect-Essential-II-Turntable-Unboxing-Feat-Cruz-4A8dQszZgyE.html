the brand or the way out aren't those to
1200 1200 FK - yeah go under the bar -
yeah yeah those are old URLs are like
legendary turntables for DJs
are we getting this ayah here no I think
I like it where it is it kind of shows
that we're doing business because you
can't really see this one and this you
can kind of see what's up guys Lou here
and today I'm hanging out with my friend
Cruz and he wanted to get involved in an
unboxing video which makes a lot of
sense it's exciting stuff and so the
next product in line and also one that
he's really excited for and I'm really
excited for hopefully you're really
excited for is this project audio
essential to turntable so we can finally
play back and listen to the Daft Punk
record that I recently unboxed and
apparently sounds really good on vinyl
we also have this little phono box right
here you probably can't see too much
doesn't say very much on the box itself
but this takes the line out or not line
up but the phone out from your turntable
and turns it into a line level so you
can feed that into speakers or into your
computers one has digital as well so
there's a USB port on it if you want to
rip the audio that you're getting from
the record or listen through your
computer for some reason but mostly I'm
going to be listening through the new
audio engine speakers that I unboxed two
videos ago so anyways very excited to
take a closer look into finally fully
enter the world of vinyl let's do it
cruise you want to do the honors man oh
yeah I'll get in this all right see what
you got man this is no easy job but I
trying to figure out how to open this
thing
sure look over on the camera I'm trying
to open this up here okay let me show
you I think I got it no don't cut
yourself man I got it okay we go now let
me show you how to actually do it though
just because if you don't supposed to do
with one hand Wow like that anyway
alright here we go
take it easy Wow don't slice the product
very nice perfect okay
these are the little belts for the dry
yeah oh okay this looks like it's just
pad no maybe something on in there this
is the lid the project turntables looks
so good
without the lid on yeah yeah that's true
you know so I don't know if it's a
mandatory thing though everybody likes
have a little lid yeah so this is to
protect the turntable yeah when you're
using it or not using it but like I said
I really like the look of these
turntables without the lid so who knows
we'll see how I set it up give me an F
to you Cruz got it this is a two-man
operation I could get used to this it's
like an operation you know when you're
doing circuit that scalpel in scalpel
it's always scalpel whenever you're
talking about surgery it's true scalpel
for surgery
cutting you're not getting anything done
without the scaling them okay so here's
the turntable guys you can see it's
black as I said before this is the
essential - so it's an entry-level
turntable if you're just getting into
the world of vinyl they sell
significantly more expensive models get
that out of the way yeah you can just
move it and bring that box back so I
think this one's around $2.99 but I will
link it down in the description and one
of the cool things about the project
audio stuff is getting a lot of
different colors and so of course I've
gone for boring black but I mean black
usually goes with anything right so it's
a smart choice but anyway they've got
red yellow wow this is like a lot more
minimalistic than I usually minimalistic
the project debut was featured in the
Daft Punk unboxing video that they did
for the vinyl of random access memories
but they featured the white debut I
believe now the debut is a little bit
more money it's about a hundred
something more but if you're just
getting started in the world of vinyl
you might not need to spend that much
money spend the money on records and you
can always upgrade I believe these
things hold their value value relatively
well because there's a lot of collectors
and people getting into the record game
connoisseurs if you will okay so here's
the turntable this is an important
component the arm which will deliver the
cartridge now they do come with
different cartridges depending on how
much money you spend this one is the OM
5e and each cartridge sort of has
different characteristics for different
kinds of music so as you become a more
sophisticated listener theoretically you
could decide on different cartridges try
different cartridges etc I know you have
to balance this thing before you use it
I'm gonna go watch some YouTube videos
eventually I do that correctly that's
the beauty of YouTube here you can see
the standard phone Oh out along with the
ground cable and over here is your power
switch on the side now the tray here
this this should lift off right yeah
there you go I love it unbelievably
simple but that's that's why these
things are so popular because of how
simple they look I can put this on
mm-hmm real quick obviously guys as you
can tell we are major amateurs right
here so you're gonna have to stick
around to the channel and see how we
make out getting this all set up and
becoming connoisseurs because we're
obviously not yet
and so take nothing that we say here as
gospel right crew right walk assuming is
the power adapter to do this
counterweight counterweight so there's a
power adapter and well guys this is
looks like interchangeable tips
depending on where you are in the world
I push that down well that's the one I
want I don't want to remove it but
there's also some other ones there
European tip and UK that's the UK let me
know in the comments but oh probably
says on it no doesn't say but I believe
that's the UK let me know if I'm wrong
also
yeah like I said this little
counterweight here and this goes on the
back of the arm and that's how you are
able to distribute the right amount of
weight down onto the record that's right
yeah so that the needle doesn't skip why
not
so anyways I'm fully willing to admit
that this isn't about me you guys are
experiencing the true first impressions
and unboxing in this video we've
obviously got to go hook this thing up
and play around listen to some records
and then I'll be back with another video
ok let's open up the next part now this
one is a little bit more familiar for
individuals like myself who live in the
digital world that's right on a regular
basis where that knife go ok perfect
you get a book like that yeah I'm always
worried when I give this knife to people
that they're gonna cut their hand open
I'm going to be responsible the problem
is the opening and closing no but it's
actually quite safe if you know if you
know what you're doing that's right you
know and it's a really compact package
it's pretty cool anyway
a lot of people have asked about that
knife in the past
okay so this is the phono box USB and it
does come in a non USB version which is
about 20 bucks cheaper I believe
everything that you're seeing today is
going to be linked in the description
but there is a non USB version which is
a little bit cheaper if you're not
interested in the digital output but I
think for the 20 bucks might as well get
it maybe you want to get into sampling
music production something like that
move you have that option lots of foam
in here it's a pretty cool looking box
there's the box itself
go ahead those you love the way these
components look that feels that looks
for bust and it's heavy too oh you've
got a gain knob on the top here I'll
show you guys there
nice smooth turn your buttons few
buttons that are unidentified but I'm
sure I'll figure them out and on the
back is a lot of the important stuff
post for our ground as well as a line in
phone oh in USB MC mm I should know what
that means
look at this handwritten handwritten
serial enough in the safe
crazy also you've also got your RCA outs
this is what will go into your amplifier
or into your speaker and then you have
your power connector here I assume the
power brick is in here it's always in
the biggest box yeah although it's a
smaller power brick than the other one
once again you've got the geography of
the planet represented through power so
that makes sense um we'll go with it
snow portables today standard mini USB
to USB you see one of these Laura's you
probably try have like four of them I
beg you charge of the BlackBerry with
using this and one in your life I bet
you charge the controller on a
Playstation using ya PlayStation 3
nostalgia are you excited to go test
this thing out let's do it
I think when it comes to vinyl you you
are supposed to listen to the whole
record start to finish start to finish
outside the inside kickin it old school
just like we've never heard it before
yeah alright we're gonna go do that guys
give crews a thumbs up down below he
didn't want to do this video letter he's
not happy right now I said come on man
we can do it a cooperative unboxing
video yeah collaboration a daft punk fan
there should be enough for you guys
thanks as always for watching I will
catch you very shortly on a
demonstration of the project audio
essential - as well as the phono USB
phono box digital analogue hopefully
this sounds as good as I expected -
thanks again later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
