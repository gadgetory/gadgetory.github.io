product in the entire tech realm for
many years now of course it's warranted
this is a device that sells millions and
millions of units and influences the
entire industry of course I remember
back to the original iPhone the keynote
with the touch screen in the
pinch-to-zoom it was all so exciting at
the time it was it was unheard of to be
honest the idea of a computer in your
pocket that we would all have one an own
one and apps and so on now over the
years we've seen so many different
versions so many improvements and maybe
most importantly we've seen a
marketplace that has developed alongside
the iPhone of course I'm speaking about
Android and Samsung and all these other
amazing devices that exist now post
iPhone one and right now we ready
ourselves for the latest incarnation of
the iPhone this device that many of us
are referring to is the iPhone 8 even
though it might not even be called that
we've seen leaks we've seen rumors we've
seen mock-ups and models but today's
video is not about that next I phone in
fact it's about something far more crazy
it's about a dream iPhone it's about a
dream in general so over the years I've
made thousands of videos on all kinds of
different tech and you probably realize
by this point that myself I'm a tech
enthusiast and so when concept creator
got in touch with me and said hey what
if I gave you the opportunity to make
all the design decisions on a potential
iPhone on a dream iPhone on what the
iPhone might look like if you were the
lead designer all right now obviously I
don't have the design chops for that but
I could at least give him a little bit
of direction
tell him some of the features and
function of the things that I've seen on
other devices over the years that I've
liked from their concept creator he ran
with it started sending me screenshots
and initial renders here's how it can
look if you want it to be like that
oh here's how this feature might go and
so on and so from there the project
began the dream iPhone
the ultimen iPhone my iPhone the way I
would make it represented by the most
beautiful three-dimensional renders
created by concept creator himself so
today's video is a culmination of that
process of that collaboration between
myself and concept creator and that's
where this beautiful device that you're
seeing here through these
three-dimensional renders that's where
it came from now the first thing you'll
probably notice on this iPhone is a
triple lens design because why not it's
the dream iPhone I happen to have a
background in video making so I'm
incredibly familiar with the idea of
different vocal ranges represented by
different lenses why should we stop at a
standard lens and a zoom lens let's add
a very important wide-angle lens
much like the one you're watching me on
in this video it gives you this
incredible aspect the ability to include
more into your photo so now when you're
traveling and you want to capture a
landscape or some architecture you've
got more to work with you've got a more
vast representation of what it might
have felt like to be in that environment
oh you want to fit extra people in the
frame for that photograph no problem
flip over to the wide-angle standard
zoom and wide angle it's on the dream
iPhone after looking at hundreds of
phones since starting this job here one
of the standout features that I've
noticed and always wanted to exist on
every device that I looked at was stereo
speakers front-facing stereo speakers
now of course HTC models have featured
this but up until now there hasn't been
an iPhone that delivered on this
potential so on this device with this
design we've managed to cram in two
stereo speakers forward-facing no more
muffling of the sound no more reflection
off the palm of your hand just
crystal-clear audio coming straight at
your eardrums now another thing you're
gonna notice is this angular design many
phones and phone manufacturers have
moved to a more curvaceous kind of
device but unfortunately that type of
design leads
to a more slippery foam something that
you can't quite grip as confidently with
this design here I went back to a more
angular device kind of similar to the
iPhone 5 or se where you can feel that
chamfered edge that little bit of bite
that it gives to the palm of your hand
so you can hold on to it and not wonder
if it's gonna slip out
I'm sick of slippery foam now of course
we're going to pick the ever-popular 5.8
inch display size this of course is the
display size on the new samsung galaxy s
8 which I've been using I think it's
right in that realm with the correct
screen to body ratio you get the best of
multimedia without giving up too much
for manageability and single-handed
functionality now of course my dream
iPhone has to have decent battery life
so we tried to cram that in there into
an incredibly slender design 3000
milliamp hours of juice not bad now also
it's got to have wireless charging of
course we've heard the rumors that the
next version of iPhone will in fact
feature wireless charging finally I've
been a fan of wireless charging for many
years every time I have a device that
supports it an outfit my entire space in
wireless chargers the next iPhone will
have it my dream iPhone has to have it
now the next choice is a little bit more
controversial and that is the choice of
including USB type-c saying goodbye to
the idea of the Lightning port no more
proprietary connector but one that's
supported across the board with all the
benefits supplied by USB type-c transfer
speeds and quick charging and so on one
cable that I can use on all of my
devices cross-platform or otherwise
whether it's the new MacBook or the new
iPhone my dream iPhone I want you as B
Type C now one of the features that
everyone is wondering about talking
about and so on is how in a world with
these incredible screen to body ratios
how do we use our fingerprints to unlock
our devices now as you know for the most
part the back of the device has become
the de-facto standard location for a
fingerprint reader that said it
it really seemed like that's going to
fit in to the Apple design aesthetic so
for this dream phone we're gonna give
you what everyone wants and that is of
course the fingerprint sensor underneath
the display now of course this is an
incredibly difficult thing to implement
and it's one of the reasons it might not
happen in the upcoming iPhone this is
tough stuff to be able to develop
especially when you're expected to
produce these millions and millions of
units but it's a dream iPhone so I want
it it's a cool new feature and I can't
wait to see it now another feature that
I've seen on other devices and always
wanted on an iPhone is the combination
SIM card micro SD card tray so we can
have expandable storage you're not stuck
with the storage that you buy on day one
but now you can stick inexpensive
expandable micro SD media into your
device this is simple we all it takes is
a slight redesign of the tray and the
one that we designed here is actually
two-sided so it can remain very thin and
just like that you're not locked in to
one storage method now as an iPhone user
you could enjoy a feature that's existed
on other phones for a long time now of
course the Galaxy s8 can't be the only
device that supports Bluetooth 5 Oh
since this is my dream iPhone it's got
to have it and of course I'd love to
pair it up to a couple of DVLA phantoms
in case you haven't seen that video
before that's probably my favorite
bluetooth speaker now the last feature
that I'd like to see in my dream I phone
is actually a really small one it's more
of a tweak to be honest I'd like to see
some texture on the buttons not all the
buttons but one of the two volume
buttons and this is just because often I
reach down into my pocket I go to turn
it up or down and I waste an extra
second I just like the confidence of
knowing which button I'm touching now
this has existed on power buttons for
example on other devices where the
volume rocker and the power switch are
on the same side of the phone it could
be on a volume button it could be on a
power button the main thing here is to
differentiate the buttons through a
little bit of texture I first
experienced this concept on a Motorola
device I think and from that moment
forward I fell in love I'm like of
course the buttons
not all be identical I should be able to
distinguish without looking why not
it's my dream life well I get to do what
I want now of course there's a lot more
that goes into designing and
manufacturing a phone then me sitting
down with a wish list in passing that
off to an incredibly talented guy like
concept creator know there's all kinds
of considerations that come into play
can we do this how much will it cost
will people be willing to pay for those
features and so on will our profit
margins be great enough but that's the
beauty of this exercise it's a dream
iPhone you can do whatever you want you
can put whichever features you would
like into the device so how could I not
participate now the next question goes
to you what would your dream phone look
like it doesn't need to be an iPhone it
could run Android I want to see your
specs what is the perfect screen size
how big of a battery what are you
willing to give up in order to get some
of the things that you want put your
dream iPhone down in the description and
who knows one day it might exist now
before I take off I want to give a huge
shout out to concept creator him and I
have been going back and forth on
Twitter in order to make this video a
reality and honestly this video wouldn't
have happened without him so if you're
unfamiliar with his stuff head over to
his channel subscribe and check it out
so I had a lot of fun making this video
was a nice little change of pace to
think creatively about a dream product
in this case in a very specific category
but I can imagine others so if you
enjoyed this concept make sure to leave
a thumbs up down below and who knows
maybe I'll do another one
