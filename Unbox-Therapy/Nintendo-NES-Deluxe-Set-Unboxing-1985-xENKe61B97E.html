therapy and today I've got a retro
unboxing for you a throwback it is the
Nintendo Entertainment System coming all
the way at you from 1985 this is not
your standard setup either this is the
deluxe set including Rob the robot I
want to give a shout out to a and C
games I'll put a link in the description
as well as up in the annotations to
their YouTube channel for allowing me to
unbox this this is a classic and this is
not something you get to look at
everyday so as you see you get the happy
family on the back that could have been
you back in 1985 if you were lucky
enough to get one of these you got the
old-school tube television let's go
ahead and get inside and get a closer
look at this classic iconic piece of
hardware so the first thing you're going
to notice when you get inside the box is
some old-school styrofoam style
packaging and everything on the interior
is exactly as you would have found it 26
27 years ago wow that's a long time I'm
feeling old talking about this and
here's your user manual just as it would
have been back then with your wonderful
Japanese to English translations which
always make for an entertaining read I
totally recommend you give this baby a
read if you do pick up something as
unique and rare as something like this
is today next you've get the classic
iconic Nintendo zapper this is the gray
model before it got replaced by the red
model gun and after you know parents in
the Western world got paranoid as they
do so well and said I don't want my kid
rocking a gray gun and look at how
imposing this baby is you do not want to
be on the wrong end of this barrel oh no
not if you're a duck at least now on the
other side here you can see it's got the
Nintendo zapper insignia on it as well
as the 1985 date so as I mentioned
before this entire package is coming
from back in time now probably the most
interesting part of this unboxing is
going to be Rob the robot because he was
only included either on his own or
through this deluxe package right here
and I never had the chance of owning him
back in the day nah I just got the
standard edition of the console came
with the zapper
and duck hunt and that was about it I
believe one controller so this is
actually my first chance to get a look
at him I'm going to give you guys a
closer look in a quick second and here's
how you get it all connected to your
television yeah back in the day there
was no HDMI I'm school in all you
youngsters here it was strictly analog
coaxial style into the back of your tube
television how exciting it was to get
your standard video video resolution
back then and you've got the classic
Nintendo controller which surprisingly
as rectangular as it is it still feels
relatively comfortable in my hands maybe
it's just me having some nice memories
of playing some old-school games back in
the day with my brother and my dad but
it does feel decent and of course it's
cabled and there was no wireless back
then and you can see on the back here
it's made in Japan just like everything
else in this package manufactured in
Japan designed in Japan this baby is
Japanese through and through except for
of course the North American
distribution so let's get a closer look
at the console this is the one that I'm
sure a lot of you had on the shelf at
some point in your lives if you owned
one of these let me know down in the
comments section let's see how many of
us started our gaming gaming careers on
the Nintendo Entertainment System so
here's a closer look at the front this
is where your controllers attached to
the console you've of course got your
power button and your reset button
there's also a little light beside the
power button to indicate that it's on on
the back of the unit you've got a spot
for your AC adapter to power up a
console you've also got a channel 3
channel 4 switch once again for that
analog beauty this thing is capable of
and then you've got another video out I
believe for you for the RF switch and
then you've got standard analog audio
and video on the I believe it's the left
side of the unit the left side of the
unit if you're looking from the front
and then on the front of the unit here's
a closer look at your controller ports
as well as your power reset button and
of course where the games are actually
inserted I remember blowing on those
cartridges trying to get them to get
them picked up hey did anybody have
those hundred in one game cartridges I
remember getting nosed from my
grandfather
back in a day let me know if any of you
guys had those too so there's your AC
power brick that's how you're going to
actually get the console up and running
and then we've got a number of different
attachments for Rob the robot this is
how he entered integrates with the
system and the game gyromite all this
stuff is necessary and in this
particular unboxing everything is
included there's nothing missing from
the original 1985 package here's a
closer look at one of the two games
included duck hunt I'm pretty much I'm
pretty sure that everybody has had a
chance to play this you get a look at
the high quality graphics on the back
and something I found interesting is
down on the bottom these things only
came with a 90-day limited warranties so
you know as you guys remember they
started to sort of not perform the same
way as they aged I don't know why I
guess that was probably because of dust
etc now you remember these old-school
plastic sleeves the black Nintendo
sleeves they used to ship in as well as
the manuals that slid in the back this
thing's got mint condition manuals
instructions I should say and you got
the Nintendo seal of approval on the
left here's a closer look at the other
game included in the deluxe set this is
gyromite and once again you get a look
at the graphics this game is the one
that integrates with Rob the robot and
it also tells you how to get Rob the
robot completely set up now I'm going to
need this as I said before I've never
owned a Rob the robot this is my first
experience with him so I want to play it
right so anyways here's what he looks
like when he's all set up and ready to
go as you can see he looks kind of like
the robot in the movie wall-e I think
they took their inspiration from Rob
he's the original he's the og of the
robot business and as you can see the
middle portion of his body actually
extends up and down on the neck part you
see the notches cut out there and he
integrates with the game gyromite and
since I have no experience with him I'm
gonna get him hooked up and see how it
all works you've got the coiled cable to
allow for that movement up and down on
and off switches etc this guy seems
complicated but I'm going to play with
it nonetheless I'm going to have some
throwback gaming going on in the unbox
therapy headquarters a little bit of
nostalgic gameplay it's going to feel
real good I'm gonna feel like a kid
again go back to 1985 the funny thing is
I would
actually born in 1985 I'm the exact same
age as this setup right here I hope to
look as good as this thing does this is
really good shape for something of that
age anyway guys if you enjoyed this
unboxing hopefully you can like and
favorite this video as it does help me
out a bunch and also please share this
video because I know there are a lot of
people that would appreciate you know
taking a look at something that was
probably a part of their childhood
anyways once again I want to give a
shout out to a and C Games for providing
this particular deluxe set for unboxing
on the channel a link to their YouTube
channel is going to be in the
annotations as well as down in the
description go check them out let them
know I sent you let them know that you
appreciate what they're doing for retro
games and other than that stay tuned for
the next video on the channel if you
haven't subscribed yet please go ahead

and I'll see you guys on the next one
