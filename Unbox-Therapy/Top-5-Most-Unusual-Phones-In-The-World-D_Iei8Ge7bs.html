video about weird foam my goodness did I
find some strange phones for that video
I decided to take it up a notch the
universe of strange phones is bigger
than I thought and ones in front of me
today are even weirder than the last one
five very weird phones now let's kick it
up with this one we're dudes it's the kr
nein nein nein
this thing is gigantic kind of resembles
the whole Zack Boris giant flashlight on
it triple frequency dual sim dual ultra
long standby Bighorn it's got a big horn
a big horn sheep there it is now who is
in their right mind in a yeah yeah yeah
yeah no it's actually a motorola boy
it's definitely not a Motorola this to
complete the look bring that thing to
the high school cafeteria right well
this is the battery
16800 milliamp hours sometimes these
things are labeled a little incorrectly
this thing does become a power bank SIM
card slots in there an expandable
storage there we go see if it's got any
juice color LCD display FM radio mp3
flashlight pretty yeah serious little
flashlight there is that it
northbound a muffled DB this week we'll
the driver pulled up to the curb the
lady light down her window and asked
excuse me sir where are we the gentleman
on the street replied Saskatoon
Saskatchewan the lady rolled up the
window turned to her husband and said we
really are lost these people don't even
speak English here okay it's a novelty
thing a little bit of fun feel like I
know what this is gonna be good old he
Jack's favorite phone he's a happy
lookin guy though I'm in line at the the
grocery store I'm talking on that but
serious like a serious business call buy
low sell high do you have a little face
here as well in case you're a proper
psychopath
me loves you am i able to power this up
it just goes on for a second and then
dies I don't think it's a power thing
welcome I don't know what that is not a
power thing someone in the audience can
tell us what this says right now that
tell us there you go well I mean you get
the gist of it yeah you get a heart in
the in all the right spots next up this
one's fancy it you've guessed correctly
this is the ultra limited louis vuitton
this is incredible look at this thing it
actually has some weight to it as well
look at that luxury battery compartment
in the back
this plate is thick metal oh another
battery
luxury the menu is like clothing items a
wrench to friendship there's a camera on
here whoa not too many pixels there huh
oh okay
nice little puzzle game there for you
you notice a theme here with these weird
phones they all have some little gimmick
like that look at the flashing it's
bizarre it's certainly bizarre okay next
up it's like a secret phone you could
have this on a shelf or something and it
looks like a model of a car but it's a
backup phone boom call the authorities
oh whoa that battery's large 8800
milliamp hours to SIM cards plus an SD
yeah whoa loudspeaker to SUV theme
carrying through here the headlights
that's kind of cool
another terrible camera 320 by 240 so
the cameras in the front here right
there
it's like a spy camera Range Rovers the
last phone is the weirdest this thing's
gonna blow your mind
filter plus flavor 20 cigarettes what
this is a phone what if you turn it
around it's got a dial pad so must be a
phone right a cigarette pack phone fake
cigarettes in there there's a mini USB
port and space for more cigarettes
that's the weirdest phone show me aware
of phone than that you can't do it
like there's no way they have clearance
on that track for some reason this one
has a Land Rover vehicle in the
background like just because why not it
has a camera as well oh my goodness this
is even worse it's a 128 by 160 pixels
that's the camera on the side of the
thing look at the resolution there
you'll notice that the interface on a
lot of these weird phones is almost
borrowed it's very similar that's an
actual thing that's a phone that's a
moral Berle phone I cannot answer the
why someone somewhere was more
interested in the why not and so be it
it's the weirdest phone in the world as
far as I'm concerned welcome to crazy
town where people's phones are cigarette
packs oh my goodness
