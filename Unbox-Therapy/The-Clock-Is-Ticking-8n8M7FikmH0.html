probably don't know what that means at
least I didn't really until this thing
arrived I did a quick search and I was
like whoa that's cool
it's like some old-school tech that
people are really getting into right now
so I'm watching some old like Russian
videos about these things be in the
original displays for information in
these vast machines I was like I could
get into that because I like tech and I
like the history of it this is a vintage
Nixie tube clock from a company called
past indicator and as far as I know they
are one of the few companies that are
actually manufacturing fully functioning
versions of these I was not expecting
this but I am pleasantly surprised
greetings Louis we are a small company
from Moscow Russia this clock is a
combination of old Soviet Nixie tubes
produced in the 70s and 80s the tubes
are highly reliable they can function up
to 30 years I'm feeling special right
now
look at those they're like packing those
packing uh littles called there's a name
for those things jack has a little duty
packing foam many moons ago anyway
whatever whoa-oh
those are the Nixie tubes those are the
things that are no longer in production
you look closely in there you can
actually see the metal components that
will illuminate to show you the time
there's a couple buttons on the back I
assume that's for setting the time and
then a power port this one is finished
in such a way that it means it just
looks a little more refined
sophisticated if you will I
adapter oh there's an adapter in the box
Thank You Russia shall we dance power
brick plugged in are you ready
are you seeing that Jack and what you
notice like it's hard for you to see but
if you look closely you can see the
illumination as it moves across the
available digits creeps forward all the
way to six and then come back seven
eight nine zero one two three four five
six as it creeps up you know what's
crazy about this tech is that you know
that it's a relic you're looking at it
right now you're enjoying it right now
but you know it's a relic you know it's
time is limited the whole point of tech
is to displace itself the next thing
comes out gets rid of the old one and we
just completely stopped making it
appreciating it for what it was but this
is I mean kind of like a piece of art
this is what people were creating at the
time the cutting edge of display
advancement so this is like a reminder
that you can put on your desk is an
indicator a passed indicator like the
name you see what I did that it's pretty
cool whoo look at those babies glow a
little tech history lesson with Lou so
look them up it's cool tech and it's a
cool thing to put on your desk so you
can wrap the past</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
