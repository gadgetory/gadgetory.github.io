brought to you by Squarespace what's up
guys Lew here bringing you more from CES
2014 and in my hands I have the new ax
100 from Sony a consumer level 4k
camcorder that's going to come in around
2 thousand bucks in terms of specs it
has a one inch back illuminated CMOS
sensor it'll shoot 50 megabit per second
as far as bitrate is concerned and it
can also do full HD AVC HD in 60 P if
you need a higher framerate it has a
nice smooth front ring on it and you can
designate either zoom or focus to that
ring also a nice large LCD for
monitoring your footage essentially
you're getting 4k in a small portable
package that you can use to show on your
4k television or maybe upload videos to
4k on YouTube because it does happen to
support it so you've got some manual
functionality that you'd be used to on
like a prosumer camcorder there's
headphone monitoring you've also got
HDMI out a focus magnifier shutter speed
controls high risk gain control so
there's a little bit of professional
built into it as you'd expect at 2000
bucks but ultimately a very portable
package that you could start shooting 4k
with so anyways yeah that is the FBR ax
100 from sony here at CES 2014 I'll
catch you guys on some more content very
shortly see on the next one
so before I take off to go shoot some
more footage here at CES 2014 I want to
give a big shout out to our official
