iPhone here for a while
that's an iPhone 10's max did I satisfy
anyone no okay I satisfied no one cuz
there's everybody's gonna say oh you
didn't you understand you lights better
and then the other than a flipside
everyone's gonna say why would you do
that why were you using it with so many
thumbs down on the video I'm like I'm
going to switch to the iPhone it's all
crazy to be honest guys I've been saying
it please hear me on this like these
things they're tools like let's not you
don't want to fly the flag alright like
you don't have to carry the torch for
these brands they just want a few
dollars from you that's it that's all
they care about which is fine if the
exchange takes place you get the value
out of it beautiful
well let's not pretend all right that
these things have not it's not pretended
they haven't gotten closer and closer
and close and now they're all basically
doing the same thing but like let's just
be honest with each other I want to be
honest know you so I used it for a while
I went back because like I said in the
previous video I said there's this tough
part about covering Apple as extensively
as you do Android only because they put
out devices once per year and they make
the only hardware for their software so
you end up covering it but there's one
point in a year and then the rest of the
year you're constantly interacting with
all these various Android devices and
switching between and I think a lot of
iOS people feel left out in the content
because it's only like a couple weeks
that I'm even on this device typically
so I went back to it a little revisit
and now this is kind of my report my you
know the mid-game halftime report it's a
great phone it's fine like the cameras
good iOS is fine I could live on it like
it's really not a problem I could easily
live my life on either platform iOS or
Android never know fully into the
iMessage thing just because my life is
is full of different people on different
messaging apps so when people say to me
I can't possibly leave iOS because of
iMessage like that doesn't really apply
to me I got people on text I got people
in whatsapp I got people in slack we
talked in slack in the studio because
we're new we're we're a startup when
you're a startup you gotta talk on slack
so I don't want my platform to tie me
down to a particular messaging app I
just don't like
that concept otherwise everything else
maps over the app experiences are very
similar now of course once upon a time I
felt that there was a real advantage in
the iOS app experience is compared to
Android that's less the case now camera
wise I liked it
I like this phone but it wasn't like
pixel esque for me now this is
subjective this is your own personal
taste it's a really good camera still
for a smartphone and we're talking about
tiny little slivers of potential
difference and potential taste
differences and so forth the knotch you
can see I have a black background so I
still didn't like this notch I never
fully embraced it face idea I lived with
but I put a black background to diminish
the significance of the knotch that's
one of the things that I'm excited to
experiment using something notch less
you could probably guess where I'm going
from there but there's one thing one
painful thing for me on this particular
device it's the notification system man
I just this could be exclusive to me and
I've talked about in the past I get a
lot of notifications likely some of that
has to do with the fact that a lot of
people you know tweet at me and even
though I have stuff turned off
do not disturb my notifications page is
such a disgusting nightmare most of the
day and I'm scrolling down and I'm
clicking X's and I guess I manage I
didn't realize
Android how much of my life I'm actually
I'm actually managing in the
notification pane and how I'm looking
for efficiencies within notifications to
get more done right within notifications
without going somewhere else and I still
feel like as much as Apple has improved
it's still not on the same page and it's
the one thing that when I cross between
platforms that I notice and it's the
most glaring now there are some nice
things I did mention air pods
I find air pots to be very convenient
and pairing them on an iOS native device
super easy to do so seamless you get to
skip a step compared to the Android
counterpart so nothing wrong with the
phone lots of people happy with the
phone it's fine okay it's just fine
bottom line but of course things have
moved on things have progressed and so
it's time to flip over
that's a recap on my experience for the
record I should just say I feel like
since we do have the camps
and you do have the warfare and you do
have the back-and-forth iOS is better
more secure privacy argument ecosystem
argument and then on the Android side
it's more open configurable like
whatever this whole back and forth
scenario that goes on I want it to be
clear at this point that no matter which
phone we're talking about modern
flagship device in 2019 they are more
similar than different ok so the idea of
screaming about it the idea of the the
petty arguments the personal attacks it
really it's it's not only does they not
make any sense but it's it's it's kind
of stupid like it doesn't actually apply
like it is there's no there's not much
of a point to be made there coming from
a guy who uses all this stuff and gets
on with it
and gets on with life and does just fine
so anyhow that's the phone most
requested this is what people want me to
switch to and it makes a lot of sense a
lot of people actually felt that I
didn't go in-depth enough on this guy
like a lot of people were like hey Lou
we want more information where as a
review was a long-term usage scenario of
course it's the one plus seven Pro tons
of attention on this device a lot of
fans for this device specifically yes
it's expensive comparative to their
previous versions but arguably you're
getting more it's a notch list design
like I said latest chipset inside one of
the things I'm gonna miss I'll tell you
straight away wireless charging again
not worth arguing over I understand you
get much faster charging without
wireless but like it's one of those
things it will be nice to have why not
have it I'm still kind of mad about it
but anyway I'll move on I'll get past it
another area of concern for me is right
here on the back on the camera I heard
that they're gonna look at that finish
though holy moly on camera that looks
wild nebula blue here in the camera
Department on a previous version one
plus 60 I went ahead and installed the
Google camera app loaded the apk on
there and saw improvements in the camera
performance so I think a lot of this has
to do with software but if you watch the
original video on this I wasn't super
impressed with my initial tests on a
camera oh not the most friendly there on
the contrast it blew out my cheek
plus to me now it's kind of in the
premium territory I understand the
prices not a thousand dollars but it's
creeping ever closer and when you look
at the spec list and you look at the
experience and you look at the user
experience and in fact that many people
are saying this is the fastest phone out
there with the 90 Hertz display and a
snapdragon 855 it's like yeah call it a
flagship call it what it is so anyhow
it's the switch is happening now and I
should mention at this point that I'll
probably follow up with this to a
certain extent I'll do some check-ins
I'll do some follow ups I'll take your
questions on this transition and
specifically on the one plus seven Pro
relating to certain issues I've already
started to catalogue a few of the
questions and concerns but I'll continue
to take more and likely address them on
the second channel with the more
discussion based format that's the loo
later channel which if you haven't
checked it out I'll link it down in the
description and if you do have questions
specific questions about this you can
hit up Willy do he will I mean he'll try
to go through them they'll try to curate
them it's will at Lew later calm I'll
link that in the description as well and
you can hit him up and then hopefully he
can surface the best questions to me on
that show so make sure to do that okay
so here we go SIM card tray and the sim
is in oh they're all right there we go
Jack it's official the sim is in I'm
back on Android for now like it's no
fanfare nothing to celebrate
all right just saying about the fanboys
situation this is uh this is just life
in the fast lane in the tech game on
YouTube use it all appreciate it all
make the comparisons that's where I'm at
in 2019 let's do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
