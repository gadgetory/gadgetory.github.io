headphones I'm all about headphones
today we've got something called modern
portable hi-fi elite so Jack tells me we
are looking at a budget pair of wireless
bluetooth headphones here around 60
bucks we've got all the controls here on
the ear cup forward back answer and a
phone call play pause mini jack
connector if you want to use them non
wireless bill quality feels decent for
sure alright hold up pairing pairing
mode
it's pairing mode Jack
bingo your phone is connected you're
talking about some thick base in here
big driver units look at the size of the
ear cups 59 is that what you said 59 bus
we might have just kicked off mystery
deal box with one hell of an opening
episode oh it's a small little thing I
have heard about this before it's
something called TARDIS something that
fits into the SD card slot on your
macbook and what it does is gives you
extra storage up to in this case 256
gigabytes so obviously since we've all
moved to SSDs you might not have as much
storage as you would like for your media
files and so on this gives you instant
expansion without needing to crack open
your macbook and try to swap out the SSD
for a bigger one that could be expensive
248 our deal from the point this video
is published it's going to be 15% off
Jack's the guy that really needs this
and you see his laptop boom nine times
out of ten the prom comes up startup
disk almost full I think this I think
there's a sign here I think there's a
reason why this was in the mystery deal
box Jack's trying to tell me something</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
