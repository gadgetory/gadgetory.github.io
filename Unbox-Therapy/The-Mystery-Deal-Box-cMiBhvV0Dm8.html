called mystery deal box
these are deals products that are having
a promotion right now just for you just
for unbox therapy viewers I don't know
what's inside the box I hope everything
is cool jack has apparently vetted these
deals and made sure that these companies
are bringing the heat when it comes to
the products this first episode of the
mystery deal box is also brought to you
by Soylent and their new drink it's
called copyist it's combination
Soylent and coffee now it actually
doesn't taste bad either
it's got like a well a coffee flavor to
it
there's a discount on this as well so
check out the description for all the
details now let's go ahead and jump
inside the mystery deal box that mr.
Jack has set up for me
look at the artwork here ah new new
frames for old man Lou from glasses
usa.com
in the description there's a crazy promo
on these if you wear glasses like I do
you want to switch up the style hey who
knows maybe you're trying to get a date
with that special someone this could be
anything
knowing jack this could be anything okay
kind of similar to what I got on right
now hmm okay oh now that's a bigger
frame right there
so that's if you own it right there yeah
yeah wear glasses
oh I kind of like those actually a
little bit lighter on the face so the
packages they got on the website its
frames and lenses there's like a virtual
tool where it'll scan your face and
it'll put the glasses on your face
oh my we got some sunglass it'll put the
glasses on your face in virtual space Oh
now that's now that's a way to do unbox
therapy right there thank you to glasses
usa.com for participating in the first
mystery deal box I'll continue the
episode with these ones on right here
all right next up
headphones I'm all about headphones
today we've got something called modern
portable hi-fi elite so Jack tells me we
are looking at a budget pair of wireless
bluetooth headphones here around 60
bucks we've got all the controls here on
the ear cup forward back answer and a
phone call play pause mini jack
connector if you want to use them non
wireless bill quality feels decent for
sure alright hold up pairing pairing
mode
it's pairing mode Jack
bingo your phone is connected you're
talking about some thick base in here
big driver units look at the size of the
ear cups 59 is that what you said 59 bus
we might have just kicked off mystery
deal box with one hell of an opening
episode oh it's a small little thing I
have heard about this before it's
something called TARDIS something that
fits into the SD card slot on your
macbook and what it does is gives you
extra storage up to in this case 256
gigabytes so obviously since we've all
moved to SSDs you might not have as much
storage as you would like for your media
files and so on this gives you instant
expansion without needing to crack open
your macbook and try to swap out the SSD
for a bigger one that could be expensive
248 our deal from the point this video
is published it's going to be 15% off
Jack's the guy that really needs this
and you see his laptop boom nine times
out of ten the prom comes up startup
disk almost full I think this I think
there's a sign here I think there's a
reason why this was in the mystery deal
box Jack's trying to tell me something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
