talk about something they got a lot of
press a lot of coverage at CES 2013 it
is of course Nvidia project shield now I
wasn't lucky enough to get my hands on
the device I was too busy and I regret
it but I did need to make a little recap
video if there's anybody out there who
hasn't heard about this device yet I
want to make it really clear what it's
about because after all it's in my
opinion probably the most exciting
device that came out or got announced at
CES 2013 so what is this little thing
well at first glance it looks like a
portable gaming device but as you can
see in this video right here it's a lot
more than that not only can you play
games right on the devices 5 inch 720p
screen but you can also stream content
from a PC that's full on PC graphics
from your PC games so you can stream
them either to the portable device right
to that little 5 inch screen but you can
also at the same time stream that
content to your flat panel display so
this is kind of like a Swiss Army knife
for gaming it can do all kinds of
different things for you most
importantly in my opinion it can take a
PC game which generally has to be played
in front of a workstation and allow you
to kick back on your couch and play it
in a more casual almost console like way
without the need for another console
under your TV so this is a very
interesting device there is no price
announced for it yet and I think if it's
gonna be a killer if it's gonna be in
everybody's home it's definitely got to
be around three maximum four hundred
dollars it'll even play steam games so
it's kind of in a way like a little
portable steam box as you can see here
they're demoing at least the Steam
interface in the presentation they did
not actually play a steam game but they
demoed PC games Android games and also
games from Nvidia's Tegra zone so a very
interesting device I obviously can't
wait to get one thumbs up down below if
you want to see this thing unboxed on
unbox therapy as soon as it comes out
but as you guys can tell a very exciting
very different device from some of the
other stuff that we've seen launched
recently or other stuff that we saw at
CES 2013 you can see the layout is
pretty standard controller layout it has
built-in speakers you can see from a
graphical standpoint it is pretty
impressive
you've got Nvidia power on the inside I
believe they said
thing like 72 GPU cores something along
those lines I'll correct myself in the
description if that's incorrect anyway
guys a very exciting device that I had
to share from CES 2013 if you guys are
excited in this and interested in as I
said before leave a thumbs up down below
thanks as always for watching and I'll
catch you on the next video alright
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
