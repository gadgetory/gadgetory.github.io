another video and today I'm gonna talk
about something that I care about
it's very dear to my heart this is the
concept of wireless charging it is one
of my favorite features on smartphones
yet tough so many models still don't
include the feature today we're gonna
talk specifically about wireless
charging for the iPhone the iPhone great
phone so this little guy in front of me
it's a case you can live on wireless
charging universe like me let's crack
this open
I suppose the benefit is you also end up
with a case in this case you get a case
so a little bit of protection there and
it's from the folks at spigen and they
make fairly reputable cases in the first
place
here it is your favorite Jack see this
little plate in here where it says
wireless charge that's essentially
what's going to enable this activity and
in this little guy here clicks right
into the iPhone and then it's out of
your way you don't notice it the case
itself it's available in a couple of
different colors so soft part to touch
your phone hard part to protect it I
think it looks pretty good like kind of
rugged but not too bulky regular iPhone
6s about to be converted into wireless
charging version easy
all right let's maneuver there you go
look at that so you pull that out this
is all the magic right here this little
ribbon up like this in and that's that
nice and flush I like that it doesn't
wirelessly charge cuz that's what you
want
while lamp blue let me break it down for
you this lamp isn't like any other lamp
my having jack it's a very special lamp
which as far as I know is the world's
first lamp that features wireless
charging look at that can you see that I
made a video about it should I turn on
the lamp first the suspense is killed
now the lamp is low minute truth
pick it up jack regular iPhone with the
case the wireless charging built-in drop
it down Oh what planet do I live on now
it doesn't even need to be an elaborate
wireless charging lamp there are really
cheap wireless charging dock station
platforms that exist on Amazon although
I like the lamp as well because well I
don't
I like lamps you come home from work had
a rough day
tough job the boss well he's an a-hole
you think this place is fun think you're
here for your own personal enjoyment
that's me as a boss by the way right
yeah you come home late at night you had
a few drinks I'm not judging you
you're tired the lights are off
someone's already sleeping into bed
probably a model the last thing you want
to be worrying about is your cable this
is you now
this is the future you you ready ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
