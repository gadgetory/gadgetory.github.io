trial head over to Hulu Plus comm slash
unbox what's up guys Lew here back with
another unboxing video this time we're
gonna kick it old-school for everybody
who's been asking for some straight-up
unboxing goodness that's what this is
it's live my initial reactions I have
never used this device before I haven't
opened this package yet this is the gbx
6900 be there you have it a long and not
too beautiful product name but hey it's
a g-shot unlike other G shocks this one
has bluetooth 4 Oh in it making it a
SmartWatch which is kind of interesting
because you're probably thinking to
yourself how can a g-shot be a
SmartWatch well this one looks like a
standard everyday G shock but it's
packin that bluetooth in there which
gives it the ability to give you
notifications on your wrist it doesn't
have the big beautiful display that some
of the other competitors in the
marketplace have but what it does have
is two years of battery life which for
me is a huge huge factor when
considering a SmartWatch recharging the
Galaxy gear every night or every other
day is just not all that pleasant
especially if you're a person who is
used to wearing a watch on a daily basis
you just want to throw it off your wrist
put it on your nightstand and be done
with it this is also going to be
significantly more resistant to dust and
grime and dirt and shock and water it's
just tough like any other g-shock watch
so it's the best of both worlds you get
a rugged and a wonderful watch that's
tried and tested and you get some of the
smart functionality you get a smart out
of a smart watch so anyways before I get
to in depth with the actual device I
want to give a big shout-out to astral
vibes that is the brand new webstore
that sent this out to me specializing in
G Shock watches you should definitely
check them out you can get pricing and
availability on this G shock as well as
others they have an enormous number to
choose from so the link is down in the
description please follow through to
that link to show them some love for
sending this out
so anyways let's go over some of the
features of this particular watch it has
music controls so you can actually
control the music on your device right
from your wrist these buttons can be
mapped to control different
functionality from pause play operations
to
volume level as well as the ability to
skip tracks it'll also give you incoming
call alert so you're going to be able to
know when you're getting the call if
your phone is say on your desk or in
your pocket or in your backpack or
wherever it might be you can find out
some information about your notification
without needing to pull it out same
thing goes for emails messages calendar
your notifications so on and so forth
now some of the features work on Android
others on iOS it is a multi-platform
device but because of the restrictions
on Bluetooth for Oh as well as a bunch
of other things some things will work on
Android and some will work on iOS for
example tap to mute for an incoming call
which is a pretty cool feature so if
you're in a meeting or something you can
just tap your watch to mute the incoming
phone call alert
that's Android only reminder alerts our
iPhone only and SMS alerts are Android
only according to Casio I have to check
this all out and test it out on both
platforms to be certain but at least it
is cross-platform that is convenient and
there are only a few smartwatches on the
market I think the only other one that's
cross-platform is the pebble if I if I'm
remembering correctly you're going to
get other cool stuff like the ability to
just have automatic updates for the
local time if you travel a lot which I
do so you're not gonna have to obviously
reset the time when you land so it has
world time alarms are the same that's
pretty convenient you can set alarms
from your smartphone instead of you know
you know maneuvering these little
buttons in order to set your alarm it's
also got water resistance up to 200
meters to get a little bit more specific
and something that's really cool is the
phone finder if you happen to walk away
from your phone with this on your wrist
it'll understand that the proximity has
changed and updates you so you don't
leave your phone at the bar or at school
or at work or anywhere you might lay
your phone down when the the range
between the watch and the phone gets too
great it will notify you and it will
vibrate so anyways this has been an
unboxing of the GB X 6900 B I'm going to
be trying
this thing out putting it through its
paces and figuring out how it compares
to the other SmartWatch offerings
whether I prefer it or not I'm a fan of
the G Shock aesthetic I know not
everybody will be but for me I almost
prefer to wear a watch like this as
opposed to something with a big piece of
glass on it because I'm kind of rough
with my stuff and you're always banging
into things with your watch or you know
you might be so since this is a really
exposed item being right on your wrist I
like having you know this rugged g-shock
instead of you know a more fragile
SmartWatch and of course the battery
life that's the big thing
you're never recharging this thing which
is amazing just a single watch battery
and two years 12 hours a day you're
getting your cool phone notifications on
your wrist so anyways got to play with
this some more before giving you guys
more feedback if you have any questions
you can always get at me on twitter i am

me there and other than that that wraps
