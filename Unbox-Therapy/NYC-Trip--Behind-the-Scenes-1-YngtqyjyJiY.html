it is that you do my name is Luis Hilson
tiger and I produce videos for the web
and what's the youtube channel that
people are doing this so most if not all
of you will know me from the youtube
channel unboxtherapy great and so tell
me how long have you been making youtube
videos for and how many subscribers I've
been making videos for close to four
years I believe or maybe we just passed
that anniversary actually I now have
close to two million subscribers the
first videos I've noticed were actually
unboxing and review day where did that
idea come from I had been interested in
the entire concept of unboxing since it
had any place in in our sort of cultural
landscape online it was almost
completely just user-generated content
for the purpose of sharing with
tight-knit social groups no one was
really doing it professionally but I
became obsessed with exploring the
psychology behind why people wanted to
watch these videos and what I could do
to sort of enhance what was already out
there
and now what you're soft you're too soft
okay when a person is looking for a
scope on a rifle they see their target
in the distance which is magnified
through the glass but they have a cross
that goes through the glass and at the
center point is where that bullet is
going to hit that those are the
crosshairs that's the level of precision
I'm talking about don't ever
underestimate yourself okay make slam
took a selfie on an airplane he took a
selfie on an airplane and he never
expected to never underestimate what
you're capable of
so we finished up at the LG event and
they unveil some really beautiful 4k
OLED panels of course we've had this
promise of all that displays for a while
now Psalm at CES now we have 4k
resolution unbelievable blacks as you'd
expect super dark you have that high
contrast kind of look colors saturated
if you're into it this is pretty much as
good as it gets and at 65 inches makes
quite an impact also super thin stupid
thin you already know that to the depth
less than that of my finger so really
exciting stuff on top of that we heard a
little bit from some people from netflix
they got a new solution called netflix
recommended where they're going to show
you or tell you or certify certain
televisions that they think give the
best netflix experience including 4k
remember netflix is one of the few ways
to actually get 4k content on one of
these new tvs we heard from the director
of photography from the new daredevil
series which will debut on netflix he
showed us some exclusive clips was just
a really cool experience all around if
you haven't heard about OLED you need to
know about it now this is the future of
TV I realize that there's a lot of value
in capturing the reaction which you
really only get one shot at because in
many ways that's that's the hardest part
to fake if you're actually excited about
something that comes through on camera
at that very first moment before you
even had a chance to collect your
thoughts and figure out where you stand
on something you start in that same
place as the regular consumer
I know that when I got into it I
imagined it being a professional thing I
i branded the channel as such I I saw an
opportunity there for a more
professional version of something that
was already happening yes that's what
I'm talking about that's the kind of
mentality of I'm looking to them for me
I did see a business side to it and I
saw an opportunity to do it for a living
so much of my channel and what I do
online is a reflection of what I'm
intuitive push it at at a given time I
don't foresee myself ever falling out of
love with whatever it is that's new and
cool I've been that way since I was five
years old the proliferation of social
media means that people like me have
transcended the space of content greater
and become a relationship that audience
members have
there are times in my life where I
recognized more responsibility and I
think for a lot of people that that's
where they would identify the adult
portion of themselves but I think I try
maybe I'm a nostalgic individual but I
try my best to tap into the stuff that I
found exciting the whole way along to
not to not really forget the excitement
associated with being being young or
being or being a kid but I don't think
in any moment I stopped and said well
look at me I'm an adult now I don't
think I ever had that moment I don't
think I ever will
