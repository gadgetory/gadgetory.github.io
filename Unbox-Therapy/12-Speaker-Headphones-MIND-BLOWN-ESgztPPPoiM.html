different headphones here on unbox
therapy it might be the most popular
product category in terms of like total
uploads today though we got something
that's a little bit different from
anything that's been featured previously
they got 12 drivers now if you're
unfamiliar with what a driver is that's
the actual speaker unit inside of your
headphones now you can see they're not
all the same size because each one is
going to perform a different function
maybe you'll be able to have better
spatial awareness as far as where that
sound is coming from I'm thinking about
during video games possibly while
watching an action movie or something
like that but I was looking at the
reviews for these online and a lot of
people are just saying they love them
for music so I'm kind of curious about
how those different functions are going
to make the most out of six separate
speaker units inside of each ear Cup
these are Wireless as well with
Bluetooth range up to 32 feet they say
my expectations are pretty high because
they are an expensive set of headphones
they're called the UFO plus by the way
ooh
so far unboxing experience kind of nice
got some magnets involved you know it's
why I'm always looking for on the side
here some paperwork a nice carrying case
for this hardshell whoo here are the
headphones they fold up it's an over ear
style I like big ear cups alright I find
it more comfortable I find that it
isolates better for me they do spin up
so if you want to get your DJ on a port
for the cable I guess that just means
you could pick whichever is more
convenient for you controls appear to be
over here on the right ear cup that's an
actual button there if I had to guess
probably volume up/down next track back
play pause answer phone calls a cool
cable here it's got a coiled portion to
it so you can feel like a real DJ
temporarily and then it also has a screw
on locking adapter you've got the mini
jack connector screw that on though
that's if you want to interface with
like a mixing board that uses the
quarter inch adapter as opposed to the
mini jack also in the box
a flat micro USB cable to charge those
up pull out my fancy new pixel XL oh yes
enjoying it very much left
your cup right here cup they're big I'm
pretty sure you're not gonna win fashion
points for these ones what about the
sound their headphones Lewis what we're
here for all right
whoa clams with the Muscadet threat from
the ender ship in which today's only
Fazio's we look away for my father said
whoa that did deep that's the most low
end I have ever heard on any headphones
ever brain shattering bass it is thick
when that bass kicks in it's like oh
it's like a subwoofer in there it's
gonna be a subjective thing but my
goodness if you want bass these got it I
want to try some surround sound style
stuff surround sound test yeah this
would be good oh whoa it's like a
shotgun back here it's over here it's
not like a test like this wouldn't be
represented on a regular set of
headphones so for a surround sound test
what you're looking for is that
discrepancy between like sort of way
back here I could easily identify the
location of that sound in this headset I
just noticed something else is cool here
you can actually connect this headset to
two different mobile phones now the
reason that's cool you could have a
couple of different audio sources
feeding into it
there's a microphone I do a phone call
of course I'm gonna give Ryan a call yo
what's going on man well I'm just happy
you finally picked up the phone man
people here on unbox therapy they miss
you they want to see more of you and
more importantly right now they want
your feedback on how I sound
so I think it's fun nine ten uh there's
not much no distortions like we're
the goings pretty good out on your and
how she is but I use it whatever it is
Ryan the people miss you what do you
have to say to them fix my only thing I
had away from me I was a I thought I was
the good guy now now your boy Austin he
rolls in maybe because is it because I'm
not available of that one
name your price how many likes do you
need to come back well it's gotta be on
the people if you guys want me to come
back yeah okay fifty thousand like hey
yo I thought we were never gonna hear it
okay later right thank you
why not pop these open and make sure
there's actually six separate speaker
units and what they look like I pop this
ear cup off there you can see the unit
itself okay and then pop this out and
there you can see the biggest unit of
all on the back there and you can see
the separate wires going to the
remaining speakers these are the five
smaller speaker units and then in the
center here that's the one that's on the
back they're not lying six total speaker
units in each ear cup you want to get
energized it's hard to find a version of
energy as intense as that bass though
you feel like you're getting kicked in
the side of the skull by the thump it's
hard not to get motivated you're a kid
there's a bully you're about to go after
okay I don't recommend probably just
tell your teachers all right no don't
tell your teacher he's some DMX get
these headphones and show that kid
what's up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
