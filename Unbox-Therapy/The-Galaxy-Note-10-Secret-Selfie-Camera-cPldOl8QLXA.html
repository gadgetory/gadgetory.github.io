these concept style videos but this one
got in front of me I was like you know
what there's some cool ideas in here
that I would like to amplify I don't
know if these ideas are possible I don't
know if they're in development I think
this is just strictly a concept
delivered by DBS design and it's a
concept for the upcoming Galaxy Note 10
and creative ideas that could possibly
be implemented in a device like the note
10 now as you can see in this video
right here it's got a crazy camera
layout on the back four cameras I don't
think we'll see that on the upcoming
notes and it's probably gonna be a
triple camera setup similar to the s10
series but then again you have you know
devices like the recent Huawei P 30
that's a four camera set up on the back
of quad camera array but this is more
wishful thinking this is dreaming this
is like the concept of the ultimate
phone bezel lists screen to body ratio
big battery powerhouse that's what
people are thinking when they're
thinking about the note series and in
particular the next generation of it so
keep the clip rolling here we're gonna
get to the good part that really caught
my attention and I think it'll also
catch yours
so obviously it's gonna have to have
wireless charging if it's a galaxy
device in the modern era in 2019 so this
one showcases a similar feature now this
is the part that caught my attention
this is the reason I'm sharing this
particular video because we'll just pass
it there for a minute we talked so much
so many times about this idea of
shrinking the bezel getting rid of
notches getting as much display as
possible onto the slab that is your
smartphone now on the s10 s10 plus we
saw this hole punch design for the very
first time pushing the necessary cutout
over into the corner of the screen I
think it has a big part to play in the
popularity of that particular device
taking a different approach to that
front facing camera but what if you
could implement something like this
particular concept
in this case you have the selfie camera
built into the s-pen so you just pop
that open and you have a selfie camera
now on this particular render this
concept it actually has two lenses on it
as well
possibly a wide-angle and a portrait
lens but imagine if not only you've got
this front facing camera completely
hidden in the silo where the pen goes
but what if it also functioned as a
standalone camera with wireless
transmission to the main device while
being held on its own now obviously
that's a very difficult thing to achieve
from a technical standpoint the S Pen is
this tiny little device can you even fit
a sensor in there well that's of course
up to the engineers to try to achieve
but that's the beauty of a concept you
could just ask for it you could just put
it out into the universe you can dream a
little bit and so that's what's happened
here via DBS design put the selfie
camera into the s-pen what does that do
for you well you could have a remote
shutter release right on the pen to take
the image you can also hide it away so
you're not constantly staring at the
lens in the form of a notch or even a
hole punch the front of the display now
gets completely opened up just for
screen and if you're a person like me
who doesn't use the front facing camera
that frequently not such a big deal and
I could see this being an issue for
things like face unlock if you're a big
fan of face unlock are you really gonna
pop the pen every time you want to
unlock it definitely not
now as cool as this is it seems just
maybe too ambitious for a realistic
product in 2019 I like to see the
boundaries pushed but I just feel like
implementing this thing at this moment
right now with the limitations of
Bluetooth information transmission you
would need a wireless feed of the
preview image that would have to be
seamless is probably not gonna happen
but a cool idea nonetheless and I
thought something worth sharing so I got
to give a shout out DBS design giving
you a kind of peek at what could be in
smartphones maybe not on the next
generation but maybe at some point in
the future assume
the note series sticks around and
depends specifically but just check that
out if you could get this level of
screen to body ratio you could have the
best of both worlds because now the
device that was originally gigantic the
note series I mean it still would be big
but definitely more pocketable because
now you're getting the screen dimension
you're looking for in a much smaller
form factor no cut out no hole punch no
notch that's a cool concept</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
