brought to you by go daddy what's up
guys welcome to the latest episode of in
review this of course is my weekly show
where I look back at the different
products that were featured on the
channel over the previous week and give
you guys a little bit of a recap a
little bit of a casual insight into what
I truly think about some of those items
well since I spent the last week out in
LA for e3 this episode's gonna be a
little different I'm gonna use it as an
opportunity to address a very big
announcement at least in my mind that
took place today at the WWDC event that
took place out in California now if you
don't know what WWDC is it's Apple's
Developers Conference and often it's a
venue for them to launch new products
well today they launched something that
in my opinion is very exciting among
other things but for me the most
exciting is the new MacBook Pro it is
incredibly thin incredibly light and
still it retains the power in fact it's
got more power significantly more power
than the MacBook Pro that I'm speaking
into right now to record this video so
you're going to get something that is
just a hair thicker than the MacBook Air
it's a 4 and 1/2 pounds I believe or
around there you've got 8 or 16
gigabytes of RAM available you've got an
incredible this is the most important
aspect Retina display which is twenty
eight eighty by eighteen hundred pixels
an incredibly high resolution display
for a 15-inch laptop in fact they were
saying the highest resolution ever in
this form factor and I do believe it
I've never personally looked at that
resolution before in such a small
environment you're going to get an
incredible amount of pixel density
meaning your eyes will not have the
ability to discern individual pixels
plus you're going to have a significant
amount more work space all those pixels
equal more space to lay things out
because the sharpness allows you to
resolve things that are significantly
smaller all very exciting stuff that's
probably the most exciting aspect you're
going to get Core i7 processors with
turbo boost up to I believe what do we
got here 3.6 gigahertz the base model
has a 2.3 gigahertz core i7 with turbo
boost up to 3.3
Hertz so lots of speed even though
things have been trimmed down so
significantly you're still gonna get
really nice battery life seven hours is
what they're stating of course nobody
has actually tested this yet they're
gonna get either a 256 gigabytes
solid-state drive or a 512 gigabyte
solid state drive so very large storage
numbers for SSDs in terms of performance
once again we're gonna have to wait and
see exactly what those s as these are
it's point seven one inches thick to be
exact and I did want to get that right
and it's just under four and a half
pounds four point four six pounds you've
also got upgraded graphics you're now
gonna get the GeForce GT 650 M with one
gigabyte of onboard gddr5 memories so a
significant boost in graphics
performance from the previous gen
MacBook Pro you're also gonna get Snow
Leopard shipping on these no that's one
of my time but I'm still using Snow
Leopard you're gonna get Mountain Lion
shipping on these which is incredibly
exciting a lot of new features new
notifications everything was really
covered in the keynote in fact I'll put
a link to the to the keynote down in the
description of this video in case you
missed it I was even live-streaming
during it but as you guys can tell I'm
most excited about this product right
here they even launched new MacBook Airs
and new old-style MacBook Pros that did
not change the design and are going to
be available at a more sort of value
conscious price point to talk about
price the new redesigned model is gonna
start at 20 199 and go all the way up to
2800 before putting your custom specs
into there so you could spec one out to
probably four grand if you really tried
but you can still get the older form
factor unibody design that I'm speaking
into right now with upgraded internal
specs but something you're not gonna get
is you're not gonna get the improved fan
performance which Apple has stated is
going to bring the volume level of the
new redesigned MacBook Pro down
significantly so that is something to
consider I know in my case I do a lot of
audio recording a lot of video editing
so the volume level is very important to
me and having a quieter MacBook Pro is
something I could really really get into
and get excited about you add onto that
the lighter lighter weight for
factor and on top of it all their Retina
display and you can tell guys I really
got to pick this thing up it won't be
shipping for five to seven business days
they are taking orders right now and who
knows if the supply is going to be able
to match the demand it may not actually
get delivered until beyond a week's time
but as soon as I get my hands on one you
guys can trust that I'm going to be
unboxing it reviewing it right here on
unbox therapy on this channel where
products get naked and you guys are used
to it I'll do it in my epic cinematic
style so you guys don't miss anything or
any of the details on the new model the
design etc it's got two Thunderbolt
displays USB 3.0 has been added still
got an SD slot a slightly redesigned
MagSafe adapter of course these are all
far less important than that big
beautiful Retina display the thin and
light form factor and the upgraded
internal specs that should knock your
socks off so anyway guys that has been
your episode of in review as you can
tell this particular item that got
announced here this MacBook Pro sorta
shifted me off my usual focus but we are
going to get back to unboxing videos
over the course of this week in fact
I've got stuff piling up like crazy so
definitely stick around for it but I did
want to take a little break to talk
about and give you guys some more
information on this particular MacBook
Pro in case you missed the event once
again I'll put a link to that event down
in the description I'm also gonna put a
link down there to some of today's best
deals in tech but definitely don't go
buying any older MacBook off of Amazon

lines other than that I'm gonna let you
