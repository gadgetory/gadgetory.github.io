today we're unboxing the limited-edition
version of DC Universe Online or DCUO
for short this game is unique because
it's played exclusively online there is
no offline mode and as such it is
subscription-based and through buying
this edition you receive one month of
free subscription or maybe it's not free
since you bought the game and you
deserve to play it anyway getting to the
box itself we see we've got this paper
sheath which much must be removed and
beneath it is a very high quality
enclosure holding our action figure
which is probably the largest perk of
this special edition
and he has one of those little zip ties
on him that you remember from when you
were a child and you received toys at
Christmas and you hated having to open
the package because he wanted the toy
badly anyhow I'm not having as much
trouble this time around here he is in
all of his glory
this is a high quality action figure I
have to say that's a quite detailed it's
grown-up stuff here boys
same for little kids put him to the side
now let's see if I can figure this out
there's some sort of mirrored cover in
there maybe I get in a different way hmm
I'm going to try a game
wow-whee they don't make it easy on us
it's got to be the toughest job in the
world right here look at that one
mirrored cover followed by another cover
holy smokes there we go and here are the
goodies here is what we all came to see
some paperwork some more action figures
if you want to add to your collection
that you just started with the Batman
here is important information you'll
receive regarding your code to get
online with that subscription some more
useless information and here's the game
itself which unfortunately is in this
sort of cardboard case only I mean
there's some cool artwork and whatnot
but kind of a strange way to store your
game at least compared to the classic
alternative we're used to here's a game
itself
and beneath it it looks like we've got a
collection of comics this looks like a
special DC Universe comic here and next
I believe we have our poster if I'm
correct which also requires a little bit
of work to extract and this I mean the
video probably not doing is our work
justice I mean this is some high quality
stuff you can see some pretty intense
contrast here and if you stick around
until the end of the video I'll give you
some macro close-ups of this artwork so
stick around I recommend it and next I
believe is another comic it is that's
correct
another DC Universe Online exclusive
some beautiful artwork in here as well
as you can see as this unboxing moves
forward there are a lot of items
included this is not just about the game
this is about much more and lastly this
seems to be the the highest quality of
all the different books it's got a
different construction with a better
spine but the the same artwork that we
were getting in the other books that
looks like everything folks and if
you've made it this far then indulge
yourself in the following macro shots
which really help to do this stuff
justice enjoy</div></body></html>
