that I've had on a show in a very long
time
first off you look at this thing and
you're like okay that's nuts the caliber
of the print out here is a bit suspect
then you look at the name you're like
s-pen well isn't that a thing that
Samsung puts inside of the note series
well those are numbers those are buttons
it looks like a phone that's because it
is a phone and now you're just in banana
land what's going on sync contacts music
voice changer a micro sim and it can
store 500 contacts so different and so
weird first thing you see is the sim
tool and some plastic with nothing in it
a very short microUSB cable no power
brick no power brick how much does this
cost will does this have a price wheels
telling me to be be nice because this is
a prototype and so that's fair okay fine
it's a prototype it's still on
Kickstarter currently we'll starting to
feel bad right now well do you feel the
need to come on camera right now to
rectify the situation
I'll hear you out they'll hear you out
what do you got so it's still a
prototype but all the features are there
it's got some pretty cool things man
somebody's patent will wallet again go
on go on this thing has a dual camera it
has a laser pointer a voice recorder a
radio okay so you recommend that
everybody that's watching this go buy
this right now it actually starts at 50
bucks which is not bad so this is will
dues official recommendation official
selection well let's say that you know
yeah well it's still in the package and
you're already selling it but
nonetheless it's still bananas admit
that oh yeah 50 bucks is something I
feel like I could have as a novelty
without feeling too guilty oh I'm just
going like this now trending you know
what yeah okay
it works in spen instead of my s-pen
everyday carry or what EDC baby there
you go well that's hard to imagine
uh there's the camera right there is
that a headphone jack seems like today
that looks like a laser pointer right ah
that's the laser pointer what you think
your buddy but everything must be a fat
wallet your screen powering up zanko
menu this will be your menu oh you know
what
the Navi err is not bad hilly Jack it's
any time a selfie time ready in 3 2 1
yeah not enough memory oh okay good I
don't know why I'm kind of into this
yeah should I put my sim card in here
you didn't think I would there's a SIM
card slot here we go guaranteed in the
comments Lou you should use that
exclusively never been to Funkytown well
what's your phone number
four one six so it has the voice
changers we've seen this in phones
before this is kind of fun I don't know
I don't know that's I don't know well
yeah hey would you use this
no you wouldn't use it for what are you
crazy man like I'm gonna carry this
thing around Plus that thing where do I
put this
this should be their Kickstarter right
here the nav is surprisingly decent it's
better actually than I expected to move
around the little tiny interface there
the cameras I don't always gonna use
that the fact that it can act as a
Bluetooth dialer like you can hook it up
to your smartphone and not pull the SIM
card out that's kind of cool as well but
you know it's a novelty thing it's a bit
of fun mm-hmm well you gotta have a bit
of fun yeah I don't get that much fun
yeah yeah I know I just I heard the last
phone call you had with that girl that
you met it sounds like a nightmare it's
a bit imaginative but from a
practicality standpoint there's just a
lot of features that probably no one or
a lot of people would use there's a lot
in there okay so you're buying one I
mean they gave me a few already so
No No
can we just end off with this shot here
