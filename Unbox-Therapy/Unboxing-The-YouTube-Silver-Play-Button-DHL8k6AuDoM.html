got something special something that was
unexpected and a little bit late frankly
this is the silver play button from
YouTube and they give this out to
anybody who reaches a hundred thousand
subscribers which thankfully we reached
a long time ago but the the play button
is just coming out now to me and to a
number of other youtubers that I've seen
and essentially it's a bit of a reward
for having some success on YouTube
obviously the next major milestone for
us here on unbox therapy would be a
million subscribers 1 million but
nonetheless I thought this was
interesting and I should show it to you
guys since after all you viewers and
subscribers are truly the reason that
I'm able to create content here and able
to receive things like this so the first
thing you'll notice is a note here from
Tom Pickett he is the VP of global
content head of content operations
globally there that makes sense we
understand the dedication and talent it
takes to reach a hundred thousand
YouTube viewers we want you to know that
we don't take your achievement for
granted you delivered the audience now
we're delivering the rewards to
commemorate your milestone of a hundred
thousand YouTube subscribers please
accept our congratulations
this silver play button we know you'll
continue to create amazing content and
bring in more fans so we'll keep looking
for new ways to reward you thanks for
being awesome so that's the little note
that's kind of nice and here is the
actual silver play button whoa cool so
you can see it says unbox therapy
congratulations for surpassing 100,000
subscribers and it's very well padded in
here so there you go I guess now you
guys know what you'll get if you pass
that particular milestone and I do
happen to know that when you get to a
million subscribers it's actually a gold
play button so I've got to find a place
to put this now and then make a spot
hopefully for the golden play button
that will follow this one if we can
reach 1 million subscribers which I
think could happen relatively soon so
there
you have it the silver play button from
YouTube commemorating 100,000
subscribers obviously there are a lot
more review now so I want to say thanks
to each and every one of you for making
my content possible and for making
Awards or rewards like this a
possibility for me I get to do what I
love to do on a daily basis and I am
forever grateful and appreciative for
your viewership to continue to make that
happen so big thanks to you guys big
thanks to YouTube for sending this out
okay now it's time to get caught up on
that giant stack of products behind me
not sure if you guys can see it but
there's a lot of stuff upcoming on the
channel so stick around stay tuned and
if you're not a subscriber yet now is a
great time to become one if you guys
enjoyed this content and you want to
help me celebrate this commemorative
plaque make sure to leave a thumbs up
down below thanks as always for watching
and I'll catch you on the next episode
later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
