going to be taking a closer look at the
Fitbit flex activity tracker so if
you're new to the world of activity
tracking you might not have ever heard a
Fitbit before but they're actually one
of the originators in the space and
they've been making tracking modules for
a while but this one here is the first
one you can actually wear on your wrist
and that's what made it especially
compelling for me because I knew I would
forget to put them in my pocket if I if
I had to be required to do so this one I
can leave on my wrist and never really
even think about it and actually not
even recharge it that often this thing
is supposed to give you up to five days
of activity tracking now I know a lot of
you right now are asking the question
what the hell is this and why do I need
one well if you're like me and you work
on a computer all day and then you can
actually get through a lot of your days
without very much activity and that
is unhealthy so in this particular case
you've got a device to remind you of how
inactive or active you are and hopefully
this thing can encourage you to get up
and move around a little bit more often
at least that's what I'm hoping that it
can do for me because when I'm working
on the computer hours can go by and I
don't even notice so inside the box you
have the Fitbit flex that's the first
item but there is another wristband as
well on the inside if your wrist is a
little bit smaller so you're covered
from small risk to big risk
now what sets the Fitbit flex apart from
some of the competitors in the
marketplace things like the Nike
FuelBand as well as the jawbone product
is the fact that the module inside that
does the tracking is removable so if you
wear out the wristband you're still good
to go you can buy another wristband pack
from Fitbit take your module out and
then install it into those new ones I'll
show you what I'm talking about here so
the brains are on the inside hidden and
protected by the rubber wristband
now when you recharge the device you
will need to pull this out but it really
comes out quite easily I expected it to
be more finicky than it actually ended
up being you then insert this module
into the specialized recharging cable
here and then plug that into any USB
port or USB charger and this thing
actually charges up pretty quickly from
my experience but as I said earlier
you're not going to be recharging it all
that often it's the kind of thing you're
probably going to do weekly and although
that might depend on how often you check
your status and possibly how much
activity you're doing so as I said
before just slides back in the same way
that it came out and just like that your
Fitbit flex is back together and ready
to be installed now it's really really
solid on your wrist it doesn't feel like
it's going to come off you have LED
lights up on the top those things will
give you all kinds of information most
commonly they will tell you when you've
hit certain goals like if you've burned
enough calories for the day or whatever
it is that you were looking to burn then
it will update you it'll vibrate and the
lights will flash so you've got this
module here if you want to sync with a
computer otherwise it can use bluetooth
to sync straight to your smart device
and give you feedback on how active
you've been for that given day so that
wraps up this quick look at the Fitbit
flex I'm actually thinking about doing a
fitness tech kind of series where I try
to drop like 10 pounds or something and
keep you guys updated with you know my
progress along the way maybe sharing
screenshots calories burned my diet I
don't even know if that's interesting at
all but I do know a lot of people who
sit around and watch too much YouTube
and put on too many pounds and that
might be you so you might keep one of
these and maybe you can find out if it
works starting with me as the guinea pig
so if that's something you want to see
leave a little thumbs up down below and
we'll get to work on it but for now
that's all we've got on the Fitbit flex
thanks as always for watching and I'll
catch you guys on the next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
