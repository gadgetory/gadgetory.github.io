to cover them here I'm always looking at
the the latest and greatest in a wide
variety of different smartphones that
are out on the market today I've got
something hot far as I know this right
here is one of the world's first
unboxing videos of this actual device
it's from honor and it's called the 6x
and the crazy part here is you are
looking at top specifications for a
price that's unheard of this baby right
here is going to retail for 249 dollars
these people getting far more
competitive these days so when they
asked me to help them debut the 6x I
said let's do it here we go
it's a 5.5 inch form factors a
relatively large screen as you can tell
there it's one of these trays that
allows for either two Sims or a sim and
a micro SD card to expand the storage
you guys know I'm a big fan of
expandable storage but also the dual sim
option if you travel a lot you could pop
in a local sim and actually have phone
calls hid that sim so you're not getting
killed on the roaming charges and so on
it's got the dual camera setup and one
of the cool things about this camera
it's got a huge aperture that's going to
give you that that shallow depth of
field so you get artistic it's actually
F point nine five not even f1 so we've
got the volume buttons over on the side
power switches in this location over
here the fingerprint sensor this
location which is becoming more and more
familiar for me it's just it's just a
very natural place to put your hand and
the phone obviously is unlocked as soon
as you pick it up the peel listen up ooh
the build here is aluminum silver
aluminum oh my goodness of course your
speakers on the bottom over here
a traditional 3.5 ml headphone jack pop
this baby nano SIM in this location and
then your secondary SIM or your micro SD
in that location micro USB cable to
charge it up and of course your power
brick as well powered by Android what is
this this is running marshmallow right
jack
one thing I like about these devices the
built-in
screensaver images look at these look at
these things this reminds me of a Bob
Ross painting you guys know Bob Ross
unbelievable all right we're gonna
enroll the fingerprint real quick let's
see how quickly it wakes up oh you seen
a lot of phones check that's pretty
quick I mean that's something right
there I'm gonna come in boom can also
launch straight into the camera from the
lock screen if you choose to speaking of
the camera you looking at me looking at
you kaboom
magic course the picture of Jack the
usual picture of jack hard at work as
usual areas taking wide aperture photos
can produce images with a shallow depth
of field recommended for photos of
people or objects within 2 meters I'm
gonna snap a photo of this even after
I've taken the photo see how the bokeh
on the back can you make that out it
hyper focuses you in on a particular
element in the image I like the way we
see things like I focus in on you on the
lens and the surroundings are by nature
of how the human eye works a little bit
more blurry it's not done after you took
the photo if you change your mind
afterwards boxes in focus logo on the
top of the box and then back to the
monitor where I'm seeing myself over
there this is a very cool way of like
sort of stepping up your game creatively
with the photos on your device can
change your f-stop that being the
shallow is depth of field at F point 9 5
and then if I drag it down all the way
to say f-16 you can see that the entire
frame then comes into focus that's
pretty cool right yeah the rear one is
12 megapixels the front one is 8
megapixels perfect selfie or standard
beauty I believe I deserve the perfect
selfie look there's a beauty slider here
so who's that over there Tom Tom what do
you do it can you step in the room
please get in here can't be halfway dumb
Wow look at that beauty right there
that's a different man I don't think
that's me I'm about to I'm gonna have
to hop on the dating site seriously
literally and figuratively a Kickstarter
what I know it's on Amazon launchpad
so this device has the emui launcher on
it 2.0 and that's what's giving you this
kind of appearance that you're looking
at here but it is full fledged Android
so go ahead and put whatever launcher
you want on there quick spec recap this
thing is a 5.5 inch 1080p display 12
megapixel camera on the back 8
megapixels on the front 32 gigs of
storage 3 gigs of RAM and a 33 40
milliamp hour battery alright you get
all that and what would you pay for
something like that huh oh I don't know
jack tell them tell the people tell him
$249 249 the smartphone game has changed
no contract no nothing it's just that's
your phone now I'm just here to show you
guys what's going on in the marketplace
and that's the kind of stuff that's
available now this is the new world the
new age the future 249 you get a new one
every year
249 Jack gets a new one every month let
me know in the comments what else could
you get for 240 minutes
not much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
