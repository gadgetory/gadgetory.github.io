last episode and you understand just how
wild it is now like I feel like I need
to give you a little bit of background
we're down here what's going on who are
these people who is bow like you have no
explanation
who is mo you know the products they
come they come they go it's a whole it's
a whole thing and now we're finally
getting organized you could thank mo for
that okay well what's the coolest thing
you saw during this whole process oh I
remember this a chessboard where the
pieces move on their own it's some kind
of magnetic aspect that got Moe's
attention as well every so often we go
through the old stuff we find a gem
something has been sitting around for a
little while but you're here for new
stuff let's go back to where we left off
whatever it is is light merge cube hold
Holograms in your hand
holographic object you can hold in the
palm of your hand and it'll superimpose
through your phone onto the block that's
my guess
launch any cube app and then point your
mobile device at the merge cube all
right let's let's try it real quick oh
it is a foam cube oh look at this little
guy
this is serious just like minecraft this
is so weird
Hey wow that's pretty wild now obviously
there's various games for this this is
not the only one so it's using the
tracking point exactly it's pretty fast
there cool or not cool
is it the future though you heard it
here will he do I mean where I mean what
did you I mean I mean
29.99 oh man
walmart.com 1497 though i can't find it
on amazon anyway extremely urgent please
hand deliver what world's first
scratch-off Penn Auto lotto scratcher
what
it automatically scratches scratching
win lottery tickets oh he put a few in
here too could you imagine the guy sent
me these scratch off tickets and like I
and I won something significant you'd be
like let's see here with the light so
you can see what you're doing
did I do that wrong I think maybe we go
with the side like this I don't know
maybe we got a deal way one guys and
he's a cool idea but this is the
real-life aspect of what happens here
this thing I put fresh batteries in and
it stopped working almost instantly not
that that could have been you auto lotto
scratch he was putting his best foot
forward and for whatever reason this one
has an issue the light works plus he's
got the message on front the note of
bullying and I mean seems like a decent
guy oh I remember this company they sell
the cheapest tablets 30 bucks or
something this must be their latest well
I mean I have to do a dedicated video if
this is like the new $30 tablet the
world needs to know who knows maybe
there's been improvements make full
evaluation coming shortly Oh remember
this thing might have to hold off on
showing you this one like they were
trying to imply that it's an expensive
milkshake but it's still worth it
because milkshakes in general are
underrated like if you have a good
milkshake it completely changes your
outlook or possibly in the universe
Jack's off theories on diet oh do sit
well with his tongue
this is an unusual-looking box so let's
do this handwritten no wishing you all
the best all right what's up Nathan
thank you very much sir
yes whoa I'm boxed at pee on the side so
modular you can keep clipping them
together super modular so you'll be able
to get two USB a USB a and C or to type
C's yeah look at there's all the modules
that will eventually be out a backup
battery module which is always gonna be
charged I think he's onto something you
could imagine that as different
connectors come out you don't need to
change out your whole power bar you
could just add on whatever it is that
you need and this could be as long as
you need it to be Nathan I think you're
officially onto something sir keep going
Nathan you get my pass here you're onto
something huh the eye ring okay I've
seen that before an alternative to that
pop socket thing what's on the drive
unbox therapy logo we have some unbox
therapy branded eye rings right so this
sits on the back of the phone you hold
it like that I mean essentially like a
ring I don't know if you guys want one
of these maybe I'll give them away but
follow me on Twitter I'll give these
away see that you can stick this
anywhere and then the ring becomes the
dock Star Wars branded lots of them I
have a lot of these to give away put a
link in the description I'll give a
bunch these away I can't possibly use
all of these oh this is too cool I've
had of course various external hard
drives over the years dual Thunderbolt 3
USB 3.1 and it's a docking station it's
your all-in-one home for your laptop
this one is 20 terabytes it also acts as
your docking station so it gives you an
extra USB port it gives you an SD card
reader which you wouldn't otherwise have
so it's got the dual Thunderbolt 3
another USB a DisplayPort so it can be
constantly connected to your display
yeah you can see the scenario right here
it will also charge the laptop over
type-c so it has enough power the bolt 3
which might be the fastest drive on the
planet it is dual Thunderbolt 3 SSD
storage 2.8 gigabytes per second over
Thunderbolt 3 but when you hear
something like that and your guys like
us that are shooting terabytes worth of
media worth of video this gets very
exciting because it's saving you time
the base is magnetic
that is select that's a real advancement
in hardware the ability to transfer at
those speeds is wild I love it all right
I remember back to serial connectors and
USB one we can't have that the media
files are too big for case you're
looking at me in 4k what do you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
