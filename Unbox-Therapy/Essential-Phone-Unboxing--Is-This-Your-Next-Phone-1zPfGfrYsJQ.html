waiting for from the original posts that
I put on Instagram and Twitter I showed
you this phone I've gotten so many
tweets lose when are you gonna show us
the essential bone it's an unusual
design it's a new look it's a new
company it's got the Heritage this
company here it's got the backing of one
of the original guys behind Android as
an operating system Andy Rubin they've
come together to create this device
that's a clean new look a new take on
the Android flagship so I'm incredibly
excited to have partnered with Telus to
get my hands on this device early and
that is the carrier that you will be
able to exclusively by the essential
phone from if you are in Canada so mine
is the black variant it will come in a
few different colors you can check those
out on their website and there will also
be a kit version of this that will ship
with a 360 camera which clips onto the
back of this device similar to the Moto
mod effect that it happens to be the
world's smallest 360 camera and it just
clips on to your phone so you're ready
to use that footage immediately oh
that's a bit of an unboxing experience
right there it's all laid out
it's almost got an iconic appearance to
it now with this cutout at the top for
the front-facing camera a USB type-c
cable and this is a braided cable a
headphone adapter USB type-c 2 mini Jack
can you see the mini jack Jack a power
brick also I believe that's the most
powerful brick I've ever seen with a
smartphone 27 watts this is gonna be
capable of giving five hours of juice to
the device with a five minute charge so
that's pretty impressive there it is
this is a nice that's a nice phone whoa
it feels really luxurious everything is
embedded nothing protrudes on the back
you can see the dual lens system up here
the fingerprint reader there we have the
volume up and down as well as the power
slash lock switch the
SIM card tray type-c connector and the
speaker as well now the construction
here on the outside is titanium making
this probably the first titanium phone
I've ever held as well they compared it
to similar aluminum phones dropped on
concrete the difference is is when it's
tougher to dent so they've used ceramic
here as well as Gorilla Glass 5 now
these two connectors up in the top right
corner that's where the magic happens
with the various accessories that we'll
be able to clip on to there including
the 360 camera that I mentioned earlier
it clips on in this location sits above
the phone a little bit and apparently
it's the smallest 360 camera on planet
earth let's take a look at this display
it's a qHD display and I'm expecting a
fairly slick Android experience here
we're also gonna test out this
fingerprint scanner on the back I'll add
a fingerprint right now whew that was
fast I didn't know how much I was gonna
like this cut out at the top obviously
like I said that's kind of the standout
way to distinguish this phone it's got
this incredible screen to body ratio so
check this out I'll show you the speed
of the fingerprint one thing I will say
this one is so flat across the back
you're kind of like wondering for a
second if you're on top of it but it's
obviously a huge step ahead of the
galaxy s 8 because that one is a weirder
thing to reach it's an odd shape and the
cameras in that location as you know not
a huge fan of the implementation of the
fingerprint reader on the SI so
obviously a very clean OS here also
it's basically pixel it's basically
stock that's wild things actually get
close to that cutout at the top the
little icon there okay so for video
let's see what happens I turn it this
way ah so that's how they get around the
cutout issue is you actually get a bit
more bezel here to grab on to so it kind
of moves it in a little bit so I suppose
that could have been a concern for
people is like if that would influence
your video viewing experience but all
they do is shift the video this way a
little bit and then match it up on the
other side so you have a similar bezel
there that you can grab now
comes to these extreme screen to body
ratios you've seen what Samsung has done
with the SAE and the unusual aspect
ratio and then of course it doesn't
necessarily match up with the video
aspect ratio we're seeing some
interesting implementations of how to
consume media on these devices with
these incredible screen to body ratios I
have to say this might be my favorite
haptic feedback I've ever had on a
device so here's what I was talking
about regarding the drop test the reason
that titanium was used they outline it a
little bit more on their website but
there's an image here which Jack can see
there now where they tested this device
against some of the competitors with
aluminum shells
apparently the titanium on the essential
fared better dropping onto concrete I
suppose that's good I mean after all I
know so many people that drop their
phones having a material like titanium
is probably a good thing now another
thing that I haven't mentioned but it's
standing out to me right now is the fact
that this device has absolutely no
branding on it did you notice that look
at this thing there's not a single logo
on there which is very unusual I don't
know it's never happened before what am
I talking about I've never held a phone
on this channel without a logo somewhere
on it or some kind of writing how did
they manage that you don't even have the
government you know the serial number
the FCC there's nothing it's nowhere on
there this idea of not having to
advertise the brand of the device that
you're using if you're somebody who's
into the most simple designs possible
then I mean you would probably never
choose to have text or branding on your
device certainly for people in that camp
this has got to be your only choice at
the moment I would assume unless there's
some other phone out there but as I said
I certainly haven't seen it it hasn't
come across this table so this dual lens
system on the back of the essential
phone is apparently the world's slimmest
of any system like this in this case you
have one that's monochrome one that's
color and it doesn't protrude at all
unlike some competitors which I'm sure
you're aware of all right so that covers
the cameras on the back but what about
this guy on the front the one that's
getting all the attention this is still
a significant camera here it's capable
of eight megapixel photos and 4k
video okay so for the usual camera test
here let's go in and snap a photo of you
guys looking at me here boom and then
I'm gonna also test the monochrome
sensor now the reason they've gone this
route with the two lens system is to
create better images in low light
there's actually more information as
opposed to what Apple is done in the
latest iPhone 7 plus and likely the next
iPhone where one of the lenses is zoom
and the other one is a more standard
format so the best way to think about it
is they've gone for an emphasis on
low-light performance video mode is
controlled up in this section here and
you can switch between 4k HD and 60
frames per second for fast-moving stuff
I kind of want to test out the 4k mode
okay so low light performance 4k video
mode you can tell it's very dark over
here let me take a quick walk over here
this is dimly lit so this will give you
a better idea of the sensor performance
in a dark environment that's actually
pretty impressive at least on the
display here as you can see there's no
lights on so a little bit more on the
specs just to cover everything off it is
a 5.7 inch display at 2560 by 1312 those
two cameras on the back that I showed
you earlier they're 13 megapixels each
with one being the black-and-white
sensor it's got a Qualcomm Snapdragon
835 processor four gigs of ram and it
comes with a hundred and twenty eight
gigabytes of internal storage the lens
on the back is f 1.85 and the one on the
front is f 2.2 it's also got bluetooth 5
oh and the battery is 3040 milliamp
hours now software I know a lot of
people were wondering when this phone
was announced what software is it gonna
ship with I obviously can't speak to
that since this is not available retail
yet but the version that mine has on it
is 7.1.1 and in terms of the actual
Android experience it's pretty much
stock it apparently matte
to Andy Rubin a great deal that there
wouldn't be any bloatware on the phone
so as you can see it's basically a stock
experience swipe to the left and you see
Google now it's all very familiar and
comforting to be honest to not see any
weirdness going on I think that aspect
of the interface is going to be one of
the major selling features of this
particular device all right so the
speaker it's one of these down firing
things you guys know I'm not that you
just fan of that if you could have
forward-facing speakers it's gonna be
better that said this type of design
this whole screen to body ratio frenzy
that's going on right now I mean I think
the days of asking for for facing
speakers is pretty numbered I mean you
can see even with this device here they
had to do a screen cut out just for the
front facing camera imagine you had to
try to jam speakers in there that we're
facing front facing it'd be tough
alright so who is this phone for I think
Android purists are gonna be really
excited about this thing because what
you get out of the box is kind of
Android as it was intended no fluff no
extras hence the name essential alright
but because of that there's a few things
missing on here that you might have
wanted that are in some other devices
for example this one here is not
waterproof and it doesn't have
expandable storage so a lot of buyers
that might not be such a big deal but
it's something that you need to know
about going into this maybe you get a
little bit back from the durability
angle when it comes to drops and the
titanium and the ceramic and so on and
maybe the overall build as a whole
another thing to mention regarding the
screen to body ratio Wars is the aspect
ratio they've chosen to go with here of
course you're probably familiar with the
galaxy s 8 I made a few videos about it
and as you can tell straight away it's
got this slender aspect ratio on the
screen that's not what you're met with
when it comes to the essential this is a
lot more familiar it doesn't roll off
the edge and certainly when you're
watching video it matches more closely
to the aspect ratio you're used to with
multimedia and one thing more to mention
about the expandable storage at least
with the essential phone you're coming
out of the gate with 128 gigabytes so
it's not like they're giving you low
storage and then
can't expand it it's already pretty
substantial to begin with is that a
silver lining it's a bit of a silver
lining so obviously this is a brand new
device in fact it's not even at retail
yet and it does pack a Snapdragon 835 so
it only makes sense to run a couple
Network speed tests I want to see what
it's pulling from the cell tower but
before I do that I'll also check it on
Wi-Fi we'll do a quick test here now of
course this figure here is gonna be
limited by your local network the router
that you're using and so on all right
now let's turn Wi-Fi off and we're gonna
go with the LTE now okay okay okay
get after it go on now so that's kind of
interesting we actually did a far better
download on LTE than we even did on our
Wi-Fi that's pretty impressive
to be clear this test is being performed
north of Toronto we're on the Telus
Network right now so there you have it
your first look at the essential phone a
completely new brand in the space
obviously this is just an unboxing video
I'm gonna spend some more time with this
in fact if you guys would like to see a
comprehensive review after I've had more
time to use it let me know by leaving a
thumbs up down below and I'll give you
some more feedback from a daily use
scenario I'm gonna pop my SIM card into
here and see what it's really all about
also if you'd like to preorder one of

details will be there so that you can be
one of the first to get your hands on
this device exclusively from Telus here
