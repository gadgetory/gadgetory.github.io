and I have to say it's one of the more
exciting arrivals here at unbox therapy
headquarters because as you can tell
this is gonna require some kind of
performance from myself maybe from Tom
what do you say Tom how to get his
favorite outfit on there is big Tom C
heat up there it is I recall getting an
email about this it's like some sort of
all-in-one karaoke package now if you've
never done karaoke before you really
haven't lived ok you gotta let loose
every so often now maybe you can
lubricate yourself so to speak at least
that's what Tom recommends you know
loosen yourself up so there it's a
little easier to get on the mic and sing
my understanding is that this entire
package is the speaker the microphone
and the karaoke songs all in one box
bring it to a party have a great time
create a memorable experience am i right
did i leading the new era of karaoke
karaoke on the go for the real karaoke
enthusiasts - 5 watt speakers ok I
should get the job done got a built-in
battery so you have to plug it in and it
uses Bluetooth to connect your phone now
looking at the picture on the front a
Android Apple switch so I'm assuming
this works with your smartphone we're
gonna find out let's crack it open oh my
goodness look at that fancy thing right
there gold they sent gold
this feels serious this will make your
star right here you can see the speaker
grilles on each side you can adjust
treble bass echo I suppose this kind of
like reverb volume of the music mixed
with your voice alright there on the
handle and then this is interesting
last next I suppose this for controlling
which track you want to be on play pause
and then a phone logo so what can you
answer phone calls on here as well a USB
port
I don't know I'm confused we're gonna
figure micro USB
then USB mini jack I'm guessing you can
send an analog source into this unit as
well if you like is there English
there's English beautiful so you can put
a USB Drive I guess on the bottom of the
handle with your songs loaded onto it
yes you can so you can save songs record
them hmm let's see if has any juice oh
it does check whoa we're live
reporting live the weather today have
you heard about the wind chill Tom minus
30 degrees Celsius Fahrenheit right Jack
you need to hold a microphone every so
often it's quite an experience really
makes you feel like you're in control
echo echo oh I mean this is fun already
I don't mean there's no music look at me
there's a use right there alright listen
I'm gonna pair this thing up now oh wow
it's already in pairing mode just by
default mic geek q9s connecting
connected so if I go to YouTube House of
the Rising Sun karaoke version Oh
Fuji
and God no you didn't sign up for this
this is not what you're expecting today
uncle Lou on the karaoke for your family
gatherings 1-800 uncle Lou entertainment
for the whole family something that I'm
realizing right now is that it's got
bluetooth so really any audio source
with bluetooth it could be a laptop if
you think about it your phone is always
with you it's a nice little it's got the
karaoke I mean on YouTube you can find
karaoke for all kind should we do
another song
she
run-run
right
right on you're up brother
right on you're up bro see what you got
all that I know you're holding out here
but little do the people know the skills
you possess when it comes to the vocal
cords the voice of an angel is how it's
been described to me by Jack it's not
true here we go
all right then no karaoke for Tom today
DSP q9s it'll lighten up your day unless
you're Tom</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
