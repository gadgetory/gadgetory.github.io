another video and today I have something
big physically large this right here is
some kind of a monster from main gear if
you don't know who main gear is they
make these incredibly elaborate custom
pcs they hit me up they said we noticed
that you've got a Mac Pro you're using
as a workstation well can you allow us
to build a Mac Pro killer and I said let
me think about that for a second sure
what you'll notice about this packaging
is it is incredibly substantial velcro
straps on the side here we go oh my
goodness get this baby out of here
elegantly as possible there it is um I
mean if you don't think that is
beautiful
I'm not sure what to tell you this cool
gray automotive paint your ports and
whatnot are actually on the top heats
coming out from the top your power
supplies up here it's just it's all
really cool I want to check out the
other items inside the box there's a
t-shirt main gear t-shirt wrap the brand
holy cables check this out
tons of different cables here more stuff
in here from the motherboard you have
some extra hardware or way sli for the
graphics lastly is the personal binder
and this is a place to keep all of the
documentation to go with the unit and
it's also got the spec sheet inside
now it's time to talk about the unit you
have main gear written here in black you
have a nice power and reset button metal
build on the front you can see the
blu-ray burner there some more expansion
as well if you want to use it there are
some quick access ports USB 3 there's
even that looks like a FireWire port
audio and then card reader is grill here
and that gives you access to everything
here then you'll run the cables through
this region and it'll keep everything
super clean with the motherboard and the
graphics card as well plenty of USB
ports my goodness dual network ports
sound spit if USB BIOS flash back button
pretty cool and that is just
unbelievable look at the cable
management here little sticky pads
holding these things together look at
this this little channel SATA cables
going to all the various drives there we
go we've got padding in there as well
you're automatically noticing the giant
graphics card there the GTX Titan X in
this location here again mounted
vertically along with the entire
motherboard here is that very special
750 series 1.2 terabyte PCIe SSD stupid
fast main gear cooler mounted on top of
that Insano
14 core processor from Intel Xeon
processor these are your hard drives or
at least this is where you can expand
your hard drive storage the power supply
is mounted down at the bottom and it's
amazing how much space still exists
inside of this unit oh my goodness this
is for people who really want to admire
their hardware you spend a ton of money
on what goes inside why cover it up
light it up once again crazy
specification obviously a Mac Pro killer
as I insinuated earlier it's got 14
cores 28 threads
64 gigs of ECC memory in insanely fast
SSD and awesome graphics I don't know
what else you're asking for and it's all
been put together in this really slick
package this is about as good as it gets
in the PC world in my opinion so that
wraps it up I guess it's time to put
this guy to use big thanks to main gear
