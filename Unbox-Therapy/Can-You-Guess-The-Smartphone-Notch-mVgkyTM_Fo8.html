in the house we're gonna play a little
game today everyone's talking about the
hole punch double hole punch galaxy
situation this is the best time right
now to evaluate the current state of
notches and we're gonna play a little
game
guess that notch with mr. Dave 2d you
got a monitor in front of us here and
we're gonna cycle through some some
popular notches we're gonna do is on the
ones and twos he's gonna DJ for us we
have our first notch on the display
right now you know this not you or this
love this notch
am i guessing you know your guests
you're the contestant I can come in and
help
I'm the call a friend I'm the lifeline
I'm pretty sure this is the ten are okay
wow you even Wow by today's standards
that notch is looking a little big
you know the pixel three XL pixel three
is this the ugliest knotch
I would say yes not just because of its
size but like the the way that it just
disrupts them so you know I think
Google's gonna be happy to forget this
particular notch in the future when I
use this phone actually turned off the
knotch it's gotta be the 16 I say that
too because of the the I support you the
Google search bar I support you 1 + 60
yeah okay I think this is my current
favorite launch well-designed
aesthetically pleasing
what were they calling it will what was
the name teardrop you're a teardrop guy
honey a teardrop even the name is like
gentle the princess girl in neverending
story look at the teardrop okay okay
she's very upset so this is obviously
where WOM + took their inspiration okay
alright what do you got next well we're
getting deeper in a notch game right now
so I'm going with the 5 T I'm gonna say
this is as n phone oh I have this phone
somewhere I didn't I didn't like this
phone very much I didn't use it much I
know this bow own I don't know it may 20
he's so proud of himself he's so proud
of himself what was it what give it away
what gave it away yeah the red button
okay first a red button and then of
course the skin oh that is an iconic
dodge I'd say one of the best not just a
good one
this phone there was something about
this hardware that just felt special to
me
you know it's the gift okay so an iPhone
10 or 10 oh yeah
God that knotch looks big we both been
playing with the s10 and then that thing
seems big now yes that's a one plus five
six what we're talking about you see how
we just merged those memories this
summer's blocked Hollywood blockbuster
The Forgotten knotch
Dave 2d starring as Leonardo DiCaprio
was the offset earpiece I've seen this
thing this same whatever that phone is
I've used it yeah
Huawei p2000 that's what it was ah I
feel like we should have known that one
okay what do you got next I know what
this is or I think I do it's got the
health logo from the from the previous
phone so that's the I don't know because
of the icons this is Huawei again but
this is the p20 that's what I answered
last scroll down okay
holy moly finally sheesh in the comments
right now they're like you guys you guys
suck you're an egg you guys are tech
review guys hate you I'm subscribing it
so I can unsubscribe again let's see the
last one
I don't think it's an LG phone no show
us well we don't is it neither of us
know oh I said that earlier man
smartphones there's a lot of notches out
there 2019 is a notch zone except if
your Samsung you're not free for life
they're embracing the hole punch life
they're not calling it a knotch so the
hole punch to you does not qualify as a
not a knotch by definition is a you know
it's got to come in it's got to be it's
got to be like a peninsula of material
right this is an island I like what
you're doing here I'm not sure I
understand it the hole punch is an
island which notch are you going for out
of the bunch including hole punch which
design is Dave 2d embracing and
endorsing in 2019 it's the one +60 that
knotch feels the most unobtrusive to me
you talk about the neverending story
notch that's right in a couple years
when the hole punch goes to other phones
and it's a little bit cheaper I think
I'd go for that and you will also take
the hole punch over the slider or the
motorized front-facing camera I haven't
used those mechanisms enough long term I
don't know how they hold up the whole
punch looks really clean to me cleaner
in person and using the phone and seeing
how everything interacts with that
hole-punch I like the way that it is but
who knows what's gonna happen
we got folding phones man no okay so who
knows where this is gonna go but
nonetheless that's where it is that's
where it stands right now for now you're
a hole-punch guy no cost too great for a
guy like Dave too deep you're gonna have
hole punches for days you're gonna have
a briefcase full of hole punch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
