therapy and today we're taking a look at
the sink by 50 these are a new pair of
SMS audio headphones for those of you
that haven't heard about them this is 50
Cent's new headphone he's got a couple
of different models the sink is the
wireless model which comes with its own
transmitter the reason for that is
because it uses clear technology which
is superior in many ways to bluetooth
for transmitting audio it will give you
CD quality over a wireless connection
which is really important if you care
about your audio there's actually
another set of headphones in this lineup
as well the new SMS audio lineup that is
they are called the Street by 50 and
they're a little bit less expensive but
you do have to use a cable with them
tangle free cable might I add now these
ones do come with a cable as well an
audio cable in case you don't want to
use them wirelessly at some you know
giving point depending on what your
setup is you can use them either way
wirelessly or wired so they're versatile
in that sense so let's go ahead give you
guys a closer look here get inside the
box and see exactly what's up so the
very first thing you're going to notice
is a real nice carrying case in fact
everything in this unboxing is included
inside the carrying case it's a hard
carrying case so you can trust that it's
going to protect your headphones when
you're traveling or when you want to put
them in storage or anything along those
lines although why would you want to put
them in storage you're gonna want to
listen to these babies right so as I
mentioned before it's a hard case it can
actually stand up it has some feet on
the bottom and you get some nice chunky
zippers along the top everything feels
high-quality at first glance but that's
not the most important aspect we got to
get inside and get a look at the
headphones themselves and the
accessories that are included in order
to get these babies up and running so
the very first thing you're going to
notice is some paperwork from 50 cent we
got a little pamphlet here outlining the
different models in the SMS lineup on
the left you've got the sink in both
black and white and then on the right
you've got the street models in a
grayish black and a blue you can check
all these headphones out at SMS by 50
com that's where you can also purchase
them if you're interested or you want to
see pricing etc we've also got this
little pamphlet here I guess you want to
call it a manual or whatever to tell you
how to get these things working
although it's not too complicated I
didn't have to read it in fact now
they've also included an airline adapter
this is if you're on an old-school
airline that still uses those double
mono adapters and then as I mentioned
earlier you're still going to get a
proper audio cable and it even has an
inline mic if you want to use it for
answering phone calls etc and this is if
you don't want to use this headphone or
headset wirelessly and you just want to
go old-school with the cable and answer
phone calls etc you can do that and you
get a nice right angle connector on this
termination point which I always like
because it's usually a little bit more
durable in your pocket than a straight
connector now you're also going to get a
micro USB cable that's pretty
straightforward that's going to be used
to charge up the headphones after all
they are wireless and this is the other
side of the charging portion you've got
your regular USB wall charger very slim
though once again this is all about
keeping it easy for travel etc and
lastly you've got the transmitter this
is what's responsible for broadcasting
that lossless audio wirelessly to your
headphones on the bottom you've got a
simple on/off switch as well as a micro
USB port to charge this baby up as well
so the last thing in the Box here or in
the carrying case is the headphones the
most important aspect of this unboxing
of course and the very first thing I
noticed is they feel real durable you
know you can really twist them around
unlike some of the competitors on the
market that can't claim the same thing
I'm not going to name any names though
now getting a closer look at the left
ear cup you've got your power button
here as well as your sync button it also
functions as a bass boost button the
headband is adjustable and along with
its flexibility that means this
headphone is going to fit most people
just right you've got the SMS Audio logo
along the top and then on the right ear
cup is the remaining controls volume up
as well as volume down and then you've
got forward and back for skipping tracks
so everything can be controlled via the
headphone without pulling out your
device now on the interior this is kind
of like a luxury car you got leather
everywhere as well as some nice blue
stitching along the headband tons of
padding on the ear cups these are going
to be real comfortable to wear for
extended listening sessions and on the
inside you can kind of catch a glimpse
of that 40 millimeter driver which
should be
more than enough to produce some real
nice bass especially along with that
bass boost functionality now I gotta say
guys I'm impressed with the fit and
finish here especially for something so
new you know a brand new company that is
and as I mentioned earlier you can use
these with a traditional wire if you
want to use them wired instead of
Wireless it plugs in right here on the
bottom and you've also got your micro
USB in that location for charging these
up as you guys can see here I'm really
trying my best to bust these they are
real tough I mean I don't recommend that
you do this with yours but I'm impressed
these things are definitely going to put
up with day to day life just right
anyway guys if you enjoyed this content
hopefully you can like and favorite this
video as it does help me out a bunch and
I'm gonna let you guys go right now and
some real nice images of these sweet
headphones see you guys on the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
