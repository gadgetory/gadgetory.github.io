may not have realized but this here is
the 200th video on unbox therapy channel
and that's a lot when you sit back and
look at it you think about where it all
started how terrible the videos used to
be once upon a time and most impressive
is the fact that you guys stuck with me
the whole way 200 videos strong the army
is there has been by my side and a
really I guess this is just an
appreciation video I just wanted to
reach out to you guys and say you know
what thanks a lot for being here thanks
a lot for being part of this because
you're just as important as I am if
there's nobody to watch the content
there's no reason to make it am i right
about that I mean that's pretty
straightforward all those likes all
those favorites all those comments you
know that that is just as important
as me sitting there in that room with my
camera and getting all the work done so
I guess I just want to reach out and say
thanks and i also want to use this as an
opportunity to celebrate together and
the way i want to do that is by getting
started with those giveaways that i
mentioned a few videos ago we're going
to get it started with the Zelda Skyward
Sword special pack with the golden Wii
mote that's where we're going to start
this is the official giveaway video for
that particular product and we're going
to run the giveaway the exact same way
that I did with the eaten Mobius case if
you're new to the channel and you didn't
get a chance to enroll in that
particular give away all you've got to
do is click the little link down in the
description that'll take you to my web
post on this particular give away all
you've got to do is click that tweet
button leave the tweet the way that it
is don't touch it at all tweet it out
and you are entered very simple very
straightforward it's really the easiest
way I found to both enroll people in a
giveaway and also to track the number of
entrance now you're going to probably
want to follow me on twitter if you
haven't yet only because that's the best
way to track where the contest is going
to ask me when it's going to end etc
i'll probably keep it open for about a
week and it's also a good way to track
the winner because that's how i'm going
to reach out to the winner and get your
address and stuff so once again if you
want to follow me that's twitter.com
slash unbox therapy but as far as the
contest is concerned it's not a
requirement I'll reach out you all find
you if you've made the correct tweet if
you click the tweet button on the post
via
link down below that's how easy it is
now I am going to mix it up a quick bit
just a little bit as some of you know I
launched a brand new website with some
new features now obviously I'm filling
it up with content i don't have it
completely full yet i'm just getting
caught up there's so much stuff to do
but it does have user accounts and it
does have a basic forum where people who
are into this kind of stuff can finally
get a chance to reach out to one another
and so i'm going to throw in a bonus
entry if you leave a comment on the
giveaway post along with tweeting it out
if you leave a comment there say what's
up say anything and you've set up a user
account which is necessary for
commenting then i'll give you two
entries instead of one so that's it once
again to recap all you got to do is
click the tweet button on the link below
on the post that it brings you to that
will give you one entry if you want a
second bonus entry then all you got to
do is leave a comment on that post
although as I said before in order to
leave a comment you got to set up a
quick user account on unbox therapy calm
which could be useful on its own because
that will give you access to that cool
new forum in order to talk to other
people who are into the same stuff that
you are so I hope that wasn't too
complicated I really tried to get it out
as as easy as possible and really the
whole point here is to be able to give
away these products as easy as I can
with as few headaches as possible
because as you guys know from before I
had some headaches using the traditional
YouTube giveaway style so I don't want
that to happen again and once again I
want to say thank you guys 200 freakin
videos who would have thought this is
where we end up am i right anyway guys
until next time until some legit
unboxing videos you know I got product
so I got to get to work and get to it
but I did want to reach out and say
thanks because I really do appreciate
your viewership alright this is getting
too sentimental now I got to get out of
your way alright until next time I'll
see you around okay later guys you're
the best love you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
