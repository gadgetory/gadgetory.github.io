keyboard the keyboard that's on my desk
right now and it's from this company as
yo I've been loving using it this one is
called the MK retro I've actually got a
couple of them here there's three total
and it's a typewriter style mechanical
keyboard and you can see from the
graphic here it's got these circular key
caps it's a completely different concept
clickety clack it's like a typewriter is
it better I don't know first off what
does it say a nostalgic classic reborn
with modern innovations fit for
composing literary masterpieces
introducing the ICO m'kay retro the
typewriter inspired mechanical keyboard
okay cool we got it you think you can
handle it handcrafted round key caps
with clicky mechanical switches this one
specifically is for Windows seven eight
ten Vista if you're holding on what are
you creeping around over there Tom I see
you tiptoeing over there brother
war is best shirt today let's let's open
the box that's what you're here for it's
what I'm here for
we're all here for you look at this look
at this this is how you'll write your
masterpiece right here you get this you
become Ernest Hemingway as you know that
Jack that's all it takes
just distracting me
that's interesting look at that I pulled
off one of the key caps accidentally but
I've kind of cool Jack can get in there
and show you what the switch looks like
apparently these are modified blue key
switches look at this okay so they're
clack e these are those old-school
clacking key caps clickety clackety
considering the fact that they're
circular and unusual I'm surprised at
how even with mine there's also some
function keys play pause multimedia this
I like look at that that is a really
cool implementation for elevating the
back twist this and it they pop up or
down see very nice they give you wrist
pads you put that baby down there and
then what I'll come back and get you in
ten years never mind
Ernest Hemmingway you're gonna be like
Rip Van Winkle do you know who Rip Van
Winkle is his name later Rip Van Winkle
he falls asleep under the tree he wakes
up he's been sleeping for what how many
years like 50 years the world has
changed he's got the beard well maybe
you're not snoozing maybe you're hacking
out your masterpiece but either way the
beard is growing I'll come back and get
you later because you got the wrist pad
now you're comfy I mean it this time mr.
Van der Donck I've got a good crop for
the first time since Rob for the first
time since Rob for the first time since
Rob what are you read man Winkle
alright but this is not the only one
they make this one is the exact same but
in white look at this I know some people
that are really gonna be down with
something like that holy smokes
with the gold trim around the outside
otherwise it's completely identical I
mean it's white on the bottom has a
white cable now the next
is actually a little different an
upgraded version classic edition our
motto and this one is backlit embodies
simplicity and purity and boldness and
what are you doing here
ooh I think I like this one the best
I like this brushed look around the
outside this volume wheel over here look
at that I'm sure you could probably
configure it for whatever these
dedicated multimedia keys I like having
them in this section over here these
keys are added as well over here so
pretty solid as far as like plastic clip
out feet go not as nice with those feet
though I will say wow look at that
elegant and fierce that's actually the
way I like to describe Jack right there
he is both elegant and fierce this one
will go here and you get the idea a key
cap remover but the other ones include
that No
ooh does a little dance just to let you
know it's booting up slow it lights up
where you tap that's a cool mode I
haven't seen that before
unbox therapy whoa check this out so I
can hand select the buttons that I want
to glow kind of lights up around the key
cap as opposed to through it you can see
here this is like a kind of glowing
pulsating situation this one is the
whole board so the thing about any of
these keyboards they're obviously
unorthodox they're a throwback the main
consideration here is definitely style
you are stepping out of the usual design
for a mechanical keyboard whatever suits
your personal style you want to kick it
old-school which one would it be for you
which one is tickling your fancy so or
tickling your fingertips see what I did
with the keyboard thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
