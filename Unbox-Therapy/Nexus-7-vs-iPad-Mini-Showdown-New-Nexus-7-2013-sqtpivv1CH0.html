heavily requested comparison video in my
left hand I've got the iPad Mini and in
my right hand the newly released Nexus 7
let's see how these things stack up
against each other so this is obviously
a tough comparison considering the fact
that the iPad Mini has been on the
market for so much longer than the new
Nexus 7 but it is still currently more
expensive as of this moment right now
and if you need a tablet for
back-to-school you could very well be
comparing the two of them and when I
asked you guys in the Nexus 7 unboxing
video if you wanted to see this
comparison many of you did so here you
have it so let's talk a little bit about
technical specifications starting with
the dimensions of each of the two
devices the iPad Mini has a height of
200 millimeters the Nexus 7 is identical
at 200 millimeters as well the width is
a little bit different because these
have different aspect ratios on the iPad
Mini side one three four point seven
millimeters and on the Nexus 7 side 114
millimeters now depth is very similar
yes the iPad Mini is still thinner at
7.2 mils but the depth of the new Nexus
7 has got a lot closer to that of the
iPad Mini all the way down to eight
point six five millimeters if you're
holding these two devices you pretty
much feel that they're the same thinness
so there's not a huge delta there like
there was with the previous generation
Nexus 7 the layout and the button
configuration is very similar you've got
the volume buttons on the top right-hand
side of both of the two devices but in
the case of the Nexus 7 you're also
going to be adding a microphone port at
that location as well as your power
button it's pretty characteristic of a
lot of Android devices to put the power
button in this location instead of on
the top you've got the camera there and
then the only thing on the very top is
your headphone jack now when we move
over to the iPad Mini you'll notice that
it is pretty similar like I said before
except in that case you're gonna move
your power button to the top of the
device instead of having it on the right
hand side inside each of these two
devices you have very capable processors
on the iPad Mini you have a 1 gigahertz
dual-core a5 chip
and on the new Nexus 7 you have a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
s4 pro that's a lot of words now the
main thing here is how's this thing
gonna perform in real-world scenarios
not just on paper and both of them are
very capable for a number of different
tablet tasks here you can see a physical
comparison we've made a bit of a tablet
sandwich here the new Nexus 7 on top
followed by the iPad Mini below and then
the latest generation full-size retina
iPad below that that's cuz we're gonna
talk about screens now if any of you
have played with the newest iPad the
retina model you know how beautiful that
screen is to look at of course it's a
lot bigger than the other two tablets
that we're comparing in this particular
video but the iPad Mini on the other
hand not so great in fact it has an
effective PPI of 163 163 pixels per inch
which is not that great in today's
marketplace it's 1024 by 768 spread
across seven point nine inches of screen
and the new Nexus 7 just kills that
figure it is a slightly smaller display
at 7.02 inches but it's got 1920 by 1200
323 pixels per inch it's beautiful so in
conclusion we have two very capable
tablets the iPad Mini has been on the
market a little bit longer and it's a
little bit later in its product cycle it
will likely be replaced pretty soon
possibly with a retina version so some
people are gonna say in the comments
that this is not exactly a fair
comparison
but the reason we did this comparison is
because both of these tablets are
available right now and if you're in the
market for one if you really need one
then you will possibly be comparing
these two as of today now the price
point definitely favors the Nexus 7 this
thing starts at 229 making it incredibly
compelling on top of that you've also
got this really pixel dense screen
that's beautiful to look at instead of
the low res screen on the iPad Mini in
terms of form factor it's kind of a
toss-up in the last video I was saying
that I really do enjoy being able to
grip this thing with one hand but then
again certain types of content display
better on this particular form factor so
that's you need to decide for yourself
which one works better it's it's a
slightly subjective choice when it comes
to
form-factor now as most of you know
Apple has been in the tablet game a
little bit longer than Google or Android
in general and that means you have a
slightly more mature app ecosystem
especially for tablets so if there's a
specific app that you need you should
check each of the two app stores
beforehand and make sure that it's gonna
have what you need to get running so in
conclusion you can't really go wrong
with either of these two tablets
although I know most you guys are gonna
be drawn towards the Nexus 7 because it
has those updated specifications and all
of those pixels that being said some of
you are always going to be in the iOS
camp and you know Apple will continue to
sell a bunch of these leading up to the
next release of the next version of
course this conversation is gonna have
to be reopened at that point in which
case we'll be analyzing a brand new iPad
Mini versus likely the same Nexus 7 that
will still be on the market as of right
now I think this is an incredible value
for 229 you can't really mess it up I'll
have links to pricing and availability
on the Nexus 7 down in the description
of this video so go ahead and check that
out thanks for watching if you guys
enjoyed this content please remember to
leave a thumbs up down below and I'll
catch you on the next episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
