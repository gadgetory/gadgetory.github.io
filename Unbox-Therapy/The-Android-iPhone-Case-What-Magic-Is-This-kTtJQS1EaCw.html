get a few peaks from people today I got
one for the realtek heads out there the
real enthusiastic viewers who are
looking for something unusual I promise
you
today's video is unusual this is
something I've never seen before but I
have often thought about worlds
colliding things coming together if
you've been following the channel you
know that I've got love for all
different kinds of tech most importantly
I've got love for iPhone and Android I
use both there are benefits and
drawbacks pros and cons there are great
devices on both sides but today I'm
going to show you something that
combines the two a lovechild if you will
Android and iPhone together at last
you're speaking my language Lou but I
need to know more this product in front
of me is a prototype it's a Kickstarter
right now it's from a company called s T
the founder here he said I'll send you
the prototype is one-of-a-kind gotta be
very careful keep in mind this is not a
finished product it will be a finished
product after the goal is reached but
this is your first look at what an
Android iPhone combination could look
like and it's all through this
particular case so inside the box you've
got this unusual looking thing it
actually is the box your device will
ship in this device here and then
opening it up the actual unit first off
this is a screen on the back you insert
your iPhone 7 plus will work for the 7
as well into the front of the device
it'll keep operating as you'd expect
then this case fits onto the back of it
and it turns the rear into an Android
device now they've obviously got some
super slim device in there because the
whole package once it's together is not
huge the other thing this thing does is
it adds extra battery life to your main
device the battery in here on the
Android side will feed the iPhone side
next up wireless charging somehow I
don't know the claim is that through
this glass display wireless charging
will be enabled essentially for both
devices charging up the first and then
the next the iPhone as well as this
Android device on this side there's also
even a couple of SIM card slots for a
total of three potential phone numbers
you could have two numbers on the
Android side one number on the iPhone
side the finished product will not look
like this in fact
this little dot right here is the power
button at the moment and you activate
the screen by tapping down here and it
has a traditional headphone jack as well
you're excited which are like blue show
me the goods okay
insert the phone into here like so one
of the only prototypes the product that
ships to you will be made of a different
material that have a different fit and
finish it'll also have some
functionality that this one currently
doesn't have like the ability to use the
iPhones rear camera while previewing
what your image will look like on this
display allowing you to use the better
camera module for Southeast that's in
the Kickstarter detail so we'll see how
they execute on that all right I'm gonna
tap down here and look at that oh my
what excute what iPhone Android iPhone
Android look at this this is fully
functioning look at this this is crazy
you have essentially a full functioning
Android phone which has been stripped
down to the bare essentials with the
battery is the SIM tray and somehow
hacked into an iPhone case most battery
cases are already this thick on their
own no screen no phone no nothing I
don't believe this is a finished product
in terms of software we can see it's
actually running CyanogenMod currently
and it's Android version 6.0.1 but again
that's strictly for this prototype the
display on the Android side is actually
OLED it's a 1080p display all the
features are not currently present in
this prototype but there's one that I
want to try out that I think might be
working in here which is the wireless
charging so I have my trusty wireless
charging lamp over here if you missed
that video well let me tell you
something you're missing out oh wow they
weren't lying charging icon alright so I
tried it out on a couple wireless
chargers first the lamp and now I have a
dedicated one it's a little tough to
line it up right now but I'm pretty sure
I know the reason why the ridge here
extends well beyond the display so if
your wireless charger is resting on the
outside it can't really make great
contact with the glass portion which is
where the charging is coming through I
still think it's a pretty wild idea
you're taking an entire Android device
and display and then charging an iPhone
on the other side
but anyhow it's not it's really not
there yet but anyway the priority here
is to give Jews to your main device to
the iPhone and the Android device will
never take from it nonetheless a cool
idea in a in a very slim package the
question now is can he deliver on a
finished product that meets your
criteria from a polished perspective
given what I'm seeing right now it's
pretty promising you're gonna get some
looks you're going to get a few peaks
from people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
