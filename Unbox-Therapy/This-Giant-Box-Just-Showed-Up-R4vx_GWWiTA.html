now I think I know what's inside not a
hundred percent positive but I think I
know what's in here and because of that
I think you should be very excited
anytime you get a package that requires
one of these to get into you know you're
talking about something special you know
what go ahead pause the video and take a
guess in the comments of what you think
this is
play the game properly zero internet
points for everyone who's correct
it's got like these brackets on the top
of but I move it more likely somewhere
there the moment of truth Oh huh like
any good unbox therapy video we're met
with some foam first oh oh oh whoa I'm
gonna just do this like this hold this
last case off of here for a moment oh
[Laughter]
this is a death trooper helmet finished
in alligator it's something like I think
I can't put it on snake or alligator
what is this feels like snake to me oh
this is like some next-level death
trooper this is the highest level boss
right here
I can't even begin to tell you how you
make something like this what I do know
is it's from a company who actually uses
these type of materials for phone cases
and wallets and things like that they're
called element I'm going to link them in
the description but these are a custom
one-of-a-kind pieces that they do my
understanding is that these things are
around 3,000 bucks really what you're
supposed to appreciate here is just the
level of detail as this stuff wraps all
the way around you can see their logo
kind of understated in that section
right there Gold it's really a showpiece
you know what I mean like that can go on
a stand somewhere
hahahahaha
you see that calm this is me from now on
but death trooper Liu meet me on the
bridge
yo hey Tess makeup our fun huh what do
you guys think is this a new this is a
new unbox therapy look right here
you don't need to see my face who wants
to see that thing anyway this entire
helmet it's like I think the whole thing
is custom to be honest it's like a
plastic and mesh sort of mold going on
in there they claim to use a similar
process to how these kind of helmets are
made for the actual films Wow
I get pumped up any time we're looking
at something that's one-of-a-kind okay
but that's not it there's a second box
over there the same size I think there's
gonna be another character in there
let's find out
look we got kylo Ren would you check
those guys out look at this let me try
and let me be kylo Ren real quick oh
baby do what I told you I find your lack
of faith disturbing
good you have disappointed me jack well
he's alright Jack's alright now I know
we're not doing it for real I thought I
told you to follow my instructions ah
this one's super comfy I could do a
whole movie in this Tom look up give me
a kylo Ren quo you go to a Halloween
party you got something this caliber you
win I will fulfill our destiny I can
show you the ways of force I need those
Jedi's oh alright okay cool it's got
like a nose piece it's the level of
detail is amazing there what a cool
thing just in general sometimes you just
look at an object it's just that's a
conversation starter it's like whoa man
go and check these guys out element
cases put this on and all of a sudden
pretend that you're mad at the Jedi you
get the replica lightsaber I don't know
what you do in your spare time how long
could you go in regular life with that
on before you had a serious problem
you think that at a certain point you've
seen it all like if you were to ask me a
week ago is there gonna be an alligator
skin kylo Ren slash death trooper helmet
on the desk a week from now I would have
told you you were crazy but that's the
beauty of this sometimes we really don't
know and that's what makes this job fun
thank you for that</div></body></html>
