another video and as you can tell in
front of me I have an unusual object
this thing came in some unmarked
cardboard I had no idea what it was or
what to expect and I started to pull it
out I'm like oh my goodness
that's an ammunition box are people
sending me ammunition this obviously is
not that this my friends is a speaker
built into an ammunition box what why I
mean it does look cool so maybe the
question is why not something that's
really cool here is you can actually
crack this thing open and look at the
internal components look at that whoa
you can see the driver units here fairly
substantial in size very importantly
that rather large battery down at the
bottom there and then some insulation as
well as some foam insulation this is a
not your run-of-the-mill kind of
off-the-shelf type deal a power switch
over here on the side it also acts as
the volume switch - and then over here
on this side you've got a USB port I'm
assuming that's going to be used to
charge up whichever device you're using
a feed audio into this power mini-jack
and an antenna it seems to be that the
company here the name of the company is
so do orth audio probably thought EO
audio ortho do I assume it's gonna be
the power brick yes sir what looks like
a pretty high quality actually mini jack
cable and it says professional low noise
audio cable why do we have an antenna is
there a radio in here well there's no
way to control the radio is it bluetooth
maybe it does let's boot it up and see
what's cool here you guys should get a
little light see that little light in
there it's kind of cool
also if you inspect what looked like
Kevlar woofers you see those often on
high-end studio monitor type speakers oh
it does have bluetooth it allows your
friends to do what they normally do and
kick you off of your own
speaker you know everybody loves to be a
DJ when bluetooth is involved I like to
call them Bluetooth DJs jack knows about
them have you heard this new this new
band
they're like the coolest some oh this
thing I'm guessing he's going to be no
joke so let's play something real quick
this is a legit stereo in a in a pretty
small form-factor here and it looks in
my opinion fairly badass as well so I
love getting this kind of stuff here at
unbox therapy that I didn't know existed
and being pleasantly surprised yeah you
literally called me during a Bluetooth
speaker video period well now you're in
the video you just left what day and
what changed I got a ton of bills
that I got a new Bluetooth champion Wow
meat Wow new Bluetooth champion
these guys these guys might have brought
their a-game just based on looking at
the components and feeling the weight of
it and whatnot this is what you bring
after you play men's league hockey you
put this thing in the parking lot and
everybody's like excuse me this is
probably going to have a permanent home
in my on my deck there where I barbeque
these are barbecued beets right here and
it's the only way I'll eat them thank
you very much for watching guys
appreciate your viewership it is time as
usual to roll out to roll out whoo
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
