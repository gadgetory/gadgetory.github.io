product called torch 2.0 and this lets
you add heating to any coke Tanny jacket
I guess you could even add it to a
hoodie now I featured something kind of
along these lines in the past it was a
sweatshirt where you put your hands in
the pocket and then there's a hand
heater in there grab grab that thing
grab it what do you got this thing works
a little different they're calling it a
universal coat heater and what I like
about this setup is you get to use your
own coat so you're sure that you've got
one that you like this unit attaches to
the inside and then the battery that
keeps everything juiced up is detachable
just bring that thing inside charge it
up and then you're heating all over
again peel and stick the velcro
installation kit into your coat attach
your torch coat heater turn it on to
enjoy hours of soothing warmth so this
is the main unit microUSB cable I
believe that will be to charge the
battery which is over here it's a pretty
slim standard looking portable battery
seems pretty Universal to me right this
is a standard USB connection other side
benefit if this is in your coat then
you've always got a battery backup for
your phone to power brick in the box
lastly these look like the velcro pads
that the unit attaches to that is
definitely velcro in fact it is velcro
brand velcro the real stuff yeah that's
a grip right there holy smokes ok that's
gonna work and the heating elements I
suppose are just there in there simple
stuff and then over here on this side
this is a pouch and this is where your
little battery pack is gonna go so this
piece is gonna plug in here like that
and then the battery unit goes inside
the little pouch clamp it down that's it
so this is a pretty standard kind of
black coat here and I'm just gonna lay
it out as they have told me to do
alright so now I am gonna remove the
sticker part of the velcro here kablammo
okay that's on there place that in the
center there Jack can you see that there
it really sticks on there and if you
take this pack out it's also the soft
side of the velcro I think that's an
important touch right so it's not the
scratchy teeth side it's the soft side
so you're not gonna notice it if
have to pack out also it's cool that
they've designed a battery bank here
which has LED indicators so you can
quickly reach down hit the button and
see how much charge you have left only
thing left to do this is the interesting
side over here with the power switch red
is high blue is medium and green is low
so on the high setting you can expect
somewhere in the neighborhood of two and
a half hours of battery life and in the
low setting you can get as much as four
hours it is already beginning to warm up
oh man that is nice here we go well I'm
gonna get cooking soon I'll tell you
what Oh me not gonna me huh I'm just
gonna wear this for a bit wait for peak
temperature to kick in from a
functionality standpoint I mean you
noticed the battery pack you're kind of
a weary I mean it feels like you have a
wallet in your pocket sort of oh it's
getting like skin like toasty now oh
this is kind of genius this kind of a
good eye I mean having a battery bank is
already useful on its own you might
already carry one and now you just got
it right here where you need it plus the
heat if I have a long walk to work if
I'm on the bike if I'm on a motorcycle
oh it's cooking I'm going now oh yeah
yeah this is a smart move all right this
is the way to do it you got to be
outdoors a little bit Nicole heck it
comes to the rescue and it's not a whole
different coat and you get a battery
bank plus it's removable and you can
have it in two different coats let's see
how this thing keypads hold up so far so
good they're in there and I just want to
see what the removal process looks like
so let's say you want to keep it in this
coat permanently well you just want to
take out the battery bank so that just
comes out boom
bring that inside charge that up all
right now maybe you want to go a step
further and remove the whole thing let's
see if the sticky pads stay on this
material all right so it does come out
again this is gonna depend a lot on the
material you're sticking it to at first
the back piece wants to come off with it
it is a very strong velcro connection so
I'm not sure I'd be taking it out all
that frequently I think this is more the
kind of thing when you install it you
probably want to leave it there or if
you do take it out you're gonna want to
let this adhesive set in a little bit
longer once you take this off this
becomes a normal coat all over again and
you're not gonna notice these velcro
pads in there just one two three you're
back to heating I think they're onto
something
especially at this price point sixty
five bucks if you're freezing out there
you'll take all the help you can get
what are you doing your shovel in the
driveway 11 pizzas I don't know what
you're up to if you have to be outside
in the weather that we are dealing with
right now you'll take any advantage you
can get the porch 2.0 you never know
what's gonna show up here human beings
they keep making things well-done porch
I think it's a cool idea DIY a detainee
