price today it might be the highest
price we've ever done gadgets under 80
bucks as the gadgets pile up they fall
into all different price categories
let's kick it off with this right here
this from a company called 12 South the
Fermata
it's a headphone charging stand not just
a headphone stand but it has a built-in
micro USB cable do you have a home for
those headphones or is it a cable
factory this thing right here aims to
change that there you can see what it
looks like all set up now this thing
costs around 79 bucks
very nice unboxing experience so far
that's aluminum whoo and that is leather
a good start the bass that was not as
satisfying as I expected it to be power
USB in here's a USB out so this dips in
right here you slot your cable there so
it doesn't jump out cable management
here without having it pinched by the
far edge of the base so this USB out is
to charge up any other device that seems
like the easiest thing ever there's one
screw and one wrench micro USB cable oh
that's nice ooh oh this is nice design
here in this guy here slots right in
there we go alright check that out
alright so if it's not in use you can
hide this cable away well photo earbud
hook Oh even more genius can clip on
here and if you are an earbud style
listener you hook it around here the
headphones you use at your desk and the
headphones that you take out with you
look at that with the little cutout
there
these are from a previous video these
are called warehouse these are bluetooth
headphones that let you link to another
pair of bluetooth headphones so you can
share what you're listening to enjoy
igloo why am i screaming I mean that are
yours as loud as mine oh man I'm getting
blasted hear anything oh man I just
noticed another little touch
that's the reversible micro USB and then
hook it on unbelievable genius the
cables always where you expect it to be
from 12 South that is a cool little
product a lot of attention to detail
next up we have a wireless bluetooth
speaker from a company called I clever
it's under 70 bucks oh look at it
apparently it's got some bass to it
which you know that's the thing I'm
always looking for you don't see many
Bluetooth speakers that look like that
and then you have an LED on the back as
well this is an aluminum base on the top
is where the controls are play pause you
can answer phone calls on here this one
the sound is projecting straight at you
it's got some decent weight to it my
base radar is starting to go you know I
mean the $3,000 $4,000 DVLA speaker I
mean that that's not what this is this
is this is 60 something dollars okay so
let's calibrate for that level of
analysis here like that's one of my
favorite unbox therapy videos ever
traditional analog mini-jack input you
have what looks like a micro SD card
slot so I guess you could load music
directly onto it oh hello there I'm sure
that's to indicate that it's in
discovery mode line her up a podcast why
not you could bottle your enthusiasm be
an awesome pill well maybe we could talk
about so this is a mastodon that was dug
up in a pit years ago oh that's the
great Joe Rogan there his podcast must
listen just let's remember the price
point this is under 70 bucks
all right it's not the loudest thing
I've ever had here but you already knew
that it's not super crunchy like you
turn up the volume it doesn't break down
there's actually a pretty full range
there and it stays punchy and concise
even up there
on a flat surface this might be a good
way to go and a little bit of bass who's
gonna hate on a little bit of bass this
goes back to one of my favorite videos
as well so these things here these
really cool-looking
futuristic lighters from a company
called plasmatic flameless basically
wind proof and USB rechargeable lighters
these are cool for survival-type people
they're cool to have in a backpack if
you need to start a fire have some heat
out in the wilderness basically any
environment you've got the opportunity
to begin the combustion of some sort of
material it's actually really cool now
you do need to recharge them over USB
but then the battery lasts for a really
long time you can read that for yourself
I mean it's right there this has a nice
pattern on it and texture we have a
brushed anyway they make a bunch of
different versions it ignites to 900
degrees Fahrenheit oh my goodness can
you see that here's the cool part if I
blow on it watch it they move around but
it won't go out you're not worried if it
gets a bit wet you're certainly not
worried if it's windy out here we go of
course we got the Don Tomas in the house
this is from the original video good old
Don Tomas like without me even going
near it
for the record I don't smoke I'm against
it alright so the lighter does its job I
don't want to be the guy with the twig
doing this back and forth and all I got
a spark
I think this weather I gotta spot the
family's gonna be standing around you'll
be lose you got that uh that plasmatic
maybe some birch bark and then I hit it
with the plasmatic who's the king of the
castle now huh who's the top of the food
chain now mr. plasmatic that's who in
the past things that show up on this
show they tend to sell out on Amazon so
I'm just saying speed up if you're
interested don't blame me blame the show
blame Jack</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
