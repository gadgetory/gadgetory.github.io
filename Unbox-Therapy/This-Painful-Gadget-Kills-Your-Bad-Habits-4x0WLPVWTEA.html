another video today I got a weird one
and I'm a little bit nervous to be
honest inside here is something called
pavlok it's a piece of tech this is what
I know like what I know is actually
pretty vague
it's a piece of tech that helps you
break bad habits gotta love those the
case study on their site is about
someone quitting smoking but there's
also another guy I think it's the
founder of the company who can use this
tech to quit eating tortilla chips what
does it do it sends a shock to your body
every time you do the bad habit like a
real shock you wear it on your red boot
we are what we repeatedly do excellence
at end is not an act but a habit
Aristotle charge pavlok place it on your
wrist
wear throughout the day pressing firmly
on the lightning bolt will release
pavlok stimulus pair the stimulus with
your bad habit or craving so in the case
enter tortilla chips you shock yourself
enough times every time you eat one and
you start to think of the shock when you
see tortilla chips and you don't even
want to let them in your life anymore
that's the idea here all right reduce
cravings pizza ice cream love pizza
donuts you see the donut you want the
donut zap cuz you gotta press a button
you got to do the shop so you gotta be
honest with yourself still here's the
bracelet lightning bolt on the front is
kind of like a watch this I guess is the
unit oh man I can feel the pain already
it's like a metal brick and a little
microUSB cable
I guess charges this guy up here I mean
how much of a shock can it be they're
selling it to you oh man
it's not gonna be fun so let's say okay
alright I'm doing the habit I'm smoking
the cigarette or I'm eating the chip or
my ice cream doughnuts I'm not waking up
on time I'm a nightmare I'm a disaster
of a human being and then I just press
this when I skip that who should I do it
but press down with nothing you must
need it need to be charged right make
those creepy red lights hey does creepy
so I'm going to go ahead and search for
the app real quick while it's charging
lock essentially what you're doing is
you are kind of hacking your mind in a
sense but you are let's not get it
twisted you're wearing the human
equivalent of a dog shock collar beep
vibrates app you can adjust the power of
these things here let's see if I get
something positive or negative this just
something about getting shocked you know
no fun why do the tap it aah
tap to connect pair okay so so what can
I do as a pretty quick oh damn
yeah it's not a good feeling
why am I being such a wimp here you
again ah that would train me I'm feeling
trained already how do you wanna man
Hedges crazy that's a 50% that's 50% Oh
hundred percent what about my ticker oh
let me go up slowly I'll go to 70 and
then I'll go to 100 mm oh it's not a
little buzz it's a hmm let's go to 100
that shock is no joke the problem is you
still need some self-control you need to
be in charge enough to say when you get
the craving hit the button what is this
tapping thing press firmly on the
Lightning Bowl I am but I could see like
if you truly wanted to get committed to
attach your craving to that shock and
you got the willpower to do it you might
be able to rewire yourself give the
remote to your spouse connected on
bluetooth around the house you pick up
that cigarette whoa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
