therapy and today we're looking at my
new camera the sony hx5v and right about
now you're saying dude what do you need
another camera for don't you have a
digital SLR don't you have a Canon 60d
and the truth is I do I shoot all my
unboxing videos on my Canon and I really
got no problems with it at all I love it
in fact but this camera doesn't attempt
to outdo that other one instead for me
it's gonna serve a completely different
function altogether I want to get more
into casual v-log style event stuff and
now what that means is more midnight
releases more you know just pick up the
camera with an idea kind of stuff you
know not not overthink it you know just
just get up and talk you guys know what
I'm saying and so what that means is I
needed something that I could pack
discreetly not draw too much attention
to myself you know I've brought my
digital SLR to some midnight releases
and everybody's looking at me like you
know I'm from the news channel or
something and and you know I just don't
like that vibe so anyhow there's a
couple of reasons why I chose this
compact even though it ain't that
compact but it is still compact camera
first and foremost it shoots 1080p at 60
frames progressive now why does
progressive matter well most cameras in
this range you know small handheld still
cameras that shoot nice video are gonna
do HD but they're gonna do it in
interlaced video now that means you're
only getting half a frame and it's gonna
interlace two together so you're not
gonna get the most fluid motion also
with 60p progressive you're gonna be
able to do some decent slow-motion stuff
when you backlog it back to 30 frames
for display on YouTube etc let's talk
about the unboxing though I'm going on
I'm really in love with these cameras
you guys can tell the first thing we had
was our USB charger the only problem
with that is it's gonna use a
proprietary connector on the other end
on the camera end and also the battery
needs to be charged in the camera body
there is no external charger for a
secondary battery the other thing that
you're gonna get in the Box is a wrist
strap there is no option for a neck
strap on this camera even though it is
fairly hefty for a compact the reason
it's so hefty is because it's also
got a fat lens on it it's got a 16 times
optical lens with a fairly wide angle of
24 millimeters at the wide end making it
perfect for v-log when you hold it out
in front of you you've also got a
battery compartment here of course
you've got a battery compartment that's
also where you insert your SD card clip
it in and you're ready to go the battery
is supposed to be good for about 500
stills if you're gonna use it for still
photography which I'm probably not
there's that proprietary connector I
mentioned as well as a tripod mount as
you notice on the side you've got
optical image stabilization some of the
best in the business that I have seen as
well as GPS and an HDMI connector for
outputting to your high-definition
display if you want to just check out
your footage the top of the camera has a
lot of your controls you if your control
wheel your zoom your stereo mic and
you've also got a flash up there on the
front of the body is fairly understated
it's all black it's a not glossy no
there's a little bit of Chrome on there
when the lens pops out it's a little bit
aggressive I mean it makes the body
quite a bit bigger but obviously you
don't have to pack it that way so it
don't really matter this is what I was
talking about about this image quality
1920 by 1080 at 60 P this is crazy for a
camera like this I have seen samples and
along with the image stabilization I
can't say I've seen higher quality
point-and-shoot video then this camera
provides so I can't wait to get out
there use this baby give you guys more
content more velox more about myself if
you guys want to see it let me know give
me a thumbs up if you think it's a good
idea anyway guys if you like this
content hopefully you can like and
favorite this video as you know it helps
me a bunch and keeps the content rolling
also if you haven't checked out my new
channel it's called the beast feed I'm
gonna put a link right in front of you
here now I haven't updated that channel
in a couple of weeks I was sick I was
under the weather I'm getting back in
the saddle I'm gonna put up a newbie
speed episode either tonight or tomorrow
and there's gonna be another unboxing on
this channel tonight so if you haven't
checked out this channel go ahead and do
that too anyway guys as always I want to
thank you for watching you guys make
this content possible I'll see you
around later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
