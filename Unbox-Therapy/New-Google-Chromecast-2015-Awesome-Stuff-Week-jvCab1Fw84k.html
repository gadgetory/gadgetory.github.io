another video and today I am finally
checking out the new Google chromecast
this is part of awesome stuff week here
on YouTube and today is must-have Monday
I've been a big fan of the chromecast
for a while using it of course to
broadcast all kinds of different content
up to your flat panel display even doing
something I like to call YouTube DJing
with friends and family where different
people take control of the chromecast
from their device and show their
favorite videos sometimes appropriate
sometimes not so much well the new
chromecast is more of the same but in a
new design as you can tell here on the
right hand side you can see some of the
supported services streaming services
that can be broadcast from your device
through to the chromecast on the back
here you can get an idea of how they set
up works it's pretty simple you can see
on your phone you actually get a little
icon allows you to take anything you're
watching and then broadcast it onto your
television HD streaming from the cloud
surround sound support screen mirroring
from supported Android devices and
laptops that's cool and of course it
supports Android devices as well as iOS
devices so iPhone iPad Mac and then
Windows as well and Chromebook oh cool
okay so the packaging is actually the
instruction manual as well here you can
see how to get started simply plug into
power as well as your television now
some TVs have a powered USB port on them
so you won't actually need to plug into
the wall and then chromecast comm slash
set up on your device the device is
pretty simple magnetic of course your
HDMI connector here on the actual unit
you have a micro USB port of course the
HDMI for transmitting your video as well
as your audio and then a power button
over here we have our power adapter as
well as our USB cable alright so that
pretty much wraps up the unboxing now I
shall connect to this chromecast give
you a better look at the interface and
also cast some things ok so I have a
display here I have the chromecast
plugged into the display now it's time
for setup and it prompts you right away
scroll over to devices here and it'll
show the available chromecast you can
see it verifies the connection we're now
connected over here as well do you see
the code yes I do after the fact you're
going to connect the chromecast directly
to your network so anyone on your
network can interact with the chromecast
you can browse your own apps that you've
already got installed that are
chromecast capable so in my particular
case I have Google Play Google Plus MLB
NBA Netflix UFC YouTube etc this is the
magic that is Google chromecast if you
are unfamiliar from the phone no longer
on the phone on the big display super
simple super easy and really to be
honest with you all displays should have
something like this actually the quality
is pretty good as well one of my
favorite things to do is to set up a cue
like this so kind of want that Leanback
youtube experience for example you can
use the YouTube cue to set up a bunch of
your favorites and they will
automatically cast in sequence so you
can watch one after the other this also
works really well for playlists series
things like that and what's cool is if
you have some subscriptions to like MLB
at bat or what is it NBA gametime and
whatnot so you can see up here right
within the app there's a chromecast
button
we can connect to Jack's cast this game
will begin shortly and now like I mean
this is this is really cool so I'm
taking control of even a live experience
like a live broadcast through the MLB
app and I'm broadcasting that to any
display that this fairly inexpensive
device is connected to I can see these
things being functional for a number of
different users regardless of what your
area of interest is it could be sports
could be MLB could be YouTube could be
Netflix but essentially this is probably
the most streamlined and cost-effective
way to get stuff that you're doing on
your phone or tablet or laptop up onto
any display that's really what the
chromecast is all about this is an
expanding marketplace and they've made
it even easier to interact with this
device I'm gonna watch this game that's
what I have to do hopefully you
appreciate it
content if you did make sure to leave a
thumbs up down below subscribe if you
haven't yet for more content like this
thank you very much for watching and
I'll catch you on the next episode later
