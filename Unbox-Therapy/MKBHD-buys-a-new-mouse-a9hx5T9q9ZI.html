sunshine
we're going to be doing breakfast in
about 15 minutes
are you in okay bye I'm working out so
do you just wake up or what yeah he said
maybe I'll skip breakfast and sleep some
more
yeah I'm stopping here soon they got a
wanted poster in the back with my face
on it what are you looking for
beads for every occasion every flavor of
beads
oh the old school yes there is a chance
that there's another gr in here with a
mouse as a chance all right
another problem P 11 MacBook Air is that
there's no HDMI or anything which is
fine but there's no SD card slot which
is a big problem to have to carry around
extra eyes to carbon and I cheat down by
128 gig back here so I have to keep my
hard drive - if I had this I would not
only be able to have a better screen I
can duck just ditch both of them the
story here is that hotel Wi-Fi sucks but
the room that I have now has an Ethernet
connection which is supposedly faster
that's Coraline
that's highway robbery this is the USB
cable and then a dongle on the end to
adapt it to microUSB I don't know if I
need all that this is just a little
sliver of an adapter on the end of your
cable what I'm totally going to lose
after like 30
decisions Oh Oh what just walking all
casual like that the curved escalator
this is gadget world
this is gadget with gadgets here
world of gadgets it's stuff for your
gadgets oh that okay some ice I know
what you're looking for
oh there it is
there it is man not looking good but
then again there are plenty on there are
plenty of mice up there that are not
down here
Oh
alright folks this is the performance MX
if you know anything about the world of
mousing efforts this is the holy grail
check out the ergonomics on that baby
it's beautiful I think everybody here
has one right three marques John's
gender you have one horse of course
Austin has one I have one Amy
how dare you lie like that I do you have
a performance right now
all right Josh forms MX team MX feels
like home yeah that's a beauty
so you heard it here first if you want
the mouse that everybody uses when the
mouse that Marquez uses and John uses
performance MX all day every day we have
an Ethernet cable now and a thunderbolt
adapter there's a laptop so far speed
tests on regular Wi-Fi are about three
megabits up and down not cool so let's
do it first of all what's under both
side done now I know there's an Ethernet
jack back here yeah I should pick it up
right away
did it mmm that's a sure cable unplug
and plug into me
I know I try one yeah I think that port
might be disabled yeah try one ones
there are these bugs exactly just
dispense mode right now but certainly
clicked
this is it right thunder bolt ethernet
cable unplug planes in there's amateur
tight
oh Sh damn there we go
but in this disaster why it's it's gonna
be I think we might be have some trouble
for you that I don't think it's the
adapter
how could it be a dead port okay we're
live this part the kitchen for some
reason is the only one that's working is
connected but I see oh it just came off
immediately
look at that loading that's not good
right it's not a good sign
damn it why I didn't even how is that
even possible
it's somehow tap it's kept great somehow
Pat they're doing some kind of
distributed thing right now all that
effort and wearing from last year it's a
new iPhone 6 plus case that claims to be
been proved
from a company incipio and their booth
is just over here they denied giving me
one
which of these need to believe that it
is not actually been crude but as a
consequence of that we're going to send
in two mercenaries we got Austin Evans
and mr. John TLB and they're going to
try to work their magic as the non bend
guys to see if they can get the bend
proof case good luck dude</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
