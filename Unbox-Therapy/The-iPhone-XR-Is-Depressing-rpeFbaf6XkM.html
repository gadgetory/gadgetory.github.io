technology on the table right there
that's that that's the latest iPhone
right that's the iPhone 10 are okay fine
no it's the iPhone 4 but it does have
something in common with the brand new
iPhone 10 are some of you probably
already know what that is for those of
you that don't it has the same number of
pixels per inch as the eventual upcoming
iPhone 10 are the 2018 iPhone 10 are and
as you can tell I'm a little bit upset
about it because the iPhone 10 ours is
seven hundred and fifty dollar device in
2018 and I'm sitting here looking at
some screen resolution that's identical
on a device that came out many years ago
when well when did the iPhone 4 come out
June 24 2010 that's when Apple was
capable of putting a 326 PPI display
into a smartphone all the way back then
and they're still doing it to this day
and I can't figure out the reason I know
some of you out there in the audience
are gonna say but Lou on a smart phone
can you really see the difference can
you tell the difference so what about
this PPI well here's the thing in an
environment where we have plenty of
choices and plenty of options especially
at low price points all kinds of
applications have started to take screen
resolution into consideration like
YouTube Netflix and so on where you may
want to trigger that HD functionality to
be able to watch a full resolution video
on your smartphone now not a lot of
people are talking about this but if you
picked up this brand new iPhone 10 are
at 750 dollars you're not gonna be able
to watch 1080p YouTube you can't toggle
that setting because the device is not
capable of it
now I'm gonna bring another phone into
the mix here this is the Samsung Galaxy
s4 when did this come out well 2013 this
device came out it's got a 5-inch 1080p
display for a PPI of 441 that's still
four years ago and of course every
single galaxy s device since then has
maintained at least that
resolution at least 1080p of course
there's ones now with even higher
resolution and you can toggle it to your
own taste now there is a debate
regarding what the human eye can
actually see and at which distance so at
this distance here I shouldn't be able
to discern pixels possibly here I start
to pick them up on this display on the
iPhone 4 if I look closely at a close
range yes I can see individual pixels is
it horrendous does it completely ruin
the experience no I'm not suggesting
that the phone is completely ruined by
the fact that it doesn't have at least a
1080p display the reason I'm angry about
this is because there's not much reason
for it except to distance the premium
product from the discounted one in my
opinion to try to convince people to
step up and spend more money on the more
premium 10s and 10's max but the reason
it's irritating is because the material
cost of stepping up to a few extra
pixels when the scale is there when so
many other smartphone manufacturers are
already using those 1080p displays some
even with a notch like on the polka
phone right here there's an example
there's a 1080p display on a device that
costs $300 how are these aggressive
Android price points being serviced by
1080p resolution because the material
cost on those displays is not that much
that part is ubiquitous it's everywhere
so Apple probably could have given it to
you they just didn't want to they didn't
think they had to and so they did it and
now they're trying to compel people much
like with the the charge brick that's
not in the box for super charge they're
trying to compel people to spend a
little more while still stating hey at
least we have a budget option now to be
completely fair I think a lot of people
are gonna walk into the Apple Store look
at the 10r and be like hey that's fine
for me
for me that's non-negotiable that's just
kind of a jerk move now I know there's
gonna be Apple fans out there you're
gonna disagree with me you're gonna sit
there and say loo Apple knows best Apple
knows how much resolution we need you're
gonna say 326 PPI is the perfect
resolution it's fine but if
was the case then why does Apple sell
premium devices with more resolution why
does the 10s and ten xmax have a higher
PPI for what reason well because it's
not true if you hold those two displays
next to each other you should be able to
discern the difference if you know what
you're looking for now at this point I
sound like an aggravated nerd and
possibly I am and many people out there
gonna be like but I can get the bright
colors on the 10r
for 750 and that's really what I'm in
this for and look if you're one of those
people more power to you these are your
dollars but in my opinion in an era with
polka phones and 1080 screens everywhere
on devices under 500 under 400 under 300
this one for me is the biggest mess up
on this particular device otherwise the
spec list looks pretty good but see the
problem with this as a tech fan is that
we count on the market leaders to push
the better technology forward we count
on them to show us sort of what's
happening and what's important and
what's possible and when you have a
leader like Apple intentionally holding
products back to create these price
discrepancies so they can play in these
different marketplaces without
cannibalizing their premium stuff you
have confusion in the consumer
marketplace or at least a lack of
understanding yes the PPI of this guy
this ancient-looking iPhone 4 is
equivalent to the PPI of the new iPhone
10 arm there are way more pixel dense
displays out there for less money and
you should know about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
