and get started what's up guys Lew here
back with another video and today we're
gonna be doing something new something
fresh often I get asked hey Lou what are
your favorites we know that you unbox
enormous amounts of things but I don't
often get to sit down what you guys can
tell you about my favorites the things
that get unboxed here that end up in my
life long term that I use in this case
as far as today's video is concerned on
a daily basis those are like baby chicks
now these things have shown up in videos
previously so if you wanna I don't know
get some more detail go check out those
videos I'll link them down in the
description this isn't technically tech
but it holds all my tech look you can
see I'm actively using it we got the
baggage tag on there still this is the
pack safe I believe it's the z400 I love
this bag I've been using this bag Jack
can attest to it on trips since I did
the original video for it it's durable
rugged spots and pouches for everything
look at this thing
so a nice zipper pocket on the outside
so solid pull satisfying this zipper can
go underneath this little flap here to
make it tougher for pickpockets and
whatnot so you've got a lock over here
on this side as well and when you pull
the zippers over string them through
there and keep that completely locked
the strap itself is slash proof there's
a mesh cage inside the bag
there's even an RFID safe pouch for your
travel documents passport and so on and
then on the backside this pass-through
for luggage which I use all the time
this strap here if you're not going to
be using it if you're using this more as
a briefcase you can unclip it from this
end and there's actually a channel where
you can store it it's something that I
can't get away from I love it probably
more now than when I even got it so go
check out the original video next up you
guys have heard me talk about this guy
right here this is the MX master mouse
from Logitech this is another example of
something I love more now than when I
got it super comfy to hold it can be
connected to multiple devices it's got
this really satisfying wheel here which
can spin freely or in a geared manner
probably my favorite feature the button
on the thumb rest here see that how I
can click down there and of course you
can map that to whatever you want
through the app I don't know you can't
beat this Mouse in my opinion it's my
favorite mouse on the planet right now
lastly this is probably the question I
get asked more than any other Lou which
phone are you using right now and
honestly I have gravitated back to the
Nexus 6p real nice D brand skin got it
blacked out I wanted that stock Android
experience I did think man it's a little
bit big maybe I don't know maybe I will
prefer something with a slightly smaller
form factor but honestly you can really
I don't know you could take advantage of
the larger screen from a multimedia
perspective nothing too flashy just nice
clean skinless experience favorite tech
pix tech that I'm using right now but
it's also time for the wild card round a
new toothbrush concept a sonic
toothbrush plus cleaning system the aura
clean system they set this baby over
there like glue we want you to check it
out maybe give it a go 99.9% pathogen
removal

all of you beautiful unbox therapy

so here are tips they've given me 3 here
there we go a little power brick a power
cord let's see if we have oh we have
juice my assumption is okay so basically
Wow alright it's I it's UVC rays they've
destroyed the DNA of pathogens here we
are I'm done I'm brushing up getting
spiffy turn it off and I'm going to hit
it right here like this and I can hear
