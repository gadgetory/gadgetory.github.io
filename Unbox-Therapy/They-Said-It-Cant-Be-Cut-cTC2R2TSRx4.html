glove where you couldn't cut yourself if
you were wearing the glove they didn't
call it like uncuttable but it was cut
resistant I went at it with a knife and
while it was on my hand it was true I
had a sharp knife and I wasn't cutting
through the material but of course the
immediate thought afterwards why is this
material not being used in other
products when of course I got an email
from this company called lock toe
industrial bag company these guys have
used a material similar to that I don't
know if it's exactly the same but
something that's incredibly cut
resistant in a bag kind of like a
backpack a couple of straps on it but
even a step further with this one in the
sense that the straps themselves are
also uncuttable cut resistant and then
the lock that keeps everything tied
together allows you to kind of strap
this to something I'm saying you're at
the beach you're at a resort maybe
you're at school in the cafeteria so on
you can kind of leave this thing with
your stuff in it locked to an object
that can't move that's the idea I don't
know I wanted to let you guys know if
it's the real deal if it even works the
uncuttable bag oh my goodness
Louis just a quick update for you back
in September we filmed on ABC's Shark
Tank oh my goodness yeah boy you guys
know this the real shark tank is here
we'll be sending our newest bag to you
this week it's a limited edition color
and pattern made with a fabric we
develop black mint some of the features
locks shut and can attach to a fixed
object slash resistant abrasion
resistant tear resistant water resistant
RFID blocking interior pocket okay
little tech for you in here
glow-in-the-dark camo fabric
glow-in-the-dark if you don't want to
get your bag stolen and maybe you don't
have one of these by the ugliest color
you possibly can no one can steal it
because you're gonna see them from a
mile away
we hope you like it locked oak team all
right thank you
oh this tells me how to use it I think
it's pretty straightforward but anyway
padlock instructions even the shipping
bag is kind of cool
whoa-ohh first things first this is a
lot more heavy-duty whoa
this is actually kind of cool little
pocket here which holds the lock and
that just fits into here when the bag is
in use pull that tight and then this is
the strap right here see so when you
pull it to its full extension you get
these little grommets here and that's
what allows you to then go ahead back
with your lock now let's assume that
this strap right here is wrapped around
a post you would lock this here you
can't get inside the top pretty
straightforward actually but it's pretty
big I mean you could fit you could do
some clothing in there your books for
sure there is a zippered section in
there it's also RFID so you can put your
wallet or your cards in there and then
there's also this big carabiner style
clip so you could have your keys in
there as well I have to admit the
quality is is greater than what I
expected
but wait if this strap is locked around
some object why not just snip the strap
but the strap itself I can feel right
now
a metal braiding in there let's go see
what's going on here okay so I can cut
the fabric see that so I just end up
with this metal here this isn't going to
completely stop somebody but the goal is
to kind of make it a little more
difficult than it would have otherwise
been now the bag part let's see what's
going on here
well now that whew oh wow
I don't know if I'm gonna say it's slash
proof I wonder why this strap wasn't
just this material to be honest because
look at this even with the bunch up
nothing you see in there this stuff
there's my hand is underneath now show
you a full swing what do you say there
brother oh my goodness
whoa ah I mean like I'm feeling it so
that part of it is definitely legit why
is that so tough to cut and then this
strap is just looks like it kind of
normal nylon with this metal right if
you saw a bike lock that just had that
kind of metal you be a little bit
skeptical nonetheless I mean listen
you're never gonna have something that's
theft proof I want to see more stuff
made out of this material I just need to
wear an outfit like this you know do not
use this bag for any type of personal or
bodily protection there goes that idea
look Jack I'm stab-proof why does this
seem dangerous whoa well I punctured a
little bit but not completely there's no
hole on the other side that material is
cool is this what you've been waiting
your whole life for I seriously want to
know I want to see it in the top comment
I don't want to have to see that stupid
spam comment anymore alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
