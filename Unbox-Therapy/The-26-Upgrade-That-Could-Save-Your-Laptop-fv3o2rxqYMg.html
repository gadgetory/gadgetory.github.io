love anything magnetic for as long as I
can remember my favorite character in
x-men magneto although I always wondered
Magneto Professor X because Professor X
I mean he can move any object magneto is
stuck with metallic objects anyway
there's one magnet that I missed
especially and that's the magnet on the
MagSafe connector of the MacBook Pro
anybody who's ever owned a MacBook
you've seen it you've known about it
you've just connected your charger and
not even thought about it
nestles itself up to the connection
point it's quite charming in fact Wow as
you know the latest iteration of the
MacBook Pro no longer has a MagSafe
connector but it's not over because this
company right here VIN puck they think
they've solved the situation not just
for the new MacBook and MacBook Pro but
also any USB C device this is
essentially the MagSafe concept for USB
type-c it's called the pop mag bolt s
and it's capable of fast charging
various devices notebooks tablets
smartphones etc now right about now
you're saying Lou I don't get it what's
the big deal you plug in you unplug get
on with your life well here's the thing
okay I've seen this before
over my years of being a tech enthusiast
and dealing with many people's tech
problems in my personal life I've seen
the laptop fell off the table scenario
somebody tripped over the cable it's all
bent out of shape the laptop you
you don't want that and the MagSafe was
a solution to that problem no problemo
so that's the reason that this is
especially exciting all right I'm gonna
open up the silver one and let's take a
closer look at this thing whoa it comes
with its own case a table SATA first
they're not messing around vim POC is
not messing around okay a substantial
cable there it looks pretty long longer
than I expected in fact a little velcro
cable management on there
and this is what the cable looks like
okay of course two connectors here it
actually kinda looks like just a normal
type C cable now this end is completely
normal because you only need the trip
side on one side this side here will go
into you
phone or your laptop so here's the
magnetic portion look at that it's as
simple as that you see that there Jack
look at that this thing slaps in there
and that's it meg safe is back so let's
give this a shot okay here are my
devices
it's an SI it's a MacBook Pro I'm going
to insert this on this side here so this
guy will just live in there like that
it's time to charge as it often is and
you just line this baby up
Oh convenience that I just saved the day
is the MagSafe back well I don't know it
might be you just get near there Oh
satisfying yeah I thought so this is a
Galaxy s8 insert that into the bottom
there now yes in this particular
scenario you have to get used to having
a tiny little bump on the bottom I don't
know to me it's not that offensive same
idea kaboom
yes it's a long cable - how about that
they're not messing around I guess since
its intended for a laptop it kind of has
to be can I tell them a quick story
alright I don't want to throw anybody
under the bus here and this is why I was
avoiding this story earlier but this
that issue it just happened to me like
two days ago there was a trip over a
laptop I'm not throwing anybody under
the bus
luckily the laptop was ok but the
charger itself was busted now you know
what I just felt I had to tell you I
personal experience with this was which
is part of the reason that I'm this
motivated and wasn't me who tripped over
the thing just to be clear so the other
end of this thing just like you would
normally do with your charging brick and
the magnetic end is on this side oh
there it is dunt dunt
and we're charging the real test is the
trip test I'm put I put my laptop on the
line for this Oh
and dangerous kind of nervous right now
actually use that I use I use this
laptop it's not a decoy oh man here we
go okay course it works though you know
one thing that I noticed depending on
the way you pulled it out so what you'll
see is like if I wanted to pull the
whole thing out I could you just get
used to pulling it off a certain way
like you just flick it up or to the side
and then that thing just stays in there
no big deal right like that it really is
like adding mag saves back to the
MacBook Pro without needing to
permanently modify anything and I've
seen this type of product for phones and
other devices but I think on the laptop
is where it makes most sense because if
somebody walks past this thing you know
that they're there very frequently
sitting on tables with the cable going
to the wall like that's not an uncommon
scenario and this essentially guarantees
that your laptop's not going to go
flying off the table or that your
Chargers gonna get busted or anything
else it's just gone look it's it that's
just it's a simple thing but it's great
question time I like this one from Matt
Bryan here will you receive fan mail
well the answer is yes I have been for a
while there's an address on the about
page of my youtube channel where people
have sent stuff in the past I haven't
done any type of fan unboxing series but
I just spoke to the other people here at
unbox therapy and they think it might be
a good idea some a fan unboxing episode
maybe send me frequently
it could be insane it could be bananas I
don't know leave a thumbs up down below
if you think that might be interested
send some stuff
here's one from Cole how much are you
willing to pay for the iPhone 8 well not
the most fair question because I'll be
buying it regardless cuz I'm going to be
making videos about it here on YouTube
but if I was a regular person like just
just your average tech enthusiast I
think it will be hard to justify at the
rumored price twelve hundred dollars
people are speculating but the Edition
version could start at
1200 or be around a thousand this is
starting to become a major investment
for the average tech head and on top of
that there are so many great budget
phones now it's kind of tough to justify
I will buy it regardless but at $1,200
I'm gonna have a hard time recommending
it to people so here's one hey Lou what
is the weirdest tech you have ever seen
in your life well it's hard to answer
because we get a ton of tech and gadgets
and general weird things here at unbox
therapy
now if you want to know what that
thing's for you got to tune in to the
next episode of question time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
