another video and today i am bringing
you something exclusive you're about to
look at some i phone 7 renders that have
never been seen anywhere else I received
an email recently from an individual
named Gert van ruphylin from the
Netherlands I'll put a link to his site
down in the description what he did is
he took all of the leaks all of the
rumors regarding the iPhone 7 and boiled
them down into these beautiful visual
representations of the upcoming iPhone
there was talk at one point about a7 pro
but it looks like the Plus will kind of
represent the pro lineup in a sense that
it will have some added functionality
now when looking at the cameras that's
where you're really going to be able to
tell the difference between the iPhone 7
standard and the iPhone 7 plus they both
got raised cameras but on the plus
there's likely to be a dual lens system
so this kind of setup could exist for a
couple of different reasons you could be
looking at two different focal lengths
maybe two different sensors there could
also be some optical zoom in one of the
lenses this is something that people are
excited for this of course would allow
you to get in closer on an image without
getting that kind of broken up look that
exists via digital zoom as you can tell
in these renders the standard iPhone 7
appears to show a more traditional
camera layout just one lens rather than
two but chances are it won't be the same
camera that you've got in the 6s instead
it looks like there's going to be a
bigger sensor in this upcoming model
bigger sensor generally means bigger
pixels which would result in better
low-light performance so it looks like
the seven will have a slightly better
camera whereas the seven plus on the
other hand is going to have this really
cool dual camera layout now something
that appears to be all but guaranteed at
this point is the lack of a headphone
jack on both the 7 and the 7 plus every
single leaked rumor including these
renders does not represent a headphone
jack on the bottom of the device instead
you will likely get an adapter inside
the box which will convert from
lightning out to mini Jack I don't think
lightning headphones are going to be in
the box and I don't think they're going
to include wireless ones and there is a
little bit of a silver lining here in
the sense that you now have stereo
speakers in the low key
nation where the headphone jack used to
exist better speaker no headphone jack
now the thing is even though nothing's
being called the 7 Pro instead it's
probably going to be 7 and 7 plus
chances are the plus is going to operate
more as a pro model it's gonna have
probably more RAM who knows what other
specs that might be superior but also a
connector that has shown up in all the
leaks and rumors as well as in these
renders this smart connector on the back
of the 7 plus that is rumored connector
is something that's been seen before on
Apple products it exists in the iPad pro
and in that case it allows you to
interface with keyboard cases in the
upcoming iPhone my hope is that this
smart connector will enable wireless
charging something I've been looking for
in an iPhone for a very long time but on
top of that maybe third parties can tap
into and create their own accessories ok
lastly let's talk about color what you
will see in these renders is a jet-black
iPhone 7 now will we see that won't we
this is one of the rumors I'm a little
bit more skeptical about all those other
colors look really familiar jet black
not something that Apple has done the
closest would have been on the iPhone 5
which was darker than the current Space
Gray I don't know if this happens that's
definitely the one I'm gonna pick up
though I just think it looks really
slick and hey more options is always a
better thing so there you have it some
exclusive renders of the upcoming iPhone
7 and 7 plus let me know down in the
comments which version would you be more
likely to go for or are you just gonna
stick with your old version or maybe
you're all about Android let me know
let's have a little vote</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
