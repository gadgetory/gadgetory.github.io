here in a long time in a while at least
as what will tells me you know I like to
look at laptops all the whole wide
variety of them the crazy stuff is
happening on the gaming end and that's
where this guy comes and we've looked at
some some unbelievable predator laptops
in the past I don't know it was like 20
pounds the thing was nuts it's like a
briefcase
this one might hold a candle to that one
that's how wild what's inside of here
actually is this one is called the
predator triton 900 and it's got a hinge
unlike anything I've ever seen before
yes it's a gaming laptop yes it's got
top-tier specs but I'm most interested
in seeing this hinge design because it's
a completely new take at least as far as
what I've seen and definitely in a
gaming laptop space for me so holy I
mean you could tell straight away
looking at the box this is different
it's got a transformer vibe it's got a
mech warrior look it has the Intel Core
I $9.99 a thk processor a 17-inch you HD
IPS LCD panel graphics come in the form
of g-force r-tx 2080 with 8 gigabytes G
DDR 6 5 12 plus 512 PCIe nvme SSD raid
this must be powerful oh they're not
goofing with the power brick look at
that bad boy right there jack you see
that all right that's how you know you
have a real system going on all right
none of this goofy little fancy boy type
a laptop this is what you carry around
now like a real man you see that Jack
look at this experience we're about to
have together collectively whoa so this
is a totally different idea like it's
still relatively slim for what it is
it's got some weight to it what's the
official weight on this we'll so it's 9
pounds all right so you won't want this
to be in a backpack every day let's put
it that way and then the magic part
comes into play when you do this whoo
you never saw that jack you don't know
anything about that you see so it's got
this dual mechanism I guess you could
flip it the other way if you wanted to
show somebody something on the other
side wow you bring us all the way down
like there if you had an external
keyboard and mouse you might want to the
footprint it's smaller you get to
display closer to you so therefore it's
more immersive the whole thing feels
crazy sturdy as well 3840 by 2160
display do you see through this glass
panel you can see the heat pipe in there
get this unusual trackpad so the
trackpad is kind of in portrait mode I
don't think that's such a big deal
because most people that are looking at
a laptop like this are also gonna be
looking at an external mouse all right
so as far as IO is concerned there's a
lock power switch Thunderbolt USB type-c
old-school old-fashioned USB you have a
networking connection there's another
traditional USB port right there you
have analog audio jacks what is this is
that just an extra USB port that pivots
you press down here it flicks out and
then the USB port is like that and then
it can push back in and hide I believe
based on a documentation that this is an
xbox controller port but I assume this
could work for any type of USB dongle
that you wanted to keep connected
permanently without having it stick out
the side of the laptop when you want to
travel with it boom you slide it in and
it's protected in this region and then
you can just pop it out alright the
remainder of the ports are on the back
over here you have a display port HDMI
port and a power connector there's also
as you can see all kinds of grills in
place for heat management a laptop like
this you're gonna hook up a mouse as far
as I can tell you're not gonna be
specking out something crazy like this
paying these big bucks for the gaming
hardware without hooking up one of these
in my opinion it's a quick DoubleTap to
bring up the keypad the number pad I
needed people are humans using the
number pad a lot I don't know oh it's
also a touch screen jeez it's a lot
going on here
now the screen actually looks really
good it's super vibrant the colors look
good as well it's an IPS LCD so
I mean it's about as good as it gets for
that particular technology willsez the
keyboard is mechanically has a you know
I'm very particular with laptop
keyboards this is still low profile
you're not getting really nice big key
switches but there's a surprising amount
of travel and clicking is here Sims
audio sounds pretty good how much volume
they're gonna need to produce ace I mean
it's it's fine but it's definitely not
what you would expect this is something
that's weird that happens is like you
get this really big beefy laptop and
you're like oh yeah there's plenty of
space for speakers this thing should
pound and then that's often not the case
I've heard laptops a lot louder than
this that are not as big and bulky as
this Oh some charming about this laptop
the speakers aren't that good I'm
charmed oh let's get will in here come
on well let's go what are we doing for
watch Willy do resident game expert
overwatch champion a dabbler some say
we're gonna catch a look now at the
intention of a laptop like this in its
natural habitat
oh did you turn on the frames will oh
there goes ain't no limit to this
remember no limit the record label
competitive we have overwatch League
competitor what's the name of the
Toronto team defiant Toronto the fire
yeah you put yeah you're the substitute
if they're missing a player defiant gets
Willie dude but you gotta get all you
get Otis as well if you get Willie do
you get both
take the keyboard is really nice the
keyboard is nice I like it
oh so this is one of the one of the
characters that flies yep it's kind of a
flight or the bass you know
there we go there's a kill look at you
you should have a Jersey on right now do
this
there you go but the fans are kicking up
now yeah you got the fans going now so
we're getting our first taste of
not too bad though not yet it's
acceptable eye candy I can live with
that will is so focus ring I've never
seen you like this before I've never
seen well like this is killer kill right
now where was so into this right now
oh my god it's so much happening Bob is
coming out yes Willie do how about the
display it's nice pretty smooth
it's only 60 Hertz yeah your monitor
might be your monitor might be a slight
difference but it's for Kato
porque ya it doesn't make a difference -
but I think it's more about the
millisecond response time response time
yeah okay part of the trade is a part of
the deal mmm-hmm hey you're gonna that's
a pretty good guy just thinking now yeah
but you know yeah
that's pretty rare for me so yeah I hope
you caught that that was a nice figure
I'm sorry go on
go on I never saw Willie do like is we
were trying to move on with the video
yeah overwatch is my girl that's uh I'm
pretty yeah I enjoy it he's sitting
there admiring what he just did
yeah it was a fun fun road let's close
it up you got lost in the moment I did I
think it's because you were gone you
were somewhere else yeah you're here
anymore now the 17 inch display I feel
like it's really immersive you're close
to it so close to it and like the
keyboards right there it's it's a nice
setup you had a time mm-hmm well I'm
glad we brought you on for this you
should give it a shot I'm glad we
brought you on for this one this hinge
really changes the experience it does
yeah that's a big difference it's a big
gap from there to there it changes the
feeling of it I was looking at your
expression how's Julie I never saw you
like that before so I don't think that's
a weird kind of way to evaluate the
effectiveness of a product 3,000 so it
starts at 38 months three $800
yeah well it's a pretty penny well yeah
well let's just take about it let's just
look at this transformer ask slab of a
thing I think this might be the one to
tell you I never saw him like this guys
this is love I think he's in love is
this love
it's the Triton 900 predator Triton 900
it's a cool thing on planet Earth we're
agreed there it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
