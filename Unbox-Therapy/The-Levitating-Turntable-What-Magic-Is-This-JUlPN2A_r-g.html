it's a bit different it's quite
different in fact this my friends is the
world's first levitating turntable the
turntable itself it levitates it's like
old meets new the old tech with the
vinyl turntable this thing is not cheap
it's like an art piece it's like the
statement is for somebody who has
everything
it's called maglev audio you could check
out their website there's a couple
different versions of it they raise like
half a million bucks now I have a
turntable I've used one in the past
alright you've seen it here in the
channel a far more basic turntable than
this one
so this is on another level from the
stuff that I've used in the past
obviously and I don't know maybe there's
an argument here that there's actually
some added practicality we have nice
little felt mat anti skating wait couple
Allen wrenches this is the counterweight
oh some high-quality audio cables
included now this is the portion that I
believe levitates this thing looks super
high quality smells high quality yeah
this is the part that's gonna levitate
you can see the design here with the
various spokes on it and here is the
turntable it is a project carbon arm
that thing is expensive on its own okay
let's get it set up this thing is pretty
wild there's a bit of a setup process
you have some normal turntable stuff
like the counterweight the anti skate
weight and an angle these pegs allow you
to line up the bottom of the turntable
if you if you take a look at it right
here these various magnetic portions
this is impressive for a couple reasons
not just because it's sitting there
floating but because it then has to spin
at the correct pace at the correct rate
to playback your record accurately line
this thing up kind of fights you a bit
there we go so we put a record on
perfect now we're gonna set the knob
here to 33
and at this point very shortly you're
gonna be completely levitating you see
this look at that boom
levitation now the arm is ready to go
but it's waiting for the record to spin
at the proper rpm that takes a second to
get up to it so keep an eye on the
needle
you see what I'm saying here listen to
this
[Laughter]
now you can still lift up the tonearm
like you normally would on any type of
turntable you can move it over to say
different track and drop it down
there's nothing holding on to this
platter
you might look kind of like it because
you have the arm over here but there's
nothing it's not touching anywhere the
only place it's touching is where the
needle meets the record that's it
shout out the brach beragon take over
his new record check them out
and then just flick this top off to the
off position and watch what happens here
he comes
so they will grab the platter and at
this point this is where you would
switch the record if you wanted to or
potentially flip sides like this
should we just actually just play some
more music
okay obviously this thing is super cool
I mean I feel the responsibility at
various times to bring you the cool
things that show up here at the studio
you can imagine in a dimly lit room some
stark minimalist environment and just a
floating turntable with the proper
record you are elevated in that moment
you you you reach beyond the
stratosphere and into outer space
temporarily through a levitating
turntable this thing is called the mag
Lev what's the price well I hate to tell
them I hate to tell about I gotta tell
up twenty nine hundred bucks but those
of you that already have everything this
is something else that you probably do
not have currently it's getting tougher
and tougher to blow people's minds you
have some guests over a couple of drinks
levitating turntable sounds like a good
time to me
