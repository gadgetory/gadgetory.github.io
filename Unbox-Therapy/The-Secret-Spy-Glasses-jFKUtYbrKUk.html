an item to be featured here on the show
is it a terrible idea I think so you
might to to let Jack do anything in fact
surprise this place hasn't burnt down so
what does he do with all of that freedom
to select an item he buys these right
here what are they Jack are they the
glasses of a businessman no they're not
there's some kind of perverted camera
glasses hidden inside of these frames is
a 1080p camera or so it says 1080p HD
camera eyewear works with Windows 2000
in case you were wondering in all
seriousness I don't know maybe you're an
investigative journalist you want to
head over to McDonald's to prove that
the Big Mac on the picture isn't the one
that showed up in front of you when you
bought it
and now you're mad maybe it'll end up on
WorldStarHipHop maybe that's who these
glasses are for the reporters of
WorldStarHipHop can I open the damn box
yet Jack Oh
Lee called tough Steve have you ever
seen a happier man it all started when
he got his pervert glasses things
started to look up oh okay here we go
has a power brick that looks like they
hijacked it out of a box for an iPhone
or something like that cleaning cloth a
USB cable to keep it charged now no
these are not prescription oh nobody
actually you know what the way they have
it kind of as a skin looks almost like a
screw would you be able to tell
something is wrong here I don't know if
you're kind of a slick dude maybe you
could get away with this and people
don't even know you're recording sir I'd
like to order a Big Mac of course I'd
like some fries as well was that English
or Irish what was it it was neither was
leprechaun how do you even there's a
button on the inside I must be Oh blue
light went off oh that looks like the
camera on that's like a little tiny
light there I'm guessing the microphone
is on the other side now it's flashing
blue
that's off maybe I do need to use your
manual look at the way these sneaky
dudes put the SD card in here and to get
it out it's a micro SD it's easiest if
you just use like a knife and kind of
pry it up this if sneaky the way it's in
there look so that's an 8 gig there's
only one button on the unit and one
light so this kind of a technique here
apparently you press it and hold it
until you get the blue light it's
supposed to flash a couple times and
that's when recording starts seeing that
happen right now
oh there now we're flashing we flashed
one time and then off you think we're
recording now okay so they are
supposedly recording now all right
anger times doesn't happen often my spy
glasses aren't doing any spying they
suck all right
multiple SD cards we tried tried
reformatting multiple times we got a
bunch of broken files that couldn't be
played and couldn't be repaired and then
on top of that many times nothing was
recorded at all and after a recharge for
half an hour it's not even turning on
anymore so it looks like it's a
resurrection of the does it suck series
and we have a resounding yes
tough ste more like sucks key</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
