therapy and today we're taking a look at
some SMS audio headphones that of course
is 50 cents new headphone company these
are called the street buy 50 now if you
guys follow my channel you'll know that
I recently unboxed the sync buy 50
series of SMS headphones now those ones
are the wireless version of these the
street on the other hand is the
traditional less expensive wired version
which is also going to give you an
inline microphone for answering phone
calls on your iPhone etc now something
to mention is if you want to check out
the sync video the sync by 50 headphone
unboxing I'll put a link down in the
description so you can do so as well as
up in the annotations you can compare
the sync to the street so you can figure
out which model is better for you so
anyways let's concentrate on the street
buy 50 headphones because that afterall
is the model featured in this video and
the first thing you're going to notice
when you enter the box if you do pick
these up yourself is a very robust
headphone you've got some really nice
materials in use here including leather
memory foam you've got this really
flexible headband if you want to watch
me really stretch that headband out
definitely do check out the sink buy 50
video as I mentioned earlier but it's
nearly indestructible definitely
indestructible in everyday use the way
you'd normally use a set of headphones
so the only other thing in the Box is
your little bag of accessories here
you've got a little airline adapter for
airlines that still use this dual mono
old-school style adapter at least you've
got the option and then you've of course
got your audio cable with that inline
microphone here are the gold-tipped
connectors one of them being a right
angle connector which I always do
appreciate on the device end of the
cable and then here is the microphone I
mentioned earlier long with a button for
picking up calls and ending them of
course now this cable feels fairly
robust as well we're probably one of
those tangle-free cables it's fair
thick so also you've got a microfiber
cloth to keep these headphones looking
as pretty as they do fresh out of the
box and then you've also got a little
bag here for travel etc this is a
drawstring fairly rugged bag
you've got the SMS Audio logo down in
the bottom corner and as I mentioned
before just a drawstring simple bag a
place to keep your headphones possibly
when you're not using them keep them
from dust etc then you've got a little
bit of paperwork a little bit of
documentation from 50 cent here you can
get a better look at the two sync models
that I mentioned earlier in both black
and white they use a transmitter too of
course transmit audio and then on the
right hand side you can see the street
in two different colors that are also
available there's a little bit of a
manual underneath there that is just
gonna break down how your headphones
operate and how to get them all hooked
up it's a little Quick Start Guide
fairly simple stuff you probably won't
have to read it anyway guys here's a
closer look at the actual headphones
after all that's what you came to check
out the very first thing you're going to
notice is an adjustable headband a
fairly adjustable headband meaning these
are going to be comfortable for most
individuals and speaking from experience
I mean I've been wearing these for the
last couple of hours including right now
this moment while I'm talking these are
incredibly comfortable headphones some
of the most comfortable headphones I've
ever worn I also appreciate the matte
black finish over the majority of the
headband as well as the majority of the
ear cup it's got a rubberized coating
and should be fairly durable so on the
bottom here is where your audio cable is
actually going to connect to the
headphone you're going to want to use
the straight angle portion of the cable
that's going to line up your microphone
correctly with your mouth for answering
phone calls etc here's a closer look at
the actual ear cover or cushion
whichever you like to call it it's got
memory foam underneath a really nice
supple leather that has something to do
with the overall comfort level as I
mentioned earlier super padded super
comfortable along top is more of the
same you've also got this nice blue
accent this blue stitching along here
which gives it a little added Flair
