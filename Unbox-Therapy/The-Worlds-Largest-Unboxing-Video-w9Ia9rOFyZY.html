thermostat says minus eighteen point
five Celsius it's pretty devastating
outside got snow you got cold and you
got myself just waking up I'm on my way
to the airport so I recently had the
opportunity to travel halfway across the
country to check out something huge
77,000 square feet huge this is
obviously the biggest thing we have ever
attempted to feature here on unbox
therapy welcome to the world's most
high-tech sports store
I am extremely excited to bring
something a little different to you guys
on the channel today and exclusive you
guys are getting a first look at the
brand new sport check store opening at
West Edmonton Mall it might be the
world's first store unboxing you're
seeing it before it's even open to the
public so that's pretty cool on its own
but there's a reason that I've selected
this store to show you guys and it's not
just the fact that they gave me the
invite to come check it out it's also
because this store is incredibly
high-tech to be a little bit more
specific it features 470 individual
screens over 1200 square feet of digital
projection 250 computers 80 tablets for
your media consumption needs 45
interactive 3d cameras those are like
Kinect sensors and 45 kilometres of cat6
cable tying it all together now all of
this cool tech is going to help you to
select the best equipment for yourself
and your particular sport but it's also
going to be a lot of fun to play with
check this out
go go
so putting is only part of the game of
golf the other big aspect or one of the
big aspects is this right here you got
to drive the ball too
so getting back to some of the
technology as I mentioned earlier there
are a ton of touchscreens inside this
store this one here is specifically for
customizing your very own authentic NHL
Jersey as you can see here you just type
in your name as well as your favorite
number and you can order it up without
ever talking to anyone just right here
high tech that's the way we like it
right here on home hutch therapy and
they've also got a bunch of authentic
Jersey sitting in the store if you want
to just try one on you know see how it
looks first you can see me taking it one
step further visiting the hockey section
but Sport Chek has you covered on a
bunch of other stuff as well if you're
in a basketball for example you can see
some KD shoes as well as some lebrons
tell me down in the comments which one
you prefer of those two and then it goes
even a step above what you'd expect to
find in any normal sports store by
adding things like this right here the
virtual reality bicycle experience with
resistance so what you're looking at on
the screen will actually be reflected in
how hard or difficult it is to ride the
bike so if you're going uphill for
example there's going to be more
resistance this also has a second job of
letting you know just how out of shape
you are or at least that's what it did
for me now taking a trip over to the
service section or service shop here at
the brand new sport check the first
thing you're going to notice is this
gigantic machine this is the winter
Steiger mercury and it is a high-end ski
and snowboard tuning device I was told
also that there are only three of these
mercury machines in Canada and two of
the three are inside of sport checks
including this brand new sport check at
West Edmonton so that's it you put your
skis in you wait like 60 seconds and
bingo they come out ready to be skied on
now the technology doesn't end there I
talked earlier about all these different
touch screens and there are a number of
them like this one right here allowing
you to navigate the entire inventory of
products that are in the store in one
place without having to walk all the way
around so as you can see it says start
here and you can search through brands
as well as size
is that are currently available and
eventually you'll even be able to order
right on the screen if you want to
another cool thing we got to check out
at the store are these translucent
display boxes which have an LCD in the
front but then product in the back so
you can see some of the features in
video of the product you're looking at
which is actually inside of the lightbox
those were really cool the store also
features in Oakley customization Center
which allows for you to tailor the fit
and style of any of their sunglasses and
they can do those customizations right
on the spot as you wait next up they've
got a motorized rock climbing treadmill
I've never tried one of these before so
please go easy on my technique down in
the comments in the beginner mode as you
can see here it's just about 90 degrees
seems pretty simple if you get more
advanced or maybe you already are more
advanced then you can use the extreme
setting to challenge yourself so as
you'll notice we decided to use a
demonstrator for that in order to avoid
turning this video into a fail video in
which I fall flat on my face
although I'm sure some of you guys would
have enjoyed seeing that as well you're
sick anyways thanks a bunch to Sport
Chek for inviting me out to come take an
exclusive sneak peek at their brand new
flagship store at West Edmonton Mall I
had an absolute blast it's a ton of fun
if you guys are in the area you should
definitely go and check it out there's
all kinds of state-of-the-art technology
that you're definitely going to want to
play with alright guys that wraps up
this video thanks as always for watching
