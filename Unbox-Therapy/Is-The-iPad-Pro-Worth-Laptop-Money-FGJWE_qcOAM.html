new MacBook Air 13.3 inch laptop this
one this makes sense this is the other
new Apple product or products the iPad
pro it's the 11 inch 12 point 9 inch of
what Apple I think considers to be the
future of computing there are many ways
to interact with this device can also
use the pencil they've changed this
around this is different this is
radically different we have to see how
this compares to the latest macbook it
does seem that humans are beginning to
adopt this modular lifestyle where
devices are not just one thing but many
things boom 512 gigabyte version Wi-Fi +
cellular me this is the more interesting
form factor because at least it's
comfortable to hold it just seems like
the right size there's no curve anymore
it's a slab contact points for
accessories including the smart Keyboard
the move to USB see this is the magnetic
portion where the pen can attach who
doesn't like magnets that's the type see
power brick now this keyboard folio is
not exactly cheap and you give me a
price check on that will you do 180
bucks
I should mention also we're dealing with
no home button anymore I know that's
gonna strike fear in certain individuals
but it allows you to have this really
balanced bezel yes it's different it
clips in like that I like the way it
clicks in I like having two angles
that's an improvement over hmm the
package is pretty nice I suppose but in
iPad mode this is a bit weird that's you
that's you working you're typing away
it's definitely not a laptop the big boy
just for iPad life it gets a bit big
some people are really into it this
hopefully gives you a better idea this
thing is small it's like magazine
territory it's light this to me feels
way bigger than that does honestly this
seems weird but my favorite thing about
these iPads in the previous generation
iPad pro is the fast screen like hold my
god it's kind of addictive the
instantaneous nature of that refresh
rate it's butter
Jack it's butter who doesn't like butter
you don't want butter I can't believe
it's not butter butter honestly no don't
eat that stuff eat the real butter the
real stuff it is not that hard to make
butter it just takes time look at Ryan
over there look how upset he is look at
him back there he's doing work
supposedly guy hasn't worked a day in
years
butter talk its concert for butter
just generic like the dairy farmers of
America are like finally Dairy Farmers
of America we're bringing jobs back to
America
it's gesture-based welcome to this lab
the bigger model where it feels again
like iOS is a bit foreign on a device
that's big like look at the spacing of
the icons the screens actually look nice
what about the speakers according to
Apple they're great although what else
would they really what else would they
tell you I mean let's be honest here
okay let's try the 11 inch first
okay that's a nice speaker I must say
let's try the bigger boy oh man hold up
oh yeah okay
if audio is a big deal to you if it's
like multimedia devices we're gonna
watch all your stuff the speakers are
better on the bigger one
wow these speakers are loud
these are louder than most laptops
features and it's firing out of both
sides well done
now of course we've also got the Apple
pencil give Apple your money and you are
a professional illustrator you are on
the bus or the subway you're sketching
you're cool-looking you have a checkered
shirt a shoulder bag leather shoes you
just had broth for lunch you lined up
for beef broth the lineup was around the
block you didn't care you paid $8.75 for
a cup of broth you make your own butter
that you brought it all the way around
you're a Turner most importantly you're
cool cuz you have the Apple pencil this
pencil now has a flat side on it cuz
it's very cool what it does check this
out
yes that's where it should have been all
along it charges from there as well
I mean does it get any better boom
unlock to connect Apple pencil 64
percent battery Apple see they do that
stuff right there the cohesiveness is
done well look at me now with the
immediate feedback also pencil
DoubleTap we're here you're right well
smooth move actually we have an artist
on set the man looking for some time in
front of the camera because he loves it
no it is not Ryan thank God it is not
Ryan Willie do
also known a ka hailey who aka Hill a
lei
all right take it away you it's like a
tongue twister take it away you what am
I supposed to draw sit so you have a
head here and you have a nose that's
pointy ears he always has his tongue out
so ha Oh shiny be on the table ah okay
this is a beautiful drawing whoa you're
a professional artist published artist
the Sistine Chapel you painted it yeah I
mean I wouldn't go that for us so you
use the pencil you drew the picture
Otis looks identical to real-life it's
uncanny right yeah I like the weight
when it's touching the surface it's
actually pretty smooth and I like that
kind of texture I gotta say they did a
pretty good job you're happy with it
yeah I guess it's a big part of Apple's
pitch is like you can have this pen
input that said this is not cheap 129
bucks for that you know let me ask you
you've seen it you held it hold it I did
yeah hold it hold it do you want it this
is not for me wow I feel like Mac OS
should be in one of these Wow I think
the hardware is awesome I think this is
like the most balanced lightweight iPad
that there ever was I really like the
design I think they went kind of back to
the industrial design I wouldn't use it
personally I think it's really nice
that's it that's what I have to say
that's very aggressive Haley bringing
the heat today you expect a man to come
in here and say one thing and he burns
the place down
it's for a specific person they're
trying to avoid the laptop they want to
touch something they're lonely they want
to feel lonely there in each kind of
like in smartphones it's designed just
getting out of the way
because we want more screen for less
it's a rectangle that you can hold and
the content itself does the talking
obviously this thing is very powerful
performance comparable to an actual
laptop in something incredibly slim and
light I think the thing holding it back
is still the OS maybe that's a
diminishing territory though they were
showing off Photoshop mm-hmm on iOS so
it's like hey maybe that's changing I
don't know if it's right now though I
think as of right now if you ask me
today and I could only go for one of the
two Apple products I'm taking the
MacBook Air you know this and you are as
well yep maybe we use this a little bit
we change our minds on the subway you're
doing this an attractive lady
sees you she sees this and the two of
you go to a restaurant and drink broth
there it is ladies and gentlemen iPad
pro you saw him both will I use it more
you let me know in the comments should I
are you curious that's hilly who you
know who I am it's all happening right
here don't miss a beat next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
