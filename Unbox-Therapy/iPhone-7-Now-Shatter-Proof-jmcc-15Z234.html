hot device everybody's talking about it
everybody wants one they want to get a
fresh smooth nice-looking new phone but
here's the thing you don't think about
you don't think about shattering that
brand new device do you you don't think
about what that screen is gonna look
like with little shards of glass getting
up underneath your skin there's
something you can do to avoid that from
ever happening or at least that's what
rhino shield has told me they reached
out they said Lou we would love to
sponsor an episode and we want to send
you the iPhones there's one here on the
table tomorrow right here they're like
do whatever you want
beat them up slam them with a hammer but
assuming that we have success here I'm
just gonna give these ones away cuz I
don't think anything's about to get
destroyed right now so rhino shield who
are they they make various accessories
for smartphones iphone iphone7 as I
mentioned but also even the new pixel
phone
according to Jack they put 4,000 pounds
of weight on top of this screen
protector I feel like I want to test
that too so I don't maybe in an upcoming
video but anyways that's been
pre-installed on this iPhone 7 but they
also have this product right to bumper
case this is the new thing right here
exceeds military drop test standards
it's easy to grip lightweight this is
kind of important because the iPhone 7
is super slippery especially the color
that I like best which is the matte
black it's one thing to be able to grip
onto it to avoid those drops in the
first place they claim you can drop this
from 11 feet we have 11 feet in here
custom formulated polymer honeycomb
structure pretty slim pretty sleek let's
see what it looks like just like that
okay so now we got something to grip on
to here now it is raised up a little bit
so when you put it down on a flat
surface your device is not touching that
surface even though it's exposed cutouts
for all the necessary areas if you do
end up using this with the screen
protector as well you can see that that
fits in there perfectly it's not like
it's getting squished up against the
bumper they are made to work together
alright now before we get today I'm
gonna get up higher than I've ever got
before in this show look I'm taking the
phone with me this is unprecedented guys
we're up higher than ever before
probably
out six feet up here though I could go
higher okay nevermind now it's probably
like eight feet I just gotta have the
perfect drop to get through here are you
ready jack three two one oh ha would you
look at that
complete and utter survival a lot of
times you end up with a smash screen it
hits on the corner and you get those
little cracks up the entire display from
the amount of pressure that has to be
absorbed in the glass itself you're
getting some drop protection and it's a
huge improvement over just having the
bare foam that's all fine and dandy fun
and games you came here to see if it can
hold up to a hammer and now of course we
have the screen protector on there so
this is the moment of truth I'm going to
take a hammer to it cross your fingers
let's see what happens maybe to start
let's just give her a few it kind of
bounces a lot of it is it time to step
it up a notch
it's a time to get crazy here we go Oh
boom yeah
that is shocking I don't know if I can
you want me hit it hard again about to
mess up something Wow can you show the
people what's happening here that's full
blast man even the screen protector
itself after that beating is still in
pretty good shape I don't know if people
know how easily things smash iPhone 5s
here doesn't work what did you do water
damage Oh rest in peace to Jack's old
iPhone 5s so before I take off I just
want to remind you guys cool people that
rhino shield they sent a bunch of stuff
look at this it's all for you I have the
details in the description but follow me
on Twitter and I'll be sending this
stuff out - maybe you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
