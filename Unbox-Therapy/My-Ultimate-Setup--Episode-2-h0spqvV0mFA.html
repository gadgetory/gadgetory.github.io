ultimate setup if you haven't seen
episode number one go back and check
that out this episode is about the large
50 inch 4k display above them well now a
lot of people have been asking me Lou
why would you need a big giant TV over
top of your setup and there's a problem
with that question the term mean I don't
need any of this
okay we're obviously pushing the limits
as mentioned in that last video this is
all about just creating a really cool
space to sit down in where you sort of
want to be and you're inspired to be
anyway yes completely
overkill I know that this display up
here has a couple of different functions
if we are looking at and edit we want to
see it in full resolution up on a big
display when you're dealing with such a
big display and you stand incredibly
close to it every little speck of dust
on the white table and the white
environment that I shooting becomes
visible so picking up those little
specks and imperfections can be
difficult on a smaller display where it
isn't on this one I haven't told you
what display this actually is it's a
Vizio P series 4k 50-inch probably the
most affordable 4k that you can get when
it comes to still maintaining good
picture quality it has local dimming so
it's not Edgeley it even has an HDMI
port capable of 60 Hertz or 60 FPS now
this display can still handle 1080p
content just fine it'll even upscale it
and it actually looks pretty damn good
the input lag on this TV is amazing too
for gaming if you just want to hook up a
console or something like that
it's one of the best 4k panels on the
market now another cool thing about this
display in this setup is how thin the
bezel is it really fits in well with
these other ultra whites it almost looks
like a brother or a sibling
or a cousin so this is what the remote
looks like you have a dedicated Amazon
button Netflix button as well as
iHeartRadio and then this Vizio button
for accessing your various smart
applications it is a smart TV after all
and the coolest thing actually happens
on this side of the controller as you'll
notice here you have a full QWERTY
keyboard so skipping through the various
applications that are pre-installed you
can see you have yahoo news finance your
own multimedia if you want to access
that so even with all those smart
functions I do like to keep an Apple TV
connected to the display as well that's
just because I like to use airplay for
various functions for example I
subscribe to MBA gametime for watching
all my basketball games that I want to
see and in this particular case over
airplay you get a much better looking
feed than you would if you just log on
to the web site and watched it that way
now one of the big questions with 4k
televisions is how do you actually get
4k onto them well in my particular case
it's kind of been easy because I posted
this up to my setup and Mac Pro which
means I can watch YouTube in four mega
watch my own videos in 4k if I wanted to
now I've got a lot of questions about
these speakers the reason that they have
this shape is because they're mounted so
close to the wall or at least in many
different installations they end up
close to a wall and one of the problems
with that with a square speaker
rectangular speaker is that this also
happens to be a point of reflection for
the base port for example on the back
having a round design means that this
the sound has a greater ability to move
around the cabinet these look a lot like
be very expensive Genelec studio
monitors and they are based on that idea
but they're from a different company
called sanam the sound is incredible for
the size this is a tiny little cabinet
but it's actually made out of metal this
is metal guys it's not plastic you can
build up an enormous amount of pressure
inside of a smaller cabinet so that you
can get a lot more power out of them
these are also completely configurable
and tunable on the back so once again
depending on your
placement and the way that your room is
shaped you can tinker with them to make
sure that you're getting an actual
accurate frequency response you're going
to want to use balanced cables with them
but that's the case with any
studio-style monitor where you're using
quarter-inch or XLR plugs also when
you're working with studio monitors
you're going to have independent volume
controls on each of the two monitors so
you're going to want to make sure that
those are matched up all right so let's
go ahead and do a little sample of how
they sound obviously you're going to be
hearing this through my microphone so
it's not going to be a full
representation but you may be able to
sort of catch an idea about the low-end
capabilities of these
so as you guys can tell lots of low-end
there even with these tiny little
cabinets and there's no subwoofer hidden
anywhere so I've been blown away at the
capabilities of these things alright so
that wraps up this episode this
installment in my ultimate setup series
as you can tell there's a lot to go over
in the first one we covered these ultra
wide monitors in this one we covered
this cool vizio p-series 4k displays
it's hooked up to the setup and we also
covered these Sanel metal enclosed
studio monitors and coming up in the
final installment we'll be talking about
the smaller components we'll be talking
about my keyboard my mouse my dock and
if you come over here I'll give you a
sneak peek at some of the other
components that live at the back here
we'll talk more about the computer that
I'm using some of the drives that I use
for backup just all the accessories that
make this thing work
and also some of my plans for some of
these other devices like this zoom
recorder over here so anyways hope you
guys are enjoying this series if you are
make sure to leave a thumbs up down
below thanks as always for watching and
I'll catch you on the next episode I'm
going to turn this song back on now
you</div></body></html>
