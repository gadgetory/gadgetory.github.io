waiting for you've been on YouTube
you've seen the other videos you heard
about this thing you watch the keynote
you're curious as is anyone else who
cares about gadgets because this is
unusual this thing in front of me is a
completely new shape to the concept of
console gaming like the title of a book
or something the Nintendo switch is the
first console it goes with you you can
play with a another person even when
you're mobile there's a kickstand it's
like it's like how many things in one
they take on an infomercial they're like
and it does this and it does that and
one more thing why can't I get a
Nintendo for three payments of $30
what's that all about the point is what
is the point the package here you can
see look it's showing off some of the
different ways you can play cool look at
the way they did that the user manuals
right there this little guy whoa that's
a Nintendo switch you kidding me this
device here is 720p on the display
versus when you put it into the dock it
will output 1080p USB type-c connector
so you can use all those type-c chargers
that you finally have lying around
there's a kickstand there maybe you're
playing two-player this is that joy Kahn
look at that little guy I could be
chilling back here and just have them
separate but behaving as a single
controller
there's some things I hold on - I'm just
not feeling comfy this one is big enough
look at that this will give you a more
traditional controller layout so they've
got an HDMI cable in there slide it in
like this like that that a big fan of
dock docks in general a couple of USB s
on here as well put more controllers on
it huh RIS check that out HDMI out
another USB and a spot for the AC
adapter but look at that you close that
up it all comes out clean out the side
one thing you've got to say about
Nintendo when it comes to like imagining
a product they go out of left field like
they really start from the ground up so
you can strap this baby here Tata Tata
whoa look how tiny in a little game is
we guys think Mario look at that Vista
now obviously if you know anything about
this game it's like a giant world to
explore boom with the tree branch oh my
look at this guy
boom I gotta be dead now
Oh buddy Wow

well yet Tom far way more your brother
