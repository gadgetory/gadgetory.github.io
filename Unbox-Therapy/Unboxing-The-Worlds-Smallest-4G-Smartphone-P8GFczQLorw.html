something small possibly even tiny
inside this box is what I'm being told
is the world's smallest 4G Android phone
and this is not the first time I have
looked at a micro smartphone Oh posh
mobile so posh Gary certainly no issues
there getting your thumb to reach the
top of the display but this is a new one
it's called the jelly and this one adds
some functionality because it's got 4G
connectivity and Android 7 and the crazy
part is once it launches on Kickstarter
it's only gonna be $60 now let's check
it out mmm there is there's my hand
there's the device oh it's actually kind
of comfy I'm not dropping that you might
be thinking I can't use some leg that's
gonna be a headache I'm on my phone I'm
watching videos I'm doing all these
things maybe it's not your main device
maybe it's a backup device maybe you
have a SIM card in here when you go for
a jog or something maybe you're on
vacation you want something you take to
the beach fits in a small little pocket
but I think at 60 bucks it doesn't need
to be your main device it could be an
accessory to your current smartphone
very nice rear-facing camera flash
volume up and down micro USB to charge
it power switch headphone jack Apple
can't even give you that there we go and
on the back would you check that out it
has a micro SD card for storage
expansion and two SIM card slots micro
USB cable to charge it up a little power
brick and a tiny little battery which at
least is removable before we boot it up
let's do some size comparisons here
alright so I have my Google pixel haha
it's like a quarter the size how about
an iPhone 7 plus but not just any 7 plus
the 24 karat gold-plated 7 plus which
you haven't seen a video go check it out
it's about a quarter of the size this
thing is tiny this reminds me of
cellphones before smartphones
I had a Motorola 2 had a pivoting
earpiece and that was like shortly after
the brick phones and then when
smartphones came out well you
what happened went all the way up I'm
not actually having fun I should
probably there are some headsets that
are bigger than this a very nice Yuna
hurts now keep in mind this unit is
running full on Android 7 gonna have
access to the Play Store and all those
things so you're not to be concerned
with that look at that it's a slick
little interface apps ok so far pretty
snappy and included Chrome and I guess
their own browser and this button here
has a pretty decent haptic feedback on
it from lock pretty quick 78% battery
life nice the CPU 4x cortex a53 1.1
gigahertz a gig of ram 8 gigabyte rom so
all pretty current alright there we go
look at that Google Play on a tiny
little screen but it works
look at how small this keyboard is
surprisingly you can actually select the
right letters like look at this here we
go that's my tiny that is the speaker is
not very loud first off this little
thing here it's a stinger emergency
escape tool powerful steel punch
life-saving it is what it is though what
is this playing back at ok that's 240 p
maximum 480p let's go all the way up
that's probably all you need under
display this side think about the
savings on your cell phone bill this is
not designed for power users that's not
the goal here I gotta be honest I didn't
really even expect it to be this smooth
but we haven't tried the camera yet that
could be a problem here we are I mean
it's nothing look that bad on this
display but who really even knows I mean
display like this who knows all right
now there's also a beauty mode on the
forward facing in this video let's test
the video here here we go a little bit
of video on the worlds
smallest 4G smartphone adjust the white
balance image properties camera mode
zero shutter delay phase detection okay
picture size five megapixels and for
video mode image stabilization noise
reduction and the video quality was at
high there is fine which is slightly
better now here is the video in fine
mode seems a little bit better actually
in quality and of course it wouldn't be
an unbox therapy video if I didn't show
you your favorite character Jack good
job buddy
here we go ooh three two one as long as
you're looking at it on this display it
doesn't look that bad anyway there you
have it a full fledged Android
smartphone two SIM card slots Android
7.0 expandable storage a headphone jack
and all of it baked into a device with a
two-and-a-half inch screen is it going
to replace your Golden iPhone 7 plus
probably not this is 60 bucks maybe it's
your second or your third device or
maybe it's a gift for somebody who has
everything plus it has a cool name it's
called the jelly you know what I never
understood everybody always said peanut
butter and jelly but I never used jelly
I always use jam you guys tell me in the
comments it's jelly the same as jam and
are you more likely to use the term
jelly or Jam when referring to a peanut
butter and jam sandwich also consider
toasting it it only gets better do you
agree on that</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
