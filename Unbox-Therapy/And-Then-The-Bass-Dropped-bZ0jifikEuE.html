hello
look at Ryan a real professional look at
this beauty there he goes what do we
have today we are checking out a 360
crane 360 smart cast speaker from Vizio
what's with the cast in the name well of
course you can broadcast to the speaker
in a number of different ways either
Vizio Smart cast which is an app which
will turn your smartphone or tablet into
a remote control to control this thing
you can also use google cast which I
know you guys are familiar with that's
the same thing it gets used in a
chromecast that little icon that pops up
you've also got bluetooth and this thing
can do multi room so you could set up
multiple speakers across your house if
you want to this little bass one of the
things is like how do you keep your
charge you guys know I'm a fan of
wireless charging in general this one
instead sits on this little base and
stays charged so you put it back when
it's not in use still works as a speaker
when you want to go wireless
boom just lift it off and go 360 degree
omnidirectional sound blast touch dial
tap to play pause so on produces bass as
low as 80 Hertz Ryan what does that mean
remember when a Hulk Hogan used to do
the ear
Ryan remembers let's see it how did he
do it ah hey you guys know I love
speaker videos Oh what am I doing here
remove the speaker charge the speaker
turn on the speaker got it whoa look at
this that's the kind of thing it can fit
into the home decor you know what I mean
we got a power brick in the base this
part here it'll plug in you see that
little connector on the bottom there
jack that guy just pops right on like so
you're charging you only need to think
about it
smells like leather they weren't joking
I just realized this thing spins what is
that is that volume I'm gonna follow the
instructions it's on a baby hello there
that's a good look right that's Vizio
version of mirrors display it's like
maybe oh well that's cool shows you the
battery life as well as the fact that
it's charging different TV services
movie services music you can see
iHeartRadio is in here it also kind of
works as a receiver so you can select
your various inputs so chromecast you
can see here I'm using a pixel XL but
you can see I can select it and it pops
up so there is my Vizio cast now I'm
connected so if I go to a place like
YouTube cast icon up there these things
were ever scared of humans
they must have been at one point in time
and this is my volume that looks like
easy lunch towards so you guys know
drones are the new hot thing it's
casting the whole day no Bluetooth
necessary
computer let's go max out the base
the top is made at its last and its
touch-sensitive
so what posit also some app supports
skipping to the next tracks what a nice
white so even if your device is placed
down somewhere you can quickly move
between songs back to plus hey I don't
need to tell you you have your own ears
coolest part is everything is happening
over Google Castle anything I'm gonna do
on my phone is gonna broadcast over here
no Bluetooth weirdness necessary little
punch to gut little bass for you you
know what's interesting about the word
bass Jack you take that same word and
you apply it to fish and what do you get
you get yourself a bass so shout out to
busy old for sending the speaker out for
a quick little test hope you guys
appreciate it I know I did also today's
episode has been brought to you by
audible who's audible those are those
guys online with all those audiobooks so
you can get smarter plus because they
love unbox therapy doers there's a free
trial 30 days and you get a free book
what book should you get I don't know
Jack's been recommending one to me
what's it called the girl on the train
god knows what this man's into I'm
driving around all the time I got over
the airport I'm in the airplane and I
want to learn something while I'm doing
that you know multitask all that
downtime dead time nightmare time that
you're sitting in traffic you could be
learning what excuses do you have
