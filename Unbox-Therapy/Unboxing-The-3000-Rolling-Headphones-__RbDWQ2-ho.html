he goes Willie do nice knowing him
though oh my goodness this is a moment
right now I have something incredibly
special in front of me which you
probably could already tell based on the
presentation engraved roller handcrafted
headphones I've looked at all the
headphones maybe a hundred videos on
headphones maybe never have I been this
pump to check out a pair of headphones
and that's because these are incredibly
exclusive you can't even buy these
things right now like if you are
interested in these headphones you send
an email you call a number you you put
your name in the Hat and you're like you
cross your fingers just for the
opportunity to pay $3,000 my friends
this is special in front of me here I've
been told that I have numbers 0 0 for
the 4th pair of these headphones out of
10 in existence should we jump inside
the box jack
that's the real deal look at those
little guys rolled up in there so this
is what's special about these as the
name implies the roller it's a headband
using watch mechanics to get the perfect
fit on any individual and allow itself
to be rolled up into this incredibly
compact package because it's meant to
travel with you they've included a nice
little pouch here a suede pouch there's
also a microfiber cleaning cloth a cable
braided very durable looking oh man look
at that you gotta love a robust cable
especially for 3,000 bucks some extra
ear pads the ear pads are removable the
cable is removable when you're spending
this kind of money on a headphone you
want to make sure you can replace
certain components this is a very soft
ear pad with some memory foam underneath
very nice these are white it looks like
the pre-installed ones are gray whoa
the quality there you can just it's it's
cool to the touch the entire headphone
here is aluminum and steel I can't even
see a single plastic component on there
okay let me unroll this here whoa that's
great so so you've got 22 separate
stainless steel springs that allow this
to extend around your head but then at
the same time can help it fold super
compactly into that right there the palm
of your hand
and then into the case look at the size
of that little package it's not much
bigger than some of the bags I've seen
for audiophile grade earbuds let's say
but this is an on-ear headphone swiss
crafted number zero zero four this is
number zero zero four out of ten that
are in existence in a hundred that will
eventually exist I don't know that any
other person outside the company has
these things in their possession other
than myself
so of course removable cable you can put
it on either ear cup the right or the
left the ear cup is adjustable still and
I notice it kind of pivots a little bit
too for the
to compensate for whatever your head
shape happens to be I think I'm just
gonna try them on uh see what happens
here ooh okay so that's a pretty sleek
design right it's doing a decent job of
blocking the ambient noise right now for
an on-ear now without the Hat let's try
it without the Hat here a little bit
more to the exact shape of your head
without the hat on
look at the components in there it
really is like a watch like a Swiss made
watch it reminds you of a band in fact
that's the calibre of components in here
of course with any headphone video the
key factor is listening to them right
that's important
they could be fancy they could be Swiss
made by hand what they got us they got a
sound good too so let's give them a shot
here let's go at this one I know this
song
there's a little bit of there's a little
bit more low-end than I expected the
drive in the base region there I think
part of it is that they seal up around
the ear a little bit better than I might
have thought with a non ear style it's
still a very portable headphone so
you're dealing with like a 30 millimeter
driver in here from a sound perspective
I mean they sound good but it's not like
it's not like blowing me away in the
sense that I'm like oh I've never heard
headphones that sound like that I think
the really striking thing about this set
is the design don't get me wrong they
sound good you're not gonna be
disappointed with the sound but really
the unique characteristic is the fact
that they do this I've never seen
anything quite like that it rolls up
almost into a ball you just get a real
feeling of quality in general when
you're handling them because you can't
find plastic will come on in man check
these out let's get your take real quick
well as a designer you're a designer
yeah yeah I do that kind of stuff way
you ever seen something like this no
look at that thing this is crazy that's
wild man
it's ambitious you know I always
appreciate these type of ambitious
designs it's really different it's
really different yeah seems pretty
sturdy too oh yeah definitely
try them on are they on there they're
not big enough for you are they no I
don't think so please stop with my hat
it's good right I don't know they're
little small on you max them both out
there you go yeah that looks better
okay that looks better I don't think it
fits your head as well as if it's mine
so what do you really think this is
about then what's this about this
product I think it's the design I think
I agree with you on that some of the
these attributes here could then be
applied to various models yeah because
it's just something that I haven't seen
before let alone
I mean Swiss handmade Swiss made
headphones not a thing that was on my
radar
those are three grand some people are a
little more rough with their headphones
yeah I'm not saying you are to be fair I
think this is mostly a design exercise
critical listening would we'll do we'll
take in another youniverse right now
like Wells not even with us anymore
there he goes Willy do you nice knowing
him though that's good oh it's good well
no need to yell there brother yeah it
does its job I mean three thousand bucks
you're not spending the three grand on
the sound right no it's not what it is
it's this it's this insane design you
wanna you want to be the guy to pull
that out and be like oh it's number zero
zero four don't you forget it
nobody's you haven't seen headphones
like them you had some Terminator stuff
going on there it's a special look
though hey I think it's incredibly
ambitious I love products that are
ambitious I'm not sure that this
headphone here is gonna replace what I'm
already using maybe I'm a little too
paranoid to be bringing this thing on
the airplane well there it is is the
most expensive headphone ever featured
on unbox therapy the roller Willy do
ladies and gentlemen Tom I'm very
excited to bring back one of our
favorite sponsors its Dollar Shave Club
and they're back with another box to
keep you looking fresh so you can keep
getting the ladies isn't that how it
works I do like though it's actually
pretty good see there you go this time
around look at this we got our bathroom
minutes little comic for you we have the
executive handle have a nice cut of beef
not a nice cut of face you would agree
with that
oh yeah change your blade each week so
here's the thing okay I've told you guys
in the past you're at the supermarket
you're trying to get the razors you're
spending a fortune you're going broke
doing it you end up using it longer
because you don't want to go out bite
the bullet and do it all over again so
use it longer now it's dull now it's
affecting the skin it's affecting the
complexion and they don't look like you
Tom and it's truly a shame because
they'll never experience the life you've
experienced because of Dollar Shave Club
you get this each month you change the
blade each week you use the shave butter
and here's the best part Tom there's a
deal right now for a limited time new
members get the first month of the
executive razor for the tube of their
doctor Carver shea butter for only $5
five bucks is that
handle weighty it is it's a weighty
handle it's good okay so all you need to
do to take advantage is to do that tom
talked about five bucks for all this for
your first month you just head over to
