another video and today it is iPhone day
it's an official holiday there are a lot
of videos in your subscription box and
on YouTube and so on about iPhone 6s and
iPhone 6s plus this is every single
variation of the iPhone 6s and 6s plus
yes these are a lot of phones I will
probably go ahead and give one of them
away at least one so make sure to
subscribe this one is all about a
comparison of every single variation the
colors and whatnot and also just to do a
mega unboxing but let's do it
for the sake of Internet sup Internet
we're gonna speed things up and I'm
going to be as efficient as I possibly
can in successfully unboxing these eight
different brand new factory fresh
iPhones let's go
okay so we have all the devices out Wow
look at that look at that right isn't
that pretty inside each box is going to
be identical you have a little bit of
paperwork from Apple as you'd expect sim
tool as well as the ear pod earbuds a
charging brick and of course the
lightning cable now you may recognize
the fact that they have plastic on them
still if you are in unboxing aficionado
that plastic pull is one of the most
satisfying things to do so let's go
ahead give you some nice audio on these
plastic bowls I'm gonna shut up can you
hear that
well the microphone the microphone just
static grabbed hold of the plastic okay
that's a lot of phones Wow let me line
these up alright this might be the most
phones I've ever had on this table at
the same time
just a stupid amount of iPhones whoa
this is the entire iPhone 6's lineup
here now let me know down in the
comments which color combination you
would go with as well as whether you're
more of a 6s guy or a 6s plus now let's
flip these over give you guys a better
idea of the colors you can see visually
this is pretty much identical to most
people's eyes I would assume when
compared with the regular six as most S
iterations are concerned you're
basically just getting a faster unit
always camera improvements and whatnot
but physically you're dealing with
something that is mostly the same
looking with the exception of the new
color dimensionally these are a little
bit bigger than the previous version for
a couple of different reasons but it's
it's minuscule though if you do wear a
case on your phone or for that matter a
skin I have a skin here from my good
friends over at D brand skins you can
see it wraps around the entire iPhone
now they are available for order now for
all of the 6s and 6s plus so check them
out through a link in the description
but you can customize the appearance of
your device while getting a little bit
of protection as well let's do the
famous tower of phones watch this
why does that look so incredible
surprise snap an Instagram photo real
quick live live on the air okay so I
have this Space Gray 6s Plus booted up
and activated and I'm gonna show you
guys just a couple of the new features
real quick of course the thing that many
people are talking about is this 3d
touch previously called
force touch the way that it works is you
press a little bit harder so like I can
launch the camera app just like that or
I can press longer or harder depending
on how you interpret it and as you can
see I can launch into various features
within the camera a little bit more
quickly for example take selfie because
as you know when you need that selfie
it's better happen quickly that's one of
the scariest selfies I've ever taken
from that angle camera still protrudes a
little bit but it is improved this time
around
now shoots 4k video so this is the 4k
video nothing has been touched here this
is completely automatic give you guys an
idea of what to expect if you were
shooting handheld with 4k so anyways
this is the forward facing camera at 4k
you know what there is something
incredibly satisfying about having all
these phones here I don't know what it
is yeah you almost want to use them like
Lego bricks you know to build different
this is incredible anyways listen I had
access to all these devices for the
purpose of this video I want to give a
shout out once again to D brand skins
for helping me to get all of these I
think it made for an interesting video
I've got a lot more plan and coming up
there's gonna be some durability stuff I
don't know if I need to be more specific
than that so Lots planned make sure to
subscribe for that oh and obviously I
don't need all these phones so a
giveaway to so subscribe for that as
well anyway so there you have it thanks
very much for watching appreciate your
guy's viewership and I'll catch you very
shortly on another video about these
devices specifically
I promise very soon all right later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
