another video and today we're taking a
look at what I've been told is the
world's smallest drone as you can see
here it is called the CX 10 for channel
ages 14 plus you youngsters might have
to wait a little bit to play with huh
not sure why it's 14 I think you 12-year
olds can handle it anyways your kind of
standard quadcopter layout but this time
miniature look at that little thing it's
tiny fits in the palm of your hand so
inside the package you have a little
remote control it so double analog
sticks as you can tell whoa interesting
noise double analog sticks as well as an
on/off switch a couple of directional
buttons here and here and of course a
slot for to triple-a batteries which I
hope to god are included so this looks
like a charge cable for the actual drone
and I know on some of the RC helicopters
you can actually charge off of the
battery in the remote doesn't look like
that's the case here you'll need to use
your own USB charger I also notice an
extra propeller many extra propellers
three four five extra propellers five or
four four would make more sense than
four extra propellers they're tiny can
probably hardly see them but that's good
because if you smash this thing at least
you have a couple of backups as you can
see it fits in the palm of my hand so
you're obviously going to be able to fly
this indoors you're going to have to fly
this indoors so that it doesn't get
completely taken away by the wind
it does feel pretty damn solid I'll link
it down in the description if you want
to check it out for yourself but I think
it was around 30 or 40 bucks something
like that anyhow I'm gonna go and get
some triple-a batteries for this remote
and I'll be back with some battery
okay so I did the classic steel
batteries from a different device one of
the remote controls for some speakers
out there had the triple A's that I need
right now you can never have enough
triple A's I see some lights let's turn
the remote on I'm gonna move oh my
goodness
I guess that just means we're powered up
let's see what this baby can do
oh whoa whoa let me try that again
this thing has a surprising amount of
power for such a small little drone Wow
whoa okay so what I'm doing right now is
I'm just making the little minor
adjustments yes at least I got it moving
yeah
whoa this is too much fun man drones if
you don't have one this is a great way
to start this is a great piloting lesson
right here I like the little control too
gosh something's powerful don't chop my
hand open I'm being especially careful
because obviously guys all my camera
equipment is around here you know the
other thing too is oh oh the other thing
too is that uh you really want to have
these things fully charged
they last somewhere in the neighborhood
of like 15 minutes or something like
that
I hit the microphone damn these things
are fun okay just a little bit more this
would be cool if you had like other
action figures set up or like those
little army men and you just came in and
blasted them so there you have it in
unboxing and first look at what might be
the world's smallest drone a great way
to get started in the world of drones
without doing too much damage to your
space or your camera equipment or your
microphone thanks as always for watching
guys I appreciate it if you enjoyed this
content make sure to leave a thumbs up
down below and I'll catch you on the
next episode later go chop my hand open</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
