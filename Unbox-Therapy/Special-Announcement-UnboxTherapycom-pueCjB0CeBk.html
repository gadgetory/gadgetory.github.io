and no that is not my real name
in fact this is going to be our formal
human introduction my name is Luis and
I've been the voice behind unbox therapy
up until this point you could call me
the man behind the machine the man
behind the genius that is unbox therapy
now I'm just kidding
anyway no I'm just a regular dude and
you know this is one of my passions so
let's get that part out of the way and
move on the reason for this video the
reason that I am gracing your screens is
because I want to formally announce our
new webpage unbox therapy com I'm gonna
go ahead and show it to you in case you
haven't visited there yet I follow the
same sort of design scheme that already
existed on the YouTube channel and also
on the Twitter page which I'll talk
about in a second and in case you're
wondering why would you guys need your
own webpage my answer is pretty simple -
that YouTube is fantastic when it comes
to video but I wanted another outlet for
high resolution images and extended
descriptions and reviews in text so this
is going to be a supplementary kind of
thing it's not going to try to overtake
what's happening on YouTube we're not
going to be posting independent videos
over there there will be some embedded
YouTube videos but it's going to be more
of a supplementary thing that you're
going to have in conjunction with the
YouTube channel like I said before to
have those high resolution images and
extended reviews there's also a comment
section for each post in case you want
to chat over there and there might be
some exclusive posts regarding things
that don't necessarily turn into videos
so anyway definitely check out that
webpage let me know what you think and
hopefully you'll visit it often the next
thing I want to talk about is our
Twitter page and for anybody who's in
the contest or the giveaway for the book
sleeves you probably already know about
it but for everybody else who doesn't
it's actually pretty sad right now we're
looking pretty weak we got about 29
followers over there on Twitter so I'm
fairly embarrassed now I'm just kidding
I mean it's nobody
we just opened the page but at this
point with 29 followers people are
standing a pretty good chance of winning
those free sleeves I think since I'm
giving away 3 there's a 1 in 3 chance
right now the people that have followed
us on Twitter 1 in 3 chance that they're
going to win one so if you're watching
this and you haven't already followed us
on Twitter and you haven't entered the
giveaway for the book sleeves then jump
on it I mean even if you don't have an
iPad maybe maybe get the sleeve and it
maybe you're convinced you can iPad
no I'm just kidding don't do that but in
all seriousness more people need to jump
on this contest because it's really a
sweet giveaway these sleeves are not
cheap the 30 bucks apiece right and
they're not run-of-the-mill and nothing
you're going to find everywhere they got
a some different styling cues and really
nice all around so definitely take
advantage of that and that's about it
I'm going to get my ugly face out of
your screen now and you can get back to
my other videos or whatever else it is
you like to do on YouTube and until next
time thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
