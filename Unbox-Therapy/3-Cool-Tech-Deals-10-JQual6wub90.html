another video and it is another
installment of three cool tech deals you
guys seem to be enjoying the show so
we're back with a fresh one for you and
today I've got three things from three
different product segments all very
useful and I think you'll hopefully I
think you'll hopefully be interested in
one I don't know maybe possibly
definitely maybe number one this is a
package of micro USB cables sounds
incredibly boring it is incredibly
boring but you need them I need them
Jack needs them AJ needs them this is a
seven dollar $6.99 pack of different
sizes one of my pet peeves wow I haven't
said that or heard that set in a long
pet-peeve sometimes you need to stretch
a little further other times not so much
right so this pack right here is going
to give you various lengths so one six
foot one ten foot two three feet I can't
do I have enough hands I do and one one
foot enough hands or enough fingers okay
so it's cheap it's six dollars and it's
every cable you could possibly need
every length that is yesterday I
actually posted something on Twitter a
cool short cable going from a chromecast
for example for some reason it comes
with this super long USB cable even
though most televisions have USB power
right on them if you had a short cable
everything would be more organized your
life would be better you'd get a
girlfriend you know the whole story
happily ever after use the right cable
for the job and in fact in your life use
the right tool for the job that's the
right tool for the job anything like
that the banging downstairs next up we
have the Joby grip tight gorilla pod
which is a little flexible tripod to go
with it there's a clip on the top which
will work for your smartphone I actually
own not only a gorilla pod but also some
of those clips which you can then use on
other tripods if you choose to which
are super convenient when it comes to
getting better shots out of your
smartphone here you can see it's not
just a tripod you can wrap it around I
guess that's a twig in this case its
small fits in a backpack and all of a
sudden you've stepped up your smartphone
photography game your Instagram game
people are gonna start noticing they're
gonna say that shot is crystal clear or
how did you get those cool light streaks
on that city shot how'd you do that with
your phone that doesn't seem normal on
my Instagram feed I'm used to only
seeing big butts and food photos what
else is some selfies tons of selfies
I've said this before the Instagram
Discoverer page it'll take years off
your life avoid it at all costs it is
the lowest form of existence it's a
little bit harsh okay maybe not that big
fan of Instagram check me out link in
the description selfies and butt shots
we're off the rails
next product this one might be a little
unfamiliar to some of you guys it's from
a company called acai and these are the
guys that made the original MPC sort of
music production device that so many of
your favorite hip-hop and rap songs and
electronic music has been created on
they've sort of progressed now they make
these digital controllers that connect
to your laptop and then you can use any
digital audio workstation you want and
they're way less expensive than npcs
used to be even though you're getting
the same tactile feedback out of these
pads when you're programming beats so
this is the MPD 26 it's a slightly older
model but at 99 bucks it's a really cool
way to get into the world of electronic
music making they are sort of the de
facto standard pads that every producer
or a huge portion of producers use so
you know you're getting something fairly
professional for a hundred bucks
blah blah blah Lou's going on about
music we've been setting up a little bit
of a studio around the corner here in
the office so this is front of mine
right now
I suggest you experiment you'd be amazed
at what you can achieve with something
as simple as this Akai professional MPD
26 you will now have some slightly more
professional music
to go with you're slightly more
professional photos and who knows where
you might go from here alright that
wraps it up another episode of three
cool tech deals all the links to all
these products will be down in the
description so you can check those out
and I will catch you very shortly
on the next episode also there's a
playlist for all of these this is number

the champagne Jack Jack has no champagne
