excited to announce another live show
this sunday and to go with it another
epic give away this time it's going to
be a little bit different I'm not going
to tell you what you have to win instead
you can pick your own prize yes i'm
bringing back an old thing that I used
to do on the channel with my giveaways
pick your prize it's a really cool way
of getting something you really want if
you happen to be the winner of this
particular giveaway what do you have to
do all it has to be is a product that i
have previously featured on unbox
therapy that i've unboxed in the past
that's the only stipulation i'm going to
have three different price thresholds or
prize positions so three winners this
sunday the first one is going to have to
be under fifty dollars any selection
under 50 the second winter is any
selection under a hundred and then the
grand prize winner is any selection
under 200 so go to my channel check out
all the different products I featured
find one that fits into that particular
price threshold and if you happen to be
the winner then hit you can pick that
prize let me know down in the comments
what you guys are leaning towards right
now remember it has to be something i've
featured before on the channel if it's
very very close if it's a little bit
over two hundred or a little bit over
100 at those different thresholds I'll
make some exceptions that's not really a
huge deal to me the main thing is I want
to have more than one winner so I can
spread the love a little bit this
weekend so what you have to do in order
to be eligible it is incredibly simple
