another day another video I gotta say
I'm excited about this one because
there's a nostalgia component here
because in front of me is a device
that's gonna bring me back it's gonna
take me back to another era the tech
that got me started in this game the
tech game let's go to doing this my
friends is the samsung galaxy folder to
which is one of the last remaining flip
phones in the world of course this other
cheapo flip phones but I mean a legit
from a big brand a flip phone and it
runs Android and they're making it now I
just ordered this from Korea in fact
where they sell it and it's I guess
popular enough to keep making executives
flipping the phone maybe you never
experience what it was like to flip a
phone but me I go back I had the razor
you flip it up you make a deal people
see you flip it up they're like let's
make a deal then you flip it now our
phones are less phone and they're more
computer in your pocket but that doesn't
mean there isn't a place a warm cozy
little hole like a gopher or a fox did
you ever see that Wes Anderson movie
with the Fox in it Oh quite good it's a
16 gigabyte phone let's flip it around
here 3G 8 megapixel camera a bunch of
Korean writing 16 gigabytes of memory
they list the size of the display in
millimeters ninety six point six
millimeters quad core processor ok I
need a knife which I moved
hey this is uh this is historical it's
like this will be in a museum one day
the last of the flip phone okay actually
well then oh my it looks like a display
but it isn't it's plastic we have a
volume rocker over here camera on the
back speaker flash microUSB on the
bottom no fancy type-c connector oh now
isn't there something satisfying about
that a physical keypad I need to make a
business that's huge
that feels so unusual nowadays you got
the real estate put it in escrow I'll
pay cash this is a touch screen up here
so you're still you're tapping away but
then you have this directional pad and
dedicated keys so you could type out a
text old-fashioned style with the t9
click click click man I used to know
people that were rapid-fire with the t9
but of course you can reach up like this
and you can type on screen to the
headset but this device does not include
a headphone jack
you need a micro USB headset a micro USB
cable a power brick and adapter remember
the days when a battery shipped
separately and you installed it yourself
how exciting
take this back panel off a SIM card slot
and also a micro SD card slot big fan of
that now the battery is at 1950 milliamp
hours so not super huge you know I could
see this device being popular amongst
senior citizens maybe what about people
who are kind of rugged with their
devices it's kind of like vinyl you
remember Jack went vinyls making a huge
comeback right now it's the nostalgia
factor
I said angry where they do angry will
adieu coming for you
mm powered by Android and Android flip
phone the Korean writing here again this
is popular in other parts of the world
not so much in North America and look at
that its proper Android and I noticed
something really cool immediately
there's an outdoors button genius why
isn't that on other devices just a quick
tap and it triggers a super-bright mode
which lasts for 15 minutes you know the
other thing I noticed having stared at
it and held it up to my faces it's huge
that is a massive it's a massive
undertaking holding that thing up but it
is a flip phone and that's kind of cool
you have a choice you can use the keypad
or you can go directly to the display
you see I could just tap up on here
scroll through like that I've got my
notifications as well as my quick
toggles over there and go back home like
this back button and multitasking button
this is essentially an entire Android
phone just in this top part and this
section right here you can still use
this pad and not touch your display you
don't get anything good prints up there
I guess that's kind of cool now
otherwise you have access to all the
usual apps I can go I can watch YouTube
on here now the keyboard is obviously
tiny you can see with two thumbs I can
kind of line it up like this and I can
type reasonably well here a nice
landscape viewing experience here's a
side benefit look at that Jack it's like
its own stand the speaker fires to the
back here but I'd say it's comparable to
like the s8 or something like that I
want to launch the camera app I'm gonna
shoot this in landscape mode that
doesn't look too fantastic right now
yeah it's a little bit blown out can I
make some adjustments to it or what not
really hey the only thing I can adjust
this video resolution very high high or
VGA and then I can also flip the camera
around so you can take a look at
Jack there is hi Jack how's it going man
now the quality on this front one not
the best I've seen let's do a quick snap
here hmm yes we've seen images with
better contrast and more detail by no
means a great camera it's probably not
why you're biased I mean they say it's
eight megapixel this is not a super
expensive phone either so you kind of
have to adjust your expectations there
it does take photos now I notice that
the menus are very easy to read the text
is all very large once again
contributing to my speculation that this
thing is mostly targeted at the older
generation of people listening they need
phones too okay maybe you download
snapchat and you become an influencer or
a social-media influencer that's what we
need we need more senior citizen
influencers I'm all fed up with the
young influencers you know what I used
to do I used to walk to the supermarket
for my mom uphill both ways that's right
Jack uphill both ways barefoot in the
winter now of course we can just go
ahead and and and make a phone call as
well we can we can quickly launch our
contacts here we can just start we can
just start typing a number you could
just go in here for one six you're
dialing all right you can pick up the
phone and call use your voice like a
human being
well it's your grandpa Lou how do I
sound youngster all right what do you
think can we can we get a business deal
done or what can we hash out the details
yeah can you sign on the dotted line
yeah I can do that
you see what happens with a flip phone
all right guys you get business done I'm
not an Instagram
it's all business
it's Android on a flip phone in 2017
it's still a thing and I'm grateful that
it is I would recommend this to anybody
who's comfortable with a flip phone and
use one in the past this is obviously
for a select group of people but if you
know that group of people or if you are
that group of people do everyone a favor
and let them know that this thing exists
flip phones they aren't dead question
number one of the day from NAS TGM will
you ever do a jack face reveal I'm not
sure exactly how I would do that I mean
I'm not Jack obviously but I will say at
10 million subscribers you may learn a
little something more about Jack so tell
your friends to subscribe because we're
almost there here's one from market 249
what was your first console the very
first game console I had was actually
one that my parents had before me it was
called in television very bizarre the
controllers were kind of like old-school
corded phones they looked like bones
sort of they weren't of course they had
a number pad on them though very bizarre
and then shortly after that I got the
original Nintendo and the game changed
forever and here's one from Fred left
flesh are you going back to the pixel
when the new one comes out so if you
don't know I'm sure most of you do I've
always been a fan of the pixel devices
well not the pixel devices because they
only recently became pixel devices with
that name but previously the Nexus
devices this stock Google devices iPhone
every single one back to the original
and I've used them all as daily drivers
so certainly when the next pixel to
pixel 2 or pixel XL 2 comes out I'll be
using that for a while possibly
exclusively time will tell
so there you have it your questions have
