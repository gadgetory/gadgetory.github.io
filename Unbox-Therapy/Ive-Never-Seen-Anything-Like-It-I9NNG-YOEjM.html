looked at before I've never I never
looked at anything in this particular
category now on the surface it looks
like I'm about to unbox to some kind of
briefcase that's kind of what it is at
least in terms of form factor but inside
is quite a bit of tech this is a product
from a company called rhinology it's the
Phoenix generator this is a suitcase
full of power and the reason it's a
generator is because when it flips open
it's actually two fully functional solar
panels that can bring power in and then
store it on the internal battery you see
up here built in monocrystalline solar
panels 20 watt
expandable up to 120 watts now you see a
guy over here he's got a backpack he's
out in the wilderness he's enjoying
himself but he still needs power all
right I don't know maybe he's got to do
something various devices maybe he's got
a drone he likes to fly around because
he's in the mountains and you getting
shots who knows what the scenario is but
this thing here is a ton of use on the
road myself I probably more inclined to
keep it in the truck keep it as a backup
battery that I could charge from the Sun
maybe you're one of the zombie
apocalypse type dude or a survival
prepper type guy either way giant
battery in a form factor that I haven't
seen before which is essentially this
fold-out briefcase style you got a few
more specs it's got a multimode LED
light built in a DC charge for AC charge
for so if you do want to charge up the
internal battery without the Sun off of
a wall outlet you can I think a lot of
people will do that got USB ports four
of them 12-volt DC output port that's a
full sized AC out so that means now
you're charging equipment that plugs
into the wall this is really amazing to
look at these specs over here it can
charge an iPad 8 times the drone three
times a laptop five times and a GoPro 47
times
select cracks it videos and intuitive
look like accessory box a student
you weren't expecting that we try always
the low key the same video and then
follow me I stay on guard alright so
here's the unit who that thinks he's
tough taking a closer peek at this you
know you're not dealing with the regular
briefcase that's where all your
connectivity lives as I said before
full-size AC port cigarette lighter
couple the USB is actually for USBs and
that door has a gasket on it so I'm
assuming you're going to have some water
resistance there on the other side top
this baby down here's the AC skin and
the trigger right later in so this is to
charge the unit up if you're not using
the solar panels over here is that big
light that's included and this is the
cool part boom looks like a regular
everyday briefcase until this and then
once you've got that going energy from
the Sun what a beautiful concept
renewable off-the-grid I don't know what
your power consumption needs are but hey
and to back up source this is pretty
cool maybe you're going to a music
festival to get this baby out there and
you become the talk of the town here
there's a focal point people come over
they charge up that could be you every
chord known to man you could possibly
want a charge cable for either
that's a lightning connector right there
it's also a microUSB for Android devices
and otherwise a cigarette lighter cable
I think like I said for people who keep
this in their truck or car that's going
to be an easy way to get juice into this
unit oh wow and check this one out this
looks like it's for a light bulb it is
with a light switch the zombies don't
stand a chance you're going to be living
in luxury so as you can see I have 43%
battery life built in I activate the AC
out or the DC out look at that that's a
bright that's actually a pretty bright
flashlight there whew spooky ah check
that out that's an SOS mode so when the
zombies are closing in this is your mode
right here alright now we should
definitely try to charge something up
the cool thing here with this Phoenix
generator is the fact that it can act as
the hub for various devices there are so
many inputs and outputs here
you could charge a wide variety of stuff
now obviously here I've got a couple of
phones and iPad and even a camera this
is an a7 s and what you'll see is when I
go ahead and turn on these ports let's
hit a button here for both and you'll
see them come on so now absolutely
everything here is charging now these
two phones and the camera are plugged
into three of the four available USB
ports with the iPad we're actually using
the AC output I could also crack this
open while those were charging just like
this and then BOOM now I'm getting
sunlight charging this up charging those
up I'm golden it's a pretty cool little
package giant battery and the ability to
charge yourself from the Sun forever as
long as the Sun is still up there I
think there's certain apocalypse
theories that wipe the Sun out as well
in which case well you'll be dead anyway
so I can't help you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
