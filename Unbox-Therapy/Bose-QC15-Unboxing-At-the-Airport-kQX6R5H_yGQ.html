you wanted to see an airport unboxing
video courtesy of one of these Best Buy
Express vending machines obviously
there's a lot of stuff to selecting here
for this unboxing video
I read your guys comments and a lot of
you wanted to see my opinion on these
right here since I play around with and
listen to so many different headphones
it is kind of strange that I haven't
tried anything from Bose yet so you
order right down over here
let's see headphones and you can see the
different options we have the overpriced
QuietComfort 15 right there what are
they selling for 329 bucks all for the
purpose of your entertainment ok by now
I assume they're going to need my credit
card number pretty soon I'm about to be
robbed if I Best Buy and Bose credit
card is inserted and swiped goes up
grabs the headphones but waits for my
verification very interesting okay so
it's grabbing the headphones now sliding
them down just like purchasing a can of
soda here we go hello where are you
imagine this thing screws up and you got
a $300 set of headphones on the other
side
I don't think shaking this is going to
work
Wow check that out that's pretty cool
all right
so just like that QC 15s are in my hands
now let's go to in Airport unboxing
video so my flight San Francisco is
about to take off in fact they're
boarding right now so we're going to do
this on boxing video then we're going to
have to speed it up it's going to be a
speed unboxing but the cool part is if I
get this done in the airport then it
means I can edit the video on the
airplane and actually test these things
out on the flight and it's five hours so
it would give me a good chance to get to
know these headphones which I've never
tried okay I'm going to find a table
we're going to do this thing
guerilla style no studio necessary in
here this is going to work
yes this work so I found a spot to sit
down let's go ahead and take a closer
look at the box so I've taken off the
plastic so that I can maintain my sanity
here while trying to unbox this with one
hand as you know there's nothing simple
about that this is ghetto style right
now okay so here are the QC 15s they
give a protective case I knew that
that's why I wasn't too concerned living
the box up we've also got a tiny bit of
paperwork right here silica pouch keep
it dry dry is good when it comes to
electronics inside the case is of course
where the headphones live you've
probably seen these on somebody they're
incredibly popular I can't really say
too much about Bose I know of course
this is your run-of-the-mill type of
headphone brand and you're probably not
getting the best bang for your buck here
but I do kind of owe it to you guys to
try something a little bit different out
after all they are so popular and you
guys probably have lots of questions
about how these sound comparatives to
some of the other stuff that I featured
on the channel so anyways actually not a
bad design pretty soft as well on the
inside and really light that could be a
good thing or a bad thing it could mean
that they're cheaply made or it could
just mean that they're going to be
really easy to keep on your head and not
get fatigued this metallic ring around
the outside the ear cups do flip they
fold flat for portability obviously they
take batteries that's what powers up
that
active noise cancellation I believe and
there's a power switch in that location
there it looks like a pretty well padded
headband as well and then a huge array
of cabling so oh they've also included a
battery that's awesome
I don't need to find one so it takes it
looks like a single triple-a battery to
me there's an airline adapter for using
your headphones on airplanes which is
what they expect and a couple of
different cabling options one of them
obviously has that inline microphone I
have a flight to catch what am I looking
at here
402 it started boarding five minutes ago
it was a major sacrifice but I wanted to
do an exclusive in the airport unboxing
video people think I'm crazy sitting
around me you guys asked for it on
Instagram and guess what you got it QC
15 unboxed impromptu unboxing video
leave a thumbs up down below leave a
comment and I'll see you guys in San
Francisco later so it looks like the
flight is delayed a little bit or at
least they're not boarding yet so I
figured I might as well show you guys
what these look like on my head in the
meantime if I can get them on with one
hand
let's see one-handed operation is it
possible oh I think so
so there we go they're actually really
quite comfortable obviously no active
noise cancellation happening right now I
haven't even put the battery in but
lightweight and comfy I will get on this
flight soon and that's what I'm eating
these things plugged in and set up and
like I said before seen in San Francisco
55 that would be passengers to Fogg
Louie looper though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
