3d from a company called moe pick now
what this thing claims to do is to take
your iPhone 7 plus turn it into a 3d
capable screen this snap 3d it goes onto
your display you do a quick kind of
configuration and all of a sudden
without glasses you're seeing 3d it's
kind of interesting now it's not the
first time I've played with the idea of
3d on a smartphone that is very 3d the
thing he's poking me with is right
around this range but today it's turning
an iPhone 7 plus into 3d so it might be
the first ever 3d iPhone install snap 3d
case download mplayer 3d that's the app
where you can watch your videos and so
on
in 3d have the image pop right out of
your phone with automatic conversion so
it's going to convert 2d content to 3d
content
alright let's crack this baby open here
and see what's what oh wow a lot thinner
than I expected so oh you wear the case
on the back of the device when it's not
in you see I was wondering about this
implementation just sits on the back of
your device when you want to go 3d mode
it goes on the front and you see the
reason I know that is because there's
the cutout for the home button and then
when you're done you want to go back a
very very thin case when it's not in use
to save 3d content connect your mobile
to your computer go to iTunes apps
file-sharing choose and player 3d and
add it to your documents whoo so with
those stickers off you can see it's a
very minimal case let's launch it and
play 3d and then I am going to put this
case on which appears to have
fingerprints already good oh my goodness
all right I'm already having a 3d effect
sort of look straight keep a distance
okay cool next caution
what no hair no sunglasses no hands near
your face and no fancy anti-pollution
masks either all right I can handle that
stay within the red lines Oh
which on my eyes oh this is more
sophisticated than I thought Jack can
you see this hang on now when I'm
looking straight at it it grabs them it
turns them green whoa angle set up check
this out
aah and I want these to be parallel whoo
I'm having a real 3d feeling right now
looks good to me
next make the beam dark okay so this is
far beyond the other stuff that I've
played with in the past for sure whoa
what do you see with the right eye B oh
my goodness
oh my goodness so there's a sample clip
in here to get you started so to you
this looks completely flat I'm just
looking over there at that image to me
it's not flat at all this oh man it is
very intense this 3d effect to me this
feels like my finger is underneath the
logo the logo is popping way out of the
display should I do a movie trailer
Deadpool movie trailer let's try this
Wow oh that's because it's christmas day
dopinder and i'm after someone on my
naughty list
I realized as I'm getting lost in this
right here that you guys to you it looks
completely normal you're not having this
effect at all it's amazing there's eye
tracking because since it finds your
eyes it's a very consistent 3d effect
Esther wills this is wild man you're not
gonna see it there's no way you only
have one eyeball Jack
that's one eyeball to see stereo 3 you
gotta have two eyeballs it's better than
3d that I've seen before I mean it looks
really good what can I say
there's a light that goes from green to
red if it loses your eyes it goes to red
and it loses the law and if it stays
green the whole time
and you hold it here it's unbelievable
it's really good it's way better than
that other thing that I had and can't
stand for five years that's any and I
don't really feel like I'm straining my
eyes which is bizarre too because
normally I do something called snake
demo okay this is this is way more 3d
than the movie trailer for me it's like
out here if that makes any sense to you
but it's popping out substantially Wow
that's some of the coolest 3d I've ever
held on to maybe you never thought you
would see a gadget like this I sure
didn't so they've got a series of clips
and demos in the mplayer 3d app that can
get you started but of course eventually
you're going to want to put your own
video files in here and convert them
which again can apply to any video files
you can do a 3d version of it what's
best about this particular one is its
low commitment it's the tiniest slimmest
little thing it's not like you got to
put glasses on this is it it's all
housed in this tiny little sheet also
happens to fit on the back of your
iPhone and protect it maybe I should
look up the price they make it for the
galaxy a5 the iPhone 7 plus the s7 edge
Note 5 and also for tablets as well
alright so this device is super early
stages right now no release date like
you can't find it on Amazon for example
right now but the official website does
have an inquiry page they don't say the
price but they do say it'll be around
the cost of a regular protective case
which means dirt cheap probably this
could be a really cool thing so check
out their website for more information
but like I said don't expect to go to
Amazon and like buy this thing right now
just keep it on your radar it's it's a
cool implementation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
