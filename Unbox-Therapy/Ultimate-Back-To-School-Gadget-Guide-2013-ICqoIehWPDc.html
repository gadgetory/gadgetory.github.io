heavily requested video this is the
official back to school technology slash
gadget guide now even if you're not a
student anymore and you're not going
back to school you'll probably want to
pay attention because these are great
suggestions in a number of different
categories anyways we'll be covering
laptops tablets even things like
messenger bags and backpacks so let's go
ahead and get straight into it let's
start out with the most major category
which is laptops and these suggestions
probably won't surprise you too much if
you're in the market for a Mac then I'm
going to go ahead and recommend the
MacBook Air surprise surprise it's been
recently updated with has well it has a
crazy battery life it's incredibly thin
and portable comes in two sizes as I'm
sure you know 11 or 13 inch it's a
little bit pricey but so are ultra books
so if you're in the market for an
everyday system that you're going to be
doing work on you can't really do too
much better than the MacBook Air but I
do have a PC recommendation for you guys
as well it is the Acer Aspire s7 it's
been recently updated and much like the
MacBook Air it's incredibly thin and
light and it's also available in 11.6
and 13.3 inch sizes one thing it's got
over the MacBook Air is higher
resolution displays there's a 1080p
screen on the 11 inch so you're
definitely going to want to look into
that if you're a fan of pixels it's also
got gorilla glass on the top portion of
the laptop shell it not only helps the
laptop look really cool it's also very
scratch resistant and durable the next
category we're going to talk about are
headphones I've got two suggestions the
first are more portable in-ear style
headphones and then the next ones are
over the ear style which each has their
benefits and drawbacks but let's get
started with the in ear style the
Sennheiser CX 300 B mark 2 it's a long
name for a little set of headphones
these things are only 35 bucks I know
students are always considering the cost
of things even though the MSRP is 70
dollars they're only 35 bucks and you're
actually getting a very high quality
in-ear headphone from a very reputable
manufacturer of course Sennheiser been
in the headphone game forever
the reviews on Amazon are fantastic for
these they have some special features
you wouldn't expect to find
thirty-five dollar headphones they come
with a little carrying case you can
adjust the tips so you can get the exact
right fit if you're a bigger fan of over
the ear style headphones like myself
you're gonna want to check out the shirt
SRH 440s as you guys know if you've been
following my videos I just got a new set
of these in the office and I've been
using them every single day I'm a huge
fan so far they've got excellent bass
reproduction they're incredibly
lightweight and comfortable to wear for
extended use they also have a nice long
10-foot coiled cable with an adapter on
the end so if you need a mini Jack
connector or a quarter inch connector
there's a screw on locking adapter so
you can use these things in more
professional environments as well these
are a little more expensive they're
ninety-nine bucks
but hey you you get what you pay for
right these things are incredibly
high-quality and definitely worth
checking out the next category that a
number of you guys suggested I cover on
both Facebook and Twitter is that of
messenger bags and backpacks this is
obviously very important for those of
you that are carrying things back and
forth to school but also for those of
you that aren't in school because if
you're like me you carry your laptop
back and forth from work to home so the
first recommendation in the backpack
category came from a ton you guys you
all sent this in on Twitter the herschel
supply code pop quiz backpack it looks
kind of like a JanSport style backpack
except it's available in a huge number
of color combinations and patterns
another cool thing these guys are based
in Vancouver Canada
so we're repping the homeland by
recommending these guys and it's also
got a laptop sleeve in there if you need
to carry a computer these retail for
about 69 bucks so not too bad in terms
of affordability next is the messenger
bag recommendation I'm recommending the
10 buck messenger photo slash laptop bag
this is the bag I carry every single day
and it works not only as a laptop bag
but also as a photo bag there is a
removable portion that you can use to
hold lenses digital SLRs all kinds of
photo gear but then you can take it out
if you're only going to be carrying a
laptop so most days I have the photo
insert out this is heavy duty stuff I
brought it with me to you know trade
shows to CES when I travel and the thing
has held up incredibly well a little bit
pricey at a hundred bucks but well worth
it in my estimation and also
available in a crazy number of colors
for the record I have the gray it's like
a dark gray gunmetal type color the next
category I want to cover is tablets and
this was probably the easiest pick for
me out of any category I would like to
recommend the Nexus 7 it is incredibly
affordable it is the right size for
travel it has that beautiful
high-resolution screen there's really
not too much negative that you can say
about it 229 dollars a ton of pixels and
a fantastic device so if you're in the
market for a tablet for back-to-school
don't look any further than the Nexus 7
the next recommendation I have is for a
set of speakers these are the ones that
I personally use at home there are a two
point one system so there's a little
subwoofer to go with two satellite
speakers and they produce an incredible
amount of bass for something at this
price point they're about a hundred
bucks these are the Logitech Z 6 to 3 or
Z 6 to 3 for those of you in the u.s.
I'm a big fan of these speakers they're
simple to set up and they just sound
great so if you need to upgrade look at
these babies by the way the links are
all down in the description if you're
wondering where to find all this stuff
the next category I want to cover real
quick is clothing I'm trying to keep you
guys looking good for back-to-school and
I know a lot of you guys are going to
buy some new clothes before you head
back if you haven't checked out packs
uncom yet or if you haven't been into
the store it's a great place to pick up
some name-brand
type gear and they've got a sale right
now 30% off a bunch of different stuff
I've got a link you can use down in the
description to head right over to the
sale items so definitely check that out
oh another thing about PacSun they ship
internationally so you can get some
great deals even if you're here in
Canada or anywhere else in the world I
also wanted to hook you guys up with a
couple of cheaper deals I know a lot of
guys get aggravated by the fact that I
only recommend things that are
relatively expensive even though we
didn't go too over-the-top on this
particular back-to-school guide but I do
have a couple of cheap items in here for
those of you on a tight budget the first
item is the classic moleskin notebook
available in a variety of sizes and
colors you've probably seen one of these
before but there's a reason that they
are the classic many people use these to
take down notes and keep important
information
nice tidy little package if you've never
owned a moleskin try it out who knows
maybe you'll take some notes oh and
girls love guys with moleskin notebooks
I don't know if that's true but to
actually tell me if that's true test
that out for this last item I'm taking
care of you guys during snack time if
you've never tried Pocky before now is
the perfect time this is an import snack
food it's chocolate it's biscuit it's an
all-around win and you can get ten
packages for $4.99 on Amazon right now I
don't know how long they're going to be
at this price I know some people
complain when they click on the link the
prices change that just depends on how
much they sell but right now you can get
ten packs for $4.99 if you've never
tried Pocky before get it if you have
tried Pocky before and you love it this
is a good deal so get it too and girls
love them too and they have strawberry
so that wraps up this back-to-school
