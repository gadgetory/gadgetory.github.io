a package for them you know me I usually
I was going for it alright you have to
come here though like yeah okay you
psych me out downstairs earlier well is
like I got this new thing it's pretty
cool and he doesn't always say that
specifically you're like that thing is
cool it's a head turner
I don't know what this is so if this
thing sucks it is not exciting or
interesting at all it's will e-news
fault let's just err
also remember he's looking for cool
stuff the coolest things in the world
yeah and if you have anything hit me up
on Twitter yeah tweet at tweet at Willy
do and who knows maybe it'll show up on
the show he's always out there he's
lurking he's a real lurker
hey you know what this is Jack I know
what this is uh I think I saw this on
Kickstarter or IndieGoGo okay maybe I
don't know what this is what did you
think it was to heat up your hands when
you're playing video games
that's exactly okay cuz you get cold
hands which I didn't know and also
there's no circulation because it's so
cold right but why are your hands
getting cold in the first place when
you're playing video games yeah Jack's
hands are always freezing he's always
complaining about it he's thinking right
now but is there something about the
this that just makes it hard for blood
to get there or something I was watching
overwatch League the guy the dude on the
break was like yeah like yeah so here's
how this work this is so crazy that a
product like this actually exists it is
a heater for your fingertips it really
is like designed for such a singular
purpose you plug it in you get her going
now you do have a keyboard as well we
actually borrowed kirk has been using
this keyboard this is the wildest thing
we did a video on this that's pretty
wild
this is the craziest keyboard of it look
at the top keys oh my goodness custom
key tabs all of it it's crazy
this would sit like this and then the
heater would sit like that and that is
an enormous power brick will he do it's
as big as the thing itself it could be
some hacker in Siberia was it Iron Man 2
the villain is the guy with the
electrical he starts out in like
someplace in Russia or something and
he's like a more lenient with the
hacking but it looks freezing in there I
don't remember the name of the villain
there so angry right now they're gonna
kill us
whip whip lash no oh I think it might be
what blood he would love this he could
do even more hacking hmm it's for cold
hackers that's a whip dynamo and endgame
have you heard endgame what son give
what's the endgame
who are the KITT Hemsworth Johansson
Downey jr. Chris Evans Ruffalo
anyhow what are we doing here we have a
power switch inline power switch can you
see this jack I'm worried this thing
might suck enough energy to like knock
out our little power break oh yeah
you're right if the video stops here we
know why
so giver ago Oh My yes yes he is coming
off that like nice yo if you have this
on your desk jack is gonna be so jealous
of you is it really gonna Rihanna wait
you got away is it reaching up down here
it has to spilt it up right no it is
working about burning marshmallow no it
is working why were you saying that you
think it's split because it's
defenseless yeah why does oh right
this is heating up this hand and this is
heating up this and uh when you're
gaming exactly yeah they actually kind
of designed it in such a fashion that it
would fit in with your typical gamer
pathetic I think it looks better with
the light dawg it could we hit the
lights
Oh baby looks like the rear end of a
Lamborghini really dude it's not really
blowing heat it's just you see those
little those little coils warming up you
see that tack so there's no noise really
coming out of it the actual exterior
surfaces are not that hot oh yeah it's
just not that hot the keyboard and the
heater right there and you're just
gaming there's heat coming off there I
think Jack would love it what do you
think well is it a go to are you into it
yeah I'm gonna oh you're not gonna let
him use it you're gonna oh oh give them
another yeah I'm another one okay try it
go ahead try get it like it's good you
know it's a subtle warmth mm-hmm how
much is it well let's get down to brass
tacks
179 it's a couple of dollars but this
will stay this isn't something that
you're gonna if
it actually doesn't look like there's
any mud parts or anything well done an
interesting product Willie do ladies and
gentlemen he did it again he showed you
something you didn't necessarily know
existed he does it for you and it comes
from a place of love and tenderness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
