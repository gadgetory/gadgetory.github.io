bringing you my official playstation 4
unboxing video in 4k so first things
first I want to give a big shout out to
Sony for sending up this ps4 and making
this video possible I have recorded this
video in 4k resolution so you can get
all of that detail when it comes to
checking out this hardware so if you
want to see it in full res make sure to
change the quality setting down below
this YouTube video the PlayStation 4
features an all-new controller packing
in some brand new tech and innovation
and while it looks a little bit like the
old version the fit in your hands is
significantly different and in my
opinion significantly more comfortable
you've got multiple vibration motors
inside for an enhanced Rumble experience
so the idea here is that hopefully
having multiple motors will help you to
decide where the action is coming from
based on where the rumble occurs on the
controller in relation to what's
happening on-screen there's a light bar
on the front now this light bar will
communicate status info with you the
player so if it changes colors it could
identify things that are happening in
the game like if your health is running
low for example and of course if you use
this in conjunction with a PlayStation
camera it also becomes trackable so the
camera can track your position or the
position of the controller I should say
the touchpad on the top that I showed
you earlier is capable of drag-and-drop
flicking as well as multi-touch right
now Killzone actually takes advantage of
this by allowing you to assign different
commands to your owl drone using this
touchpad we will have to wait and see
how other developers of other games take
advantage of this touchpad as I
mentioned earlier the DualShock 4
features a dedicated share button as you
can probably guess that gives you the
ability to share both gameplay video as
well as screenshots on a number of
popular networks including Facebook and
Twitter and you can even do live streams
on Ustream and twitch there's also some
paperwork included inside the box as
you'd expect and part of that paperwork
is a code to get you started with
PlayStation Plus allowing you to get
online and start using some of those
awesome multiplayer features setting up
the devices in
easy to do just plug in your HDMI cable
as well as your power cable and you're
ready to start playing sony has been
generous enough to include all of those
cables necessary which includes the HDMI
cable which hasn't come in previous
generations so you literally have
everything you need right in the box to
start playing the power cable doesn't
include a separate power brick that's
built right into the ps4 that is a big
plus over the competitors and you've
also got the micro USB cable included
for charging the controller this plugs
in rather simply just like your
smartphone or other micro USB device
you've also got a basic headset in the
box this is a one-sided kind of stealth
portable headset which now plugs into
the controller using this mini jack
connector very simple right on the
bottom you will see your audio port plug
it in and you are ready to start using
the headset the last item in the box is
arguably the most important this is the
actual console the PlayStation 4 packing
8 cores of computing power as well as 8
gigabytes of gddr5 memory of 500
gigabyte built-in hard drive a blu-ray
disc drive on the front which is
slot-loading you've got capacitive
buttons for the power as well as the
disk eject button there are two USBs on
the front used for charging your
controllers or connecting USB devices on
the back is all the rest of your
connectivity a power port an optical
audio port an HDMI out a LAN port and
then in aux port which will be used for
your PlayStation camera if you pick one
up navigating the PlayStation 4 will be
a familiar experience for individuals
coming from the previous generation
PlayStation console you have this
left-to-right navigation but even for
individuals who haven't ever used the
PlayStation 3 this is very simple and
streamlined as far as a user experience
you have two menu systems the first main
one and then this secondary one you can
access by pressing up on the d-pad this
will give you access to things like your
download statuses as well as your
friends list who's online other
PlayStation Network features and then
maybe most importantly all of your
settings which I happen to access on a
fairly regular basis in here you can
change all
of things including the ability to log
into your system parental controls
whether you want to backup your data you
can see what's using up all of your hard
drive space and that brings me to
something else the hard drive is fully
user upgradeable on the PlayStation 4 I
may do an upgrade video in the future so
leave a thumbs up down below if that's
something that you would enjoy seeing
but what about the games after all the
PlayStation 4 is a next-generation
gaming console so in front of me I have
a copy of one of the launch titles knack
so on the surface knack is a very
family-friendly two-player co-op game
that being said if you toggle up the
difficulty level you can turn it into a
more challenging experience as the level
of AI increases so if you're an
experienced gamer it could be more
suitable at a higher difficulty level it
makes neck a really good title for
households where you have new gamers
mixed with more experienced ones
everybody can sort of get a challenge
out of it as you can tell the visuals
are very beautiful there are bright
colorful graphics and you have fully
animated CG cutscenes that are also very
nice to look at for example in one of
the earlier levels some of the smoke
effects were very convincing anyways as
you can tell it's got an old-school vibe
to it you know you go around bash some
dudes up and really a core element here
is you collect these things called
artifacts which make nak larger and more
powerful as you move through levels this
is really cool because the game style
sort of changes as your character
changes that might sound a little bit
complicated basically it gets really
really fun as you get huge and starts
smashing through enemy's walls and
pretty much everything else within the
world so anyway guys definitely if
you're picking up a brand new
PlayStation 4 you might want to get
started with knack as one of your launch
titles to take home with you as I said
earlier a game for everybody in the
household once again big shout out to
the folks over at Sony Playstation for
sending this system out so I could give
you guys a closer look at the next-gen
Playstation 4 so that wraps up this
unboxing and overview of the PlayStation
4 if you guys enjoyed this content
please remember to leave a thumbs up
down below thanks as always for watching
and I will catch you on the next episode
later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
