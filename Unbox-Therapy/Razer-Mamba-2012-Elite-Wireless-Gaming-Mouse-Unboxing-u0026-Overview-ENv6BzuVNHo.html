therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Razer Mamba Wireless Gaming Mouse
this is the 2012 elite version of this
mouse which comes along with razors
brand new 4G dual sensor system now
that's going to mean a lot of
sensitivity a significant number of dpi
here's a look at some of the
specifications on the back of the box
including the 6400 dpi 4G dual sensor
system so let's go ahead jump inside the
box and take a closer look at the mouse
and also what's included so the first
thing you're going to notice is a very
nice unboxing experience razer
definitely puts a significant amount of
attention to detail in their packaging
so the first thing you're going to get
is a little bit of paperwork from Razer
thanking you for your purchase there's
also going to be your official user
guide or manual whichever you prefer to
call it that'll help you get up and
running with your device as well as the
driver on your computer or system and
here you'll notice you also get a Razer
sticker in case you want to let other
people know that you are a Razer
customer so next you've got a docking
station after all this is a wireless
mouse so you can use this very sleek
dock in order to charge your device and
it'll also work as a transmitter
underneath there you've also got one
more box a little box here that includes
your battery after all like I said this
is Wireless so you will need a battery
to use it and a battery door to cover
that portion so I'll go ahead and
install that off-camera and show you
guys what that looks like in a quick
moment but first let's take a look at
the USB cable which is pretty special it
has a special connector on one end that
I'll show you in a quick second it also
features a woven nylon design so it
should be fairly durable and it is also
fairly long so here's a look at that
unique connector that I mentioned
earlier and that will give you the
ability to plug directly into the mouse
or into the transmitter and it does so
in a manner that's pretty sleek you
don't really notice that the cable is
not permanent I'll show you in a quick
second here what I'm talking about so
you go ahead and slide the cable
directly into the mouse and it actually
in place so it's not going to come out
accidentally the only way you can get it
out is by holding the unlock switch to
the right of the connector while trying
to extract it so if you're gaming etc
and you're using the mouse as a wired
device you're not going to have to worry
about this cable coming out
inadvertently so that to me is a very
very nice feature and you can use the
exact same cable for the wireless
transmitter / dock and it also fits in
there very nicely so it doesn't look
like it's a misfit in either it really
is designed well in my opinion to work
with both devices whether it's going
straight into the mouse or into the dock
now the dock is going to charge your
wireless mouse as well via two metallic
contact points and I also think it's a
really nice place just to store your
mouse in general this is going to really
look nice up on your desk or wherever
you want to put it as you can see the
design and build quality of this mouse
is pretty impressive at first glance now
the mouse is constructed out of a very
soft touch material that's nice to use
and you'll notice here that it's also
incredibly sensitive I'll give you an
even closer look here just how sensitive
it is it's really like a hair-trigger it
doesn't take much pressure at all to
press down the trigger button and so
depending on what kind of a person you
are maybe it's too sensitive of course
you can always make adjustments you've
also got a backlit scroll wheel it's got
a blueish purple-ish LED and on the
bottom of the devices where you'll find
your on/off switch as well as your
wireless button there's also a battery
indicator on the left hand side of the
device that's fairly subtle and of
course a razor stamp right on the main
area of the mouse so as you guys can
tell this is a very nice looking Mouse
obviously I haven't used it extensively
yet so I'll be comparing it to my
performance MX in the coming days and
I'll get back to you guys with more
information on my opinion if you're
interested in pricing and availability

the description of this video so you can
go and get that info I also want to
mention that tonight is Sunday which
means the live stream is going to be
