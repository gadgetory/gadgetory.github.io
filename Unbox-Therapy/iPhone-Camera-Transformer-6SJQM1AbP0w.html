up guys Lew here back with another video
and today I'm checking out probably the
coolest iPhone camera cases that I've
ever seen these are legitimately
professional looking they have a
dedicated shutter button in a huge array
of lens add-ons and various grips this
might be the most advanced way you can
shoot photos with that smartphone in
this case the iPhone 6 or 6s it is from
a company called bit play it's called
the snap Pro professional camera case
plus I've got a bunch of lenses over
here to try out there's the case itself
as well as an extended grip similar
setup here in this case though you're
adding a leather strap as well as a
wooden grip look at that thing and you
guys know my relationship with wood you
can see how you install your phone
physical shutter button two types of
grips so it's easy to hold it in
portrait mode or landscape tripod
compatible so there is a tripod mount up
to six lenses you can add to this and of
course with the thumb rest a firmer grip
which the ladies tell me is very
important so this is a quick and easy
way to kind of upgrade your social
photography let's say stuff that you
intend on sharing immediately and of
course that's very easy to do on an
iPhone and less easy to do on a
dedicated camera look at that guy Jack
look at that guy I mean now you feel you
put that baby in there you feel like a
you're the real deal for a minute
instant real deal a single lens but two
functionalities so it does wide-angle or
macro and it feels pretty solid actually
so this is the the front and back cap
here if you take the standard black grip
you're gonna get a tripod mount included
on there see that Jack fancy wooden one
does not have that so you got to make a
call there a standard strap
and then the hotshot leather strap for
the boss players you know who you are it
looks like it's just simply two screws
on the backside here ooh
so natural-organic
I even kind of like they're little mini
screwdriver here I can think of other
uses for it on other devices we're in
business now the wide angle as I said
it's versatile because you can actually
flick the front spin it and turn it into
a macro lens as well now the thumb part
slides in here cool all right so that's
optional okay so we're gonna go down and
then snap it in whoo now the thumb grip
goes in oh yes
Wow I really underestimated the
importance of a thumb grip tiny bit
concern that might slide out let's see
here yeah oh there yeah let's open the
camera app here oh yeah we are totally
wide angling it right now whoa very wide
oh how about this little speaker from
the last video you can see how much
bigger the field of view is here pull
that part off now it becomes a macro
lens whoa we're talking like tiny little
fibers and whatnot on that speaker Wow
right inside that micro USB there it's
kind of important to mention that your
other buttons are still available to you
you've still got access to your whole
switch volume up volume down oh wow the
mechanism they have here is actually
lifting up on that when I press here
because the iPhone maps the shutter to
the volume down tell me if you see a
move that's how they navigated the fact
that the volume down is the way you take
a you have a physical shutter button on
the iPhone they sent a bunch of other
lens adapters as well look at that
they're all in the frame perfect listen
I like white angles you're we're talking
this is a wide angle you see me wide
angle it's a bird it's a plane it's a
wide-angle lens
polarisers going to cut down on
reflections if you're shooting out in
bright light against reflective surfaces
full-frame fisheye substantially more
distorted fisheye type situation fisheye
plus macro ultra wide plus macro and
then a telephoto this is zoom what do we
have here three times zoom let's try
this one out decent chunk of glass there
the zoom lens and if I go ahead and
unscrew it being very careful that's
without the zoom so wide-angle see
that's your standard iPhone field of you
can imagine being at an event taking
these cool photos videos using these
adapters that other people with iPhones
can't and sharing it immediately so now
you're you're a reporter now you're
April O'Neil if you don't know who that
is get your Google out Ninja Turtles FTW
don't ever grow up Jack I yeah you know
what it's I got the wrong number
oh I apologize sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
