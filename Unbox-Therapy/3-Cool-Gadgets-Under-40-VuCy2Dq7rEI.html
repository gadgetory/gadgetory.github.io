these budget tech videos after the last
one went up I saw the top comment
something along the lines of make this a
series please and so I decided why wait
let's get straight back to it because
the studio is full of random gadgets
some of them it's like hey let's pile
them together and show people some cool
stuff on this episode it's gonna be cool
tech gadget under 40 bucks now this one
on the right is thirty nine in the
middle 19 and over here twenty nine so
it's a good little bit of a range
alright now let's talk about the first
one this one this is kind of near and
dear to my heart because I had one of
those claw gadgets when I was a kid with
the plastic fingers on it you could like
go around and bother people with or I
mean there was always this dream of
being some sort of Inspector Gadget when
in reality the thing didn't work very
well it was kind of more like when you
play those games trying to get a stuffed
animal on the clock
and then you like I'm lying right up all
I got to do is close the cloth and it's
like II
e and then as soon as it starts to lift
up man every time but of course the game
is rigged and you already know that well
anyway these guys right here company
called OD I think they decided to make
the more mature hopefully functional
version of that object and then they
added some other stuff to it too so it's
the ultimate Gravatt gadget in your car
you drop something between the seeds to
nightmare the cash you drop some cash
down the drain
well it ain't down the drain yet cuz you
got the ultimate grab it gadget that's
the idea here
there you get a better idea of what it
looks like so there's a telescopic arm
19 inches four pronged claw super strong
flexible neodymium magnet and a
detachable LED light it's a lot going on
in this one gadget let's check it out
and see if I can see if I can grab
anything I can see this in a car or
something I mean it's kind of look fully
extend the claw alright well how do i
what do I twist no oh oh turn the claw
to lock okay so it's locked now whoa
then an antenna in it let's say I drop
some keys imagine I just go with this
guy right here
get in it Danette wow that thing works
then in it why am i doing the
SportsCenter theme whoa I'm picking
everything up whoop
I'm rich remember this thing also has a
powerful magnet on it and that's on the
side with a little curvature to leti
like that now that's even easier Oh
powerful boom
kaboom so this is like you drop a screw
or something down the drain
all of a sudden snake this little baby
down there kaboom you save the day can
you put a price on that it's certainly
worth more than a quarter I like this
little thing and then over here look at
that whoo and you can focus it in as
well the beam depending on what you want
when you're going down to grab something
there we go
it's got a few things going on but it
does kind of deliver on that promise of
that toy claw that you had as a kid now
you have it as an adult and you have no
excuse next up we've got this right here
this is going to solve some people's
problems this is a dual lightning charge
and audio cable many of you are probably
using iPhone 7s and seven pluses now and
of course when that phone came out a lot
of people were upset that they could no
longer listen to audio and charge the
device at the same time in other words
have it beside the bed listen to music
fall asleep and not drain the battery
completely so this company here has come
up with a dual lightning cable to solve
that problem so essentially if you look
at this diagram here this will go into
the bottom of the device you'll plug
your power cable as well as your audio
cable into here and also compatible with
the adapter that Apple includes so this
is it here takes one lightning port and
turns it into two that's pretty cool
there is actually a sequence that you
need to connect things in in order for
it to work correctly plug the headset
into this adapter first and then plug in
the power adapter boom music starts
playing it's charging right now this
gives you the freedom to listen to music
for extended periods of time without
worrying about your phone dying and not
necessarily having to use Bluetooth
headphones okay last up we have this
product here from a company called XO
Audio and this reminds me a lot of a
product that I featured previously on
the channel a little while back now this
gives you the ability to take wired
headphones and turn them into wireless
headphones so maybe you want the
wireless freedom but you like the
headphones you
have now these two products are targeted
specifically at the beats brand of
headphones and what they've done in this
box as well is included an adapter so
you can use this for car audio as well
as well as any other audio device really
what you'll see is I can install this on
here and now you get a lot more
extension away from whatever the audio
device is that you're trying to interact
with now I don't have Beats Studio or
solos here but I do have these
incredibly flashy
24k golden monster headphones which
don't happen to be wireless so this is
where the cable would go and of course
we're trying to make these wireless
using this product here this guy was
slide in the bottom like that and that's
essentially how it would look but since
these aren't the Beats Studio it doesn't
really quite sink in there properly you
would need to use an adapter for this
which you could use this adapter here
and then it kind of it slides in there
as you might imagine it's not the ideal
look but I'm just doing this for the
purpose of testing these here on this
particular video you're gonna press and
hold that to put it into wireless
pairing mode comes up right away
EXO studio look at me I'm styling sounds
pretty good actually surprisingly my
musical taste is far more fast than you
had ever assumed this is going to give
you the most seamless wireless
experience you won't even notice this on
your headphones three products under 40
bucks these are 39 39 29 and 19
