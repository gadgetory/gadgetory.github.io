therapy and today we're taking a look at
a Chromebook from Samsung this is my
very first experience with Chromebooks
I've never played with them before and I
can't wait to get inside and get a
closer look this one is the series 5 550
which is Samsung's top of the range in
the world of Chromebooks it includes a
3G module so you can use your SIM card
and get connectivity while you're on the
go they do have a lower end model which
is Wi-Fi only so anyways let's get to
the unboxing let's talk about what's
happening here you've got a little bit
of paperwork as well as a beautiful
little chrome sticker that you can do
with whatever you please and other than
that it's a pretty simple unboxing the
only other thing you're going to notice
in here is a power cable to go with this
mini little power brick which is always
a plus it's a plus to have a tiny little
power brick to carry with you although
the Chromebook should give you about 6
hours of battery life for normal usage
it's still nice to have a really small
portable power brick to go with it so
anyways let's take a closer look at the
main attraction this is a t-series 5 550
Chromebook with the silver color silver
finish along top upon closer inspection
you'll notice a nice mirrored Samsung
logo that's subtle it's small and then
in the top corner you've got the chrome
logo and the word chrome to identify the
fact that this is a Chromebook on the
bottom it's pretty straightforward
you've got a couple of grilles for your
fans and that's also the location of the
speakers I'll give you guys a closer
look at that towards the end of the
video so opening it up I think it's
pretty good looking at first appearance
here you can take a look at the keyboard
as well as the screen and the bezel
you'll notice one more Samsung logo on
the lower part of the bezel here then on
the top part is where you'll see your
webcam of course for web conferencing
etc and taking a closer look at the
keyboard it's a chiclet style keyboard
that is basically the norm these days
especially on thin and light notebooks
ultrabooks etc this keyboard is a little
bit different it has some different keys
on it since this is a Chromebook it's
not running Windows you've got enlarged
ctrl and alt keys which is nice because
those are used all the time
forward and back keys you've got a
refresh key you've got a believe a
microphone up their brightness keys
volume keys and the power button is also
on the keyboard there's also a very nice
large trackpad especially in comparison
to the size of the notebook it's got a
little line a little chrome bezel around
the outside of it which i think is a
nice touch on the side of the laptop
you'll notice your power port Ethernet
there's a display port for video out as
well as one USB and a headphone jack and
as you move to the other side you'll see
an SD card slot one more USB port and
the last thing on here is a Kensington
lock for locking this up of course on
the back side is where you'll insert
your SIM card for that 3G connectivity
that I mentioned earlier on the bottom
is where you'll find your speakers they
bounce off the table and then into your
ears it's kind of an interesting design
but it does function correctly I did
test it out now booting it up is pretty
straightforward you've got your chrome
logo to greet you you've got to put in a
few credentials your Google Account
obviously in order to get up and running
this is a 12.1 inch laptop for those of
you wondering so it is really small and
portable after you've got all your
system updates installed you can either
login as a guest or using those
credentials I mentioned earlier first I
logged in as a guest loaded up the
beasts feet comm that's my blog by the
way guys if you haven't checked it out
yet I'll put a link to it down in the
description but it's called the beast
feed comm this this system is actually
pretty snappy in the web browser whether
you're scrolling using multi-touch or
you're just looking at a video for
example this one right here it runs
fairly smoothly so I'm impressed at
least at this point now if you go ahead
and login with credentials like your
Google Account you'll be greeted with
this little interface here which goes
over some of the features and functions
of the notebook to help you get started
with it because it after all it really
is a new OS even though it's a Chrome
browser and most people are familiar
with it if you click on this little icon
down in the bar you'll bring up all your
different apps that are available
through the App Store and they show up
in this really clean little interface
and these are essentially bookmarks to
those apps which happen within the web
browser anyway guys that's been a quick
unboxing of the samsung series 5 550
chromebook can't wait to get more time
to play with this and check it out if
you guys enjoyed this unboxing please
remember to
like and favorite the video as it does
help out a bunch and for people waiting
for the ultimate gaming PC project more
info is coming up very very soon and
also if you're interested in pricing and
availability on this Chromebook I'll
drop a link down in the description of
this video so you can go check that out
alright guys thanks as always for
watching I'll catch you in the next
video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
