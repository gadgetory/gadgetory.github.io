fold and more specifically the questions
that you guys have the type of stuff
that's coming at me that you guys are
asking and one of the big questions that
I've been getting is relating to cases
it wasn't immediately obvious when you
saw this thing at the keynote what would
happen in a case Department even for
myself and I didn't expect cases to
exist at all because of this very
bizarre hinge situation but it turns out
I completely missed a case that was
included in the box
during the unboxing video samsung
includes something it's I mean it's very
flimsy and basic as you can see not that
that's a bad thing because it doesn't
add much bulk and this is the weird part
this part right here because it has to
have this screen cut out because you
have the external display as you're
aware of as well as the cutouts for the
camera earpiece and whatnot now I've had
cases like this in the past four
different smartphones I believe this is
made out of a material called aramid
which is like a Kevlar it allows it to
be rigid enough to not just snap in half
but also be incredibly thin and light so
I don't mind the material but it's not a
case in the sense that it's gonna give
you a ton of protection if that's what
you're looking for to protect your
investment because as we know this is a
very expensive smartphone I thought I
should go ahead and install this thing
you've talked a little bit about the
restrictions relating to cases on a
device like this whatever case comes out
for it whether it's from a third-party
manufacturer or from Samsung themselves
it's gonna have to deal with the fact
that this thing bends in the middle it
has a hinge in the middle so as you can
see this only installs to that point
there and then the other piece clips on
like this leaving space for the
front-facing display and then this
allows you to close it down like this
I've had this case on a little bit and
I've interacted with it to decide
whether I liked it or not it's a bit
strange there's some benefit some
drawbacks obviously the benefit it's a
bit of
it slides out of your pocket less
because well it's not as slippery as
glass happens to be and then when it
comes to the front-facing screen the
exterior screen it tells you very
obviously where the edge of that screen
happens to be so when you go to pull
down the notifications or bring up your
apps you know immediately where the edge
happens to be the right left top bottom
edge now the downside of that is it's
not it's not incredibly smooth dragging
up from there I guess it's just not that
elegant is the way I would describe it
it does work but it's not particularly
elegant now the backside of the case
that's less of an issue this is more of
a typical case fit that you'd be used to
on a standard slab style smartphone it
doesn't really interact with the phone
in the way that the front portion of the
case does now when it's in the flipped
open mode you also get this weird thing
where part of your hand is grasping a
nice case texture and the other hand is
touching this glass so that's a bit odd
as well I'm sure you'll get used to it
but here's the thing should this phone
have a case on it I mean that's the real
discussion that's what many of you guys
are hitting me up about am I personally
worried about the durability of it of
course it's not IP rated I don't think
it's a particularly durable phone when
compared to some other stuff that's on
the market I do believe in the hinge
mechanically but as far as like dropping
it as far as beating it up or not
treating it nicely I don't think I'd
recommend based on my experience with it
to this point it has moving parts most
of these smart phones whatever we happen
to be looking at their slabs like I mean
they're just solid slabs solid state
nothing moves in there this is a
gigantic moving component in the form of
this hinge and so I understand the
apprehension regarding durability and
the need for a case but I do think it's
nice to have the option for a case but
as far as protecting it from a drop
OtterBox style I just don't see how that
could possibly work
and still interact with the hinge
putting this case onto the device
exposes just how hard it would be to
manufacture a case for something like
this and what
ever kind of case you have it has to
meet up here it can't extend beyond this
point is there's a glue material on it
right there this strip on there you have
to take off a plastic piece in order to
apply this and it sticks on there like a
glue now I've taken it on and off a
couple times and it still remains
somewhat sticky so I suppose it's
intended for a multiple installation if
necessary but it does also showcase that
unlike a regular case for a phone that
can grip around all sides this flat edge
presents its own issues that requires an
adhesive so I don't know how long this
thing is going to remain on the device
before it starts to shimmy off a little
bit my feeling is that this is a case
less foam even though they've gone ahead
and included one and I'm happy about
that and I'm happy to have the option
it's such a feat of Engineering you kind
of want to enjoy the full potential of
it and when you're holding it like this
you want to feel glass across the entire
back when you get to this Ridge with
this thing here it just feels awkward
you're reminded this is another display
there you're reminded of this bizarre
implementation it's just not the most
confidence-inspiring feeling to have on
your really expensive device and this
could be part of a bigger conversation
in general about cases on smartphones
but I feel like at least if you can put
a case on something like this this is
the s10 or an iPhone or something that
you could get one that could protect it
depending on what kind of work you do I
just don't see how an option like that
could be implemented for the fold I
think all cases beyond the one that's in
the box are gonna be something like this
one in order to protect the way you
interact with the device and just the
way that it functions and because of
that I think this is gonna be a caseless
situation for me I'm just gonna have to
live by the sword die by the sword on
this one and this is part of the reason
why if you need this next smartphone
purchase to be rock-solid it's probably
not a good idea to buy a 1.0 device in
general when you're talking about a year
two years or however long it is the
chooks you expect to be using something
like this then those durability
questions do come into play if you're
hoping that some super rugged case is
gonna come out for this I don't see it
happening and if it does happen
I have to believe it's gonna the
experience with the device is gonna
suffer because of it so I'm not gonna
put the official Samsung case on I'm
gonna leave a case list and I think most
people who buy this thing are probably
going to do the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
