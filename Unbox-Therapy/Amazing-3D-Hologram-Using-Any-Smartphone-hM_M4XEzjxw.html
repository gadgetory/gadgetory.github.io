another video and today I hope to blow
your mind and my own while I'm at it
it's called smart hologram it's a
hologram for your smartphone or it's a
lens that allows you to display
Holograms on your smartphone doesn't
matter if you've got an iPhone an
Android phone if you can launch YouTube
videos on your phone like this one that
you're watching then you can supposedly
with a device like this display
Holograms as you can see there's some
basic instructions here on how it all
clips together and then you can simply
search 3d hologram videos on YouTube to
watch this thing come to life so that's
what we're gonna do together let's find
out if it works and if so potentially
blow some minds you know last night I
was watching the original Star Wars and
they had the message from Princess Leia
go get obi-wan and it was a hologram
okay so that's it that's what you get
does it look fancy not so much okay
that's simple enough interlock the tabs
to secure this shape okay that's it look
at me look at that looks like super
simple right launch YouTube 3d hologram
so what happens is if you've glanced
into it from the side you get this
really interesting holographic
perspective now the video is key because
it essentially has the image you're
looking at four times and then it comes
through each of these and reflects you
end up with this kind of floating
version of it you can look at fireworks
in hologram you could look at skulls as
you're seeing right here fish octopus
jellyfish just like so much stuff that's
been converted to hologram form you can
actually make one of these on your own
if you have like an old CD case or
something like that but this is crazy
you can get a legit three-dimensional
floating image plastic foldable origami
type thing in your smartphone and you
can actually see what these look like in
real life
so there you have it $10 gets you this
ready-made little pyramid which is going
to enable the smartphone you already
have to become a holographic viewer and
most people are going to believe you
you're going to show them that and say
yeah I can look at Holograms with this
mega bit I don't I don't think that's
drop it on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
