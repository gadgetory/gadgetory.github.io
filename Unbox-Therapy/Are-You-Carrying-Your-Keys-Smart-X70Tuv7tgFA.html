they're an important part of civilized
life if you want to protect things you
have you got to lock up your doors
here's the problem though they're like
this this is a keychain this is
technology that's been the same for I
don't know at least as long as I've been
alive what happens when this goes in
your pocket
it's stabbing you in the leg these
things they go all over the place and
then when you need one
what are you doing you're going through
here who knows you're getting chased by
the predator over here and you're out
you've seen it in the movies and you're
dead
I think I may have the solution to my
own problems and all of yours as well
this guy right here is called the key
smart hand made in the USA that thing
there becomes your keychain and your
keys kind of flip out you have like a
Swiss Army knife of keys they're all
flat they stay smooth and the cool thing
is this is the expansion pack which
comes with a USB key as well so now your
data can also live on top of here safe
and sound
this is an expansion pack so that you
can hold more keys so it's going to get
fatter if you want it to I think you
take a coin spin that off of there same
thing down here perfect these two little
posts but that's what the expansion is
for if you want to take it up a notch
now I don't know based on the number of
keys I have I'm probably gonna have at
least one maybe we'll find out okay well
why not
let's take a key here
okay so I watched the video just to
figure it out
seems simple but there's some technique
involved first of all if you're gonna do
the USB Drive you want to get started
with that you want to get that in there
and spaced out first now the adapter
that's included looks like the other
ones but it's a little bit fatter so you
want to stick that in the center here
put that on first see nice movement
there the next thing you want to do is
spaced out each individual key so let's
say I go with this one space that out
and then maybe I can go one more on this
side let's just find out okay cool well
go ahead and get the first one screwed
in just to make sure that we've got the
right fit at least on this side okay
cool so you got half done now you want
to achieve the same thing on the other
side so go ahead and grab some keys here
now there's also an adapter included
this thing here and this is if you want
to hook your key fob to this so like
your car key fob or something like that
so you can put this on the post here and
then connect that to a traditional
keyring
sure slide this back over tighten it
down now I don't know about you that's
pretty portable compared to what I had
there's some nuance to it like you gotta
set it up the way you like but when it
comes to actually using a key you just
pull it out like this and look at that
you need your other key flip that out
bingo is it revolutionary I don't know I
think it's I gotta be it's gonna depend
on how many keys you hope to Karia I've
seen some pretty intense few chains out
there like a hundred keys on them this
isn't gonna be a substitute for that but
if you carry a few you end up with a
pretty cool package key smart is it
smarter I think a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
