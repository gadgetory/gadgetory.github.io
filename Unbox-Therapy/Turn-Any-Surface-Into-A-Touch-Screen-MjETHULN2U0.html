it I think floating around Amazon it's
called the touch jet pond it is a touch
projector try to formulate what you
think that means essentially the
projected screen is touchable with this
pen right here so as you might expect
you're playing fruit ninja with a pen on
a giant it's it's bizarre it's cool
though it's got bluetooth Wi-Fi USB and
HDMI so there's a number of different
ways to interface with it they're using
it to uh well I guess spice up their
dad's look there as you could tell
that's the same guy I think they used
the same guy with his family as they did
with the annual report she's crossing
out the results though I don't know if
that's good for him maybe he's not gonna
get that Christmas bonus okay let's open
it up and see how this thing works I'm
excited to touch a projection screen oh
it all fits into this carrying case here
whoa that is smaller than I expected it
to be look at that so you've got some
controls on the side here a tripod mount
on the bottom it also looks like a
little camera there maybe that's how it
maps your input with the pen a USB input
HDMI audio out and DC in there is a
that's mini HDMI I think - full size
HDMI adapter if I wanted to put a full
size HDMI source in there like a laptop
or a game console something like that I
could do so here's some batteries right
here ah for the Pens whew those are
substantial that's a hefty pen right
there kind of like a cigar over there
this part screws out and batteries go in
there as well and it looks like there's
one more cable here micro USB 2 female
USB like a USB thumb drive maybe that
has files on it video files something
that you want to access over that port
I'm gonna do I'm gonna get this baby
rigged up now dim a few lights and see
what we're working with so got it rigged
up there I'm sort of shooting it down
onto the table here now I do have a
piece of bristol board here as well just
to cut down on the glare a little bit
the crazy part is this pen becomes your
input it's really like having a giant
Android tablet or phone you see like I
can scroll through like that back out of
here I've got you know complete
interface this isn't as big as it could
possibly get either right what happens
for keying something in it's a giant
touchscreen essentially so I could be
like unbox therapy here's a recent video
and exactly like using the app on your
phone you can get rid of it like that
now the nub it clicks down like this and
the click actually acts as the tab it's
going to try to sense the location of it
map it using the camera on the device to
register that click the other thing is
it has a built in battery so if we
wanted to do like a movie night take it
into the backyard broadcast on the back
of your house see this is actually how
you calibrate the pen in there tap down
hold tap down hold because this is the
true test right now oh boy
boom whoa no oh that's cool right wow
that is such a strange sensation it's
it's really like drawing right on your
table but digitally Oh Oh Jack's got a
tail ha
there you go become an artist</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
