least it looks like a Ferrari booth when
you first roll up is actually a Ferrari
599 in the middle pretty nice looking
vehicle over there play the reason that
there at CES is not because of the
vehicle not because of the car it's
because they got a new set of headphones
or a number of different headphones
inspired by Ferrari design here you can
get a look at some these are the on the
ear style but they've also got over the
ear and they've they've even got a more
luxury styled headphone over on the
other side of the booth maybe I'll take
you over there in a quick second they've
also got some speaker docks that there
is actually an iPad speaker dock but
there is one that also supports airplay
if you're more into Wireless play of
your music I'll take you guys inside for
a quick second get a better look at that
nice piece of machinery in the center
there we've also got some of the
higher-end models of headphone over
around here I'm gonna take you for a
quick trip this is what it's like trying
to get around CES real difficult lots of
people everywhere but anyways right over
here yes this is their top of the range
model you get a better look you got it
in black and then on the other side you
got it in a tan kind of leather believe
the model here is called the T 350 and
this is inspired by the interior of
Ferrari cars of course you got the same
kind of finishes the same kind of
appearance really a luxury look and feel
I believe the MSRP on this particular
model is gonna be around 349 at least
that's what I've been told they've also
got some ear buds available once again
high-end year buds I've been told
they've got real leather as well as
titanium enclosures so real nice stuff
all around some even bigger speaker
ducts here once again supporting air
play I've been told that there's
currently no more powerful speaker duck
in terms of wattage than this one right
in front of me right here so anyway guys
lots of cool product over here wasn't
expecting to see it Donen I don't really
understand you know
who manufactures number what's involved
it's obviously got Ferrari affiliation
as you can see here oh there you go
crafted by logic three so that's the
company that's handling the
manufacturing obviously a Ferrari
license project and has some Ferrari
inspired design cues here's one more
pair to take a look at these ones are
obviously race probably f1 inspired the
P 200 give you guys a closer look there
I don't know if you can see that carbon
fiber finish on the side and then
there's a model with some red accents as
well detachable cables they look
high-end all around hopefully they're
gonna send us out a pair for a proper
unboxing and I'll get you guys a closer
look at the fit and finish of those
headphones alright later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
