time sometimes I forget and I'm sure you
do too
it's been many years many products over
a thousand in fact I have never looked
at a product like this before that's the
truth Jack can attest to it this my
friends is some tech where you least
expect it that's like a flashy it's like
a tag tech where you least expect it
there's a lot of products in our life
too haven't been tacked up yet here's
the thing you guys know I wear a hoodie
all right I got a hoodie in almost every
video did I think that would come a day
where I'd be looking at a hoodie that
did so much more it wasn't on the
horizon as far as I was concerned then
these guys GTECH reached out to me they
said we got this new product we want you
to be the one to show it to the world
and help us launch it on Kickstarter cuz
that's how fresh it is that's how new it
is it's like a hot it's like a fresh
pizza right now out of the oven first I
got to give you a little bit of a
background origin story the reason why
there's two boxes so look at this okay
this is the company's background it's a
hand warmer you stick your hands inside
it's got this thing in the center
patent-pending Therma grip you're a
golfer you play football you're a hunter
you're outside working on a regular
basis
that's the entender construction medical
fishing photographers these puppies you
need to use them you need the dexterity
you get it steamed up you get back to
work that's the origin story behind this
product
your boy Cam Newton yes world famous
quarterback actually was using this in
his last game you can look it up
yourself keep in these paws heat it up
for that precision a lot of people can
benefit from this here's what it looks
like so the hands go in like this
there's a little strap on the inside
that you put them on top of you've got a
little bit of storage in there as well
maybe you like to go watch football
games hockey games all right you just
keep the hands in there you're all set
you got a little LED on there to let you
know if you're powered up and then this
thing starts to steam so this little guy
here this is your battery boom charge it
up you're ready to go you're ready to
get out and about out in the wilderness
you plug that in as a little pocket for
it that is what's gonna supply all of
your juice check pick up the red LED now
you're heating up it's already getting
one no word of a lot this thing is
already
there now this not gonna be for everyone
right what the world really needs is
some tech right in the hoodie I'm like
the hoodie master I'm like Yoda of the
hoodie game oh my goodness it's an all
box therapy version I did not even know
that this one also has what looks like
car charger here is what the hoodie
looks like and here is the heated
portion you can see the same G logo here
that's gonna act as your power button
this is almost like a coat replacement
on its own now I got a lot of friends
you know buddies that work outdoors I
could see them getting very motivated by
some like this seriously oh it's got
like a certain type of velcro there it's
a very subtle velcro it's not as intense
as some of the other stuff on the inside
here once again I'm just gonna show Jack
this rail that you grip onto
so water-resistant looking stuff so if
you get a little bit of rain on you or
something like that you should be well
protected
once again when it comes to the battery
there's a little pocket for it let's go
ahead let's try this baby on Jack you're
always cold you would love one of the
day you're always freezing so look at
that look at that baby right there
one of 1000 unbox therapy limited
edition of a prototype oh it's not even
out yet look at that light goes red Jack
picked that out for them it looks like a
normal hoodie nobody needs to know
what's going on you just sneak in there
and your hands are getting warm well I
like about this it starts heating right
away now let's see I switch it off press
and hold and I'm back and nobody even
knows what's going on I just look like a
dude in a hoodie I know beady eyes what
are you talking about look at my lady
maybe you got a walk to school maybe you
got to be outdoors for work maybe you
like to be outdoors maybe you like to
have binoculars and look at birds or or
play a sport that's outdoors survival
people maybe you like to go to outdoor
music festivals gets a little bit chilly
I got to be honest with you guys I got a
problem with jackets I can never get
into jacket weather and this is from a
guy who lives in Canada all right I live
in Toronto and I can't get used to
pulling the jacket out of the closet you
think you got it all together well you
don't because this temperatures dipping
and you're unprepared this is the best
of both worlds it doesn't feel like a
coat but when you add in that eating
potential down there you're gonna make a
lot of dudes jealous with the beer in
one hand
warming up the other and then you do the
switcheroo to link down in the
description I'm helping these guys
launched on Kickstarter Tom come here
for a sec Tom I want you to put your
hand inside my hoodie say okay please
put your hand inside my money
easy go
grab it grab that grab it what do you
got
pretty calm what top did you feel it
yeah
it's been said many times many ways
merry christma
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
