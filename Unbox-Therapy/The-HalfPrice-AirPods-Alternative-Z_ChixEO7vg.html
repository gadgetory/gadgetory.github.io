pods have kind of become a meme they're
out there they're in the wild but there
are alternatives out there now I've
tried a few I've tried wireless earbuds
all the way down to 18 bucks those ones
have a wire between the two-year buds
themselves so what about an alternative
that's sort of more like air pods
without the air pods price tag that's
what I'm looking at today these ones are
almost half the price or actually
exactly half the price 79 bucks
anchor sound core Liberty air kind of
reminiscent of air pods maybe they sound
good
maybe they don't you can answer phone
calls you can talk into these things the
earbuds themselves have five hours of
play time combined with the case 20
hours now if you're familiar with the
company anchor if there's somebody to
trust in the battery department it's
probably these guys nonetheless
could it be the air pods killer let's go
ahead and find out look at this guy he's
happy it's a business trip he's a
traveling man it kind of looks like Jack
actually is that you put the leather bag
the coats but the jeans because you're
still you're still a cowboy at heart
Brokeback Mountain whoo okay not much
bigger than an air pods container small
medium and large ear tips these are the
ear buds now I see it says touch right
there so are they also touch sensitive
really do is nodding his head right now
left right you pop them out I'm gonna go
ahead and just put this in how much I'm
just gonna get oh okay
pretty comfy to be honest not gonna fall
out of my head so when you buy them they
go straight into pairing mode pair it up
okay hang on let me just have a listen
real quick please allow me
I got no play posture well hold on a
second it's a hold
okay Will's got a little update for us
on the interface you tap it twice for
play pause what else you got twice to
answer and end phone calls of course if
a phone call was coming in so it's a
it's a longer to tap to switch tracks
well what does this one do Wow okay so
each touch pad is doing different things
the left one is the previous track if
you want to go back a song the right one
is to go forward a song the right one is
play pause answer phone calls the left
one can launch Google assistant Wow as
you can see here I'll double tap and the
saw will begin playing
okay that's a little pink floyd-- I'm
gonna reserve my feedback here I'm gonna
pick something from a different genre
right quick if you don't mind give me a
minute here
beast mode hip hop there you go
I want to test the range I'm gonna walk
away from the phone range is pretty good
big difference between different genres
and music
I went from Pink Floyd to future
nonetheless they both sound good way
more bass on a hip hop side as as
expected air pots don't actually really
cut you off from the world
these ones are much deeper so you're a
bit more isolated and a bit more in the
music I wish there was a bit more volume
here I thought these could maybe deliver
a little bit more let me just try one
more track here Ruff Ryders anthem there
you go hmm they do something that air
pods do not do I think they sound better
than air pods you're getting punched
harder with these then with the air pods
in my opinion how was the sound bleed
zero you're hearing nothing which is
good alright last thing I wanna do I
should make a phone call real quick you
call me and I'll try to answer it right
on it right on the headset hello
will he do yeah you sound good man do I
so I say a sentence like this and then
there's leftover garbage at the end yeah
I mean it's usable you've heard better
Bluetooth headsets on this on this show
right here he has okay very well thank
you very much for the phone call well
you've been a tremendous help as usual
this is the liberty air it's available
in black and white right out the gate
which I think a lot of people are gonna
like as well it's a nice little kit it's
a nice little package these are half the
price of Apple's product I think anchor
has another hit potentially another hit
on their hands I think it's a decent
alternative to Apple's product that said
keep in mind Apple's putting out the air
pods to the rumor is relatively soon
those are probably going to improve on
the previous version but don't expect
them to be affordable by any means if
anything they're probably gonna cost
more probably be like $200 so if you're
trying to stay away from that price
point this is a good place to look this
is a good place to look can you end it
there I don't know somewhere else before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
