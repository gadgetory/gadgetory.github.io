happens ex trainers bone conduction
sunglasses off to shocks what is this
this is ultimate warrior right
ultimate warrior intro came out coked up
coke to the gills everyone is telling me
this is the future of sound this is how
people should be listening to music
through bone conduction so they can
still use their ears and then why not
slam them into some sunglasses while
you're at it and so I was like let's
check it out let's see if it's any good
for the gamers right Willy do dave 2d
that's their type of lens right there
maybe even Kirk for that matter
overwatch overwatch head out to the golf
course then you go to the nightclub
Miami Vice you see what I see what I did
that I've had a varying degree of
success in the past with bone conduction
audio and I was kind of surprised
actually at the performance it's like
the sound is it's already there it's in
my brain ooh that's a nice case the
actual bone conduction unit sits behind
your ear in this section right here and
creates some sort of vibration and the
tech of your skull skull tech is
actually responsible for delivering that
sound through your bone how much she's
cost well hundred bucks on IndieGoGo
right now okay old-school vibes you fold
it out for the actual bone conduction
piece this will sit behind your ear and
deliver all the sound you have a robust
nose piece in case there's an impromptu
volleyball match on the beach ha
his own the guy who spikes the ball
that's he's wearing those no shirt
tanned up just what Jack is looking for
there are buttons on it as there should
be as well as what looks like a
microphone and that is a microUSB port
to charge it up okay cool
an extra nose piece a carrying case
slash cloth otherwise these things
operate like bluetooth headphones Oh see
how that works jack it hides kind of
behind the ear a little bit there you're
just this guy
when you put something like this on
you're not the same person anymore what
if I came to work and this is just
terrible though I don't say anything
okay connected I don't you know it's uh
I mean it's there it's like as if music
was on in the background - the tickle
like you're getting tickled that might
be your thing if you're got like well
earlier you was fiddling so he probably
wouldn't mind being tickled as well it
hasn't exactly come a long way it's cool
technology in the sense that like I
don't feel cut off from the world at all
but I do hear audio playing but the
sound is not in my opinion a substitute
for headphones like it's not immersive
not a lot of bass it's mostly mid-range
and high stuff that comes through it's
useful like if you were biking jogging
but the volume is not that high either
that's the other thing
I don't know you know what I think it's
kind of useful I don't know I mean you
gotta have a whole thing going on to
just be out in public and this is you
when the shades come off the music comes
off as well so I mean you got to be in
environments where the shades just stay
on I mean really Fitness is is kind of
the only way that I see these things
taking off because that's kind of a
personal thing you don't want to be
talking anyone else see the thing is
this comes with the shades and the
shades already send a message that like
you're not like don't talk to me I'm in
my shades now you're even more in your
own universe you're listening and you're
in your shades it's a whole thing
maybe going those long bike rides you
know those guys you can't you probably
want to have headphones in car coming
transport truck I personally like this
thing if you're doing some sort of
physical activity and you want to have
some sound coming through without
cutting you off from the universe that's
what this thing is about so keep that in
mind don't have your expectations set
too high as far as a replacement for
headphones to get lost in to music this
is more kind of ambience you can hear
your stuff but you're still in the world
up to shocks X trainers you know I see
they said trainers I think that's
exactly what they're going after jack
guys like me you know
