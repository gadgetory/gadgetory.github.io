therapy and today we're taking a look at
a product from henge docks now they're
known for making docking stations for
Apple computers this product is a little
different it's called the clique and
what it does is takes your regular
Wireless Apple keyboard along with a
wireless Magic Trackpad and puts them
into one continuous unit so that you can
use it from the couch or just a way of
keeping it tidy on your desk
it also remaps the power buttons as I
just showed you there in that picture
meaning you don't have to remove each
independent device in order to turn them
on and off here you can see you've got
the instructions again on the inside of
the box other than that you've really
only got the unit itself there aren't
any accessories or anything like that
included just one piece of molded
plastic ready to receive your wireless
keyboard as well as your wireless Magic
Trackpad
now on the bottom of the device you've
got the branding from henge docks and
here's a better look at that power
switch this switch here is responsible
for the power on the keyboard and then
there's another switch on the end of the
unit responsible for the power of the
Magic Trackpad I'll show you that in a
quick second the thing has solid
rubberized feet on there so that it's
not going to slip around your desk and
when you've got the whole package put
together it actually feels quite sturdy
even sturdier than each independent
device on its own so I'll go ahead and
show you guys how to install the
wireless keyboard as well as the Magic
Trackpad it takes a little bit of
getting used to you've got to kind of
click it in and wait to see if you know
if you get that satisfying click you
make sure as well that the front corners
are set in properly same thing goes on
this side you're actually going to want
to install the bottom portion before the
top portion as I learned really quickly
here and then set the back part down and
there you go you have one solid
continuous unit capable of inputting you
know either multi-touch gestures or
regular Mouse input as well as text this
could be very useful from the couch you
know for a media center Mac Mini or
something along those line
removing each independent device is a
little bit tricky at first you got to
kind of know where to apply pressure but
eventually you'll get the hang of it
once again you're not really gonna have
to remove these that often it's only
going to be when you want to replace
batteries otherwise you know you can
control the power etc as I mentioned
earlier and here is that far power
button which is responsible for pressing
down on the power button right within
the Magic Trackpad the regular power
button so it just sort of it's kind of a
dumb button in the sense that it just
presses down on it and that middle
button is more like a switch but it does
work fine I did test it so anyway guys
this has been a quick look at the click
from henge Doc's if you enjoyed this
video hopefully you can like and
favorite it as it does help me out a
bunch and if you haven't subscribed yet
why not go ahead and do that too I got a
lot more content planned new products
coming up all the time on the channel
anyway guys until the next video I will
see you around ok later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
