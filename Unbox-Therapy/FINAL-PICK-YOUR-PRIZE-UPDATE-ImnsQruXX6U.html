here and it looks like the drama
continues I just got my appeal notice
back from YouTube and it says that
they're going to uphold their original
decision to remove the video due to not
following community guidelines now let's
not give me the details because like I
reviewed the community guidelines and I
can't see anything remotely close to
contest rules or anything like that so
you know I don't think we can really
analyze it at this point I really
understand where they're coming from I
don't really know how they analyze
contest or which ones are acceptable in
which ones aren't but I made the
decision based on what happened to go
back through my catalog and remove all
the contest videos because I've got a
strike against my account now and you
know you can't get too many of those
before you've got serious problems now
as you guys know I put a lot of time and
effort into my content it's really of
what I live and breathe you know and the
last thing I need is to have the whole
thing smashed to pieces because of some
haters and because of some strange
interpretation of policy so from now on
what I'm going to do is move my contest
videos over to Twitter not because I
want to but because I have to because
it's really the only place i know of
that publicly embraces the contest
platform they've even got a section on
their site about how to properly do
contests and what guidelines to follow
and you know the other part of it too is
that a bunch of you guys are already
over there not all of you I mean there's
only about 1,500 people following me
right now but it's super easy to do so
if you don't know my username it's at
unboxtherapy or twitter.com / unbox
therapy you know if you don't have an
account yet on twitter it takes like two
seconds to set one up even if you set it
up just for the purpose of this giveaway
and I shut it down after you know that's
completely cool you know you don't have
to become some kind of
did twitter user doesn't have to be a
part of your life but I just want to
make good on this contest you know what
I'm saying I mean I advertise this damn
thing for I don't know a few days now a
number of different videos the whole
thing got way more complicated than it
had to be and listen I'm sorry for
dragging you guys along you know that's
not the way I wanted to go and it's not
the way I wanted to play it and I
totally understand if you want to bail
on the whole thing right now you want to
bail the hell out and say forget this
guy in his shady ass let me
tell you something I ain't shady at all
if I say I'm gonna do something I'm
gonna do it that's the truth and and and
that remains true for this giveaway I
said I'm going to give away a
five-hundred-dollar pick your prize
anything from the channel or similar and
I'm gonna follow through so if you come
over there with me if you come over to
Twitter you're going to reap the
benefits and you can be part of the pick
your prize franchise from this from this
day forward because that's really our
only place that we can do it reliably
and not risk what we got going on over
here on YouTube and what we got going on
over here is beautiful let me tell you
it's a community and that's what I'm
trying to protect here I'm trying to
protect what we've built you know and
and you know and you guys and how much
you enjoy what I do and how much I enjoy
doing what I'm doing so I'm getting a
little nuts here but anyways I mean I
don't really have too much else to say
as far as once we get over the Twitter
how we're going to run the contest I've
been doing a little bit of research and
basically what you do is you just send
out a tweet and you ask people to
retweet it and then like which is like
one click from you guys and then boom
you just randomize that baby you know
you pick out of the people who retweeted
it which is apparently easy to track and
randomized and then I come right at you
and i'll send you a direct message which
will say you want to pick your prize
tell me what you want I'll even give you
a little bit of time to think about it
you know i'll say hey you know you want
to take a day go through the videos or
research how you want to fulfill this
contest I'm cool with that I'll give you
leeway on that and like I said the main
reason for this is I just want to make
it right I don't feel it's right right
I don't feel it's cool to advertise
something that you say you're going to
do and then not do it so like I said if
you guys can help me out and come be a
part of it over there I'll be indebted
to you forever which i already am
because you guys make this stuff
possible so anyway guys without further
ado I'm gonna let you get on with your
day and stay tuned to that twitter feed
because that's where it's going to go
down at unbox therapy and as always if
you guys like my content or if you like
this video then you know what to do
anyways until next time and as always
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
