large piece of technology to share with
you today this is a 60-inch flat panel
from Sharp the model is the LC - 60 le 8
v 7u that is a lot of letters and
numbers to remember but don't worry you
won't have to because I have linked this
product down in the description and the
link down there will actually take you
to Amazon where it's being heavily
discounted right now definitely go ahead
and check out the link if you are
interested in more information technical
specifications or if you want to buy it
so anyways one of the reasons I'm
interested in this model is because of
its video gaming capabilities I will
speak more about that as the video moves
forward but first some of the basic TV
functionality it is a 240 Hertz display
it has Wi-Fi built-in DivX bluetooth a
bunch of HDMI so you have all of your
standard analog inputs to go with it if
you're rocking some old-school equipment
there's also a PC input a couple of USB
s so if you have multimedia files on a
USB Drive you can use the Smart TV
functionality to play back some of those
files you have a bunch of HDMI inputs
four of them over here as well as
another USB port so two USB ports in
total the display also features active
3d if you're into that and it has the
quatrain color technology that sharp is
famous for so all that stuff is cool but
for me one of the main functions of my
TV in my family room is to play video
games and the problem with flat panels
in the past is that they do an enormous
amount of processing to your image which
results in horrendous input lag now if
you're unfamiliar with input lag it is
not the same thing as like a refresh
rate or you know motion technology which
is going to cut down on motion blur this
is literally the ability to get
immediate response time from when you
hit a button on your controller when you
see that happen on the display so if
there's a ton of post-processing going
on to the image then when you hit that
button it doesn't happen right away
there could be a couple hundred
milliseconds in between that process and
that might not seem like a lot but if
you
or into like heavy-duty multiplayer
gaming it can be significant it can be
the difference between living and dying
now this display has some of the best
game modes available in the business
including like high motion mode so
there's a couple of different options
you can you know zero in on whichever
one works best for you but as mentioned
it is a fully functioning smart TV as
well you've got YouTube built in netflix
built-in Vudu movies got some music
services some really basic minigames
you've got Facebook Skype Twitter built
in and then some web search
functionality with a web browser so
pretty standard fare for you know Smart
TV type offerings you can customize the
interface a little bit if you want to
change the appearance of it as well so a
very thin 60-inch flat panel it's a
1080p display but as I said before for
me the really killer functionality is
its ability to play video games if you
want a large flat panel to play video
games on definitely take a look at sharp
they've got some of the best game modes
in the business with pretty much no lag
when compared to their heavy duty
post-processing competitors in the game
mode space so before we close out
today's video I want to give another big
shout out to Squarespace for helping
make this content possible what you're
looking at right now is the official
unbox therapy dot-com website which is
built using Squarespace that's right I'm
not talking about a service that I don't
personally use I put together a website
I'm really happy with using the tools
over on squarespace.com and you can do
it too it's probably the easiest way
online to get a website up and running
incredibly fast you can do all kinds of
stuff like put a photo gallery you can
put a store in there if you want to sell
merchandise like we do we have a couple
of t-shirts up on there and there are
plenty of different templates to choose
from so no matter what look you're going
for in one night you can pretty much set
something up maybe even faster than a
night I mean it took me a night or two
but if you're really quick with this
kind of stuff you could probably do it
even faster and I've got even better
news for you if you want to try out the
service it's completely free no
obligation head over to squarespace.com
