therapy and today we're taking a look at
resistance 3 this is the doomsday
Edition and what that means is you're
going to get the ps3 sharpshooter as
well as the entire PlayStation Move
system and the game resistance 3 you can
get into the action like that dude on
the side of the box but if you've been
avoiding the Move system this is the
right time to jump in with an MSRP of 1
$49.99 for this entire package it
represents a fantastic value as far as
I'm concerned this is the time to bite
if you know what I mean as far as the
unboxing is concerned the first thing we
see when we open it is resistance 3 -
game disc as well as a little bit more
paperwork here some documentation on a
PlayStation Move system and how to set
it up I'll give you a better look at
those in the end portion of the video as
well as some stickers to customize your
gun customize your sharpshooter make it
look the way you want now the next thing
we've got as far as the hardware is
concerned is a the actual move system
this portion is going to slide into the
bottom of the Sharpshooter that's how
you're going to move around within the
game you got your d-pad on there as well
as a couple of other PlayStation buttons
a little trigger there too now most of
these are going to be mapped out to
handle specific functions within the
game and everything is sort of where
you'd expect it to be so that you're not
gonna have to be searching around you
can pick this up and sort of figure
everything out real quick the next
portion is the actual motion tracking
portion the little orb on the end here
sticks out the end of the gun making you
look like a strange-looking commando but
that's what's gonna allow for your
targeting your aiming and whatnot to be
tracked by this piece this is obviously
the PlayStation Move camera and this is
what makes this whole system possible
it's optical tracking which means it's
going to track in you know in a couple
of different ways it's gonna track left
to right but it's also gonna track depth
unlike some other systems that are out
there and you got a real long USB cable
so you can get it a safe distance away
from your ps3 of course so the last
thing we got is the sharp shooter this
is the showstopper
and if you haven't seen one of these
actually unboxed the Sharpshooter on its
own a little while ago I'll put a link
somewhere up here but basically what
happens is most of the controls in game
get remapped to locations that make
sense in this kind of form factor the
optical portion of the move system gets
inserted into the top side there and
your little orb sticks out the end yeah
right here that's what I'm talking about
lastly we've got our documentation we've
got a little bit of paperwork here about
the move system explaining the remap of
all of those buttons that I mentioned
and we've got those stickers that I
mentioned too in case you want to
customize the appearance of your
sharpshooter next we've got the
PlayStation Move Quick Start Guide
this is gonna tell you how to set it up
where to position your camera etc for
you know accurate feedback so everything
works the way it was intended to work
and a lot more paper for some reason so
lastly we've got the game disc and I
mean this is really what it's all
about after all there aren't too many
shooter style games that are you know
gonna work or are compatible with the
move system so it's gonna be interesting
to see how this one works out but I'm
sure resistance 3 is gonna be a kick-ass
game regardless now on the inside we
don't have anything too special we've
got the game disc and we've got a manual
maybe this is special an actual manual
not like a 2-page little pamphlet this
one's legit so before you go to bed you
take it with you and you study up a
little bit on resistance 3 but anyway no
it's nice I'm not making a joke it's
nice to have you know it takes a few
extra bucks to print something like that
so anyway guys I think this is an
awesome value as I said earlier you're
probably gonna want to pick up
resistance 3 anyways why not add the
Sharpshooter and a move system for 149 I
mean you can't go wrong anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this video and if you
did hopefully you can like and favorite
it that helps me out a bunch helps me

giveaways etc and if you haven't visited
