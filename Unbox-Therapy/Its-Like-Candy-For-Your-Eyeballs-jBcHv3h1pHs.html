controller I want to give a shout out to
oculus for sending this out and
sponsoring this video I'm pumped up to
check this thing out finally there's a
controller if you can interact with your
device I tried the previous version of
this but I think this one's gonna be
better now this one here it'll work with
Galaxy sa sa + s7 s7 edge note 5 s6
edge+ s6 and s6 edge cinematic wide view
360-degree experience when you dock your
phone into this headset it will actually
download the oculus app with the various
experiences in it so you're you're off
to the races straight away I'll tell you
what
ok there it is the headset itself oh
it's a very soft memory foam ish
material you can see the lenses on the
inside some buttons here and a touch pad
the home button and a back button that's
a Robocop kind of look right there click
that way
and then that way and look at this
kaboom this is why it can fit so many
different devices check that out it's
spring-loaded if you have this adapter
here as well if you need to go down to
micro USB and that's why it can
accommodate so many different phones in
one headset of course the head strap
controller right here couple of
batteries for it I love I love when they
include the batteries shout-out to them
for that a little bit of a wand type of
feel to it it's actually quite
comfortable it has a trigger on it a
touchpad on the top back and home boot
it up like that
that's pretty foolproof there oh hello
there we're gonna have to put an app in
first there it is look at that so
shortly after installing the device into
the headset it prompts you to get the
specific app gear vr powered by oculus
oh wow look at this the screen
resolution must be wqhd to use the gear
vr now this is this is really
interesting you guys remember when I did
my original video on the galaxy s 8 and
I was talking about how out of the box
the device
doesn't come in the full resolution
here's an application we're having those
extra pixels make sense so we toggle it
up let's go 20 960 by 1440 I'm excited
so now we're gonna pair up the
controller press and hold the home
button calibrate the controller okay
draw a series of figure eights whoo-hoo
okay
please control face down on a flat
surface for a few seconds all right very
nice
yeah right-handed for sure so looks like
we're ready to go here I think it's time
to put the phone back into the headset
let's try this out ooh there we go this
is my controller down here represented
by the exact same object that I'm
holding and I can see this and then it
sends out this laser pointer looking
thing so I can select what I want
without having to reach up and touch the
headset itself so it's a it's a lot more
natural oh wow look at this I'm rotating
this around with the touchpad on the
controller and I'm gonna go and select
one of these here and plate it whoo oh
my goodness
Oh Oh No this is a bigger drop now oh
okay
that's good we're good on the roller
coasters now keep in mind I can go to
the Internet here and do the usual
things I like to do as well I mean
here's u-tube over here you got your
social media I could go on Instagram in
VR and what I like here this is just a
laid-back kind of experience I can use
the touchpad to just scroll through the
videos and they've they're huge
within the headset you just scroll
through some popular videos here there
we go there's the complete Floyd
Mayweather Conor McGregor press
conference Los Angeles I have to say I
was at the Toronto press conference a
little bit better than this one all
right the old saloon here we go dead and
buried let's check it out
boom boom I think I have like Lemmy data
maybe I should have done the tutorial
whoa okay yes sir
Wow hey there brother why can't I am I
out do I have to reload how do I reload
that's how you reload don't flick of the
wrist baby I don't know maybe it's just
a time thing come on they go Manny dudes
are getting close to me I'm dying I'm
dying I'm dying oh I'm still alive I'm
still alive being boy I got a
sharpshooter over it
I died okay cool I'm happy with that I
think I feel like I killed a bunch of
guys you know no tutorial skip the
tutorial that now that was that one
there that was cool
see that's the kind of thing that
becomes available to you when you have
the separate controller rather than just
being stuck controlling from the headset
a gear VR powered by oculus with a new
controller I mean this has got to be the
easiest path into VR you probably
already have the phone you have the
device you just add this you're
untethered you're living it up</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
