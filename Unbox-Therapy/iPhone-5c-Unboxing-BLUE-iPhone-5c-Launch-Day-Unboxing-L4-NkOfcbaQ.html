with more iPhone based coverage this is
the iPhone 5c and as you can see I've
got the blue coloring right here I'm
going to go ahead and unbox this compare
it to the 5s that we just finished
unboxing so let's go ahead and get
straight into it this is packaged a
little bit differently than the 5s as
I'm sure you can tell this is probably
less expensive packaging instead of
having a box you have this almost like
iPod esque
covering as a clear part on top so the
phone is secured to this plastic plate
I'm going to put it to the side just for
a moment in order to look at the other
items in the box
you've got your Apple stickers and stuff
nobody cares about that you've also got
a power brick the new ear pods which
come in their own little carrying case
and then of course a USB cable for
charging and syncing device but of
course what you care about most is the
iPhone the device in this case there's a
protective covering here on the front
and as you can see of a black faceplate
unlike on the 5s goals that we recently
unbox which has in Whiteface place so
there you have it
5c this is my first time actually
handling one this is a fairly slick
plastic not bad and it has a very
similar design of course to the iPhone 5
5 s except for the fact that it's
available in all of these colors
internally it is essentially in iphone 5
with a slightly better battery I believe
as well as more LTE bands so improved
LTE performance alright guys so that
wraps up the elimin airy portion of the
unboxing now we will head over to the
studio set up to give you some more
beautiful visuals of this brand-new
device from
so that wraps up this unboxing and first
look at the iPhone 5c but if you're
interested in learning more about this
device you probably want to stick around
and subscribe if you haven't yet because
we're going to be doing a durability
test we're going to be dropping this and
filming in slow motion on the brand new
iPhone 5s so there's going to be some
carnage yes but in the name of science
because everyone's interested to find
out how durable this new 5c is in the
plastic enclosure before we wrap up this
video I want to give a shout out to
Squarespace who is our sponsor for this
video and all of our iPhone 5s and 5c

square space they will enable you to
build a very beautiful website if you
need one and most people should have a
