product that aims to disrupt a category
that has been the same for a very long
time so the category I'm talking about
here is padlocks that boring little
thing with the combination spin to the
right to the right twice to the left
once all the way around
it's a nightmare Jack you member at our
old place when we were you had to leave
the key but it was in the padlock and
the next people coming along you would
you would be trying to be trying to
explain it it's a nightmare
they're not listening to him well this
product right here aims to change that
on your locker at school you probably
have one of these and yours could be a
lot better it's called the tap lock one
now this started out on IndieGoGo it's a
real product now you can pick this thing
up it's got an app for both Google Play
and the App Store designed in Canada
they're companies companies on Yonge
Street that who would have thought
designed in Canada assembled in China of
course essentially what you're looking
at is a fingerprint activated padlock
that's good looking whoa you're gonna
have the nicest looking lock in your
entire school the entire universe
possibly oh it's still heavy though
there's some charging contact points
here this is the fingerprint scanner in
this location but my understanding is
you don't have to charge it up that
often this is the charge cable the
magnetic cable you just line it up and
boom your charging up if you can
implement the magnet let's do the magnet
it stores up to five hundred
fingerprints shareable wireless access
so you can remotely share access with
unlimited users you see Jack you could
just unlock it remotely or they could
you unlock it more
yeah share and control access remotely
so you can know when it's been opened
and by who that is a smart padlock
rechargeable battery up to one year of
battery life a two hour charge gives you
one year of battery life Morse code
backup access Morse pointed you remember
the heritage minute with the it was it
in it was the boat was coming in only
only Canadians would get this reference
shout out to the heritage minute we all
came up on it
I see the light tap yo Monica we're
filming I'm filming right now you got a
I gotta call you back
oh it's we'll push the power button
twice the LED light will start blinking
blue okay that found it quickly place
your finger on to the locs fingerprint
sensor okay wait for the light to turn
green all right whoa that was easy
oh just unlocked you'll say the name of
the owner here which hand it is and
which finger it is that's intense
oh that's nice that's you now who's
better than you all you gotta do is get
on the other side of the fence and and
you're getting chased and spinning it
around all of a sudden you're inside
wait quick which snap the lock shut
you're safe you live you live because of
this without it you're dead with it you
live it's incredible I can see the
battery life the Bluetooth connection I
can unlock it from the phone let's try
that out
kaboom unlocks so I'm gonna try and add
a second fingerprint now let's see here
oh there we go
okay cool my left thumb okay cool save
use the thumb and boom pinkie finger no
dice middle finger on the other hand
nothing but then I hit it with the index
kaboom
now let's say I want to give Jack access
I'd be crazy to give him access well
let's just say I did I could just go to
this shared access button over here hit
the plus and look I can set up a
one-time access so maybe I don't want
this guy back temporary ten-minute
access or if I really trust Jack which
again I'd be crazy to do I could give
him permanent access forever invite a
user with an email address and a user
name and that could be Jack okay the
last thing to check out is this Morse
code there's two types of Morse code
inputs long and short so I could be like
one two three short one long and one two
three short so three clicks to get it
into Morse code mode one two three and
then of course the code that I pre
program so check this out one two three
one two one two three
boom it's a whole package deal right
here one year of battery life on two
hours of a charge think about the hours
of your life you've lost spinning that
thing around remember you put this
padlock on your gate and you're getting
you got the stalker following you you're
inside you don't eat that you're not
fiddling like in the horror movie all
right don't be a Fiddler's</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
