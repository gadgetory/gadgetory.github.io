therapy and by request I'm sitting here
to do this Holiday Gift Guide video I
asked you guys in a previous video if
you wanted me to do something like this
and you guys went crazy saying yes so
these are going to be my recommendations
for what you should look for this
holiday season at different price points
i've got everything from under 20 to
over 500 - the money ain't a thing
category for those of you with fat
wallets so to speak and the idea here is
to give each one of you some options
depending on which what your price point
is now everything i'm going to mention
here has been featured on the channel at
some point so i will put links to every
product mention down in the description
and i'll try my best as well to put
annotations probably over here or
somewhere on top of the videos so when
i'm talking about a specific item you
can click through it'll open in a new
window
watch that unboxing or review and then
come back and continue the holiday gift
guide so i'm gonna try and make it as
convenient as possible without further
ado let's get right into the guide so
the first category the lowest category
the under $20 gift or something that you
want for yourself i'm gonna feature
jealous skins now if you haven't been a
subscriber for a while you may have
missed this particular video i did a
video on jealous skins for your iPad
your iPhone and also for my Nexus S you
can see here I've got a jealous skin on
my iPad featured here so anyways the the
link to the video is going to be up here
as well as in the description go check
out jealous kins they're a protective
cover for your smart devices or any kind
of electronic device they make tons and
they've also got a number of different
styles so under $20 definitely a unique
gift that is gonna surprise anyone and
you'll be happy with you can also wear
cases over top of them so it's not like
it's the only form of protection you can
put a case over top of this a clear case
for example and still get the artwork
showing through next under $50 we've got
the ps3 dual shock charging station and
this is a very convenient item if you've
got a ps3 or
you're buying for somebody who does have
a ps3 nice price point under 50 bucks
and totally useful as we all know it
sucks to have to have you know USB
cables hanging outside of your console
this thing makes charging real easy
check out the video to learn more and
we've also got headphones that I
recently unboxed and I've been using a
little bit in the past few days and I'm
really impressed with they are the sony
MDR 570 LPS once again the link is
available to you here and they're not a
super expensive headphone obviously
they're in the under 50 category but
they are a travel headphone so even if
you know you or the person you're buying
for has a higher quality bigger set of
phones they're still gonna you know find
some use for these in more sort of
portable environments airplanes whatever
the next category under $75 we've got my
favorite headphones in the world the
ones that I use every day the ones that
I record audio with the ones that I
listen to dubstep with the ones that I
listen to everything with the sony xba-1
droid headphones
once again you're definitely gonna want
to check out this video these things
have incredible based representation big
huge drivers they're big headphones
though so they're more suited to indoor
use but of course no one's gonna stop
you from rocking them on the street
we've also got the Logitech keyboard
case for the iPad 2 I actually really
like this case it's going to give you
the functionality of a case but it's
also going to give you a keyboard
bluetooth based keyboard if you want to
try to be more productive on your iPad
and the last in the under 75 category is
uncharted 3 you guys probably know it's
the Uncharted series has been my
favorite series in video games probably
at least modern video games and
uncharted 3 does not disappoint amazing
story awesome voice acting you know
amazing cutscenes etc if you're into
those style of games and you haven't
checked out uncharted 3 or you want to
ask your parents for a game this year
and you have a ps3 get uncharted 3 so
lastly no not lastly what am I talking
about we got more categories to go or
let's move to the hundred dollar
category we've got the sony ps3 7.1
emulated surround sound headset this
just came out recently it's
wireless it's convenient it's not the
best headset in the world it's not the
worst headset in the world again it's
it's an incredibly easy to setup it's
convenient rechargeable you can't go
wrong with it if you've got you know an
old-school Bluetooth headset or none at
all this is a big improvement
the next item we've got is the WD
livewire if you guys I don't know if you
guys have watched this unboxing it's a
little bit older and you may have
wondered what the hell is that item and
not clicked on it very cool little
device for sending Internet through your
power cables in your house now you're
probably saying wait a minute dude I got
a router I got Wi-Fi why would I want to
do that this thing provides a
significantly more reliable connection
in my experience especially for games
consoles so you can run this baby down
to your game consoles and get a more
reliable connection and then what Wi-Fi
might be giving you and also if it's out
of reach of Wi-Fi for getting like I'm
just just a tiny little signal this
might work better for you so check out
that video and then lastly we've got the
performance mouse MX that's a Logitech
mouse I've been using the Logitech
performance series for a while now from
the MX revolution to this one they are
my favorite mice incredibly ergonomic
programmable Mac PC whatever you want to
do with it awesome Mouse under $200
we've got the Logitech z6 two three
speakers these are the ones as well that
I use everyday lots of power for the
money they could be had for anywhere
between 120 and 150 incredible value at
that price point if you watch my video
you'll see how the subwoofer has tons of
power bangs out some serious bass check
that one out we've also got the Amazon
Kindle Fire of course one of the most
affordable tablets on the market if you
need a tablet and $200 is your price
range it's hard to do better right now
than the Kindle Fire once again check
out that video and lastly for the gamer
anybody who's into the Zelda series and
specific we're talking about the 3ds
Zelda Edition which is still available
in some places as I understand it's not
going to be available forever it is one
of those sort of special combinations
retails for $1.99 as I as I know Game
Stop is having some promos I don't know
if they're still on or not we're if
you're trading your older Nintendo
and then you might get a significant
rebate towards the purchase of that
particular combo so look into that under
$500 we've got my my new camera my
vlogging / casual camera the sony hx5v
if you haven't checked out that video
yet you'll find out that I'm in love
with this camera for a number of reasons
incredible image stabilization whether
it be for stills and especially in video
it also shoots 1080p it's got a
wide-angle lens which which is unusual
for these style of cameras at least this
wide and a number of other features that
are unique in that category so
definitely check out that camera if
you're looking for a camera the
PlayStation 3d display obviously is a
big hit it's not the best display in the
world but it is affordable it integrates
incredibly well with your Playstation or
Xbox it's got that new feature for the
you know the split screen gaming where
you don't see what the other individual
is doing so it's great for versus mode
and the only downside of it as I
mentioned in the in the unboxing was no
remote but I have heard that the latest
PlayStation 3 remote will function with
the television so in that in that sense
yes it sucks you have to pay a little
bit more but the functionality should be
accessible
one more thing we've got is the modern
warfare 3 console pack where you get the
special edition console the game
controllers etc I really like the design
of the modern warfare 3 console even
more so than the Gears of War 3 one
which I've unboxed both it's it's subtle
it's not like it's not overpowering or
overwhelming it's got a nice sort of
increased appearance improved in
appearance I should say from the
standard edition console but that's a
subjective thing that's my opinion the
last category the money ain't a thing
category and this is obviously for those
of you where money anything where you
got the fat wallets etc the first one
I'm gonna say is a MacBook Air you guys
know I use a MacBook Pro for most of my
editing but the MacBook Air for 99% of
the population is more than powerful
enough I mean obviously not for gaming
and you know specific tasks like that
but for most productivity it's
incredibly
asked considering its size and wage that
great battery life I really can't say
enough about about it great screen high
resolution for a 13-inch if you do get
the 13-inch model anyway I'll show you
the unboxings down below in the links of
course the Galaxy Tab 10 one you guys
can see I'm using an iPad 2 right now
but I actually probably use the Galaxy
Tab 10 one more often than the iPad or
at least the same amount this one sort
of gets used by the family more I'd say
but anyways the Galaxy Tab 10 one and
and if you're an Apple fan or an iPad
fan iPad 2 still is great of course fast
does everything you want it to do
etc and then lastly a product the only
product I've mentioned that I haven't
unboxed the Galaxy Nexus which
supposedly I'm getting tomorrow we'll
see if that's true
I know it hasn't officially launched yet
but supposedly I'm gonna get one some
more we'll see if that works out if so
that unboxing will be up tomorrow so
stay tuned for that anyway guys I hope
you enjoyed this holiday god I hope it
in Babylon for too long I just wanted to
cover every different price range and
give you guys a lot of options because I
know it's difficult to determine what to
get for people and what to ask for
yourself you don't you really want to
get value for your money and know that
the products that you're gonna be
interested in our quality products and I
guess that's part of what this channel
is all about really anyway guys I want
