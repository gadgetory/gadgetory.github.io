therapy and today we're taking a look at
a gaming keyboard this is the Vengeance
k9t from Corsair it's made out of
professional-grade brushed aluminum and
it also features cherry MX red
mechanical key switches now these key
switches are very popular not just for
gamers but also typists they should help
you to avoid missed key presses and
hopefully improve not just your gaming
but also your typing it's also a
customizable keyboard I'll tell you more
about that as the video moves on it
features a two-year warranty
let's go ahead jump inside the box and
take a closer look at what you get for
your hard-earned cash so jumping inside
the box you're first gonna notice that
it is very well protected during
shipping
as I flip over this cart and you get the
first look at the actual keyboard and
probably the most striking feature is
the brushed aluminum build it is
probably the first aluminum keyboard
that I've ever had or ever looked at
closely and it is definitely impressive
you've also got a little bit of
paperwork
you got some warranty info as well as a
little product pamphlet here is the USB
cable which is very strong and sturdy it
seems to be made out of sort of nylon
braided material the last thing included
in the box is this wrist rest here which
is optional you can install it or leave
it off it's completely up to you it does
have a permanent style installation
using some screws so it's not gonna come
off by accident if you don't want it to
here's a closer look at the material
it's made out of very soft I definitely
recommend installing it now since it is
a mechanical keyboard you're going to
get a very satisfying key press taking a
closer look at the USB cable you'll
notice two outlets the reason for that
is because this keyboard features a USB
hub that hub can be used for either USB
thumb drives or your mouse you can use
it however you please looking closer at
the keys on the keyboard you have your
customizable ones over on the far left
these are called your macros and there's
a number of different banks to choose
from so you can set up all kinds of
crazy configurations in terms of
customisation to suit whatever game it
is that you like to play as I said
earlier the main portion of the keyboard
here is incredibly satisfying to type on
you have
he's really obvious keypresses so you're
probably not going to be hitting them by
accident speeding up everything you do
on your keyboard from typing to gaming
as I said earlier you've also got
multimedia keys up here stop play pause
cetera and there's also a backlight key
for controlling a backlight I'll show
you more on that in quick second over to
the far right is where you'll find a
scroll wheel you can use that for volume
or whatever you choose there's a Corsair
logo along top which has a nice mirrored
finish to it to contrast that brushed
aluminum look so here's a closer look at
that backlight it has three different
settings or should I say four because I
guess off is a setting and then there's
three variations in terms of intensity
and brightness there's a closer look at
the scroll wheel I mentioned earlier as
well as the etched multimedia keys
overall guys this is a very impressive
keyboard once you see it in person you
really start to appreciate the build
quality the brushed aluminum look and
feel if you guys are interested in
pricing and availability definitely
