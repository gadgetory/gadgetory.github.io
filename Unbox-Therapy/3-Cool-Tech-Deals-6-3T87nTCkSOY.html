another video today it's going to be
three cool tech deals which haven't done
in a little while so I thought it was
time for an update these of course are
three cool things that I find anywhere
on Amazon and I share them with you so
let's go ahead and get into it first up
we have something from a company called
M pal at least I hope I'm saying that
correctly this is a wide angle adapter
for your iPhone or any phone that's what
caught my attention here for $15 you can
use this little clip on for a number of
different phones and it includes a
couple of different lens adapters so
that you can sort of change your phone
photography at least the the way that
your photos look three lenses supreme
fisheye that's going to give you that
crazy skateboard video effect than just
a regular wide-angle and then the macro
this is going to let you take super wide
photos or very close ones so you can
step up your Instagram photo game these
adapters are mostly novelty this is for
fun it's not going to replace a DSLR
it's just going to let you get a little
bit different perspective on some photos
for 15 bucks and that is a markdown of
15 dollars according to Amazon so maybe
you want to give it a shot and since
you'll have a wide-angle adapter you can
now take pictures of yourself with
somebody else in the frame a friend you
can find a friend you can make a friend
you now have room for a friend in the
frame go make some friends next up we
have an external battery pack from a
company called anchor this one is very
large 16,000 milliamp hours and it has
something called power IQ technology
this is sort of what differentiates your
various backup battery sources that are
out there for example this one will
fully charge an iPhone in about two
hours one and a half to two hours or an
iPad in about three and a half hours
some of them are significantly longer
than that so it's an interesting thing
to take a look at and at least know how
quickly your power bank is going to
charge up those devices that need juice
so this will work with various devices
up to three amps whether it's your
tablet smartphone or otherwise it has
two ports on it and with 16,000
milliamp hours of power that's going to
recharge your phone up to six times
pretty impressive
37 bucks you can see the list price was
90 then 80 now 37 don't take too much
from that these things are discounted on
a regular basis nonetheless at 37
dollars I think this one is a pretty
good value all right so the last item of
the day is from SanDisk this is the
extreme cz 80 USB 3 flash drive this
thing has speeds up to 245 megabytes per
second over USB 3 so when you get a
larger capacity USB key you want to make
sure that it has decent speed because
you're obviously going to be
transferring very large files it comes
in 64 32 and 16 gigabyte capacity at
various price points you can see there
discounted a little bit today I think
this is a good fit for back-to-school
pretty much everybody needs to have one
of these for very quick file transfer
hey now this drive is also backwards
compatible with USB 2.0 so if you need
to transfer between your cool new laptop
which supports USB 3.0 and your friends
less cool laptop which only uses 2.0 you
can do it I'll be it slowly on your
friends slow laptop listen friend get an
upgrade
whatever whatever another thing that I
like about this Drive it has the
retractable connector look at that see
that action right there I think I like a
full-size USB key like this one with the
retractable connector which you can hide
away protect and then expose when you
need to use it and this is a little bit
harder to lose because it at least
occupies a little bit of space all right
you guys check it out there it is
those are the picks another episode of
three cool tech deals I've created a
playlist as well if you want to go back
and watch all the other ones this is
number six so you can watch all six
episodes of three cool tech deals I'll
