app on Android and it has some
interesting features in it now most
people they're talking about the new
dark mode which is cool I'm a big fan of
dark modes in general but the thing that
was more interesting to me than that was
the watch time tracking the YouTube is
now making available to you it's giving
you that information back of course
YouTube's always knew how much time you
spent on YouTube but they didn't tell
you certainly not within the app and not
on the webpage either in fact they still
don't on the webpage not within the
settings or anywhere like that but on
Android right now you can find out how
much time you're spending on YouTube a
daily average a weekly average maybe you
can bring some balance to your life now
a little personal story here before I
dive into the feature and we take a look
at my watch history and how much time
I've spent on YouTube recently I have
been trying to tone it down a little bit
take a little break from YouTube's
consumption because it can overcome
overwhelm of course that is the case
with all forms of entertainment social
media and so on it can absorb you and
you can actually kind of miss out on
real life because you're too invested
with the screen it's locked in there's
no life left over so nobody wants that
it appears even YouTube doesn't want
that because they're making this data
available to you as well as some
features to help you also
take a break from YouTube it seems crazy
they want you to watch more content
watch more ads they can earn more money
but for whatever reason they must have
recognized that people were taking it a
bit too far or maybe they were getting
burned out strung out on the YouTube
binge toggle it back you got to have a
balance here and so we're gonna make
this available to you so anyhow I made
that video a little while back about it
was called no phone as an app where you
could limit your usage of certain apps
limit the addiction to a certain extent
for most of you that isn't realistic
but maybe they
on an app specific basis you know maybe
you could take a break here in there and
regain some of your actual life back
from the social media vortex so anyhow
I'm gonna dive into my YouTube here and
this will be available to you on the
latest version of YouTube for Android so
go download it if you don't have it yet
head up to your profile image up here
and then click on time watched so here
you can see today I watched 2 hours and
25 minutes that's more than usual
yesterday was 51 minutes in the past
week 7 hours and 28 for a daily average
of an hour and four minutes now you
might be looking at density that's a lot
of time to me it does seem like a lot of
time when you see it like that I might
want to knock it back even a little bit
more now again this seems odd I'm
telling myself maybe you to watch less
YouTube why would anyone want to do that
I mean this is where I am this is where
I speak to you here on YouTube but you
know it's about quality over quantity
watching the things that you want that
are useful to you and maybe not getting
so caught up in the algorithmic stuff of
just the whole click farm just next next
I don't even know what I'm clicking on
anymore why am i attracted to this
thumbnail you can have a little bit more
agency over those clicks if you're a
little bit more careful about how you
spend these hours we're gonna bring in
Willie do right now because he's got
some staggering figures here the men he
spends a little bit of time on YouTube
as I understand it so here he is
round of applause for the YouTube
champion of the office this man banks
the biggest numbers on YouTube it's all
here it's all happening now let's put
the smartphone on the table see what
we're working with here all right
time watched here we are okay put it
aside mine your your watching a little
more than me 2 hours and 38 minutes a
day that equals out to 18 hours and 30
minutes a week yeah that's quite a lot
I'm actually a little ashamed but but
make the case I would have to say that
most of the videos are educational mmm
like that watch a lot of lectures yes
but also I stream a lot of music a lot
of just live music right
an occasional ASMR here
right that's pretty much it look there's
all kinds of habits here that are gonna
adjust how these numbers look for you
like he said if you're streaming music
well you're not really watching it's on
in the background maybe you are being
productive maybe you are doing something
else maybe you are watching something
educational there is no black and white
strict rule with this stuff it's not
like just watching in general is bad
it's a you just got to get something
from it
yeah something valuable something that
like an unbox therapy video but I
guarantee you someone in the audience is
gonna go check their stats right now and
they're gonna crush your 18 hours I
guarantee it and I'm curious to see the
numbers that people come up with and
also just the numbers that people think
are acceptable
as YouTube the web our smart phones have
displaced the television and now all of
our hours for the most part are being
spent here you have to expect that these
are going to continue to go up as the
quality of content goes up as well
that's true we both have the new dark
mode enabled to so recommend that you
can see there's a feature here which can
remind you to take a break I'm going to
turn this on for me I'm gonna turn on
for what we'll obviously needs it now
the default setting for that is one hour
and 15 minutes so I wonder if Google
thinks that one hour fifteen minutes is
kind of like the perfect viewing session
with Google there's always some
reasoning so I'm assuming that's the
case we're both gonna get reminders from
now on every one hour and 15 minutes you
have autoplay next video you have this
off yeah I I don't usually okay I'm
gonna turn that off to scheduled digest
let's say you get notifications from
five or six channels uh-huh you will get
one notification as a daily digest of
those uploads interesting I think the
point with some of those features there
are to eliminate distractions if you're
get if you're distracted too frequently
and then of course if the reminder to
take a break is just like look you spend
an hour and 15 maybe you want to go do
something else listen this is important
this is important right here because the
truth is even if YouTube could show you
a million different ads if you're not
engaged if you're not interested if
you're a vegetable a zombie sitting
there
drooling foaming-at-the-mouth you're not
helpful really to anyone what content
creators advertisers anybody that's
serving up anything to somebody on the
other side of this lens watching through
their smartphone wants to deliver
something that's engaging
yeah beyond entertainment there's some
sort of utility that should go with it
hopefully I think that's kind of the
best YouTube that's my favorite type of
YouTube if I can take something away
with me that I consider to be useful
then I tend to not feel as guilty for
having spent my time doing that yeah
like I said before leave a comment down
below how much time are you spending
watching YouTube and what's the biggest
time waster in which content do you feel
most guilty about watching what are
those hours you want to get back I'm
curious I want to know maybe the
algorithm is not always right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
