introduction as well as the title this
video is dedicated to my recap it's a
little bit of a mini review on the Razer
edge this is the third video in my
series which got started with the tablet
unboxing it was followed by an unboxing
of the game controller this is actually
a couple of different components you're
looking at you do not need to buy them
together though I get the feeling that
most people interested in this device
will probably end up getting the package
in this fashion if you're interested in
pricing and availability the links are
down in the description but my warning
to you will be the same as it was in the
first video this thing is not cheap it's
for a very special individual who wants
to have a special device unlike other
people you really can't find a tablet
that's this powerful with this number of
interfacing options besides the Razer
edge this one is the edge pro which
means it's packing an Intel Core i7 dual
core with a base clock speed of 1.9
gigahertz and it can turbo up to 3
gigahertz it's also got 8 gigs of ddr3
memory and maybe most importantly it has
discreet graphics an Nvidia GT 640 ml II
which packs in 2 gigabytes of ddr3
memory that's dedicated video memory so
all these specs combined sort of point
to like a gaming laptop or a laptop like
experience except in this case you're
not looking at a laptop instead you're
looking at a tablet so you're going to
be able to play PC games in this case
I'll go ahead and boot up steam as you
guys have seen in the last video it will
run PC games no problem you will need to
remap your favorite keyboard based games
to work with the controller interface
but the power is actually not the issue
and you may remember in the last video I
also mentioned the ability to hook up
you know USB keyboard and mouse and
actually game on this thing in a
traditional PC fashion that's totally
possible you're totally capable of doing
that with a device that's this powerful
you've got a 10.1 inch IPS display
that's a 1366 by 768 resolution it's
multi-touch and it happens to be one of
the nicest multi-touch experiences that
I've had on a tablet
the reason I say that is because it's
just really responsive there aren't too
many missed key presses and I'd have to
say it exceeded my expectations because
Razer is new to this business they don't
have a huge track record in the tablet
space so my expectations were kind of
low on that front but I was pleasantly
surprised a little bit more detail on
the screen it is a 10.1 inch IPS display
packing 1366 by 768 pixels so IPS is
good especially for a device like this
because you want to get the best viewing
angles possible and this definitely
delivers on that front even as you move
to the side of the screen you're not
going to lose the image in any way
you've also got Windows 8 as you'd
expect
so those specs on their own for a tablet
are pretty damn interesting but things
get a lot more interesting when you
start considering this controller it has
a built in battery so it's going to
extend the battery life on your device
but more importantly it's going to give
you a console like gaming experience in
a way that you're not used to having it
and in something that you can
essentially fit into your backpack so
it's kind of got a console element to it
it's got a PC gaming element to it it's
got a portable gaming element to it it's
just really really strange in a good way
I do like seeing devices like this that
really sort of stretch the boundaries on
what we expect to see in the consumer
electronics world I've personally seen
nothing like this before and that's
always exciting to get a chance to
analyze devices that are completely
unique but because it's so unique the
price tag as I said earlier in this
video is a little bit higher than what
most people would probably consider
paying for what will likely be a
secondary device to a laptop or desktop
PC yes you can get a gaming laptop for
less money than this entire outfit but I
think that that kind of misses the point
and that's not really the argument if
you have the money to spend on this will
you enjoy it probably yes you could
definitely enjoy this thing I know it's
not for the faint of heart you could
easily blow over $1000 on this thing so
if you don't have a nice PC I probably
wouldn't recommend getting it get
yourself a nice PC first and then have
this as a supplementary device but then
that's kind of tough to say nowadays
because a lot of people are getting a
ton of work done on their tablets and
since this tablet is essentially a piece
see you could probably get even more
work done on it so it's really hard to
say whether or not this is a legitimate
device worth considering or not it
really depends on how you see yourself
using it and whether or not you can see
a value proposition in the edge Pro
anyway guys that wraps up my thoughts on
this device I hope you enjoyed this
video if you did make sure to leave a
thumbs up down below and I'll catch on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
