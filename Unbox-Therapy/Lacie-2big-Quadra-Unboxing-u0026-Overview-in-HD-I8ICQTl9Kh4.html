the house
and these unboxings just keep getting
cooler and cooler today we got a let's
see two big Quadra professional two disc
raid and I just want to say off the bat
that we've got a special guest on boxer
today we invited someone from far far
away he's known to most of the world as
the Wolfman
so please lay off the comments regarding
the hairy arms he gets very upset and
he's very self-conscious about it anyway
now that we've got that out of the way
the important part of this and the
reason you came here is to look at the
hard drive and there's a couple things
that are special about this model first
and foremost it has a ton of different
interfaces hence the name Quadra and
second of all the design is different
from other external drives in that the
entire enclosure is a giant heatsink and
what that means for you is you're not
gonna have a fan constantly running
making noise in you know you're gonna
probably want to use this thing in some
environments where noise might be an
issue but even if it isn't everybody
knows that a another fan going off in
your computer room is not necessarily
something that you're looking forward to
so one thing I noticed right away is
this puppy's heavy as you'd expect it's
got two hard drives in it let's take a
close look at the back here we got our
power port a firewire 400 port two
firewire 800 ports a USB 2.0 port an
eSATA port an on/off switch and at the
top there you can see the indicators for
the different type of hardware aids that
you can set up this is also where the
hard drives can be hot swapped out the
back you can see on the front that you
got your giant big blue Lissie button
that everybody's used to if you've had
Lucy products and that button actually
has some functionality itself you can
set it up to perform a number of
different shortcuts such as backing up
or launching specific applications
that's completely up to you now let's
see what's included I'm hoping we get
all the different cables for those
different interfaces and by the looks of
it that's the case first this is your
jumper pin this you're gonna stick in
the back of the device to configure the
type of raid you're looking for
this is to remove this is an allen key
obviously to remove the stand from the
bottom in case you want to you know
mount the raid into a rack
here is your USB cable eSATA cable look
at this they gave us all the cables we
need that's beautiful here we got our
firewire 400 cable and firewire 800
cable that's the one I'm probably going
to be using and some self-explanatory
stuff here is our power cord and the
other half of the power adapter which
actually is not huge and fairly light
you think a device like this might have
some gigantic freaking power adapter
like though like the first xbox 360's or
whatever anyway here is some utilities
on disk so backup utilities and whatnot
your quick install guide a couple
different languages in here and lastly
your warranty information and that's
another cool thing about Lisi is you're
getting a three year warranty with this
stuff so here I'm gonna show you just
how you hot-swap a drive you just got to
stick poin in here and of course you've
got two drives in this model and then
this Bay just slides out to reveal a
regular three and a half inch SATA drive
in my case they're each gonna be a
terabyte and I was actually surprised to
find out that there's Samsung hard
drives inside I was thinking I was gonna
see Western Digital or Seagate but now
we found a Samsung drive anyway you can
see the build quality of the cage is
pretty serious it's all it's all some
sort of aluminum alloy okay here is a
little bit of information regarding raid
you can see we got our different
performance chart depending on the type
of interface you use obviously eSATA is
going to be the fastest here's some
information regarding the heatsink and
how it works as opposed to a sort of
standard design and lastly
we've got that shortcut button which I
explained to you earlier you can set it
up forever whatever you want this
episode of unbox the repiy has been
