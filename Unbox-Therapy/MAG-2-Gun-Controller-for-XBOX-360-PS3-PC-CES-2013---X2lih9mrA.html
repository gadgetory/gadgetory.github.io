coverage what's up guys Lew here and
I've got another cool thing to show you
from the show floor here at CES 2013
this is the mag 2 and as you can tell
it's a different way of interfacing or
interacting with your favorite shooting
games shooters like Call of Duty etc so
the way that it works is you point the
device at your screen and wherever
you're pointing well that's where you're
aiming your other hand rests on a
joystick and your buttons are remapped
into a location that makes sense to use
with a controller like this so
essentially you take a regular everyday
controller and you turn it into
something like this that's the shape of
a rifle you use this module here this
plugs into the USB port on your Xbox 360
Playstation 3 or your PC so it'll work
on pretty much any platform and then
you're up and running you're ready to go
here you can see Ajay giving us a quick
quick little demo and he told me
afterwards that you get better as time
goes on so the more that you use it the
more that you play the better you get at
functioning with it it does take a
little while to get used to it as you
might imagine any new control mechanism
control scheme will take a little while
but as you can tell here there he blew
up that he blew up that enemy so he is
getting better and you will get the hang
of it eventually so it's a cool way of
interacting with your game and I guess a
more realistic way from what a
controller can offer so definitely worth
checking out actually if you guys are
interested in pricing and availability
on the mag - I've dropped the link down
in the description of this video so you
can click that and go and check out a
little bit more info on it but as I
mentioned before it will work across
platforms so regardless if you're on
PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 or PC you can use
it one thing to mention if you are on an
Xbox 360 then you will need to plug also
a regular controller into the module in
order so that Xbox Live sees a regular
controller hooked up anyway guys if you
enjoyed this content please remember to
leave a thumbs up down below and I've
got a lot more CES stuff to get through
so don't go anywhere subscribe if you
want to see it alright later guys sync
is all about staying in touch all with
simple voice commands you never have to
worry about a phone call while driving
with hands-free calling
if your phone rings you can answer with
the push of a button and you can make a
call with the sound of your voice unbox
