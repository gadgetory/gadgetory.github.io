therapy comm and today we're taking a
look at a three speaker boom box from
TDK that's right you heard me correctly
TDK these guys have been out of the
audio game for a little while at least
as far as boom boxes are concerned and
they're making a comeback here with a
vengeance they got a brand new product
line with a bunch of different boom
boxes and even a turntable now this is
the flagship model it's the three
speaker model and we're gonna get right
to it let me tell you guys this thing is
heavy and has a boom box I guess that
kind of makes it a little less portable
but as it goes for audio you need a
little bit of weight to produce that
that heavy sound that deep bass so I can
understand why we've got wait here and
I'll I'll take something that's a little
heavier as long as it's going to sound
better but this thing is beautiful let
me tell you the materials in use here
are all top of the line the handle is
made out of a metallic aluminum kind of
finish with a bronze coloring you got
this glossy front Kevlar speakers it's
crazy I mean the production quality here
is unlike any kind of boombox I've seen
or even audio equipment I've seen of
recent so as far as extras go they're
going to give you a bunch of extra stuff
we've got an antenna here for picking up
the radio although who the hell this is
radio so anyway we got am/fm this is a
good backup in an emergency situation if
aliens take over we're sticking to have
our our FM and AM radio going anyway
we've also got our power cord this half
is going to plug into the power brick we
got a little stand for that radio
antenna that I was talking about there
you go at least it makes it look a
little prettier standing up that way
they're also going to give us a 3.5
millimeter cable that's nice
get all your different audio sources
into this here's the other half of the
power this is the brick
and lastly we're going to get an iPod
cable or iphone cable which usually you
wouldn't see something like that
included that's because this stereo can
interface directly with your iPod or
iPhone and grab tunes off of it next we
got our documentation straightforward
stuff manual in a couple of different
languages three different languages to
be exact
no need to check this out it's just a
boom box here's our inputs we at RCA
line-in actually got an instrument in
and that USB I was talking about this
baby can also run off batteries albeit a
ton of them we got a nice LCD screen
here and touch sensitive buttons all
really slick looking super high quality
woofers here Kevlar
we got metallic knobs everything's done
in this nice bronze coloring leather on
the handles I mean this thing looks real
pretty anyway you probably want to know
how she sounds and let me tell you she
sounds just as good as she looks anyway
