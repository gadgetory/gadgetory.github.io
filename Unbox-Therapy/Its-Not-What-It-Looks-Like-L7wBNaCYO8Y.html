need this brother I've been thirsty for
whiskey on my lips Oh backwards hat
brother the hell of a statement brother
so it's been a little while since it did
a speaker video but they are some of my
most favorite videos to make especially
when Ryan is in that he's been known to
get loose she's got a few moves he's
promised me today that if the speaker
sounds good at all he'll make an
appearance on camera he's going to show
you his newest moves today he's been
working on these for many months I'm
looking at a special speaker as well you
can tell he does not look like your
average bluetooth speaker from the folks
at Blu toi featured this stuff before I
did a pair of headphones with like a
hundred speakers in them all right don't
hold me to that they're all about taking
an unconventional approach when it comes
to audio equipment audio devices three
separate drivers assuming the middle
driver is probably going to be the low
frequency and then that's just a guess
it's kind of microphone as well this
could be our new speaker phone
conference caller it's also got a carry
belt with a carabiner this is like a
boombox bluetooth version 4.1 I need a
knife how does that keep happening this
is a boxer good knives around jeans men
Ryan you're ready to get loose why do
you need look I thought I needed a knife
and anything comes home like this
what a disaster this thing looks like uh
some kind of submarines oh cool
Wow you think Bluetooth speaker you want
your you wouldn't immediately imagine
designing something like this but hey
man
more power to you oh this is the belt
carabiner combo that Ryan will be
wearing wait till you see this guy
prancing around so I'm going to kick it
off with the power switch right here
power on oh really oh hello there
power on very rock connected guess who
is connected I'm going to hit the 3d
button do have one thing that definitely
happens here is like the stereo
separation in the sound because of the
width of it it looks like it it looks
like a like some kind of it belongs in
Star Wars music they're going to whoa
dude what is that stink you think you
can play like whoa
it's like Batman start playing this song
it's like the jimbacca Rashad and g3 the
Batman he knows that the world needs
them boom
same thing it applies Ryan drew you play
takes off your nose the world needs is
moving and there it is and there it is
oh my good look at the improvement look
at the looseness
look at the joint as they swing with
unbelievable lubrication this is
unprecedented you're the man needs to be
studied by science they can better
determine how to completely kill
arthritis okay hold up this is it
serious time out okay it goes like that
oh yeah okay and then you come to the
bottom it's a team effort over here Oh
huge backwards now these ones can touch
up front that's right because wow this
is a statement oh my goodness okay yeah
this is tight is it yeah all right get
your carabiner on there brother
these dance moves you're coming to the
people that's arranged how I can beer
it's kind of like that on the creepy
okay you you what is that base in the
right place right now let's try the very
front okay how's that BC you'll ride on
that base feeling there it is Oh
feels like a - total man Ryan all right
Ryan you close it out I'm out of here
you close it up say goodbye okay
Oh sink you know if you could hang it
from the ceiling or maybe a fan that
would be kind of cool and it just like
goes around the room and it's playing
music I don't you have a ceiling fan
maybe that's dangerous I'm not sure it's
not really that heavy though so I think
that would work that's about it hello
hey VIN hey it's Ryan how are you man
it's going pretty good yo can you hear
me very well yeah okay it's pretty
pretty crisp and clear oh yeah
what do you up to tonight okay and there
