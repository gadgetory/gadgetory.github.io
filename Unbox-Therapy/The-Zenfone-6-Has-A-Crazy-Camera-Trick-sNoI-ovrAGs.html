nothing about it to be honest I mean
will he do just he just showed up
whether he said it's interesting and
exciting and it's a bit different
something that it does is a bit
different so I'm kind of pumped to check
it out in fact all right so interesting
phone here today zenfone 6 got my hands
on it it's apparently pretty interesting
a little bit different has a feature
that I feel like I saw before a really
long time ago a feature that I think
some people might be a fan of it's got a
Snapdragon 855 8 gigs of ram it's a case
or oh it is okay basic kind of case this
is the device so you can start to see
some of the specs here as I mentioned
Snapdragon 820 5 latest flagship from
Qualcomm it's got a six point four inch
all screen a lot of people using that
terminology these days nano edge display
with Corning Gorilla Glass 6 so it
should be pretty durable you see a
little diamond there and the flip camera
which is the interesting part of this
particular device front and rear 48
megapixel Sony I MX 586 and then a 13
megapixel ultra light now why would I
want some crazy flip II camera there it
is by the way oh that's cool and of
course the reason is because you get
your best camera to always be your
camera your best camera is always on the
rear side of your device for obvious
reasons now on this one I guess that's
not the case somehow this thing is gonna
flip around and you're gonna get access
to a dual and setup you have your basic
big sensor lens and then you've also got
your wide-angle you're gonna get that
wide field of view that I'm such a fan
of and also actually happens to be quite
useful on a front-facing camera so when
the thing flips around you can imagine
that one being a popular choice there's
still a fingerprint scanner in the rear
uh you know what I'm not such a that's
not such a problem for me
I like these fingerprint scanners I find
them fast and reliable USB type-c down
on the bottom here and also a headphone
jack there's also a textured what is
this some sort of a shortcut button I'm
guessing wills telling me this button it
can trigger Google assistant so it's an
assistant style button Oh or you can
customize it to do something else so
that's kind nice
nice little switch and it doesn't have a
texture it has a tiny little texture to
it now I should also mention while I'm
showcasing the outside of this device
it's got a huge battery in it that's
another differentiating factor and they
really have a couple of differentiating
factors in this phone
we've got type-c cable there's a
semi-decent
pretty decent looking headset included
as well interchangeable ear tips to go
with that headset and then a quick
charge power brick here let's boot this
up see if it has any power here oh it
definitely does okay cool yes it's an
all screen design there's a bit of a
bezel around the sides and a chin as
well but no knotch
so the display is IPS and it's six point
four inches fhd plus so another cool
thing about this device is it's
expandable it's actually got a triple
slot look at the size of this SIM card
tray it's got a triple slot setup so you
can have two SIM cards two nano sims and
a micro SD card up to two terabytes of
course who's buying two terabyte s DS
Micro has these but that said on an
earlier episode of Lew later downstairs
we showcased the one terabyte micro SD
card so that is a thing you can get
right now so if you're a big fan of
local storage not necessarily storing
things in the cloud you can put a large
micro SD card in here expand your
storage from the available 256 gigs that
comes on the phone alright so this is
pretty cool this is the smart key that I
was mentioning earlier which can wake up
Google assistant and it actually is
multifunctional one press will call up
Google assistant press twice it calls of
Google assistant and then runs your
personal updates press and hold and keep
talking to Google assistant and then
when you release assistant will respond
immediately that's kind of cool you can
also customize this Marquis function to
fit your personal need all right I like
that this is set up let's get the
brightness cranked up okay so obviously
not an OLED display it's not all bad it
does one thing it helps to bring the
cost of this thing into you know we're
kind of an attractive range retail price
$4.99 kind of diving into the territory
that oneplus just left
honestly I'm having one plus vibes just
on a home screen here the bezel it's a
bit bigger here then on the oneplus
device around the edges but not so much
so that it's gonna be offensive
it looks like the experience here is
pretty stock very stock in fact they're
calling it Zen UI but it's a very
similar experience to stock Android
okay now I'm not even gonna try to snap
a rear camera yet because I'm just too
curious I got to hit this button here we
go oh it flips out it flips up did you
witness this Jack why has no one thought
of that look at this ready it looks to
me like we are fully in the era of
motors on smartphones 2019 is the motor
year for smartphones that is crazy why
you me you've got this amazing camera on
the back of the device why not utilize
it twice now of course it's not all rosy
this means you've got this mechanism in
place that motor you're gonna have to
trust it I'm gonna switch between the
portrait the the kind of typical focal
length and wide so this switches over to
the wide-angle a 48 megapixel Sony IMX
586 flagship sensor and then the
secondary camera is a 13 megapixel 125
ultra wide 125 degree field of view
ultra wide it's got some sort of an HDR
process going on right away
I'm definitely beautified I got a toggle
that back jack that's not me what what
is this am I not beautiful enough to you
already
so without HDR on you can immediately
pick up a little more contrast in the
old beard there that's the wide one to
give you an idea of focal range and then
we have the slightly closer one it's a
nice selfie it's a good selfie I still
feel like in the skin tones it's a bit
softer a little more forgiving yeah it's
pretty impressive man I mean if you're
into taking pictures of yourself I mean
you're just getting way more resolution
than you would typically get on a on a
selfie image whoo I feel like portrait
mode has done even better now the beard
is even more distinguished
of course it's also capable 4k video
you're out like this and you got the
full resolution that Kirk's right so
another advantage here you now have a
flash on the front of your device and
that's the wide aspect ratio right there
and then slightly more zoomed in on the
standard focal range lots of resolution
very vibrant of course I've got to
evaluate the speakers first let's check
out some dialogue on unbox therapy here
oh wow okay so they've included
something called audio wizard including
DTS surround sound it's currently in
normal mode with volume maxed so let's
head back to the video here okay my
usual test here where I check to see
exactly where the sound is coming from
vast majority is out of the bottom of
the unit benefit there is gonna give you
a little bit more detail coming straight
at you but all your low-end most of your
frequency range is gonna come out of the
bottom and you can block that
unfortunately it is possible let's say I
go to vocal on the DTS it really works
as well that's a cool feature see that's
one of my my problems with a lot of
these devices is that like out of the
box they can be muffled in exchange for
some extending the the base piece of
your sound profile this one gives you
the option to select I'm curious when I
play some music so let's go ahead and do
that Wow
okay now keep in mind it's currently
this is loud okay so it's currently in
voice enhanced mode
oh I don't know let's try pop mode it
really changes the performance of it I'm
just gonna play it on the iPhone here
just for comparison I'm putting a
flagship territory that's that's the
iPhone it's a thousand dollar phone I
think I have to say a 499 I'm impressed
regardless that's the way I'm gonna put
it it's up to your it's gonna be a
subjective choice there I'd say I was a
bit concerned at first it felt a bit
muffled before I went into the audio
wizard that's installed by default when
you hit the settings on the volume meter
again is this something you could
achieve on a lot of smart phones if you
install some sort of third-party
equalizer maybe but they've done it
right out of the box and some of their
preset sound great so at 499 I'm pretty
impressed with that package right there
sound wise this device is not OLED so to
give you a breakdown of how that kind of
a fit might affect you there's a quick
one - they're just gonna show you I'm
out if you need to click on a picture to
show you what you're giving up when you
go away from all that you might get
slightly better battery consumption out
of the LCD app will try to convince you
of this with the iPhone 10 R I think the
main thing here is you're getting a
lower price point just way more contrast
over here especially when you see the
white now if I click on an actual pizza
here I mean this is still like a pretty
nice display from a detailed perspective
it's not gonna pop like this one like
the red over here it's not a bad looking
display it's just let's not let's not
pretend that it's OLED cuz it isn't
alright so what can I say about this
device I think it's kind of promising at
this price I mean well I'm constantly
bringing a price because that's really
what it comes down to of course if you
had unlimited money you know why are you
picking this phone over some other one
unless you're just really attracted to
the motorized camera component maybe
they're like a professional snapchatter
or a Instagram user or something then
this is really the only way to get 48
megapixels big size sensor facing you
with a monitor to view it and a
Snapdragon e55 that's the chip that you
want right that's the horsepower you're
looking for and it's becoming a little
bit more difficult to find that chip at
an accessible price especially when it's
paired with a half-decent camera and a
five thousand milliamp hour battery so I
think it's a pretty competitive price
point at $4.99 I think the big question
here is gonna be if you just absolutely
want to have OLED but if you're like hey
man I only really care about the
oullette thing when I see them side by
side then that just exposes the fact
that they look different and you might
be right
in this environment this display it
looks good to me and I'm counting my
extra dollars saved while I'm flipping
around my fancy camera so there's a case
to be made for it and then the other
angle is the giant battery 5,000
milliamp hour battery that's no joke I
think on this hardware that's gonna give
you some serious battery life you're
definitely gonna be charging this less
than a lot of other competitors at this
price point and other price points for
that matter and of course how could I
forget no not as a consequence you're
just looking at all display so when you
pop open that YouTube video it's no
distraction and I think that's worth
something I think that's actually a
pretty pretty valuable thing and it's
increasingly the case we have we'd have
more options notch list options or a
real thing in 2019 and that's a good
thing but there's also gonna be those of
you that are apprehensive in the know
motor camp you're the same people that
were commenting into one plus seven pro
video was saying that's just not for me
I'm not ready for a motor in my
smartphone and that's a valid point as
well now I'm sure in this case the
testing has been done as well just like
three hundred thousand times I know one
plus side but you just can't change the
fact that it's a moving part moving
component and there's a motor in your
smartphone and up until now that just
even wasn't it wasn't even a thing now
you have options for which phone you
want and which motor this one has a cool
factor can't take that away you're
probably using some boring slab right
now that's a party trick you pull that
baby out for the group selfie and people
are like this man is onto something
you're doing something I'm not so we got
to add a little value there as well I
think it's an interesting package and I
think it probably deserves some
is the zenfone 6 but maybe the coolest
craziest camera contraption I've seen
definitely in a long time
