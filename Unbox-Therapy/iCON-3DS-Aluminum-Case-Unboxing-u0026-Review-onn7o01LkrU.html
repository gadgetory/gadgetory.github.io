therapy comm and today we're looking at
the aluminum case for your Nintendo 3ds
this one is from Ikon and it's in the
blue color it's also available in red
and this was actually thrown in as a
gift from Future Shop at the midnight
release of the Nintendo 3ds so anybody
who purchased one got one of these cases
for free now as it is with anything
that's free my expectations are not
extremely high
that being said I'm looking forward to
trying it on and getting some sort of
protection on my new device so there's
nothing else in the box besides the case
itself and judging from the appearance
of it it looks like it probably just
snaps into place it's got a soft felt
interior definitely made out of aluminum
and obviously you've got your cutouts
for your cameras the bottom side has
cutouts for everything the your game
your different switches volume LEDs etc
let's go ahead and try it on the device
as you can see it looks pretty good
actually it just clips on so I'm not
sure if it's gonna loosen over time but
it feels real tight right now the color
is like a blueish kind of purple anyway
you still get access to all your
switches
that's your 3d switch as well as your
Wi-Fi switch all your ports on the back
remain open now the one question
everybody's gonna have is can you still
put it in the dock with the case on now
that's kind of an interesting thing
because yes you can but it doesn't
really fit as it was intended to fit so
it will charge but the front edge
doesn't clip properly so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you some pictures you see
it doesn't really slide in there very
nicely so it will charge but it's not
necessarily how it was intended but
that's fine after all this case was a
throw-in anyways and as far as
protection is concerned it seems like
it's going to be pretty tough so I'm
okay with it
anyway be sure to check back to our
channel and subscribe I'm still working
on the review I'm gonna cover everything
so there's gonna be a lot of 3ds
coverage coming up in the next few days
later</div></body></html>
