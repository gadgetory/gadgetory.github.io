another video and today I am doing an
experiment well we're doing an
experiment together collectively this is
the new s7 edge the objective here today
is to dunk it give it a little bath let
it go for a swim as you know this new
model along with the standard s7 now
features a water-resistant build I
believe the official line is somewhere
in the neighborhood of an hour submerged
well in ours just not all that
entertaining and who knows maybe your
whole house gets flooded you get hit by
that tsunami and your phone ends up
underwater a little longer let's find
out exactly how robust this water
resistance is let's dunk this baby for
many many hours I'm gonna dunk it
overnight I'm gonna pop it in this
little jar right here and when I get
back into the studio tomorrow we'll see
what happened this is science I want to
know the truth when does it die or does
it die at all
okie-dokie what do we have here we've
obviously gone to the extreme here and
we recorded the entire event so we can
find out what exactly went down I'm
gonna pull this out
it looks to me
Oh oh wow that baby is working right now
look at this working perfectly so this
has been in water from 7:00 p.m. last
night until 12:00 noon I didn't expect
it to survive that long and it looks
like it's done quite a bit better than
that you can drop it in your toilet and
leave it there overnight later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
