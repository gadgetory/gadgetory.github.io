got another unboxing for you I'm gonna
be going on a little bit of an unboxing
spree I know I've been off my game a
little bit recently so I'm gonna hit you
back with a huge volume of unboxing
videos and I hope you guys appreciate
that today we're taking a closer look at
the Corsair Vengeance 1500 which is of
course a gaming headset closed-back
design a noise cancelling microphone and
very very comfortable I know that
because I tried out the previous
generation and still use them on a
regular basis so anyways let's go ahead
and slice open this box and take a
closer look at the materials that are in
use I know it has a very well padded
headband as well as ear cups plus the
ear cups are oversized which is a big
deal for me I usually prefer an over the
ear style design when it comes to
headsets as opposed to like on the ear
that's just my preference I feel like it
isolates external noise a little bit
better and gives you a little bit more
immersive experience plus they are very
comfortable
alright so that phone call ruined
everything that's the beauty of these
live unboxing videos is you get what you
get it's live so you're gonna get my
real reactions to the products and I
think there's something special about
that it's nothing contrived there is no
script this is real legitimate unboxing
as it was intended as it was originally
invented here it looks like we've got a
really long cable it's not removable
though so I'm gonna have to slide it
through this hole right here probably
have to remove this packaging here first
so it is a braided cable a USB of course
and it looks like there's a remote yep
so you have volume as well as a mute
button and it's an inline remote with a
little clip on it so that's gonna be
able to clip onto your sweater clothing
etc there's also a little cable strap on
here to manage your cable if this is too
much for you and then a little bit of
paperwork in the package as well alright
so here is the heads
you can see that the ear cups rotate
they have a microfiber interior which is
good for a gaming headset or what really
any headset that you're gonna use for
extended sessions gonna be a little bit
better when it comes to like sweat or
getting too hot compared with you know
those vinyl interiors or even leather
your cups oversized they should fit
around most people's ears and they also
have this really padded wide headband
which is important I'm a big fan of wide
headbands because it distributes the
weight over your head obviously better
noise cancelling microphone these are
also surround sound emulating headphones
or a headset and so that means you're
gonna get slightly better situational
awareness when you're playing your
favorite games you're gonna be able to
tell where the sound is coming from so
you know if a gunshot comes from your
rear or your left ear right well left
and right just any headset would be able
to tell but a lot more precision on
where that particular sound is coming
from you have an adjustable headband so
big head small head now you should be
good to go in terms of more technical
specifications you're gonna have a
frequency response of 20 Hertz to 20
kilohertz impedance of 32 ohms so pretty
easy to drive dynamic range of 95 DB
they are 50 millimeter drivers on the
inside so that's gonna give you a lot of
low-end when you're looking for that
bass or you want to hear those
explosions so these should be pretty
good for music as well the cable length
as I said was long it's exactly 3 meters
so if your PC is far away from where you
sit you're gonna have enough slack to
get there the microphone is
unidirectional and it is noise canceling
I believe I mentioned that before
it's a condenser its impedance is 2.2 K
ohms if that means anything to you
anyways there it is an unboxing and
first look at the Vengeance 1500 headset
from Corsair I've got a bunch of Corsair
head sets here in the studio currently
so we'll be going through a bunch of
them and as I use them I will tell you
which ones are my favorites and why and
the best way to find out my opinions and
ask me questions etc is on Twitter I am
at unbox therapy follow me there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
