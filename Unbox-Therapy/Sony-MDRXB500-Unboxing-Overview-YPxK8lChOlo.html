therapy and today we're taking a look at
the sony xba-4
now if you follow the channel then you
know i've unboxed and looked at a
shitload of headphones some a lot more
expensive than these in fact i only paid
$59 for these and let me tell you
something these things do not sound like
$59 headphones in fact they sound a lot
better the cost of performance ratio on
these is incredible if you got a spare
50 or 60 bucks i totally recommend
picking these up now one of the
downsides is that the unboxing is pretty
lame all you get is an old-school
headphone container and a little piece
of paper from Sony that no one's gonna
read then the headphones as well as a
carrying pouch this one actually has a
special looking cable it's a flat style
instead of the normal round one and
hopefully your st. gonna get tangled up
at least I'm pretty sure that's the
reason why they went with that design so
as you guys see these are super
cushioned I mean I've never put
something like this on my head this is
like putting two pillows on your head
in fact these have been nicknamed the
Princess Leia headphones for obvious
reasons you've got a nice adjustable
headband now the only thing that kind of
sucks about these but not really a huge
deal is that the cable is not detachable
so they're fixed on there so if
something does happen to the cable you
can't just throw another one in there
but they're 59 bucks
don't complain there's a better look at
that flat style cable and a nice right
angle connector this is not a super long
cable so depending on your use case
scenario that might be a good thing or a
bad thing in my case it's good I hate
having all that extra cable I don't need
so here's a closer look at the materials
in use here there's a lot of metallic
portions to these headphones and there's
a better look at that area that is not
detachable and a better look also at
that flat style cable you can see a big
huge 50 millimeter driver in there
ready to bring music to
or years and a better look at that
pillow I'm not sure if this is real
leather or leatherette but let me tell
you something these are super
comfortable the most comfortable
headphones I've ever put on my head so
here's a look at that pouch that comes
with it it's a nice big pouch so you're
not gonna have to struggle to slide the
headphones in there let's go ahead and
make sure that they fit in nice so there
you go y'all ready to travel anyway guys
if you haven't checked out my channel
yet please go ahead and do so I got a
lot more content over there including a
lot more headphone unboxings and
overviews and if you don't mind how
about you hit that like and even
favorite button because it's those
little clicks that help to keep this
content rolling anyway guys until next
time I'll see you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
