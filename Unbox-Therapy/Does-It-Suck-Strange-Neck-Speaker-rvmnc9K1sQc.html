guys Lew here back with another episode
of does it suck this is the new show
here on unbox therapy this is called the
boomerang mini I know nothing about it
crazy stuff shows up here sometimes and
I just gotta check it out and find out
if it's any good this one has me
skeptical though if you look at the
image on the front of the box it shows a
speaker with a phone but then it also
shows it around somebody's neck here
that had me wondering why would you put
something like this around your neck
when you could use a cool invention
called headphones you know that go right
on your ears who knows I don't know I'm
gonna be checking it out I'm gonna be
testing now that's the point of these
videos so it's the boomerang mini
wireless surround sound for smartphones
featuring Bluetooth and NFC plays with
iPhone plays with Android now it works
with plays with be careful will you play
with you can see the device folds up for
easy storage but they do recommend that
when you carry it around you put it
around your neck so this is gonna be
really interesting now our boomerang
meaning here is outfitted much like a
fine sports car with the yellow and
black coloring now the first thing that
I notice here is the weight it has
fairly decent weight to it an audio can
be a good thing you have some controls
here on off switch auxiliary port
auxiliary port Oh so you can put in an
analog source and a USB connector for
charging it up it is NFC capable at
least it has a little NFC sticker there
then you have a tiny little auxiliary
cable and a charging cable it should
have a little bit of a charge on it is
there a light okay let's see if the NFC
function works let's do that first
hello anybody home
AJ check the NFC sticker is there but
does that mean that the NFC is there
like this wax on wax off and FC where
art thou Oh got it okay works a lot
better when you hold the device up Oh
connected baby okay you just kind of
stretch this out this now that's kind of
cool right
like if you if your main media device is
your phone it's like a stand to I don't
know put this up on the on the table
when you're eating lunch or something
it's this that's useful does it sound
good okay here we go I'm gonna point it
at me because like that's that's the way
I would be using it I mean it's not okay
listen I've heard better portable
speakers and maybe the most important
thing you're getting is the ability to
put it around your neck okay
I mean that's fashion forward a little
tight weave my necks a little thicker
than most but it's a little tight aw
it's very odd feeling having a sound
near my ears but not on it's like it's
like when you have your headphones on
but they're not on your ears the new-age
boombox got the kids at school just
doing it this way instead no okay this
is too tight for my neck you know it's a
little bigger than your average
bluetooth speaker I guess but it's a
stand as well
we certainly got more low-end than your
phone speaker does sit in the cafeteria
this is a cool way like set up a little
YouTube playlist some unbox therapy
videos of course and you and your
friends sit around and all of a sudden
that becomes a social kind of situation
instead of just having your earbuds in
how much does this go for 60 bucks hmm
you can get a better speaker for 60
bucks
does it suck it doesn't suck
rechargeable battery built-in auxiliary
port NFC allowed a lot of them don't
have NFC there's an iPad version as well
a tablet version which of course
stretches larger it's going to be a
little bit louder
a bizarre-o device let's be honest quite
bizarre
especially the around the neck part tech
fashion taking it to the next level here
on unbox therapy it doesn't suck it's
not the best there you have it your
second episode of doesn't suck stay
tuned stick around leave a thumbs up if
you enjoyed it thanks as always for
watching and I'll catch you on the next
