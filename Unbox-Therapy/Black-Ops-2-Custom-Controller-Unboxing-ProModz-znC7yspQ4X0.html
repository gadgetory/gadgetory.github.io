we're gonna do an old-school live style
unboxing unlike anything that's being
done on unbox therapy before you guys
told me to remove the lipstick and kick
it old-school and so that's what I'm
gonna do in this particular unboxing
right here and what better way to start
then on a box like this a nondescript
cardboard box let's go ahead and get
inside I got my trusty blade over here
this is the Cricut I believe it's called
can't remember the name exactly right
now if you guys want to know more info
on this little knife let me know down in
the comments section I believe it's the
CR what the hell is the name CRKT is the
brand so anyways let's go ahead and jump
inside this box and take a closer look
at what is inside of here so as you guys
can see completely unadulterated
unboxing in I'll be cutting it open on
camera just like in the old days and
let's go ahead and take a closer look at
what's inside so you got a bunch of
packing foam in here
I'll remove some of that stuff and here
is something iMac I'm actually really
excited about it really excited to
receive it is a special black ops 2
slash unbox therapy branded xbox 360
controller and it comes from my good
friends over at Pro mods and I believe
they stuff some information in here
regarding their brand so here you can
see some cards so once again they're
called Pro mods and they specialize in
custom controllers like this one and as
I said before this is in commemoration
of not only black ops 2 but also unbox
therapy as you can see down on the
bottom there you've also got unbox
therapy on the bumpers a very
cool-looking design you can still buy
this controller in the black ops 2
configuration in the orange and black
with the very cool honeycomb gradient
here that fades from silver up top down
into a darker black coloring and you've
also got the orange on the bottom here
so very cool
overall one more thing to mention you do
get orange LEDs as well around the
center button and of course orange
thumbsticks
orange d-pad a B buttons etc so let's go
ahead and get a slightly closer look
I'll bring this a little bit closer to
the camera and hopefully we can get some
autofocus on there so there you go you
get a better idea up close and personal
unbox therapy style if you will and a
pretty sweet look as far as I'm
concerned that you can see the unbox
therapy lettering and of course the
beautiful paint that's being used here
it has a glossy finish but it doesn't
attract finger prints at all it's a
really nice finish actually as we come
around top you can see once again the
unbox therapy on the bumpers got the
orange triggers to match everywhere else
and black ops on the back nice little
skull down there as well so I've been
thinking about maybe doing a giveaway
for this controller for one lucky unbox
therapy viewer I think it would be a
really cool thing to own since it is
pretty unique of course like I said
before you get Pro mods to make you a
black ops 2 controller which matches
this one in design but you won't have
that unbox therapy lettering down on the
bottom so for that case this is
basically one-of-a-kind so let me know
by hitting that thumbs up button if this
is something you guys hope to have a
giveaway for and I think it would be a
pretty cool addition to your Xbox 360
console you have all your friends asking
you where the hell you got hooked up
with this sweet controller so the Pro
mods information is gonna be down in the
description of this video I also started
a new website it's called trigger pulled
comm it's a place where I'm posting and
listing some of my favorite gadgets
technology things that I own things that
I want to own and I'm also taking user
submissions so you can actually get
products you are interested in posted on
the site and I'm having fun building it
right now so definitely check that out
too I'll put a link to trigger pulled
calm in the description as well thanks
for watching this old-school unboxing
let me know what you guys think in the
comments I might be able to fly through
unboxings faster if I do them in this
house I hope you guys did appreciate
this unadulterated
one-take live unboxing alright guys
thanks as always for watching and I'll
catch you on the next video later</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
