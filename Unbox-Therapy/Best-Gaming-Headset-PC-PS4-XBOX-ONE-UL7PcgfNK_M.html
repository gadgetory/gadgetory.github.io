factory-fresh video for your consumption
today we're going to be talking about a
very high-end gaming headset as you'll
notice there are two of them on the
table hmm I wonder what the extra one
might be for don't go anywhere but
before we talk about this headset I want
to mention something special I want to
address the elephant in the room the
fact that I am not wearing my usual
hooded sweatshirt sort of my uniform as
most of you know today I have stepped up
upgraded the fashion game and I owe it
all to 5'4 clothing that's right this
beautiful looking shirt right here which
is actually surprisingly high-quality
came from 5'4 they sent me a bunch of
other stuff as well cool company brand
new concept $60 a month gets you a
hundred and twenty dollars worth of
clothes so it's a subscription-based
model but the beauty of it is that you
can set it and sort of forget it you get
a stylist assigned to you based on your
taste so when you sign up at first you
pick a few things you like and they Zone
in on creating an entire style for you
so you don't have to worry about it and
they keep you looking fresh every single
month so you don't have to keep
recycling the same old gear and you
don't need to think about it very cool
I'll drop a link down in the description
go and check them out five for clothing
alright let's jump inside this box right
here and take a closer look at the gain
0 from Sennheiser big Sennheiser fan and
hey now we're going to look at their
gaming headsets so today we're looking
at the game 0 headset from the game
series it's sennheiser if you're
unfamiliar with Sennheiser they've been
in the audio business for a very long
time famous for their audiophile grade
headphones and now they are in the
gaming headset space with what looks
like a very compelling package obviously
you've noticed there are two boxes in
front of me and as I mentioned before
there's a reason for that I'm going to
give one of them away to you guys meet
lucky viewers and we're going to do it
very simply just subscribe to both of my
channels both of his channels what is he
talking about some of you know others
don't I recently launched a brand new
channel here on YouTube called more top
5 dedicated to the world's coolest top 5
videos at least I hope I've only
uploaded two videos at this point so go
check them out
subscribe to the channel and leave a
comment on one of the two videos just
saying that you're a subscriber on both
unbox therapy and more top 5 and that's
it I'm gonna pick somebody and send you
one of the highest and gaming headsets
on the planet so definitely go and do
that I'll put the link down in the
description so it's very easy for you
maybe we should look at the outside of
the box first to get acquainted with the
game 0 supreme comfort acoustically
ceiling memory foam ear pads that is
good I like a nice acoustic seal 2 year
warranty frequency response ten to
twenty six thousand Hertz it's got a
headband of course thanks for letting me
know three meter cable and they are
three hundred and twelve grams another
thing I noticed is that they have double
XL ear pads this is huge for me I love
over the ear style headphones of the
most and give me the best seal from
outside noise and they also happen to be
the most comfortable for extended
listening sessions whether that's for
gaming or for music inside the box we
have that I just say whoo we have a very
nice traveling case a hard shell with a
nylon exterior and everything appears to
be enclosed in this case so let's go
ahead and open this up a nice little
zipper and then the actual headset with
a little bit of foam on the top so look
at that they fold nice and flat for
travel having something that is portable
is definitely something that I
appreciate and I think a lot of other
users appreciate as well if it can be
small and compact then why not something
interesting about the boom like is that
it mutes when you lift it up so you
don't need a separate mute button as you
lift it just like this it's a little
clip that you'll hear and that will
essentially mean that it's muted so you
won't need to worry and then when you
bring it back down you are back in
action and speaking it's a little bit
bendable and as I mentioned before it is
noise cancelling you have
very cushiony padding here very
cushioning well cushioned padding maybe
and they are big ear cups as you can
tell in this image right here one thing
I will say wish it had a removable cable
it terminates into a headphone output as
well as a microphone output this can be
adapted for console if need be otherwise
you can tell how that will interface
with your sound card on your PC so I
guess I should try them on and see just
how comfy they are before I do that
there's also a hardware volume control
in this location over here this is
important obviously so you can adjust
volume on the fly without the need to go
into any kind of settings or reach for a
remote or anything like that it's right
there on your ear cup alright time for a
fashion show let me try these on real
quick yes
stupid comfortable guys I could wear
these for a long long time they go
around my ears very very well and they
also isolate my own voice from me which
implies that they'll have a great
ability to also isolate from other noise
that's being created in my household and
trust me there are other people creating
noise and I think that happens in the
average household should I just continue
this video with the headset on this is a
utilitarian device this is a tool and
the goal here is to hear as much of the
game as you possibly can
so you want a nice sealed ear cup that
goes all the way around your ear so you
can have that competitive advantage
that's my opinion and trust me I've
tried a lot of different headsets we
just throw something on real quick you
obviously won't be able to hear it
because it's sealed so while you may
hear a little bit going on this ride
together folks you can tell anytime I'm
doing critical listening I always close
my eyes it's how you know it's
mission-critical
all right so nothing scientific just
plug directly into my phone which is
obviously not the ideal listening
scenario for a large set of headphones
or a headset for that matter but I was
very surprised you have a controlled
sound very accurate feeling tight which
is important for a gaming headset or I
guess music headphones for that matter a
lot of people are looking for that flat
response so they get an accurate
representation of what they were meant
to hear I could see that being important
for gaming when you're trying to use
sound to designate the location of a
particular gunfight or something along
those lines
you want something accurate instead of
something that may be enhanced so as
mentioned I do have an extra gain 0
headset that will be going out to one
lucky viewer simply make sure you're
subscribed to my new channel more top 5
as well as here on unbox therapy and
then leave a comment on one of the
videos on the new channel saying that
you want to win the game 0 headset

talked about is going to be down in the
