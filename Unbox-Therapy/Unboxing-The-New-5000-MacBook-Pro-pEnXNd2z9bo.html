the one with the touch bodice the 15
inch model you know what for some reason
this thing has been controversial a lot
of people have made videos I just
received mine it was a custom order this
one has all the specs it's like 5 grands
the worth 5 grand no definitely not all
right but for the purpose of this video
for the purpose of this channel it's an
interesting thing to cover as a topic so
whatever but for the average person
they're looking at this thing and going
why would I get that instead of a used
car and that makes sense you don't need
to be paying this much money for
computing power these days especially
when you're you're looking at a product
that in many people's eyes has given up
some of the versatility of the previous
version but I'm gonna give you some my
thoughts on this thing as I open it up
here why I think Apple is doing what
they're doing here and why this still
might be a good machine for you as you
know with Apple to get a very expensive
unboxing experience as well it's very
special but you can see on the back here
this one 2.9 gigahertz so has the
upgraded processor 16 gigs of ram now
this is a this is something I was
reading about that actually does kind of
bother me a little bit only the ability
to get 16 gigs rather than 32 it's
soldered onto the motherboard now so
it's not like you're gonna be able to
upgrade that in the future so if you
need more RAM it ain't happening here
the Radeon Pro 460 so the graphics are
one of the areas where there is a
substantial improvement and not much of
an argument between this version and the
previous one and I have the two terabyte
SSD in here which it's gonna be nice
it's an incredibly exorbitant amount of
money I think that upgrade alone is like
fourteen hundred dollars let's crack
inside the box here
it definitely feels slimmer than the old
version the Apple logo no longer lights
up it's got this mirrored finish like
the 12-inch MacBook and the other thing
you're going to notice is the ports no
more versatility there you have
Thunderbolt 3 in the form of this USB
type-c connector and you've got a
headphone jack and that's it USB type-c
connector cable the laptop no more
MagSafe that's kind of a that's kind of
a letdown
right MagSafe you kick it it pops out in
technology you're always making
compromises right-size battery life
thinness portability power it's always a
give-and-take relationship in this case
you've got better throughput in exchange
you no longer have the convenience of a
MagSafe connector 87 watt USB C power
adapter that's all that's in there
another thing to mention about this one
there's no more power switch so you lift
it up and it turns on before I boot it
up I just want to do a quick comparison
here with the older version so what
you'll notice beyond the fact that it's
a tiny bit thicker is that the footprint
is actually larger as well
how significant is it not major so the
previous max-flow SD card slot full size
HDMI and a USB port old-fashioned style
compared to two thunderbolt 3s and a
headphone jack and then the other side
of the laptop two USB type-c connectors
for your Thunderbolt 3 and then here
we've got MagSafe 2 Thunderbolt twos a
USB and a headphone jack from a
throughput perspective with 4
Thunderbolt 3 ports you can do some
things that you wouldn't be able to do
here with the 2 ports or with the slower
speed USB connectors yes you may have to
adapt these for your current peripherals
I think it's only a short matter of time
before we see maximum throughput hard
drives and such that could take
advantage of these ports this laptop can
output to 2 separate 5k monitors right
or 3 4k monitors from a laptop that's
one of the benefits of having all this
Thunderbolt access almost a terabyte of
data in five minutes over this port that
affects my daily life whew and it just
boots up straight away it does have
touch ID so you can login with your
fingerprint if you like the trackpad is
gigantic I'm just noticing now it is
clicky
it's clicky and it's loud but just very
low travel right not not very much key
travel there now the trackpad is of
course the haptic version there's no
physical click there you can now use
your fingerprint not just to unlock the
Mac but also to make purchases close it
goes to sleep pop it back open touch ID
oh now I notice I can hit this button
here and expand the multimedia controls
here now this touch bar will adapt to
whatever application you're using if
it's Final Cut Pro for example you'll
see a timeline in there you can get
emoji in there but I mean that's kind of
the thing I think that's going to take
some getting used to and experimentation
to truly figure out new MacBook Pro old
MacBook Pro trackpad it's almost double
the size to be honest measured
diagonally new one has more of a thump
to it also the screens they're both at
full brightness now and you should be
able to tell that the new screen is more
vibrant there's much more detail you can
make out in the trees it's a brighter
screen so now the speaker grills look
similar but I have heard some very nice
things about the sound maximum volume
old MacBook Pro ok new MacBook Pro
there's a little thump to it a little
bit of low-end in there
speakers are way better should you be
upgrading forgot the old one probably
not
you can make the argument it's more
versatile with all the ports that are
available SD card slot and stuff like
that are there some improvements to the
new one sure right you get the nicer
screen you've got all this Thunderbolt 3
throughput if you can use it but this
thing is more than 5 grand for most
people they'd be better suited with a
used car in their old MacBook just
remember it's a 1 it's not gonna all of
a sudden do something for you that the
old one couldn't but that said there's a
bunch of people out there they just want
to have the latest and greatest myself
included they are happy to sell at a
high margin to a customer who has a lot
of money to spend that's their game who
can evaluate value right it's it's so
subjective it's so personal I mean this
entire package is very nice amy has been
in the past but it still is it's a very
nice package how much is that worth to
