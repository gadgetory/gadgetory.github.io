things on the channel wild never done
before world's greatest weirdest biggest
you probably caught a recent video where
I tried to put together the world's
biggest for tonight setup and in that
video I paired together to consumer
projectors to create a large what I
thought was the world's largest fort
night gaming setup at the time but boy
was I wrong because what I forgot about
was a little thing called IMAX now of
course you're familiar with IMAX you've
seen IMAX movies before you've been in
the IMAX movie theater you've seen IMAX
projector 80 feet wide 1,100 inches just
some staggering image they got new
technology IMAX with laser which ups the
contrast ups the image even beyond what
you might have seen on previous IMAX
tech so when they hit me up they're like
come visit the facility and play the
actual world's biggest fortnight I was
like Jack getting a car get the gear
let's go show the people the most insane
gaming setup I can comprehend let alone
actually play this is me this is unbox
therapy about to walk into an
eighty-foot theater just for us
Jurassic world ant-man unbox there
now this is the world's largest
fortnight's setup haha how ridiculous is
this this is 80 feet across plus we have
the sound to go with it
Jack's trying to show you on the camera
this is massive it's for tonight on an
80 foot wide screen now let's go ahead
and play a little bit here the display
here is about as big as a house or a
couple houses so the whole purpose of
having a giant display like this in
general is for ultimate immersion it
extends below you it extends above you
I'm a little worried about my
performance here oh it's a childhood
dream here to play video games not just
in a movie theater but in an IMAX
theater
wow that's crazy guy had all kinds of
gear as well
Oh
ah okay so here's the thing about IMAX
this is like over 20 percent bigger than
your average cinema display that you
might be used to on top of that the
projector tech that they're using is a
whole different level also we took a
short tour of the facility in fact this
theater is at their facility and we got
to see some of the construction like
what these actual systems look like and
the cooling and so on that it takes to
pump these lasers out and apparently
there's like hundreds of lasers that are
shooting at the display to give you this
image so what you end up with through
that tech a greater degree of difference
between the dark spots on the screen and
the bright spots on the screen the
blacks are way darker they they're like
the absence of light so not only is this
the world's biggest fortnight or the
biggest screen I've ever played video
games on but it's also the future of how
you're gonna want to watch movies for
even greater immersion and there's
plenty of filmmakers that currently take
advantage of it I'm playing in 4k right
now on a ps4 a ps4 Pro which can output
in 4k which is of course necessary for
an image of this scale the other crazy
part about this is I wasn't sure if I
should expect any kind of lag or not but
if you were watching my gameplay that I
got a couple of kills I'm actually kind
of surprised at how little lag there is
input from the controller to what I'm
actually seeing on the projector this
experience here is crazy immersive holy
smokes did you throw a shell at me oh
come on there it is too easy
one fish your ear on the podium at least
you can't beat this cheapness man
although anybody watching right now I
was like I know exactly how to beat that
it's not you will you're not you're not
the hero they need right now man
oh maybe you are maybe you are oh it's
so painful to domination</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
