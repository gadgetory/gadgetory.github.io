to announce a new project here on unbox
therapy it's called the ultimate
workstation project and as the name
implies this is about building the most
outlandish most powerful workstation
computer that we can we've got an aging
Mac Pro over there we want to replace it
with something much more powerful much
more configurable and so we're setting
out to do that and I want your guys
suggestions I want to know from you what
kind of components you would put in an
ultimate workstation PC everything from
memory to hard drives SSDs monitors you
know everything that you would need
keyboard mouse I want to see your build
lists don't worry about money
do the most outlandish build list you
can and then we'll obviously edit it
down but this thing is going to be
pricey and it is going to be beastly so
you don't want to miss out on this
project I've set up a subreddit on
reddit because that's where you set
those up and the link is down in the
description and if you click through
there you can actually make your
suggestions in that location in a more
organized fashion and people can vote on
your lists they can vote on your
comments and we can figure out what most
people want to see in terms of
components the series is going to be
very similar to the ultimate gaming PC
so it will be a number of videos
outlining not just the process of
getting the parts but also building the
system and I know you guys really
enjoyed that project so I can't wait to
get started on this one and then
actually implement this new workstation
and start to use it and see what it can
do in this environment in our work
environment so anyway guys if you're a
fan of this idea if you like the idea of
a project like this make sure to leave a
thumbs up down below and as I said
before use the link in the description
in order to leave your comments and
suggestions so that we can figure out
what the best components are for the
entire community also leave a comment
down below if that's a little bit easier
but remember it's tougher for me to go
through those because there's so many of
them and they're changing so quickly so
I really would prefer if you guys use
the reddit link instead anyways that
pretty much wraps up this video thanks
as always for watching I hope you guys
you're a fan of this project I think a
lot of you will be and other than that
I'll catch you on the next video later
