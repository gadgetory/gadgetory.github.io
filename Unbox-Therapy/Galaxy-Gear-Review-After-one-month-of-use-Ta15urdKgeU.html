location for technology more
specifically glanceable data timekeeping
in and of itself was at one time a
fairly high-tech endeavor today
ambitious parties are aiming to carry
forth that tradition replacing old tech
with new stuff and timekeepers with
communicators going forward it's obvious
the risk could play a bigger role from
both a computing and communication
standpoint companies are barreling
headfirst into this emerging SmartWatch
category in hopes of capturing both
market and mine share Samsung's Galaxy
gear is one of the most ambitious
approaches thus far reviews porting
shortly after its launch and many
declared the gear DOA citing a general
lack of usefulness I decided to live
with the device over a longer period of
time before weighing in with my thoughts
in fact I've been using both the Galaxy
gear and Galaxy Note 3 since launch and
these have been my exclusive devices
this review comes from a more long-term
user a convert an individual willing to
give up his primary mobile device for an
extended period in exchange for a new
experience most of all I'm a fan of
technology the future and the devices
that will get us there that being said a
review would be pointless without a
healthy dose of skepticism first off I'd
like to talk about the gear as a watch I
actually quite like it it features a
robust metallic face a securely locking
clasp a wonderfully sharp high contrast
display it seems like the perfect watch
right unfortunately that's where the
positive watch specific attributes end a
key component in watch functionality
over time is battery life of course and
the gear simply can't match its
traditional digital counterparts in this
area that minor drawback though comes
with good reason
the gear is hard to define as a watch
it's actually quite a bit more to be
honest since installing the device on my
wrist
checking for time has probably only
occupied 10 percent of my overall usage
I'm not sure if this says more about the
watch or me and my habits when it comes
to being on time anyways the gear like
many other Bluetooth devices will
require a fairly regular charging
regimen in my experience under normal
operation a needed and continues to
require daily charging so much like my
smartphone this baby hits the wall
socket at night and sleeps on my ever
crowded gadget ridden nightstand but the
gear isn't a smartphone in fact it
requires one in order to do much of
anything what's more it will only work
with select devices like the note 3 S 4
and a couple of other Samsung products
this is probably my largest single
criticism I really wish the gear was
more open possibly sporting a companion
app in the Play Store to access
functionality configuration etc from any
Android device I'm not a fan of these
proprietary approaches for fear that
they'll slow down adoption and
subsequently development for these new
innovative platforms onto something I've
really enjoyed about the gear incredibly
convenient voice memos the gear features
a built-in microphone and speaker
capable of phonecall communication I
found much more use for the mic as a
memo taker than call taker the wrist is
the perfect location for something like
this I've got the voice memo shortcut
right on the gears homepage one tap and
I'm into the interface recording my
thoughts the audio is immediately synced
to my note 3 for organization or
consumption at a later date this is not
a feature I've ever been compelled to
use previously on other devices but for
some reason giving this particular piece
of real estate it seems to make more
sense to me now
anyway addicted to this particular
feature find my device is also useful no
matter where you've plopped down your
phone when you're about to walk out the
door you simply hit the find my device
button your phone starts to buzz and
ring your golden simple stuff super
useful hot features don't end there the
gear brings security enhancements and
convenience to your standard smartphone
experience there's nothing I despise
more than typing a numerical passcode
into a device a hundred times a day
the iPhone 5s addresses this issue using
their brand new
fingerprint scanner but in my experience
this can still be a nuisance at times
the Galaxy gear and Note 3 combo takes a
different approach using proximity since
the gear is a wearable chances are it's
on your body have your watch in the same
vicinity as your device and the gear
will authenticate granting you access
with a simple swipe take the gear away
and the phone reverts back to its boring
passcode locking out thieves or anyone
who isn't you it's an elegant and fast
solution and it's being rock-solid
throughout my entire experience another
simple thing yet incredibly useful not
so useful as being the camera there are
few if any circumstances where I'd opt
to use it over my much higher quality
phone camera that's sitting in my pocket
anyways it's there I'm sure someone will
find a use for it it's definitely not a
killer feature from my perspective
though a twelve-year-old version of
myself would probably think it's cool as
hell I've answered a couple of phone
calls on the gear seeing as how it's got
that built-in mic / speaker combo it
behaves essentially like a speakerphone
it's ideal as a backup when you might
not have immediate access to your device
if you've left it upstairs or in a
backpack or it's deep in your pocket and
you're driving that being said I don't
see this feature replacing the call
functionality of your handset as most
prefer taking their calls in private
there are a number of apps available
notably some watch face variations and
social network integration the
third-party app ecosystem is obviously
in its infancy as a result this aspect
of the gear isn't very compelling at
least for now
for me app installation portions of the
configuration etc are all accessed via
the phone instead of the watch this
doesn't really bother me as I'd imagine
the configuration process to be much
more painful on the gears significantly
smaller display ultimately the goal of
the gear and pretty much every other
SmartWatch on the market or in
development is to bring phone
notifications to your wrist this works
as expected bringing text messages and
emails from your device to this new high
profile location one glaring issue is
the fact that not all apps that notify
one's handset are capable of being
pushed out to the watch for example
Gmail likely the mo
most widely adopted email client it'll
push a notification to the watch but in
a rudimentary form lacking any insight
into the actual message this is hardly
the glanceable computing future I'd
hoped for though I'm sure enhancing the
risk-based gmail experience is likely a
priority for both Samsung and Google I'm
anxious for that to get hashed out did I
mention that the gear vibrates this
might seem like a minuscule addition to
some but to me it's a killer given my
work environment I've often got my phone
on silent or sitting on my desk even
with the vibration enabled on my main
device I occasionally miss calls I'm not
sure if this happens to others but for
me sometimes the vibe function on the
phone is simply not powerful enough to
jar me away from what I'm already doing
something vibrating on your wrist by
comparison is impossible to avoid
I've yet to miss a single call while
wearing the gear the gear features a
basic media controller for content
playing on your smart phone as well as a
stripped-down fitness tracker in the
form of a pedometer I'm not hating on
either of these functions I just get a
feeling that more could be done here
there is already a sense of it in the
gear specific app store though I'd love
to see even more development in this
particular arena like any new platform
adoption will likely dictate the
direction myself I enjoy being on the
forefront but this comes at a cost it
means I sometimes end up using
half-baked devices that are more of a
nuisance than anything else in my
opinion the Galaxy gear is no such
device it houses select features that
have become part of my communication
routine in my case it has definitely
proven useful and relatively hassle-free
a tough accomplishment for one of the
first mass-market devices in this
category the $2.99 price point will
likely hurt immediate adoption that's
understandable but I refuse to write off
the device because of it I think the
gear is a very cool step in a very cool
package could it do more of course the
same could be said of so many categories
ripe for disruption bottom line if
you've got a compatible device the gear
will enhance its functionality what
that's worth to you in dollar figures is
dependent on many factors
being at the forefront has always
commanded a premium and only you can
decide if it's worth the cost of
admission for me it has been come on my
way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
