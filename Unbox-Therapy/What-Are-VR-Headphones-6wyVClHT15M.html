a grooved headband which is tailor built
for VR comfort so that means goes along
with your VR headset and you do need a
decent headset for a fully immersive VR
experience 50 millimeter speakers it's
important for as they call it
thundering loaves an integrated amp

time what do we have here must be a nice
little base for it yes of course

a heavy-duty base so when that baby is
on the desk you are golden even when you
get rowdy this is an adapter for a boom
or mic stand

dedicated mic can make a huge difference
to your streams or to your videos

same setting and Xbox has its own
independent setting and then on the far
