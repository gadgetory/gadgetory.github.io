excited to make a video that I'm excited
about a product that arrives here I
gotta find this stuff that is cool I
gotta find this stuff that you've never
heard about so here's the thing
I've looked at all kinds of speakers
Bluetooth plug-in vinyl record player
speakers with the record on I mean you
name it little tiny dinky ones at at $10
that you use in the shower but never
have I looked at something like what
we're about to look at today this came
straight from Japan it's not cheap but
today we're gonna be looking at the
lyric speaker this is a see-through
speaker capable of projecting the lyrics
of your music onto its surface while
you're listening to it we have some
t-shirts here feel the true power of
music
oh oh my it's clear it's see-through
like you can it stupid kind of like it's
your window on your car has a tint to it
you can see the different speaker units
here this looks like a volume control
I'm fairly certain that this unit here
has something to do with the lyrics
being projected Wow look at that down
firing units they're probably for the
low end now this thing has Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and has an app so the way that
you're gonna feed your music to it is
through the app and it's gonna search a
lyrics database for whatever song you
happen to be playing regardless of
language so hit the Lights for a second
whoa what is going on whoa this entire
thing has lit up now as a display
essentially a relatively translucent one
it's prompting me to set up the speaker
Network I downloaded the lyric speaker
app here so I open the window in the
back because I was concerned you guys
wouldn't be able to really get the full
grasp of just how crazy this is
translucent there and somehow the
projection is in front of that
now within the lyric app you can either
select music locally that's on your
phone and play that or you can play
using Spotify specifically Spotify
Connect which allows you to play Spotify
through network connected speakers like
this one
oh man that is cool
that is that's technology
that's some deep vibes right there
that's weird
I was good guys this thing is
unbelievable that's it that's the bottom
line it's one of the coolest things I've
ever looked at on this desk I don't care
you can say whatever you want about me
everybody in the office has gathered
around to look at this thing what you're
seeing on camera doesn't even represent
how cool that it looks in real life I
didn't know that lyric was that I always
thought that lyric was this playing
classic songs and realizing that right
now it's constantly shifting so the way
that it displays lyrics it changes
depending on the song sometimes it's a
dark background with light font or light
text and then other times it's like kind
of like a scroll it varies so it's
always unique but it's also not just the
lyrics there's other elements shapes in
this case it's dots there's a few
different beams for lyrics depending on
the song that you pick okay so real
quick guys if you have a song with
lyrics unavailable something off of
SoundCloud it'll it'll play some cool
graphics so it's not leaving you with
nothing it's still utilizing the
functionality to create a cool ambience
to go with the song and you can see that
this graphic is reactive to the music
itself
of course it's a speaker you want to
know how it sounds so let's pump it up a
little bit if you do want to send music
to it that isn't through Spotify or
isn't coming from the local storage on
the device you can still use airplay
because this is a Wi-Fi speaker so right
now this is being broadcast via airplay
from SoundCloud honestly guys it's
gadgets like this that are the reason
that I was attracted to this to the
entire technology space as a whole yes
it's expensive I'm not trying to deny
that its ambitious it's not gonna be for
everyone but the sound is there and this
feature it's like nothing I've ever seen
before this thing is gonna have a a
constant spot on the shelf
see the lyrics you sing along it's
unbelievable</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
