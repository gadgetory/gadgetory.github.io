about special days here at unbox therapy
you know it you love it I love doing it
and it's all about this this giant
wooden crate I love a wooden crate a
good wooden crate there's a promise
there inside is something sensitive
inside is something from Samsung they
said hey Moo
you've never seen anything like it well
if you're gonna send me this I'm gonna
do something unprecedented I want to use
this thing for a completely outlandish
setup all right should I just get inside
the box oh this my friend is the CH g90
look at how wide this boxes oh my
goodness Hewlett gaming monitor some
Robocop looking goos 144 Hertz 32 by 9
ultra wide aspect ratio that's a 49 inch
monitor what gaming monitor what HDR
what nu-metal
quantum dot what curve 144 Hertz refresh
rate what Ryan on the couch why that
monitor is cool right is 49 inches
that's super wide you're like oh my
goodness Lou show it to me like plain
Universal wanna know what it's about
let's step it up a notch
now it might look like you're getting
ready for some dental work but this here
this is all gaming I'm hoping I'm
thinking I can mount the monitor up here
and get the craziest gaming cockpit ever
contrived why the lights turned off on
this thing oh and don't forget that it's
got to have the LEDs all right so I've
got a PC hooked up to this but there's
three HDMI cables we could probably hook
up some game consoles as well it's
motorized look at this what so think
about it what better place for this type
of monitor than this type of setup to do
it justice so let's crack open this box
and see if we can get this thing mounted
up skull
whoa look at how why it is okay you got
it
where do you put this we're here haha so
I see two HDMI a display for a mini
DisplayPort
a headphone jack it looks like
microphone in and out couple of super
speed USB ports a PC in as well
all right so I'm in the gaming cockpit
now as you can tell and I just
downloaded pub G because everybody's
talking about it
I'm obviously terrible but that doesn't
make it any less fun all right
oh man I might be dead right away so
it's 38 40 this way by 1080 hi
all right oh yes I'm sure somebody has
some kind of long-range weapon
oh is it dude over there
oh I didn't kill anyone
I'll probably get maybe next time okay
so this is obviously crazy wide it's the
widest monitor I've ever sat in front of
this is 49 inches stretched across a
resolution of 3840 by 1080 high so what
happens is you kind of focus in on the
central portion of the display when
you're gaming your peripheral vision is
also completely filled with the game
screen regardless of the style of game
now this monitor does something else
that's really cool which is allow for a
split screen mode so it does have
multiple inputs I can have one HDMI
input on the left hand side and a
completely separate one on the right
hand side watching Netflix on the left
and I could be playing PlayStation on
the right TV on one side if I wanted or
maybe I just want to watch Twitter while
I'm gaming or streaming or something
along those lines so it's kind of the
best of a dual monitor setup in a single
monitor without a bezel in the middle
obstructing your view this has got to be
close to as good as it gets I'm sitting
here in this cockpit completely immersed
I'm kind of excited to see how this
breaks down for different styles of
games I'm gonna download a bunch more I
could see like some of those aircraft
simulators flight simulator type racing
you could probably put a steering wheel
up in here and have that type of
experience as well and who knows maybe
even for work these guys were joking
around they're like glue are we gonna be
able to get you out of that seat the
truth is probably not let me know down
in the comments which game you would
play first if you were sitting where I'm
sitting in front of this crazy wide
display and also if you want to see more
about this entire set up as a whole just
leave a like down below and that lets me
know
and it lets jack know and then we're
going make another video that's how it
works right</div></body></html>
