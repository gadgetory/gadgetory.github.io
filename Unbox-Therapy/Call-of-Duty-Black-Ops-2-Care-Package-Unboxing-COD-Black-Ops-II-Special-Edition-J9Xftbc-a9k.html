therapy and today we're taking a look at
call of duty black ops 2 the care
package edition just pick this up from
the midnight launch and before we get
inside I want to let you know I'm giving
away one of these care package editions
as well
to a lucky subscriber so if you're not
subscribed yet click that button right
now all you're gonna have to do is leave
a comment on my next video which will be
the official giveaway video and you're
gonna have a great chance at walking
away with your own care package so if
you like that idea definitely leave a
thumbs up down below to let me know that
you're interested in that kind of a
giveaway as you guys can tell this is a
huge special edition for a game and
that's because the game is really the
smallest item in here you've actually
got a vehicle included in this unboxing
it is the MQ 27 Dragon Fire drone which
has a remote control which I'll open up
in a second it's very similar to like
the parrot ar.drone which I also unboxed
on the channel so you've got a very
light construction and this thing is
gonna fly around remain stable because
it does have the four propellers a very
cool inclusion in one of these kinds of
unboxings for a special edition game
very unusual so you got some
instructions here you have to install
some batteries I'm not gonna do that on
camera right now for obvious reasons we
have to get through the other items
included here if you guys are interested
in picking up one of these care package
additions or the hardened edition or the
regular edition of black ops 2 I've got
links down in the description so you can
do that so definitely check down there
if you want to check out pricing and
availability on this particular version
so I went ahead and got the big care
package portion out of the way so we can
take a closer look at the actual items
included so there's a quick look at the
Dragon Fire drone which I'm not gonna
operate right now so I'll put it to the
side now we'll take a closer look at the
remote control for that actual vehicle
you can see batteries are included
there's also a USB cable not a hundred
percent sure at the moment what that's
going to be for here's the remote
control with antenna actually pretty
solid construction here as you can see
you've got a couple of thumb sticks on
there and as I flip the device around I
believe you're going to need to install
batteries in here
as well or definitely you're going to
have to install batteries in there and
there's a little stand to keep the drone
on you know for collectors purposes of
course now here's a closer look at the
game case steelbook style case with
really some really cool look and artwork
on there you've also got these two
commemorative coins which I believe also
have some DLC on there there are some
codes on the others other side of them
so I'm gonna leave them this way for the
purpose of maintaining those DLC codes
so you guys don't jump in and snag them
and here's a closer look at the artwork
want to bring you guys up close and
personal with the actual game so you can
sort of understand the unboxing
experience especially if you're gonna
pick one up yourself or maybe you're not
gonna pick one up but you just want to
know what's included so here's a closer
look at the interior of the game case
you have the game disc over on the right
hand side followed by your usual
paperwork on the left-hand side here
there's some DLC on the back of this
sheet followed by a super simple manual
you could hardly even call it a manual a
little little piece of instruction paper
anyway guys that's been a quick unboxing
of call of duty black ops 2 the care
package edition
I'll also be featuring the hardened
edition and as I said before massive
giveaway this care package will be given
