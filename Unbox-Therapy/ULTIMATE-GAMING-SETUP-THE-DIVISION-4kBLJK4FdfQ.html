another video and as you can tell I'm on
the dance floor today
that's not actually what this is this is
a gaming setup which is outlandish
intentionally outlandish three OLED
displays when one OLED display is not
enough get three there's 65 inches of
piece and powering the pixels is no joke
that's what this guy's for which you may
have seen in a previous video I actually
had to beef this thing up in order to
drive all of these monitors so now it's
running three GeForce GTX Titans 3 this
is about the ultimate experience right
here is a seat where you can sit and
enjoy all of that power and I'd like to
invite each and every one of you to come
give it a try we're talking about this
guy right here we're talking about the
hot new title the division from UBC so I
want to give a big thanks to Ubisoft
for sponsoring this video hooking me up
with the division so I could check it
out virus breakout the world has gone to
 as you can tell from this visual
right here
few people yourself included decide to
pick up arms imagine fail au division
activate at the same time as you part of
the second wave of us going in I don't
know what happened to the first wave but
unfortunately there's still lots left
for us to do vigilante justice the
division that's you now you're a
vigilante this experience right here has
been immersive to say the least because
when you sit here and you have this
peripheral kind of experience where
where the left and right monitor are
things that are happening you know on
each side of your vision it really is a
different type of experience now this
particular game is a great one to use on
a system like this because it is the
latest and greatest in graphical prowess
in order to get the most
a game like the division and run
everything in ultra settings you're
gonna have to have a fair amount of
horsepower as I mentioned earlier but as
you'll see here I've got the ultra
settings turned on and I've even got it
running at 60 Hertz so what you're gonna
look at in this video right here is some
60 FPS 4k gameplay this is like the
Arnold Schwarzenegger of gaming right
here this computer when it's not
actually this this PC when it's not in
here in the office it's hanging out at
Gold's Gym I've played through the first
little bit of the game attempting to
experience the environment to the
maximum capacity especially if you can
throw some graphics cards at it and run
it in ultra mode so hopefully I informed
you guys a little bit hopefully you'll
head out and check out the division I
hope you guys find it as impressive as I
did it really is a unique experience and
if you could sit in this chair right
here let me show you how it looks if you
could sit right here and as I said you
listen you're all invited over as long
as you bring pizza</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
