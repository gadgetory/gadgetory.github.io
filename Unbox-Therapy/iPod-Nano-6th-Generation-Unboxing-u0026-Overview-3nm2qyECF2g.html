your daily dose of unboxings and today
we've got the new iPod nano
16 gigabyte flavour in graphite and I'm
sure you've seen other unboxings of this
device on YouTube because there are a
lot of them and I can't guarantee you
that there's going to be too much
different to see here but one thing I
can guarantee you is this is probably
the only nano unboxing that was shot
entirely on a sixty millimeter macro
lens and that should give you an idea of
just how small this box is so first
let's remove the Nano itself and see
what else we get for our hard-earned
money so we've got the ubiquitous iPod
headphones I am fairly positive that
everybody on the planet has owned a pair
of these at some point or another okay
maybe not the planet at least North
America and Europe from South America
most of the planet anyway not much to
see here next we'll see what else is in
the package and we actually get a little
bit of miniature documentation imagine
reading through this barely old the
thing I wonder what font size they're
using and lastly we've got our
straightforward dock connector and all
these iPods now are using that slightly
smaller dock connector and of course
it's USB on the other side let's get a
better look at the iPod itself so first
we're going to have to peel off the fake
icons which had me fooled at first no
not not exactly that's a joke or a bad
one anyway next we've got this little
tab here that you pull and it's actually
quite a little genius packaging
situation there
boy is this is this thing small I mean
it's hard to believe it's a multi-touch
screen hard to believe anybody would
think of putting a multi-touch screen in
something like an inch diagonal there
you go
exactly as we expected we got our icons
we got our clip we got our buttons and
now let's take a look at just how
responsive this little screen is yeah
look at that it works anyway check out
our channel more new stuff getting
unboxed</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
