brought to you by netflix what's up guys
Lew here and I'm excited to announce yet
another giveaway this one has been
heavily requested by you guys I was
looking around thinking about what to do
for the next giveaway which is happening
this Sunday and the most requested
single item was the new 128 gigabyte
iPad
so here it is your chance your
opportunity to walk away with the
largest capacity latest generation iPad
so what do you have to do to win it's
pretty damn simple just like my other
giveaways there's a link down below my
face in the description which will take
you to the location of my live show my
live show happens on Sundays so this
giveaway is not going to be open very
long you're gonna stand a chance to win

Eastern Time is when it's all going down

great supporters of unbox therapy they
help make if he's giveaways possible so
head over to a link down below logging
to the website get a head start on
everyone else and wait for Sunday when
the official giveaway is going to happen
if you're worried about you know missing
out on the Sunday giveaway or just

well and I will keep those spaces

down below and hey a new iPad for one of
you guys this Sunday don't miss it by
this point in time I'm sure most of you
guys have heard about Netflix and
there's also probably a number of you
that are already members but for those
of you have been holding out there's a
really good reason to join the service
or at least try the service right now
that reason is house of cards an amazing
series that just dropped exclusively on
Netflix I went through all 13 episodes
in about two days they spent like a
hundred million dollars that's right
100 million dollars to produce it so
it's like movie level production but in
a long-drawn-out so you
which is a pretty cool experience so as
I said before if you've been holding out
on trying up the service now is the time
plus there's a free trial there's a link
down in the description that will take
you to that free trial and it'll help
out the show at the same time that link
for those of you that are watching on
services where you can't see the
description is netflix.com slash therapy
I'll put it probably up above my head as
well if I could fit it there so once
again netflix.com slash therapy help out
this show go watch some other cool shows
it's a win-win situation
all right thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
