you guys this sunday don't miss it by
this point in time I'm sure most of you
guys have heard about Netflix and
there's also probably a number of you
that are already members but for those
of you who have been holding out there's
a really good reason to join the service
or at least try the service right now
that reason is house of cards an amazing
series that just dropped exclusively on
netflix I went through all 13 episodes
in about two days they spent like a
hundred million dollars that's right one
hundred million dollars to produce it so
it's like movie level production but in
a law
drawn out series which is a pretty cool
experience so as I said before if you've
been holding out on trying up the
service now is the time plus there's a
free trial there's a link down in the
description that will take you to that
free trial and it'll help out the show
at the same time that link for those of
you that are watching on services where
you can't see the description is
netflix.com slash therapy i'll put it
probably up above my head as well if i
could fit it there so once again
netflix.com slash therapy helped out
this show go watch some other cool shows
it's a win-win situation alright thanks
