therapy comm and we're gonna be having a
quick little showdown here between the
iPad 2 and the BlackBerry PlayBook I'm
gonna do this real quick so you can get
an idea of which one might work better
for you
first the browser test so here we are
loading up unbox therapy calm and as you
can see the iPad 2 outpaced the
BlackBerry PlayBook a little bit now my
page isn't too heavy but there are a lot
of images a couple of ads it's not a
significant win though they both loaded
the page roughly the same next we've got
an gadget calm now this page is going to
be even heavier and it's also going to
have flash but as you can see the
PlayBook keeps up pretty well the iPad
is done the PlayBook still going there
it's done now but as I mentioned before
you're getting flash loading on the
right-hand side of the PlayBook in that
same amount of time so that's actually
pretty impressive in this little unit is
speedy
now the UI is obviously different than
what you're getting on the iPad and that
takes a little while to get used to
using the iPad comes as second nature
usually for any individual who has
experience with iOS devices and most of
us have at this point but I got to say
this blackberry interface is pretty
slick considering you've got to learn it
from the ground up now we'll take a look
at the camera on the backside of the
PlayBook and as you can see it's I mean
it works
you're not gonna use it for you know
photojournalism but it does the trick
I'm gonna do a camera comparison at the
end of this video I'll put the back
camera of the PlayBook up against the
iPads camera so stick around until the
end one thing I did like about the
PlayBook is
that they included need for speed on
here they didn't have to do that I kind
of think the reason they did is because
the BlackBerry App Store is so weak as
far as selection is concerned I mean and
that's another big thing they're gonna
have to overcome getting into this
business so late it's they're gonna have
to build up a app repertoire in a very
short period of time but this game looks
great I have to say the graphics are
awesome and the form factor of this
tablet makes it awesome for gaming I
might even say better if the selection
was out there there's something about
this screen size and the physical
dimensions of the device that make it a
little better to maneuver at least in my
opinion others might disagree with me
but as you can see this game has a great
frame rate and I'm not very good at it I
ran out of turbos too quick anyway this
should give you a look at how things run
you'll notice that the game is still
running while I bounce around some other
features in the OS now that's pretty
impressive
here is the weak point of the device
this is the App Store and as you can see
the selection is smothered in weaksauce
it's really nothing compared to the the
Apple App Store but I mean that's to be
expected this thing is brand-new here's
the configuration settings again this
thing is completely gesture based there
is no button on the front side of it
here's how the iPad 2 camera looks I'm
doing this for a point of comparison
against the BlackBerry and as you can
see it's nothing to write home about but
it gets the job done and here's what it
still looks like you'll notice the
aspect ratio now here's the playbook you
can see it's visibly better I mean again
it's nothing perfect and the white
balance is slightly different but it is
significantly better than the iPads
video and here's a still in a Y format
unlike how the iPad takes stills
anyway guys this was a harder decision
than I expected it really comes down to
whether you're looking for portability
or polish the iPad is obviously the more
polished device but it ain't gonna fit
in a coat pocket and the other thing is
do you need flash if you need flash the
PlayBook is the only way to go and
lastly if it's apps you're after then
the iPad is the obvious choice as always
visit the channel we got a lot more to
look at over there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
