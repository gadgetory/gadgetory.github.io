picks possibly the most interesting
backpack I've ever seen in my entire
life it's kind of hard to explain I'm
probably better off showing you it's on
Kickstarter right now there's an app
that goes with it
you're gonna get a lot of attention with
something like this they're calling it a
smart animated backpack I might even
play some Tetris on a backpack which is
not something I ever assumed I'd be
doing meat picks the world's first smart
animated backpack animated open the pigs
backpack app and pair it okay cool we
can do all this that's a bit of with the
yellow the two-tone this is what's gonna
be an interactive display let the people
know how I'm feeling it does have a
laptop sleeve in it yeah so you could go
ahead and slide a laptop that could do
like a tablet or something these are
good because your back is there so they
should be secure oh they included a
power bank awesome that'll make things
easier this looks like the laptop sleeve
inside okay we have this USB cable which
is the key indicator that something
specials gonna happen here alongside the
app ooh fully charged look at that jack
you know how satisfying that is this is
on now I don't see anything yet okay
application is requesting permission to
turn on Bluetooth yeah of course we can
do that let's pair oh wow okay there's
immediately some options here in the
collection some flames a heart whoa holy
that is C wow that is much more vibrant
than I expected this is a very bright
environment approach that in the past
that's glowing those are that's kind of
cool so those must be little individual
LEDs you see how it's animated there and
let's try the flames out okay
on fire Hot Tamale what about the ice
cream cone this this looks like Willy do
style right here
that's Willy dudes choice Raider he just
wants the ice cream cone try a different
one what's this oh okay this is like an
ambient this is this is the rave this is
for the rave crowd music festival you
guys are in the music festivals will
Jack where were you you were at
Coachella yeah did you have a special
outfit he had a special outfit if you
click over here there's a whole market
cartoons games images you got Mario like
okay I'll get it let's see it's free
they couldn't get the licensing rights
there Mario is just plumber is there a
more famous plumber than Mario oh yes
you know what the youngsters are into
Jack this is what they're into okay is
that a tongue sticking out this is the
one for Haley do right here that's you
right there okay here's the jack there's
a couple of widgets check this out what
are these do enable widget enter your
text okay on box
Oh
oh now you're at the music festival
advertising I send will he do out there
he's like a street team have you tried
the new flavor of Mountain Dew yet and
you tried mount you red octave whoa
so we'll just told me this bike widget
right here it can actually have signal
indicators on the backpack when you're
gonna turn on your bike don't ask me how
that's gonna function it doesn't work
right now probably because this is a
prototype but still that's pretty wild
obviously this thing is probably gonna
expand as the Kickstarter wraps up
eventually I mean there's so much stuff
going on in there to choose from it's
pretty wild now you can also do custom
things custom images or text I guess
there it is
that's my my wonderful creation there
but the coolest part by far is the
tetris game oh baby and it's
surprisingly decent wait I messed that
up ok let me get the hang of it here ok
hang on man let me get that
let me get things going here ok what no
no man no I'm not doing that
you can't hold down you gotta like tap
it this is crazy
oh ok hang on whoa game over you're
gonna get some attention for sure
holy double it's obviously a cool thing
it's a bit of a novelty it's just a cool
thing to have as we know this is a
prototype of the pix backpack but still
that's crazy this is what Kirkwood have
there's a seizure fest Kirk chops you
know you've got to swim you got the
swimming turtle maybe we put a dog up
there for Otis
can we get Otis over here well please
we'll just see we'll see what he thinks
about it no he
Otis doesn't care about it he doesn't
it's not working not that I expected it
to dead emoji melting OH
the melting emoji who knew that's a gift
I would use not something I ever
expected to exist but it does and that's
what we do we show you the world of
gadgets that exist that you might not
expect to including the pics backpack I
have to commend these guys even though
it's a Kickstarter I was a bit worried
about the functionality at this point in
the form of a prototype I think they
kind of delivered it's not gonna be for
everyone but if you're real flashy if
you want to send a message to the world
if you have something to say whether you
want to program your own or choose one
from the little store they've got going
on I don't know of another way you can
do this so there it is
picks backpack check out the Kickstarter
if you're interested and yeah I think
it's pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
