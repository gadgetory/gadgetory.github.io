been construction downstairs every so
often there are noises that come along
with construction they interrupt the
process here what's up guys Lew here
back with another video and today it is
another installment of the doesn't suck
show here on unbox therapy if you have
no idea what that is
go watch the other episodes don't know
why I'm pointing that way today we are
looking at some wireless earphones which
are actually completely wireless
now you're probably thinking but Lou
you've shown us wireless earphones and
headphones before what do you mean
completely well these fit into your ear
canals these guys here and have no wire
not a wire going to the back can you
hear that
see that's the noise I'm talking about
these are actually two little units
independent of one another that go into
your ears let's actually open a box so
these are called the d900 from a company
called syllable and this tiny little box
here houses the goods extra ear tips
this is a microUSB charging cable a
little bit of paperwork quality control
passed fairly recently a hot product
tiny little things here oh cool so the
case itself is how you're going to
charge them up here's your little cable
right here plugs right in that's cool I
like that they charge in the case here
they are right here look at those little
guys now you can get somewhere between 6
and 10 hours of music listening out of
these guys card room at night pick them
up the next day 10 hours is pretty good
for most people so
now that is all never know when that saw
is gonna go off so portability
convenience Bluetooth headset
functionality that's all cool but these
are headphones after all so sound is the
most important aspect so I'm gonna go
ahead try these on and get to the bottom
of it but before that they need to be
paired up now I've been told that the
bluetooth pairing function might work a
little differently because they are two
independent devices let's find out I see
a flashing lights flashing lights are
good when it comes to Bluetooth d900 yes
connected call audio and media audio the
moment of truth okay we're installed no
SoundCloud I will not be inviting
friends today all right you're invited
right now I hear nothing this could be a
problem especially here on Oh
it lost its media okay Media Audio here
we go it was only paired for call audio
but oh I have audio now my this one is
cutting in and out it's weird whenever I
touch this one it cuts out even if I do
this cuts out I feel like it's maybe
weak bluetooth how loud am i talking
right now by the way and a hold down
what both buttons yeah okay they cut out
wait like is it there it doesn't oh wait
still cuts out this is a fiasco debacle
if you will 2d nine hundreds now what
one two three four
I gotta be paired to both oh yeah
yep okay let me try this one two three
four till it's off they go off you know
if they weren't talking to each other or
to the phone AJ then how was I getting
sound at a boat it makes no sense still
cuts out if I cover it
they might suck can I say something else
really quickly the sound is not great I
mean they work with it I mean the sound
is not great I have nothing in this one
no nightmare one was cutting in and out
the sound quality is janky then not loud
enough that's for sure
imagine every time I go that thing
came off again okay hold it for four
seconds tapping four times just reading
this on its own should be enough to tell
you that this is not fully fleshed out
right now plus compressor and air gun
nail gun downstairs happening right now
listen to it the whole point of this
show is to uncover stuff like this I
can't recommend this to you and
therefore I'm gonna have to say that
these suck it's a cool idea we ain't
there yet thanks very much for watching
guys and I'll catch you on the next
episode
I tried I need some volume I'm out later
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
