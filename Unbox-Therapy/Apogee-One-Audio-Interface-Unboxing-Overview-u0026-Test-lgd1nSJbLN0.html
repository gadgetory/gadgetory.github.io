absolutely no surprises we get
everything that we expected to get
inside here is our breakout cable for
connecting audio devices to our audio

this is a surprise has a micro USB
connector on one end
that's right micro just like some of
your phones at an old BlackBerry's my
Galaxy S has a micro USB anyway next is
the least important thing which says
important on it and that is your
software which is probably outdated and
you can get something better off their
website so listen up manufacturers stop

savings on to us save the goddamn
environment I don't know forget about
