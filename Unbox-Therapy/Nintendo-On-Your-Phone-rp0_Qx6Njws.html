than brains he had what's up guys Lew
here back with another video and today
this looks like a classic Nintendo
controller well in many ways it kind of
is but there's no Nintendo logo on this
box right here no because this product
here is from a company called 8-bit
dough 8-bit dough Nintendo 8-bit dough
that's I don't essentially we've got
here is a replica of a classic NES
controller which is now blue 2 can be
used with iOS Mac OS Android Windows and
so on you can use it as a regular
Bluetooth controller for whatever game
you're playing or boot up some emulators
and play the classics with a classic
style of input I've got a built-in
battery completely wireless and another
cool thing it appears to have something
called the extender little stand type
situation for your touchscreen device if
you want to use it in conjunction with
this let's crack it open the 8-bit Doe
the boxy nostalgic whoa I have you know
such positive memories when it comes to
this thing is this did I do that right
yeah Nintendo for days you have shoulder
buttons as well you obviously did not
have those this micro USB port at the
top I don't know
this little guy in the back oh that must
be the extent extender let's see here
way to say ahh

so I got the phone on there - where am i
I'm at high school or whatever I don't
know I'm in the I'm in the cafeteria
I'm doing this everybody's like look at
that guy he's a classic he's got the
classic he must be a classic himself

at it everything old is new again oh my
hitting me right in the fields here
showing it being used with a Super Mario
Bros emulator up there that's cool an
NES kind of color you know that this
color here the color that gadgets all
used to be at one point in time I like
that I like the attention to detail
there a keychain it's got like a little
signature on it 30th anniversary they're
making it feel special for you right
look at that
they've got their sticker in their font
in a kind of 8-bit font start can you
see those LEDs right there jack flashing
now yes
8-bit doe connected now real quick this
guy here will work with a number of
different emulators and even games that
aren't classics retro throwbacks NES
games and whatnot the emulator i'm using
is nes emu and you can see it brings up
some different game pads you can see
mine listed down below i'm gonna load up
a game here double dragon - it's a
banger right i grew up on these sounds
that sweet japanese music that ruled my
childhood that's a banger right here
