not to smoke but just as a problem he
writes the Diogenes Club the only good
time well that looks like an iPhone
10 bucks doesn't it it's got all the
parts there's a phone on the front you
got the Apple logo the iPhone logo 256
gigabytes but then you dig a little
deeper and you notice the P is not
capitalized on the iPhone 10 hmm
these people are unbelievable it's
amazing this my friends is a fake
version of the iPhone 10 which isn't
even out yet but it's party big nah stop
yes good it all looks so promising you
know what it's actually protrudes from
the box like the real one does there's a
little Ridge there attention to detail
unbelievable but what about the actual
device hmm now I'm starting to get
skeptical because is there a notch as
the notch real HT concept 8 they thought
this model was gonna be called the
iPhone 8 okay let's peel this off what
are we doing
wait what it that did not come off
cleanly there's like a film under the
film this is what I'm doing now that
might be a first for me I don't know
what to say that actually looks pretty
good now Wow
model number FCC ID I mean they went
deep on this the edge here is polish
power switch it's a little loose might
be a bit of a giveaway on this side
volume up and down but they're a little
more recess than what you'd be used to
on an iPhone and this is bizarre because
I mean that looks like the bezel there
this is looking like an iPhone 3G on the
front I don't know what's gonna happen
when I booted up to be honest do we have
the paperwork what is that an iPhone se
ah that's the legit looking sim tool
they nailed the sim tool the power brick
pretty standard a lightning cable and of
course the ear pods which again it looks
like they've nailed the quality I mean
it feels decent SIM card tray is over
here looks like the speakers are on the
bottom and I'm guessing this back is
just plastic oh we got the Apple logo
straight away immediately you can tell
there's an issue because of these huge
bezels here Android is starting okay if
he didn't if we didn't think yet but it
was obvious that this was a knockoff
well that's your giveaway right there
but look at this press home to unlock
where is home Oh home is under here and
it vibrates like crazy can you hear it
oh it's like a rumble pack look at that
it looks like an iPhone look at the top
here the cutout the notch for the tent
is there against the background but in a
tiny way the bezel just overwhelms it I
don't know they missed the mark there it
certainly isn't like how they show it on
the box but certain aspects of iOS are
in here in the form of a skin tonight
what's going on here oh there we go so
it's a little bit glitchy quick settings
there what happens if I go to the App
Store that must be the Play Store cannot
connect hmm this device was already set
up oh wow it looks like the iOS App
Store these are obviously Android apps
right
downloading I'd even put any credentials
in I can't get rid of the keyboard there
we go okay
the reflection off the display I can't
see anything
now it is listing the capacities to
forty eight point five six but available
181 60 gigs already used out of the box
do you think I can get YouTube no okay
let's see if SoundCloud is there
SoundCloud is there whoa everything
switched to downloading when I hit that
everything on this page I hit download
on the top and they're all downloading
we're gonna do what even is their web
browser here wow it's a pretty harsh
speaker
that's some crunchy audio I don't think
you want your audio to be crunchy maybe
punchy but not crunchy okay what about
the camera cameras got to be decent
right right
oh my it's so slow holy and the pictures
are terrible as well I mean I don't know
if you guys can tell just how
out-of-focus that is I can't can I not
zoom in anymore what drive me crazy
garbage what about the front-facing
probably even worse
holy they're gonna hear you coming from
a mile away it's not gonna work for Jack
inside pictures he likes to take the new
worst selfie ever what is it
probably point three megapixels this
phone is terrible I hate to break it to
you I realize you got a nice box that
might be the highlight of the fake
iPhone 10 it makes you believe that you
might be in for something interesting
it's kind of fun to make it buzz the
screen is terrible it's so reflective
you can barely see it the speaker's
terrible you don't even have a real App
Store like don't pay for this thing all
right unless it's strictly novelty
you're like ha ha look at me I got the I
got the iPhone 10 look at me you know
you don't have the iPhone 10 it's cool
as a joke but be warned do not buy the
fake wannabe iPhone 10</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
