2014 behind me is the brand new Corvette
which has some very special features
that you can probably see on the screen
there so let's go ahead and take a
closer look so the new Corvette doesn't
just look cool it's also packin some
brand new tech for car enthusiasts the
optional 2015 Corvettes dash cam will
give drivers the ability to turn their
track-day into a video game well sort of
the optional dash cam comes with an SD
card slot as well as a recorder which
will take your track footage as well as
relevant data and paste it onto
something that looks like it came out of
Gran Turismo it'll show you your shifts
and rpms and all kinds of data that you
might want to have if you are an
enthusiast it shoots in 720p and it
includes GPS tracking it will then
output an mp4 file that is washable on
any device that can playback mp4s which
is pretty much everything this video and
data combo will allow tracting
enthusiasts to get a better idea of what
they're doing right as well as wrong
while out racing on weekends or whenever
it is that these people go out to tracks
you shouldn't be using this device on
the road I guess you could I mean I
don't think it's impossible to do so but
I think the idea here is to use it when
you're pushing your car to its limits
individuals can also upload their clips
to YouTube afterwards for bragging
rights over other drivers or friends or
anybody that you might want to brag to
this new tech helps make an already
badass vehicle even more compelling the
Stingray starts at just over 50 grand
which is a surprisingly good deal when
you consider the specs it's got a 460
horsepower v8 that will deliver a 0 to
60 time of 3.8 seconds while maintaining
a surprisingly decent EPA estimate of 29
miles per gallon on the highway so there
you have it a high-tech option for
individuals looking to push their brand
new Corvette to the limit so before I
take off to go shoot some more footage
here at
CES 2014 I want to give a big shout-out
