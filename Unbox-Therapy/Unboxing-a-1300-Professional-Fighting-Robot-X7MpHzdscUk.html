every so often I've said it before I'll
say it again you get something here in
the studio that's just it's not like
something you've ever seen before this
is one of those items this is one of
those moments it's the super Anthony
robot fighting League it's fighting
robot it's all because of Willie do he's
a maniac he's a psychopath and he
arranged for these to show up I don't
know anything about this
apparently you run these things off of a
Playstation controller I'm a little bit
pumped whoa got the signature in the
front with the paperwork you know it's
serious some cabling does he stand on
this I'm guessing that he does and then
super Anthony himself oh man holy it's
like a mini little Boston Dynamics whoa
okay then so when he's not fighting you
give him a little rest this is where
he's gonna be I suppose in the other box
PlayStation 4 controller but it looks
like a like a generic version of one an
easy balance charger couple of batteries
I mean how are these things really gonna
what are we really meant to fight them
like this has a tripod mount this looks
like you mount a phone on there the
visual takes form with the decals it's
like the old days the decals bring it to
life oh look you can train punching a
water bottle does his heavy bag should I
get this charging probably
let's see here that's hang on a second
man what is first of all they're not
supposed to be on the stands anymore I
think you should take your guy off the
stand because he's trying to do
something right now I'm not touching it
him take him off the stand it's yours
oh oh well you're gonna break it before
you can get this thing going
gonna bust why my god just chill for a
sec you know bitch no video is you're
gonna break this thing oh man this is so
cool move slightly fluidly let's put all
the mat on the surface
well folks as you can tell there was a
battle and I don't know where everybody
else went but yeah it was a great time
these robots are a lot of fun and super
cool and that's about oh I'd say about
that all right
that's it see you on the next episode
well yeah I guess you can put
smartphones on their heads I wouldn't
try that they fall down sometimes but I
think that was a user problem they're
different though I mean there's there's
nothing else out there that I'm aware of
that's like these and I'm I'm here so I
know about a lot of cool stuff okay so
they're way more powerful than I would
have guessed I think that they they got
a lot more reach like the arms I would
if I was really you know short but that
the punches I don't can't really tell
they go all the way there like that
right so I could see some good battles
wasn't there like there's like a league
for these things so I think obviously
there's other people that are having
these these battles she's getting down
here battle them I'd like to actually
program to get some more moves right
that's possible I think
right thumbs up if you liked it I
couldn't afford one to be honest with
you you need like your friends or other
people to you know play with it you
can't I don't know I don't know I don't
nobody owns one I would do it if I had
some extra dough lying around but
eventually gonna have to get some more
moves which apparently you can program
these things but don't quote me on that
because I have no idea Pratt put some
time into it which I don't have any of
that either so maybe they'll come down
in price you know in the future when
things are cheaper and maybe they scale
these things nothing against the people
that made these I think they're amazing
units and you know super cool and for
the for the gadgety guy gadgety guy get
your parents to get off our wallets and
grab one for ya for christmas or maybe
think our weapons I don't know weapons
maybe that's too much I don't know guns
or something I guess maybe they got
knives I don't know maybe that's a
little too much noise I don't know what
am I talking about it's just different
they're just they're unique and someone
put a lot of time and effort into
putting these things together pretty
sure they did I want to thank everybody
for being here with me today it's been
tough and I'm just happy that I'm alive
and well and things are going great so
thank you I'll see you tomorrow
I'm not a robot guy just not a robot guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
