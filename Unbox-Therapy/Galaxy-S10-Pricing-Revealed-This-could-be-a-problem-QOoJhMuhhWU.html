the way from the UK you decided to come
for the coldest weather I've ever
experienced in my entire life and I'm
Canadian my beard was frozen dude like
you came to visit the Arctic came at the
same time it's really incredible today
specifically we've got this leaked
document talking about the upcoming
Samsung Galaxy S 10 now on your channel
on YouTube you talked a lot about
Samsung S 10 s 10 uh you talked about
leaks rumors and so on people really
like to see those leaks and these days
pretty much everything is leaked right
it's looking like the top tier Model S
10 plus 12 gigabytes of RAM one terabyte
of storage it's gonna come in at 1500
euros which depending on how that
converts to USD it could be close to 2
grand 1750 somewhere in that territory
plus tax
potentially as well so you're looking at
around the $2,000 mark which is which is
steep 12 gigabytes around you using the
McClaren right now 1 + 10 gigs do you
notice the difference I don't know it's
like okay fair enough eight gigs maybe
like fine but twelve do you really need
twelve no so what is this is this spec
chasing is that what's going on it seems
like dominance we've got 10 gig now we
need to go to 12 so it's just like the
show off its it's the show it's just
what you do now to be fair there's a
lite version all the way down at 749
euros which is going to be 850 bucks
somewhere in that territory so there is
a range being offered mm-hmm but they
all look kind of pricey to be honest
with you they do and that's the that's
the affordable option so that's gonna be
the cheapest one mm-hmm
the 10 e the colours offered for the s10
e an airy yellow prism black green white
and blue launching later mm-hmm
iPhone 10 oh here you can have the 10 e
instead it has one more camera we're in
a state right now
where it's becoming so difficult to
differentiate these things that it's
like sometimes I think the novelty of
just seeing something different is like
oh that's new mmm thank goodness we have
a new thing I'm honestly waiting for the
phone that just doesn't even have a
front facing camera a lot of people I
know actually use a front-facing camera
more than 350 yeah I mean look at the
pixel for example it's actually got two
front-facing cameras but just the one
rear it's cool that they're cutting
holes in displays yeah yeah I think it
looks better when it's not the dual
punch-out but obviously there's going to
be an advantage there you've got two
lenses so you're probably gonna have two
focal lengths going on yeah I think the
price tag is too much man
prices might drop I mean good friend of
mine Dave 2d but he made a video about
the ss9 and how it dropped in price oh
yeah I know you could actually pick it
up cheaper than the one plus it's for
attentively in some places but
discounting after the fact
Apple did the complete different thing
which was like we're gonna keep the 6s
forever
hmm and that's our budget monitor oh
wait that's years that's old if Samsung
could employ sort of a faster
development mmm cycle they could come
out maybe at different price points out
of the gate instead of people because
then what ends up happening is what are
we supposed to do we supposed to wait
wait yeah six months after a phone comes
out but you're right currently right now
yeah the s9 is a great value great value
and like in a lot of places it's coming
in cheaper than the one plus which I in
a lot of places actually beat some it's
got a better display than the one place
in my opinion it's got wireless charging
yeah it's got a headphone jack mm-hmm
which I believe the s tens will have as
well but I'm pretty excited that the
triple cameras I'm excited about
something like about the Huawei phone is
having the three options there that's
something that might be quite cool I'm
excited to check them out I'm excited
chip yeah Samsung of course still the
biggest player in the game what they do
does influence the entire marketplace I
think this if last year was the notch
year this year is the hole-punch year it
is
and we're just gonna have to deal with
it maybe next year they'll be able to
have it underneath the display I mean
that's the journey markets the dreams
maybe that we're getting towards there
so slowly but surely hopefully next year
we won't have to worry about these punch
holes and these notches are you going on
the record here and saying that that
that image that will had on the screen
is that exactly what the s10 is going to
look like I mean did those renders look
very official and I would say that we're
looking at their destiny s 10 s 10 plus
and potentially also another s 10 which
is gonna be the 5g version okay but
that's pretty much what we're looking at
so that's it you just guaranteed it
that's you guys are looking at the
eventual future soon to be seen s 10 it
does look cool I have to say I like it
I'm looking forward to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
