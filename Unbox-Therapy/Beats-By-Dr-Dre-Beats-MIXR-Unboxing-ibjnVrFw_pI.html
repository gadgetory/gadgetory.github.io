therapy and today we're taking a look at
the beats by dr. dre Mixr headphones
created in conjunction with world famous
DJ David Guetta these are unique in the
DJ world in a sense that they are
incredibly portable they fit on your ear
rather than around and what that means
is when they're folded down they create
an incredibly small form-factor
perfect for travel and perfect for you
world famous DJ's that are jet-setting
around the world anyways enough joking
around let's talk about the unboxing the
actual experience is similar to that of
other Beats products you've got the red
cardboard box followed by a monster
cleaning cloth a microfiber cleaning
cloth this is a good time to mention the
fact that I've unboxed a number of
different beats products on the channel
so if you haven't checked those out I'll
put links down in the description or you
can just click on my channel icon above
to go check that out
now let's get back to this unboxing
right here I've got the beats official
beats sticker included in the package
here followed by a catalog outlining the
different beats products that are
currently available for purchase and
below that we have a user manual done up
in the style of a car user manual this
is the size that you normally get when
you purchase a new vehicle these things
are kind of like a vehicle a vehicle for
music and emotion damn I'm on a roll
sorry about that guys anyways so next
we've got the actual headphones that's
the important portion of this unboxing
of course and they're housed in this
very compact carrying case which has a
hard shell within it now before getting
to the headphones let's talk about the
cables because they have included two
cables to give you options on how you
want to connect to your audio source the
first cable here is a DJ style cable and
the reason I say that is first and
foremost because it has a quarter-inch
style removable connector so you can
step it down to a 3.5 Milka nectar for
traditional or basic you know iPods
iPhones etc and I like the fact that
it's tethered there so you won't lose
the adapter it's also coiled meaning if
you step away or back from the audio
source you've got a little bit of slack
there and on the other side you have a
traditional 3.5 mm
limiter connector which will connect to
the headphone end of the chain next we
have a more basic cable similar to the
one that you'd receive with Beats
studios or Beats solos etc you've got
the built in hock functionality which
will allow you to answer phone calls and
also use it as a remote for devices like
the iPhone as well as blackberry now
there is no Android love here it's not
fully supported it'll probably function
just fine but it's not supported by the
manufacturer as you'll see on the side
of the box so lastly we've got the
actual headphones this is obviously the
most important item within this unboxing
you can see they have the beats Mixr
logo across the top of the headband and
here is the unique element they are
rotatable 360 degrees for each ear cup
the build quality is actually pretty
good here most of the components are
metallic and everything feels super
sturdy especially when twisting the ear
cups one thing I did notice though is
it's a pretty tight fit around my head
so if you've got a huge head or
something I don't know maybe I do you
you might want to consider that the
other thing too is since the components
are metallic these might loosen up over
time and form to your actual head
structure at least hopefully so here you
can get a better idea of the materials
in use as I bring you up closer to the
headphones and it all sort of centers
around this circular pivot point that's
what's important here on the bottom is
where your cables will connect whichever
cable you choose to use and I believe
like other Beats products you can
actually output audio through this
separate headphone here you can get an
idea of the leather and padding that's
available on the ear cushion and the
monster branding up along the headband
so here's how they look when they're
fully compressed compacted here's the
beats logo on the side of the headphone
and here's a better look at that
mechanism that's used for twisting each
independent ear cup a very nice looking
headphone you can definitely not argue
that now the last thing I want to talk
about a lot of people showed interest in
this comparison here between the SMS
audio Street by 50 headphones and the
beats mixr's if that's a video you guys
want to see a vs. showdown video
