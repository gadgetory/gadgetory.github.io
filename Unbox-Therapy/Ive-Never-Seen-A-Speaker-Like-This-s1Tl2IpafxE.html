today we've got a gadget that combines
other gadgets I love when this kind of
thing happens you've heard about this
resurgence of vinyl I remember hearing
this statistic recently that vinyl has
experienced some of its best years ever
recently nostalgic component I think the
whole thing is like ceremonial you crack
your favourite beverage you watch it
spin it takes you back like a time
machine to another time and place but
here's the problem you see a record
player on its own not very modern that's
where this thing comes in the seed
turntable speaker it's not all the
modern stuff you've expected a speaker
like bluetooth you know the ability to
connect to it wirelessly but then on the
top of it is also got a turntable a
little bit of the old with a little bit
of the new this thing is on Kickstarter
right now I believe I'll have a link in
the description to check it out here we
go whoo kind of fancy here power
documentation this comes off course
don't worry we'll have it all back
together in a moment this thing is made
out of some solid materials here you can
see that's that's real wood it's got the
weight to support it now here's the
thing with audio there's currently no
substitute for physical form factors you
want that base you have to have the
cabinet to back it up based on the
weight my expectations are elevating
okay that's convenient right everything
you need on their power turntable
control bluetooth looks like a Wi-Fi
button mute you've got the digital stuff
with the analogue stuff very interesting
power brick extension cable the counter
weight this goes on the opposite end of
the arm here in order to balance it out
now believe it or not this is kind of a
technological feat here to have a
turntable right on top of a speaker
especially a loud one are those
vibrations going to potentially leak
into the spinning of the turntable
they've got some spring-loaded tech in
here as well as your counterweight
supposedly stop that from happening
again
we check it out we'll find out over here
you have your power port
followed by analog audio outputs so you
could send this source out to other
speakers if you wanted to auxilary USB
can keep a device charged up if you're
streaming from that device to this one
spit it out as well so that's digital
audio out go to network connection and
then what looks like a Wi-Fi button I'm
assuming those are capacitive touch
buttons back forward play pause volume
up and down in Muse alright so I have
the thing plugged in it's completely
it's set up and ready to go I think all
I have to do is put a record on it so a
little bit of hotline Miami for you guys
here you know look at that the whole
thing is spring-loaded when this thing
is vibrating look at this look I can
that's insane
bye know mode
so you get the point all right like if
you want to have a dance party you're
jumping around these things you can make
it skip obviously but playing music
without trying to jump around or smack
the table or whatever the music itself
and the volume level will not cause that
to happen but something that I noticed
here if I switch over to Bluetooth mode
Bluetooth mode side note very pleasant
voice check this out bass up call you
out of the we're gonna quit the mic
watch
I see the level what am I trying to get
in here cut you're not using the
turntable nice man
over Bluetooth and probably auxilary as
well all of a sudden you can you can
play it in a higher volume kind of more
what you're expecting when you take a
look at the cavity youngish I'm saying
so here's the thing to consider right
yes it plays vinyls but if you're like a
major vinyl aficionado then you probably
want an outboard piece of gear you can
seclude it off somewhere but if you
dabble a little bit this isn't only one
kind of package you know you get a
little bit of both a little bit of the
best of both worlds if you're a guy like
Jack you got the deer antlers the rug
with the lounge chair and you have this
beside and you're zoning the way this
curve happens they say that this shape
on the side here is inspired by
Soundwave
so the what itself has been bent in a
very unusual way I feel like I'll just
keep this thing around just because of
the looks if you're interested in more
info there's a link in the description
go watch my other speaker videos if you
want something to just blow your head
off
go watch the phantom video highly
regarded as possibly the greatest unbox
therapy video ever so if you haven't
seen it yet
I don't know what I mean clicking now
that's what I wanted this episode of
unboxed I repeat has been sponsored by
Oreo they sent over the Wonder vault the
milk Oreo chocolate candy bar so check
it out look at that the king-sized Milka
Oreo chocolate candy bar two
individually wrapped bars in here you
can pick this up right now your local
convenience store the king-sized classic
Oreo check that baby out the Oreo mini
take them to go Oreo thins the Milka
Oreo chocolate candy bar so the king
sized the single size exotic the Oreo
