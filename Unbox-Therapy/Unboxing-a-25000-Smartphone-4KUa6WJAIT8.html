to watch that for the rest of your life
Oh baby that's some kind of hell that is
uh that's in nondescript box that's a
white box there's no label no nothing
it's Willie do he gave me like an idea
of what it is but I haven't seen it yet
I know it's very fancy I know it's very
special I know it's probably very
expensive but I don't even know if we've
got an official price on it because my
understanding is that this thing is just
over the top custom I'm not sure that
you can buy it they custom phone I
believe it's an iPhone ultra luxury is
about to happen in this nondescript box
so here we go okay well that's a logo
not that I know what it means
it looks luxurious though inter locking
Universal cosmic unlock the gates
neverending story type of emblem now how
do you I just oh alright so here we have
a brand on the back golden concept
Sweden holy moly just came all the way
from Sweden how special is this a wooden
a leather cover that's lined with velvet
beautiful wooden box oh man it's like
some sort of mahogany polished this is
where you would typically find a fine
watch or a fine piece of jewelry Jack we
need to be careful here we go
doing this for you
in an envelope first with what oh my
goodness
hang on a minute oh this is officially
the craziest iPhone I've ever looked at
had that is three-dimensional
this golden skull diamond Rose eyeballs
and some sort of reptile leather
crocodile and gold plating around the
actual phone real crocodile this is the
most luxurious iPhone on planet Earth
probably imagine pulling this thing out
like it's not even a big deal like oh
yeah I got a phone call man now it is
heavy as well I don't know is there real
gold on here well there must be got the
golden concept logo at the bottom Sweden
I feel like there's some gold in here it
smells like Cologne
oh this lives out ah very nice
presentation once again power brick
charge cable earpods
for unbox therapy Luis Hilson tiger that
of course is me signed off by the CEO of
the company this is the first and only
sample of our new skeleton edition soon
to be launched this unique iPhone 10s
max is handmade by our master craftsmen
to obtain the most beautiful finish
imaginable with a unique blend of the
finest materials such as a hundred and
ten grams of 18 karat gold 137 pieces of
diamond and alligator leather this item
will cost around 25,000 USD
dude put 25 grand in the mail
that's a $25,000 phone do you even feel
comfortable carrying it's I don't know
to keep your product looking its best
for a long time we recommend you follow
this advice avoid contact with water
grease perfume and cosmetics prolonged
exposure to heat strong sources of light
don't keep it anywhere too warm humid or
unventilated thank you very much
ladies and gentlemen that is the most
expensive smartphone ever on unbox
therapy it's not for everyone it is not
to be compared with your average
run-of-the-mill smartphone because this
is taking on some different form at this
point yes there's a smartphone one here
but it has now become a piece of art I
don't know where to begin
I guess we should boot it up make sure
it's got to be a phone still otherwise
what's the point of all that so as you
can tell iPhone 10's max it does what an
iPhone does this is where it does what
an iPhone typically doesn't do which is
scare you
hence the skull typing on it is kind of
nice put the added weight it feels super
sturdy there it is you saw it I don't
know if it's the most expensive phone on
planet Earth but it's the most expensive
phone ever featured here on unbox
therapy some like this retail for around
twenty five thousand twenty five
thousand USD and of course you're paying
for the materials here right you're
paying for 110 grams of 18 karat gold
and 137 pieces of diamonds and of course
the alligator leather it's a luxury item
it's a bit of fun for somebody who's run
out of fun
