another video and today I am genuinely
excited not that I'm not normally
genuinely excited but today it's another
level we're taking it up a notch and the
reason is because this thing in front of
me the optimist popularise keyboard is
something that i wanted to get my hands
on since i first heard about it which
was quite a while ago this is a keyboard
in which every single key is actually a
display whoa
you can program this keyboard for
whatever you want now this thing is not
cheap if you click the link in the
description
don't be appalled here you can see it's
configured with like glowing pink keys
can be like any number of 260,000 colors
now this will work on Windows Mac and of
course it just uses USB whoa it's kind
of heavy I mean they just look clear at
this point you can't really make out the
displays underneath them so it has the
USB but then it has a separate power
port there let's see if you can make
that oh look at that
whoa whoa here's the power brick and
international adapters ok UK Europe this
guy always gets me going I don't
so that just fits in there like that
that's it that's easy Jack we need power
my friend oh it's coming to life I got
the displays on now I don't know if you
guys can make that out it's so damn
bright in here there is literally a
display beneath every single key wow
it's working straight away - ok so I
finally figured out this app essentially
what it is it's like there's a few
pre-loaded layers in there this entire
display in the middle here it's showing
me some like some data essentially my my
free memory my free space my network
traffic up and down in and out CPU usage
percentage the media Keys show up in the
top section
where things get more intense is like
when you start looking at the Adobe
layers so like Photoshop like look at
that look what happens when I turn the
Photoshop group on you know the magic
wand over here zoom tool stamp tool
whatever you might use is now defaulting
to the entire keyboard space look at
this world of warcraft look at that I
don't know anything about world of
warcraft but it looks like I don't know
potions or magic they even have where
you can like import an image and then
map that image visually across the keys
that's insane the shift button
immediately capitalizes everything oh
let's say I just want to change my
command key right maybe I want it to
look a little different some pictures in
here some options the Apple logo how
about that you put like one of the
YouTube thumbs hahaha it's a thumb from
one of our videos say your Gmail unread
message count in there I suppose the
idea here is you're gonna set your thing
up you're really gonna spend some time
modifying it and then get it the way you
like and then you probably won't have to
be making too many mods after the fact
it's just really crazy to think about
your keyboard as this consistently
modifiable thing at least to this level
here I want to watch more unbox therapy
I mean like I'm no Mavis Beacon you have
to really hit the keys you know I mean
these are shallow key presses right and
the keys actually don't stick up too
much from the actual surface codes math
functions images special symbols and so
on to infinity you ever described a
keyboard using the word infinity before
it's not going to be for everyone it's
insanely expensive but it's a piece of
tech that you just don't see every day
every single key is a configurable
display let that percolate that's what
you're in now welcome to art class
therapy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
