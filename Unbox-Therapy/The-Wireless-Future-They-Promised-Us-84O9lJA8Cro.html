charging you probably don't have it you
might have it you might have a phone
that has it but then you have another
gadget that doesn't everything's going
back to the wall this power going here
this power going there how do you take a
device that doesn't have wireless
charging and give it wireless charging
I got a PlayStation controller over here
that doesn't have wireless charging
today it will with the help of something
called fly charged and this is a
IndieGoGo campaign right now they hit me
up there lady Lou we got the next-gen
thing not sure if I believe you
what's the fly charge what makes it so
different Lou why is this so special and
why am I watching this well this is
faster than traditional wireless
chargers and it's modular so no matter
what device you have you can interact
with it now keep in mind this is a
prototype situation this thing is
actively being funded on IndieGoGo right
now so they just they sent me the
boatload so the core of this system is
this little pad right here now this
thing according to their videos can just
live sort of on your kitchen table on
your countertop if you want to get down
let me show you the way whoa there it is
Oh conductive wireless charging not
inductive so that means metal contact
points will touch this guy and the
reason that's important is because if
that gives you way faster charging than
the inductive variant so inside these
little bags are some different units
that will inner interact with your
devices this is a little pad with the 3m
adhesive I immediately thought of
battery banks Jack's always stealing my
juice look at this it's like Christmas
morning over here cases cases for
popular phones this one is for the
iPhone bingo bango you are also juicing
hard but if you want to use your device
while you're charging this aims to
defeat that USB port but then Wireless
on the bottom oh and it sticks a little
bit real
a magnetic component more bricks more
cases they hit me with the kitchen sink
that typo the first generate item you
seen it before you've seen a case that
you can stick on your phone and add
wireless charging to it
oh yeah here is where things get a
little spicier so check this out
take your sticky and then log it a magic
all of a sudden green light jack pick up
the green light then you're ready to go
on your trip you just this one is
interesting to me because this is if
you've got this wireless charger and
some things interface with it but others
don't it's like what about the things
that don't or what about the things I
want to keep using this guy fits down on
there a USB cable let's say it's an iPad
oh we suck in too much juice now in the
image online they showed like how many
things on there could it be that this is
like a prototype
let me try try try this one the og
working this unit here the one that was
on the top charges all these guys no
problem this one's cutting in and out so
I'm assuming that maybe what am i
assuming that's not good for the devices
so go back to this for now
prototype one of the earliest packages
that are out there so I'm not trying to
condemn it I'm just saying like step
your game up gonna be on unbox therapy
we're gonna try to max out this one to
see where the drop-off point is see how
it's orange
this must be what they're eventually
getting towards because this is pretty
wild we got a lot of things charging
here is it a complete GameChanger me
there's been no prevailing tech there's
been like no one system that became the
VHS to somebody else's beta that's an
old reference where is this wonderful
Wireless future
how do we get there wherever that place
is</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
