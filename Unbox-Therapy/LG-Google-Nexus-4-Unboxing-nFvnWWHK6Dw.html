hands on a new Nexus the next Nexus the
Nexus 4 and the reason we're in this
space right now to unbox it is because
I'm renovating a new office and I'm
actually not prepared yet but this
device is too important to miss so let's
go ahead and unbox it right here so just
like the Nexus 7 you have this kind of
box that you lift up off here and I've
already opened it up I've been playing
with it I couldn't help myself this
one's easier time box than the Nexus 7
but here's the device so I don't try and
pull it out here elegantly there's a
device get a few fingerprints on it
already he does have gorilla glass on
the front and the back in terms of
extras you've got a little bit of
paperwork from LG as well as a t-mobile
SIM card and it's a micro sim this
device came from t-mobile that's really
the only way to get one right now I
don't believe shipments are coming out
until Monday tomorrow people are gonna
start to receive them you got this
slim little power brick from LG pretty
nice USB cable as well as a little SIM
extractor tool in order to pop out the
SIM card holder so here's a look at the
device I'll go ahead I've already got it
powered on there's no sim in it right
now you can see the screen is a big
improvement over the old Nexus which I
have in my pocket as well for comparison
with the Galaxy Nexus of course the form
factor is very similar though and
another thing I noticed is the haptic
feedback on the new Nexus is a little
nicer in my opinion it's different a
little more subtle on the back you've
got glass as well once again Gorilla
Glass 2
see this pattern that you have here it
is a real-world scenario so he can see a
couple of finger prints on there
the improved camera up top the speaker
is much improved much louder than on the
Galaxy Nexus which is important to me
because the speaker on the Galaxy Nexus
was terrible I'm also hoping for battery
improvements on here power switch is
over on the side just like on the gene X
headphone jack is on the top if you can
see that up there go ahead and get a
close up there AJ that's a little too
close and then on the other side volume
rocker as well as your micro SIM slot
and then on the bottom is where you're
gonna find your micro USB as well as
your microphone there's actually a
couple of exposed screws which is pretty
unusual to find on these devices these
days you probably can't see them there
maybe if I go up in the light here and
get a closer look at that
maybe not anyway there's exposed screws
on the bottom of the device which is
unusual so anyways that's been a quick
look at the Nexus 4 they go ahead and oh
did we run out of power oh we did I turn
I think we ran out of power but that's a
quick look at the Nexus 4 I'm gonna be
giving you guys more details as soon as
I finish the new office and I do
apologize for the lack of content but it
does have to do with the renovations I'm
doing I'm painting I'm beat up haven't
shaved
- no shaved November so anyways thanks
as always for watching
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
