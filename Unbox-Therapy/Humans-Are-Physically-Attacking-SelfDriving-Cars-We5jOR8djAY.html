problems in Arizona man wielding rocks
and knives Arizonans attack self-driving
cars did you know that self-driving cars
were under attack no neither did I but I
feel like I'm going to what appears to
be happening there is a resistance to
the self-driving experiments going on
specifically in Arizona there's like
20-plus incidents of people attacking
self-driving waynebow vehicles that are
trying to figure out how to get better
how to improve the AI on those vehicles
to be better self-driving cars
essentially Chillar police confirming to
12 News there have been 21 attacks on
the self-driving cars since they first
hit the road back in 2017 so they're
stabbing them that is an odd thing to do
the incidents including slashed tires
drivers trying to talk to employees and
runway mow cars off the road and in some
cases weapons are pointed at the
company's safety drivers people are also
throwing rocks at them and some are
trying to cut them off or fit to break
in front of them trying to screw them up
mess them up now it sounds crazy
obviously I don't recommend that anybody
do this but the individuals they have
they have a bit of a point in the sense
that this is untested technology those
tests are taking place in their
neighborhoods they didn't necessarily
vote for it they didn't agree to that
and I mean waving a PVC pipe or
brandishing a 22 revolver which is in
the next paragraph and not a great way
to deal with the issue I just don't feel
comfortable with technology long as it's
relatively safe
you know the trial period yeah I'd give
it a shot I don't like self-driving cars
personally but nonetheless I am kind of
interested in the point because it talks
about that one case in which that
cyclist was hit by I believe it was a
self driving driving uber vehicle and
then there's another statement where
apparently a kid playing in a cul-de-sac
was almost hit they're a ten year old
boy it's kind of rough it's like a lot
of other things in life though whenever
this topic comes up of the danger of
self-driving vehicles or automation you
get people like Elon Musk on Twitter
that are saying hey if you look at the
statistics what about human beings are
way worse than the robots driving
they're safer but everyone gets all
fired up when a robots responsible
because there are all these questions of
ethics and decisions and who's doing the
programming who's responsible what are
the rules I don't know if it's a
majority but at least there are some
people who are angry enough to
physically attack these way mow vans
apparently many people feel that this is
out of their control and the only way
they can fight back is is through these
types of attacks but it does bring up
this hot debate in general about you
know the future of automation and AI and
how it's going to interact an interface
with the pre-existing systems that are
set up that involve humans typically
take for example uber drivers obviously
uber is one of these companies that's
testing self-driving tech and the
presumption there that eventually those
drivers would be replaced by automated
versions of themselves and that this
process of testing these styles of
vehicles that the eventual aim is to
eliminate the need for human beings to
be behind those steering wheels right
and so people in Arizona they might be
doing that math and saying hey are we
taking part in our own demise
obsolescence here are we are we
participating in in a process that may
eliminate us eventually I don't know
where I land on the thing obviously it's
a it's a it's an interesting topic of
conversation in a lot of places tech
ecology has eliminated human beings a
recent study found up to six hundred
seventy thousand US jobs were lost to
robots between 1990 and 2007 and that
number is likely to go up as a result
the number of human beings
needed to deliver a particular product
or service has diminished and driving in
particular a very big employer of
individuals in the United States and
elsewhere it has become the flagship
innovation segment for having this
conversation there's another
conversation about like I said earlier
if you're responsible for programming
these vehicles you have to in some way
decide how that vehicles gonna behave in
an emergency scenario right for example
if there is a pedestrian on the road do
I play through this pedestrian to save
the driver or the passenger or do I veer
into this wall which may damage the
occupant who makes that selection is it
the person who designs the software is
that the driver themselves is it a
politician these are tough things to
talk about tough topics now I'm not sure
the people throwing rocks at cars want
to have that conversation exactly but I
think that they sense that there's there
are philosophical issues yeah with these
types of tests taking place in their
town mm-hmm this is definitely a sign it
is I think that there is a variance in
how much trust an individual has for
these various tech companies to take
care of their best interests this
technology
appears to be a really innovative really
cool and amazing and has the potential
to do to make the road safer ultimately
to have fewer people to have fewer
people died in car accidents which by
the way is a fairly big figure and
nobody wants that and I'm sure if
there's someone that's been affected by
that directly they would love to see a
world in which that happens less
frequently if you look at Airlines for
example they're all automated and
they're incredibly safe because of it
we rely on automation and artificial
intelligence and in certain in certain
departments in something like this it
becomes a step more complicated I'm
gonna suggest that people stop attacking
vehicles I don't think that's a good
move but it definitely is a discussion
that that we should be having about the
future of artificial intelligence in
human life and how we kind of navigate
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
