therapy and I'm very excited to unbox
the brand-new ps3 3d display with Simon
technology I'm going to explain what
that technology is in a minute but first
let's talk about what we've got included
we have an extra set of 3d glasses on
the outside of the box there's also one
on the inside of the box so of course we
can take advantage of that Simon also
got a bunch of paperwork for you
bookworms in the crowd just explaining
how to charge up your 3d glasses after
all they are active shutter glasses they
do require power but it is nice to have
rechargeable ones so you don't have to
go looking for those watch batteries so
my samsung tv looks for those the next
thing we've got is an HDMI cable hooray
finally the manufacturer has included an
HDMI cable with your television that is
beautiful I've been I've been clamoring
for that kind of thing for a long long
time and we finally have it you've also
got a copy of MotorStorm apocalypse this
is one of the few games at launch that
supports that Simon technology I'm going
to tell you more about that right now
what it does is it allows for two people
to play a game locally versus mode and
not see what the other individual is
doing basically it looks like they have
a full one player display even though
there's another person doing the exact
same thing to the to the left or right
of them crazy right no more split-screen
no more half display you see the full
display but you don't see what your
partner is doing very cool you've got
the world's shortest micro USB included
for charging up your 3d glasses one
thing I do want to mention is that these
were pretty tight when I did use them
they're definitely not as loose as the
Samsung glasses that I mentioned earlier
that shipped with my television so
that's something to note if you've got a
large brain anyways
the other things here are relating to
the television now and the first two
components here are how you're going to
mount the TV how you're going to put it
on its stand I don't believe the
television is vas a mountable so you
don't have any choices it's going to go
on this stand right here
it actually feels super solid there are
a lot of metal components on here this
piece here is basically solid metal so
it's a it's a fairly sturdy contraption
when it's all put together especially
considering the screw that goes in to
tighten it up at the very end similar to
putting together a computer monitor if
you've ever done that before has a
little bit more paperwork here regarding
the television I'm not going to bore you
with that
and lastly hiding inside of this piece
of packaging the power cable the
ever-important power cable so don't go
worrying that it's not in the box it's
hidden in this portion here if you do
pick up this TV so lastly we've got the
display I keep calling it a TV it's
really a display there's no tuner for
cable in here you're gonna have to use a
set-top box if you want to watch TV on
here which most people have who have
modern HD TV anyhow after you get to the
display out you notice it kind of looks
like a giant PSP with the curved sides
on I actually like the design I think
computer monitors for the most part are
pretty boring so this is a good way of
spicing it up a little bit so the last
thing you want to do here after
connecting the two components is twist
this little screw until it's tight and
then you know you've got a nice lock and
then you just drop the display right
down on the two components you'll hear a
click and you're good to power it up so
I've got my ps3 connected here the the
display is not super adjustable just a
little bit of tilt that's about it you
get too much these days and here's a
closer look in and around the display as
you can see there's a nice look at that
curved edge the controls are all on the
lower right side there is no remote
included that's a little bit nuts but
these are a little finicky to use I'll
show you more of those in a minute but
this display is nice and pretty it's a
real thin I actually do like the
aesthetics of it you've got headphone
out to HDMI s an analog audio in and a
component in that's enough for most
people nowadays but it isn't a ton but
then again this is not a super expensive
television so as you guys can see the
display looks nice as I mentioned before
it's not the brightest I've ever seen
but there is zero input lag now that's
important it means it's going to perform
really well when you push a button on
your controller it's going to happen
instantaneously on the display
so here's more about that menu system
which I found to be a little finicky yet
really would like to have a remote
included with this thing that really
surprised me but anyways you got a mess
around with this crap here and it ain't
fun I'm telling you you gotta kind of
guess at what you're touching unless you
fully turn the display around which most
people are going to be able to do and it
brings up this menu system up here which
as I said before is not the most fun so
get it set up the way you like and then
never touch those buttons again anyway
guys I'm impressed I gotta say I've been
looking for gaming display with zero
input lag that looks you know a little
bit more unique than a regular computer
monitor and this might just be it and it
does match the ps3 real nicely so anyway
