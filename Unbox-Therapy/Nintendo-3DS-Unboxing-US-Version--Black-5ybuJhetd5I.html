therapy calm and I just picked this up
it's the Nintendo 3ds just launched here
I was at the midnight release here in
Toronto and right now it is 2:40 a.m. I
just got home anyway since I went to the
midnight release they included this
aluminum case for free it's the icon
aluminum case I'm not going to unbox
that on this video I'm going to do it in
a separate video coming up after this
one I'm also going to try it on so you
can see how it fits etc so that'll be a
separate sort of unboxing and review
anyway the important part is this 3ds
itself so let's go ahead and see if we
can knife our way in here Rambow this
box you know what I'm saying alright so
first things first we got a bunch of
paperwork up here it seems like the
paperwork weighs more than the actual
product I'm pretty sure they included
every language on the planet in here so
we got me Plaza we got place me we got
Plaza me we got the QuickStart guide
this is the one that matters at least
for me it's in English then we got the
French one and I guess we had the
Spanish one as well here is a
beautiful-looking manual to be honest
with you so in case you want to do it
old-school and learn about the device go
ahead and kick back with that novel a
couple of other vouchers here don't
steal my code and this is something cool
as well these are the AR games these are
the cards that you scan in via the
camera on the 3ds and they're actually
pretty cool keep in mind this is just an
unboxing not a review I'm gonna have a
separate review video coming up real
soon as soon as I get a chance to play
with this a little more so definitely
subscribe for that but this is an
unboxing so we're going to cover the way
that everything looks exactly what you
get I'm going to do some real nice
close-ups of the device as soon as we're
done looking at these cartoony a
archives
you know they look real friendly
anyway next we've got the actual gear
first let's look at the power adapter
it's an unusual gray color actually
but it's cool it's slim you got that
fold out style two prong perfect for
traveling gaming and traveling go
hand-in-hand you know what I'm saying
next we got this docking station and
basically this works like any other
docking station the 3ds sits inside of
it and this one actually has a flip-down
panel on the back so you can actually
insert and pull out games while it's in
the dock so that's pretty cool and now
the most important item in here the 3ds
itself neatly packaged of course I got
the black version a lot of people on
YouTube seem to have the aqua version
wow I just wasn't feeling that anyway it
feels nice in a hand so far it is super
glossy I mean this is mega gloss
this is gloss on top of gloss you know
what I'm saying
but it feels real sweet this joystick on
the left-hand side feels real smooth and
the fit is nice in the hands as for sure
so we got all of our usual switches in
the places you'd expect them to be on
the back we've got our shoulder buttons
as well as our stylus because he just
wouldn't be a d/s without a stylus and
we've got our slot to insert games up on
the top there I'm going to getting
closer to give you guys a better look at
some of these ports and switches let's
take a look so there is the SD card slot
as well as the volume switch volume
switch up and down straightforward stuff
here is the SD slot which actually comes
with a 2 gigabyte SD card installed so
that's pretty sweet to Toshiba card in
case you care as we move around the
device we've got like I said our
shoulder buttons that stylus that I just
pulled out I'm going to go ahead and
pull it out again this time in close-up
mode
there you go exactly what you'd expect
slot for games and we've got our
charging port and our right shoulder
button on this side here we got our
wireless switch as well as our 3d switch
which you probably won't use unless the
screens flipped open but you actually
can access it without get your headphone
jack your power LED you're charging LED
so here's the front side of it you see
we've got all of our switches where you
expect them to be our power button I'm
not sure if this has any power and our
regular X Y a B stuff oh yeah there you
go we got our blue LED on the front and
look at that we booted up get a bunch of
languages to choose from it's going to
be a tough one to review because I can't
really show you the 3d but anyway I'm
gonna do a full review this was just the
unboxing be sure to subscribe I'm going
to go over everything
Oh as well I'm going to do a video
exclusively on this case it's the
aluminum icon case and stay tuned for
that as well</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
