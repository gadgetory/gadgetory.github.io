give you a quick update as far as what's
going on on the channel it's been like a
week since I've uploaded any content and
I know a lot of you are hungry for some
new stuff truth is I've been sick for
like a week as you can probably tell my
voice is not even 100% back right now
but I am feeling a little bit better if
for those of you that follow me on
Twitter you already know the deal I've
been complaining about being sick for a
while now if you don't follow me on
Twitter that's the best way to keep up
to date and also to get in contact with
me with questions and things like that
that's twitter.com slash unbox therapy
but anyways yes today I am feeling a
little bit better this was like some
beast of a cold I mean it lasted forever
and really destroyed me
maybe it was more than a cold who the
hell knows but I am feeling better next
enough about that in terms of content
I'm on my way over to my mailbox right
now because I am expecting some new
exciting product to be there hopefully
it's something worth sharing with you
guys but I'll share it nonetheless what
I'll do is I'll pick up the product take
a trip back home and then give you guys
a quick unboxing preview let you know
what's coming up on the channel and I've
even got one surprise I have a product
already at my house that is a retro
product re unboxing a revisitation of a
product if you have any guesses as far
as what it might be I mean we're talking
a way back playback here we're going
back a number of years anyways you have
any guesses of what it is let me know
down in the comments section and if you
have any questions about the giveaway
once again the best way to get at me is
on Twitter at the address I mentioned
before and other than that let's
reconvene back at the house and take a
closer look at whatever I pick up in a
few moments all right see you guys a
quick second so probably the most
exciting for you guys it's going to be
the Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime this
is their latest tablet you've probably
already heard of it but a super thin
super powerful quad-core blah blah blah
that's gonna be coming up on the channel
I'm sure a lot of you gonna be
interested in that we've also got
something from newer technology yes he
looks like a regular wall socket but it
isn't
it's got USBs built-in with these little
retractable doors so you could charge
your different USB devices without the
need for your power brick you can do
that right on your wall I'm gonna have
to test out my electrician skills and
get this baby and stuff but now I heard
it's really easy so it shouldn't be too
hard and then next I got a big stack of
color shields from bricks in you guys
know I love these things there's
everything from the white to the green
and also the pink caller yeah they say
they set these out to me these are
actually for you guys we're gonna do a
massive sort of color shield giveaway
I'll probably do them on Twitter give
them away individually probably do some
trivia on either Twitter or Facebook or
maybe both hey if you don't follow me in
those places please do so it's
twitter.com slash on unbox therapy and
facebook.com slash unbox therapy I'm
also on Google+ I'll put all my social
links down below in the description and
as I mentioned before we're going to
giveaway I don't know it looks like
about a dozen of these things on those
different social networks so definitely
link up over there and in terms of that
what is it that surprised the unboxing
of the retro product I'll give you guys
a quick peek another quick hint but now
you give the whole thing away hang on
one second alright guys so here's your
hint this is the retro package right
here is this all you're gonna get to see
this little glimpse go ahead and throw
your guesses down below in the comment
section as far as what this is it should
be a lot of fun to get inside and take a
closer look at I'm gonna get to work get
to all these different unboxings and
I'll see you guys on the channel real
soon alright subscribe later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
