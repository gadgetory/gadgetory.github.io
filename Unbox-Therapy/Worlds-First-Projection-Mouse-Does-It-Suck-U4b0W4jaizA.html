unusual it's called the Oden world's
first projection mouse I don't have a
problem with my mouse or trackpad or
anything like that but sometimes I'm
just looking around and I'm like there's
some new tech right there maybe it's
interesting I'm not really sure I gotta
check it out I got to find out more
importantly if it's any good
or if it sucks so the world's first
projection mouse let's find out together
it's from a company I haven't heard of
called Seraphim my first time using one
your first time seeing one it kind of
looks like a transformer as well it's a
good thing I think maybe advantage is
its small oh it is very small actually
look at that thing
that's the mouse definitely each
transformer like some red cutouts on the
front and then on the back is where the
microUSB part is so this end here is
gonna plug in right over here and
supposedly what happens is this little
guy sits in front of wherever you want
your trackpad to be and then projects it
onto the desk so let's go ahead and grab
this laptop here oh wow
that dude booted up right away okay so I
have it plugged in now and I don't know
I mean oh my oh all right it's actually
not bad ooh I don't know guys
ah it's mostly it's a precision thing
like it works but I like how it makes a
little clicking like the dude winks when
you click down I mean it's usable it's
hard to really compare it to a real
trackpad in what kind of scenario would
you need something like this as opposed
to a traditional Mouse I don't really
know and also the surface you're
projecting onto is gonna make an impact
to a certain extent because if it's a
slick surface you'll probably slide a
little bit better than if it's a rough
one it just doesn't really have the
precision for me oh this is kind of
frustrating be honest now maybe if you
went up here kind of adjusted the
sensitivity you could maybe dial it in a
little bit
better don't know if it was slower would
it be yeah I mean it works it's not as
good as an actual trackpad I mean it
would have to be quite good for it to be
cool in my opinion
it would have to be so such a
substantial improvement that you would
like to use it over whatever you have
built in or over a standard Mouse that
cost a couple dollars is it cool yeah of
course look at that and he's like a red
laser I mean it looks incredibly cool
that you would want to try that I'm sure
but uh I don't want to really shut the
guys down too much after all they claim
it's the world's first it's kind of
interesting I like new technology plus
it looks like a transformers has got to
be points for that
it's claiming to be a mouse it's
claiming to displace this product that
everybody's super familiar with you have
one on your desk or maybe you have a
trackpad you're very familiar claims
that it's gonna displace that it's
calling itself a mouse yet it doesn't do
that job better than the other stuff
that's already out there so I mean I saw
this on Amazon I was skeptical but of
course the only way to truly know is to
order it and test it yourself the thing
is cool right I mean it looks like a
transformer it's got to get cool points
for that alone but the question that you
want answered is does it suck it
probably does if you bought this thing
you would probably be disappointing you
probably would hope that it would
perform as well but with the new tech
you let me know in the comments my
evaluation it ain't that good I'm gonna
say it probably sucks you tell me that's
what the comments are for Merry
Christmas oh yeah right
