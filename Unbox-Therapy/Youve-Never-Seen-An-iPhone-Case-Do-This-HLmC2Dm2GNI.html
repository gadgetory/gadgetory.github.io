call pom gives me a call he says listen
I'm out I'm at the store and I see
something that you need to know about
not just you Lu but the audience the
entire the world needs to know that this
thing exists and I'm like Tom what could
it possibly be he responds the Scuderia
Ferrari black fragrance spray hard case
for iPhone it's shocking I know
I told the man to buy it so I could
bring it to you there are big
announcements that happen in the tech
and gadget world then there's other
things that fly under the radar it's not
a new phone it's not a new laptop it's
not a drone it is enough
an unbelievable achievement this case
that goes on your iPhone gives you
access to Cologne
whenever you might need it it's kind of
kind of person I've got to have listen
I'm not here to judge but if you're the
kind of person that needs that potential
I never I mean I've looked at all the
weird cases that exist on a planet this
might be jacket it's the weirdest
probably the weirdest I've looked at
cases that have weapons in them tools
case with headphones built into it case
you could light a cigarette with or
anything else to that matter this is the
weirdest not only that but it's for our
heat system so somehow this thing goes
on your phone and sprays cologne and
it's refillable and it's Ferrari and
that's what's happening here and you can
thank Tom for this video an official
Ferrari licensed product look at that
it's got the badge on it now it is
refillable also because I know that's
another question that you had you were
like but Lou what happens when I'm all
out of my friends people around me they
start to expect that fragrance how do I
get it back in my case I can smell it
already
oh my goodness that's kind of heavy to
excess so this entire place smells like
us right I can hardly breathe
whoo it's not a bad smell I guess you
got to take it easy though see my
problem is I assume if you've got a case
with Cologne in it chances are you're
you're a little abundant with the
application so you press your Oh
wait a sec is there some already in here
look at that made in Italy
you didn't expect to see that Jack ah so
they give you two you've got two
different little packs 25 milliliters
each the phone will clip on I've got an
iPhone 6 here this one is 4 6 or 6 X yes
Oh Steve I just I don't really get it do
you need the Cologne on you at all times
I mean this is bigger than like a multi
battery case well you like you're always
loaded up with cologne like how what
level do you need to keep it okay I'm
getting nauseous right now I'm good
you're gonna smell this brother there
you go this whole place is going to
smell like Ferrari cologne now we'll
never get rid of it and like I don't
think it smells bad but isn't it the
kind of thing you spray it in the
morning I got to be honest I don't wear
Cologne so I'm obviously not the target
market it smells like it smells like
waiting in line to get into a club
couple of shots oh look at how recess
the camera is I find it hard to believe
that's even going to work correctly let
me check works just fine let's try to
light those all right the immediate
function still is the phone still
function feels really bizarre holding it
it is the fattest case I've ever put on
an iPhone and for the weirdest reason 3
2 1 boom it does fighter pretty far
though I do have to say this thing is
inside of stores right now
humans are buying it
can you have a responsibility as a human
to be aware the dangers that are out
there let me give you a little shot here
you go on your way out here you go this
is for you
I apologize this is as close as you'll
ever get to smelling it I don't actually
want to spray it over one when I bring
it off</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
