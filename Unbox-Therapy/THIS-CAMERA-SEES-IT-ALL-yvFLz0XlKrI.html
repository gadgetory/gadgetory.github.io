another video and today I'm very excited
to be looking at what we must be one of
the first all-in-one pack 4k 360 cameras
I mean look at it you can this thing is
unusual
after I've unboxed this and used this I
will have a separate upload in full 360
so you can experience what this looks
like a lot of people don't know that
YouTube supports 360-degree video but
one of the drawbacks has been the fact
that it's relatively low res on some of
the pre-configured packaged 360 cameras
this changes that because this has 4k
now so you've got more resolution to
work with hardly ever a bad thing shall
we do the dance now it looks like this
is also a little bit rugged it says 2
meters 6 foot shockproof freeze proof to
minus 10 degrees Celsius dust proof
splash proof she also got NFC Wi-Fi
built-in and 12 megapixel CMOS sensor so
this is the core of what's going to make
up your 360-degree image is these 2 SP
360s look at those guys that is a
substantial unit what I like immediately
nice tactile legit buttons not a
touchscreen so you can switch the mode
this looks like a menu button big red
record button and then a Wi-Fi button as
well and it feels rugged an NFC logo so
it does support NFC I'm assuming that's
going to be to pair it up to your
smartphone a standard tripod mount in
this location here HDMI out a USB to
charge it up as well as a micro SD card
slot and it also looks like a couple of
microphones on the top so this is
interesting it looks to me like there's
multiple mic points on this unit here
now it opens up on the bottom looks like
the battery just slots in so that's one
that's two who knows maybe one day all
of your unbox therapy videos will be in
360 and if you want to spin the camera
around and see Jack then
can or can you this is a little
microfiber cleaning cloth for your
lenses look at the size of those lenses
I mean you're gonna need it a dedicated
charger you can have it just charging
through this and keep an extra battery
charge that way a standard power brick
with USB on one end 1250 milliamp hours
two of them two cameras makes sense a
place to keep everything ooh and there's
your micro USB cable
nice little spherical lens cap oh wow if
you wanted something even more rugged
you would screw this one on to protect
the lens itself that's interesting so it
looks like we've got three of these
little units now let's go ahead and look
at the accessories box over here this
looks like you could mount it on a drone
if you want to do that would be nuts
mounting this thing on a drone 360 in
the sky what are you a bird now this
looks like a suction mount here's a
remote that straps to your wrist like a
watch and has complete controls for the
actual camera this guy allows you to
mount the cameras back-to-back and that
is a robust selfie stick by the way
that's like the police officers in
certain parts of the world they walk
around with these babies like this but
they ain't taking pictures you have a
dual tripod mount so this is going to be
to mount up both of the cameras check it
little door and you go ahead and tighten
that up whoa
360 time oh my goodness that thing is no
joke I'm into this it really kind of
gone after it with a different approach
if you're wanting to see footage a video
will be available for you to watch and
really experience at the 360 thing in
this case in far better resolution than
what's been available at least to me in
the past so definitely go and check that
out
perfect pitch black Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
