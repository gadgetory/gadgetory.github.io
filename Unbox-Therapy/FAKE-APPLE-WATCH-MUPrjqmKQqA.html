another video and today I've got
something unexpected this is a knockoff
fake Apple watch now obviously there's
no real Apple watch yet but I guess
based on the designs and the pictures
they were able to create this replica
and it actually works with Android
pretty interesting came all the way from
China and I've actually got an extra one
over here so I don't know I'll probably
give that away just make sure you're
subscribed here on YouTube and then
follow me on Twitter as well i'll put a
link down in the description but anyways
let's take a look at this knockoff Apple
watch as you can see on the front here
you have a music player built-in micro
USB notifications and hands-free comes
in a number of different colors and on
the back you just have some more product
specifications so let's go ahead and
open it up and the first thing you are
greeted with is the actual fake Apple
watch I'm go ahead and slide this baby
out so there you have it you can see it
has a sticker with the icons on the
front as you've seen from the various
Apple Press photographs and it looks to
have a slightly smaller screen with a
slightly larger bezel but otherwise you
have a very similar design even with
this little knob spinny wheel on the
side which is also clickable and then a
power switch and oh it actually works it
has some battery life with Chinese
writing not the most helpful for me
surprisingly snappy though look at that
anyways what do you really expect here
from a knockoff Apple watch let's see
what it looks like mounted on my wrist
because after all that's that's the key
factor here when you're dealing with a
fake Apple watch at least you can figure
out what it looks like mounted up
because that might give you some insight
into what the actual Apple watch is
going to look like
you know I'm on the second last notch
here on this watch band there you go
that's what it looks like mounted up not
too shabby actually I was worried that
this design was gonna look very dainty
and small on my wrist but pretty good
actually
Oh behavior is a little bit strange only
works part of the time but I really got
to figure out how to change the language
here settings let's look at the other
items inside the box here we have a
charging cable here USB on one end and a
little tiny power adapter on the other
end thank you for choosing our aw0
8 devices you can read the manual a
comprehensive understanding of the use
of equipment in fact with a taste of the
function and simple method of operation
the charge hole it has a charge hole
doesn't keep out the hole while calling
ah
these are comedy on their own but the
fact that we have English instructions
would lead me to believe that I can set
this thing up for English so tell me how
people that's not how to do it settings
language I did it I did it not sure how
but I have done it folks
okay so I've grabbed some other smart
watches for size comparison and I've
even got the old-school iPod Nano as a
watch in a watch strap I don't know if
you guys remember this but this was what
people were doing before there was such
a thing as a smart watch so here it is
up against the LG G watch R and as you
can tell the G watch R is a little bit
bigger a little bit thicker as well of
course the quality on the G watch are
significantly better it is a Finnish
official product and not a knockoff here
it is up against the original LG G watch
now those are almost identical of course
in the Apple watch face fake Apple watch
face is more of a square
paired to more of a rectangle on the
original G watch in this case the
original G watch is a little bit slimmer
than the knockoff Apple watch as you can
see I'll flip them on the side so you
can hopefully appreciate that they're
not the original iPod Nano but the
original iPod Nano watch and
comparatively they're almost exactly the
same hmm Apple drawing some size
inspiration from one of the iPod nanos
of course that's gonna be quite a bit
thicker and heavier because you've got
this crazy watch band around the actual
Nano so we have a pedometer we have
Bluetooth a dialer phonebook a notifier
music messaging anti lost sometimes the
buttons don't register but when they do
it's snappier than I expected it to be
you would assume that the wheel would
work in these menus which it doesn't
what it was it's scrolling then LCD
backlight so you're obviously looking at
a very rudimentary SmartWatch here
there's no wireless charging it's not
anywhere as fancy up or refined as the
actual Apple watch will eventually be so
the watch face is adjustable by swiping
right to left so if you want to fool
your friends scam your friends at school
tell them you got the hot new Apple
watch and wear this thing on your wrist
just don't let them actually look at it
and examine it but you could be the cool
kid in school for about five minutes
anyways so there you have it the
knockoff or fake Apple watch before
there's even a real Apple watch on the
market it's actually quite amazing what
they're capable of that they can
manufacture these things before there's
an official product on the market but
hey who knows they get their hands on
diagrams or drawings or maybe they just
fabricate these things based on the
pictures that are out there who really
knows anyway pretty cool as a
collector's item probably not going to
be wearing it everyday but I might want
to fool a few people and rock it to some
different events and see if I get people
asking hey what is that dude you
shouldn't have that yet
as I mentioned I've got an extra one in
this box here still in the awesome
straight from China packaging so if you
guys want me to give this away let me
know on Twitter make sure you're
subscribed here I'll put my Twitter link
down in the description and that wraps
this up that's about all I've got to say
about this so thanks as always for
