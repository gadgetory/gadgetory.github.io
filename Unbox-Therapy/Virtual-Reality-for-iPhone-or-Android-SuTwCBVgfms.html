another video and today we're gonna talk
about virtual reality probably heard
about it you seeing these big elaborate
setups you know there's things that
might have been holding you back from
experiencing both VR or even spherical
360 video the oculus is expensive
requires a PC the HTC vive is also
expensive and you might not have a
galaxy s7 or otherwise so how do you do
it
where's the like Universal approach for
this thing and that's where this product
merge virtual reality comes in this guy
is going to be able to accommodate most
phones on the market capable of viewing
spherical 360 video and doing some of
the cool VR functionality that you can
now get on iOS and Android so you see on
the side here games 3d movies spherical
or 360 videos augmented reality
