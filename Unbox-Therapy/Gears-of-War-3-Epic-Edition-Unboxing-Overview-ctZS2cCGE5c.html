therapy today is September the 20th 2
a.m. this is the street date for Gears
of War 3 I've got the epic Edition here
and it's time for you guys to find out
what it's all about and what better
place to do it then right here on unbox
therapy where we get you closer than the
human eye this is going to be one hell
of an unboxing there's a lot included in
here and it's going to cost you I mean
you pay extra for this kind of stuff but
if you're a big video game head and
you're going to want to have this stuff
and you're going to appreciate the
amount of work that goes into this kind
of stuff so let's get you close let's
get started so first we had the art book
followed by the actual game package
which has some weight to its I know
that's where a lot of the goodies are
hiding
we even got special foam in here and
here is the figurine as I'm supposed to
call it this thing is heavy duty it
weighs like five pounds and that's how
you know it's got to be quality and as I
hear it's actually all hand-painted I
don't know if anyone can verify that but
look at this this is by far I mean I've
unboxed a few special and limited
editions this is by far the best
figurine that I have handled I don't
know who manufactures it but they're
doing something right look at this we
even got a weapon in its own bubble wrap
hidden in his groin area that's where
you should keep a weapon like this look
at that thing all detailed and whatnot I
mean it even tells you how you got
instructions for how to put the gun
where this guy needs it pretty awesome
stuff so I believe you just insert it in
the front here hopefully I don't make a
fool of myself I don't know much about
figurines there we go look at that as
where it's it's a beautiful weapon there
and guys man I can't I can't really
portray this to you in video I'm going
to try I'm gonna get you as close as I
possibly can now you think this is close
here I'm going to get you
even closer but look at his stuff the
detail is just unfreakin real I mean I I
can't get over it I got I don't normally
get excited about figurines I'm excited
about the the dudes got dirt in his
fingernails come on guys round of
applause for these people this thing is
extreme and I guess this is why you paid
a big buck somebody had to put the
effort into this thing I'm glad it
wasn't me I mean I'll edit videos and
whatnot but damn give me a tiny little
paintbrush and I'm useless so like I
said real impressed here and and and
this isn't the end of it I mean we got
more it's not just about this guy you
know that you're going to set up
somewhere nice so people can admire it
there's also more extra stuff including
downloadable content so let's get into
the game portion itself and like I said
it's got some serious weight to this box
here and it's also got like a really
nice texture I mean it almost feels kind
of like leather ish but not quite it's
smoother so I mean this is a super nice
game case a real good place to keep your
game so the first thing we see is the
disc itself and it's in its own plastic
case in case you want to store it like
that I mean you will store it like that
but in case you want to put on your
shelf like that I guess I should say
there's the game disc and some more
paperwork
we got a mini manual here the good old
one page with a fold and then we got
that DLC love and that's always a big
deal because you know when you pay a
little extra for these versions you want
to get some extra in-game content and
we've got Gears of War stickers so you
can be a proud fan stick those in public
places if you just want to sort of let
people know what's up alright I didn't
endorse that so the next thing we got is
the flag a commemorative flag here and I
believe this is where all the other
extra content is hiding too so there you
go just like you see in those movies
when people have the old military boxes
they've always got the flag and then
some extra pictures and commemorative
items are in here to even make the notes
look like they're written with in pen I
mean
this stuff is serious this is real
serious we've got the last will and
testament in here signed in everything
Jonathan Phoenix on there dr. Samuel
Ennis as well we've also got a note from
dad in there and look it's even got the
fake ink blotches this shit is
legitimate what else is in here we've
got I believe this is another picture
yeah this is another picture with a
little love note on the back for all you
romantic I don't know if gamers are
romantic let me know if you're romantic
anyways that we've also got some weapon
plans I believe it is or yeah we've got
some drawings here some technical
drawings and that's of the h OD the h OD
schematics and lastly we've got the
Octus metal for professor Adam Fenix
there you have it
so I believe that's everything as far as
extra paper material is concerned and
lastly we've got this metal here it's
like a commemorative medal of course and
again it's got some nice weight to it
you know they didn't cheap out this is
definitely not plastic this thing is
legitimate metal look at that for
service to humanity that thing is
engraved in there dr. Adam Fenix and on
the other side we've got property of
coalition of order ordered governments
there you go and look at that we've even
got a serial number edged in there that
is unreal I feel like I'm I feel like
I'm taking part in something special
here this is a special event crazy stuff
anyways if you're wondering why I'm a
little I'm a little out of it right now
it's because it's 2:00 in the morning I
got this at the midnight lunch so I got
back here and I got straight to work so
here's that art book and you know I
really like these books helps you really
appreciate the amount of effort and time
that goes into these games man people
live and breathe this stuff for months
and years and and it's all for your
entertainment so you know you get some
books like this and it really
build that appreciation for the industry
you know so I like that stuff I like to
have that stuff so anyways guys I just
wanted to tell you that that's not all I
picked up I also got the Gears of War 3
special edition limited edition system
we got the throat communicator for Gears
of War 3 we also got some DLC from
Gamestop so that stuff I'm gonna get
working on that right now
