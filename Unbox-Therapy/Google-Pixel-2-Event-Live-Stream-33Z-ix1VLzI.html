joining me right now for the pixel to
event livestream which just started we
are joining in progress area with the
power of machine learning on our neural
machine translations being so or two
billion translations in many many
languages every single day to me shows
the power of staying at a problem
constantly using computer science to
make it better and seeing users respond
to it at scale this is why we are
excited about the shift from a mobile
first to a AI first well it is not just
about applying machine learning in in
their products but it's radically
rethinking how computing should work at
a higher level in an AI first world I
believe computers should adapt to how
people live their lives rather than
people having to adapt to computers and
so we think about four core attributes
as part of this experience first people
should be able to interact with
computing in a natural and seamless way
model took a step in this direction with
multi-touch but increasingly it needs to
be conversational sensory we need to be
able to use her voice gestures and
vision to make the experience much more
seamless second it is going to be
ambient computing is going to evolve
beyond the phone be there in many
screens around you when you need it
working for you
third we think it needs to be
thoughtfully contextual mobile gave us
limited context you know with identity
your location we were able to improve
this we using
and AI first well we can have a lot more
context and apply it thoughtfully for
example if you're into fitness and you
land in a new city we can suggest
running routes
maybe gyms nearby and healthy eating
options and in my case being a
vegetarian having a weakness for
desserts maybe suggest the right
restaurants for me finally and probably
the most important of it all in a
computing needs to learn and adapt
constantly over time it just doesn't
work that way today in Mobile
you know developers write software and
constantly ship updates but you know let
me give a small example I use Google
Calendar all the time
on Sundays I try to get a weekly view of
how my week looks lost
but once the worst week starts say on a
Monday or a Tuesday I'm trying to get a
view into what the next few hours looks
like I have to constantly toggle toggle
back and forth
Google Calendar should automatically
understand my context and show me the
right field it's a very simple example
but software needs to fundamentally
change how it works it needs to learn
and adapt and then applies the important
things like security and privacy as well
today a lot of us deal with security and
privacy by putting the onus back on
users we give them many settings and
toggles to improve those but in an AI
first world we can learn and adapt and
do it thoughtfully for our users for
example if it's a notification for your
doctor's appointment we need to treat it
sensitively and differently than just
telling you when you need to start
driving to work so we're really excited
by the shift and that's why we are here
today we've been working on software and
hardware together because that's the
best way to drive the shifts in
computing power but we think we're the
unique moment in time where we can bring
the combination of AI and software and
hardware to bring a different
perspective to solving problems for
users and we're very confident about our
approach here because we are the four
friend of driving the shifts with AI
three months ago at Google i/o our
Google AI teams announced a new approach
called Auto mo
although ml is just our machines
automatically generating machine
learning models today these are
handcrafted by machine learning
scientists and literally only a few
thousands of scientists around the world
can do this design the number of layers
weight and connect the neurons
appropriately it's very hard to do we
want to democratize this we want to
bring this to more people you want to
enable hundreds of thousands of
developers to be able to do it so we've
been working on this technology called
Auto ml and just in the past month for a
standard task like image classification
understanding images our auto ml models
are now not only more accurate than the
best human generated models or they are
more resource efficient so it's pretty
amazing to see we are now taking it a
step further let me talk about another
use case object direction when we say
object direction just fancy name for
computers trying to delineate and
understand images being able to draw
bounding boxes and distinguish between
all the way vehicles their scooters
mopeds motorcycles and even pick up the
bike in front it has a lot of practical
use cases the Street View example for
Legos works based on object direction
google lense which you'll hear about
later as well as our photography in
pixel use this object direction this is
really hard to do the best human
generated models we have only have a
thirty nine percent accuracy but our
auto ml models as of the past couple of
weeks have have reached from forty three
percent accuracy they're constantly
getting better so the rate at which we
are seeing progress with AI is amazing
which is why we are really excited about
combined even
okay so right about now you might be
wondering what about this pixel what
about the pixel - that might be what
you're tuned in for well as you know
what these keynotes there's a little bit
of information to get through first
regarding other developments and things
that are going on that are exciting and
so on but I promise you there will be
pixel to talk and after this livestream
I'm gonna have my hands on video with
the pixel - as well so definitely stick
around for that if you have any
questions regarding the pixel 2 or pixel
2 XL hit me up on Twitter right now it's
a little bit easier to manage than the
chat right here or you can do one of the
super chats at the top you might see
those super chats up there where where
the question can stick I'll also look at
those art I'm gonna unmute this match
the 60 is furthered by thinking about AI
software and hardware together I
couldn't be more excited by the
direction our Hardware team is taking
and approaching their work here so to
give you a lot more insights let me
welcome break onto the stage thank you
hi everyone I want to welcome everyone
here today Google fans the media in the
front row we have some of our top sales
reps from Verizon and other partners
it's great to have you all here yes
welcome welcome
we've got a lot to show you today
including a few surprises so I thought I
would quickly set the scene and explain
what we've been working toward and just
how it ties in to the vision that sundar
outlined a year ago we stood on a
slightly smaller stage and introduce the
world to Google pixel home and Wi-Fi
chromecast ultra and daydream view this
is the first generation of Hardware made
by Google so much has happened since
then and we've made tremendous progress
in our first year
for starters our team is getting a lot
bigger we're bringing on 2,000 very
talented engineers from HTC along with
some important IP it's an amazing team
that's created a series of industry
first innovations and by working more
closely together we'll be able to better
integrate Google hardware and software
and our products have built up a lot of
momentum going into our second year
let's take a look ok Google ok Google ok
Google Play the soundtrack to spaghetti
for Pitt Bay we will set to hold the
product event at San Francisco there are
now
my mom
you see anybody recognizing that little
montage we're still in the early days of
our hardware line but we're off to a
great start we're thrilled to announce
that they're now 55 million chromecast
devices around the world Google Wi-Fi is
the number one selling mesh router since
its launch in the US and Canada and in
the last 12 months alone the assistant
has gotten a lot smarter thanks to
Google we've added more than a hundred
million new unique featured snippets
from the web video results from YouTube
and new local places in Google Maps and
a lot more and Pixel had a great year I
just wish we had a few more of them to
go around
but user satisfaction among pixel owners
is among the highest of any Google
product ever industry analysts and the
media gave pixel rave reviews to our
performance scores led the industry and
pixel had the best and top rated
smartphone camera
we're really proud of how well the pixel
did for our first generation smartphone
in such a competitive space well you all
know this better than anyone but the
playing field for hardware components is
leveling off and I don't envy those of
you who have to write reviews for a
bunch of smart phones with very similar
specs megapixels in the camera processor
speed modem throughput battery life
display quality these core features are
table stakes now Moore's law and Dennard
scaling are ideas from the past to be
honest it's going to be tougher and
tougher for people to develop new
exciting products each year because
that's no longer the timetable for big
leaps forward in hardware alone and
that's why works and to make all those
thousands of memories easy to find on
any of your devices we did the same
thing with home networks Google Wi-Fi
uses machine learning not only to keep
your signal strong but to reduce Wi-Fi
congestion while you're moving
throughout the house your router is
intelligently transitioning your devices
to the best Wi-Fi point and placing you
on the right channel when you're using
the assistant or Google home you'll
notice it can pick either going even in
a noisy River says our deep learning
capabilities and neural beamforming
help Google home locate the slogan sound
and hear you accurately so we can do
with just two microphones what others
normally need 6r8 to do and this is what
it means to design hardware from the
inside out it's this combination of AI
software and hardware working together
that provides a helpful experience for
our users and that's where the big leaps
forward are going to happen in the next
10 years we're still in the early days
for our hardware line but we know what
it takes to build great products in a
crowded field we were at first with many
of our most successful we had a little
drop in the stream there we're back
though on Android and even search but in
each case we succeeded by doing what
we're best at
reimagining the experience to make it
radically helpful for the user and as
you'll hear today our next generation of
devices is radically helpful - they're
fast they're there when you need them
they're simple to use and they
anticipate your needs everything is
designed for you to keep the tech in the
background and out of your way interact
with your devices naturally through your
voice or by touching them and by
building Hardware around our AI and
software we're creating products that
get even better over time they're
constantly getting faster and more
helpful the more you interact with them
thanks to machine learning as a family
made by Google products represent the
ultimate Google experience today we're
going to show you how we're creating a
family of products that are there when
you need them at work at school and on
the go but we're gonna start with the
most important place your home so let's
hear next from Rishi Chandra who leaves
our home team over to you Rishi
okay so it looks like Google home first
and then probably pixel after thank you
Rick it's been a really exciting year
for us Google home was the first product
to bring the Google assistant to the
home and we've been constantly learning
from our users so that we can make the
assistant radically helpful for you
for example as Rick mentioned in the
last year we can answer over 100 million
new questions and the best part is you
know the talk like a computer or teach
Google home any new skills it just works
now we're really happy with a positive
feedback thus far we know this is a
journey so been working hard to bring
Google home to more people and more
countries this year we launched in five
new countries and we're happy to
announce that we'll be launching in
Japan later this week
now bringing the assistant of people all
around the world is no easy task we had
to make sure we can understand people at
different age groups genders and accents
so we trained the assistant at a scale
that only Google could with over 50
million voice samples from hundreds of
different ambient environments we've
been investing in voice search for over
a decade which is why we have the best
voice recognition in the world now
earlier this year we had a major
breakthrough with the ability to
recognize your voice we call it voice
match with your permission we build a
model of your voice by looking at dozens
of different voice characteristics like
vocal constructs pitch and tone this is
a really big deal Google homes great for
the whole family
but doesn't mean I want to get the same
answer to every question an assistant
can only be truly useful if it knows who
you are and with voice match we're the
only assistant that can bring personal
help to each individual member of your
household so he asked a question we
match your voice and we respond with
your calendar your commute and your
personal reminders now voice match has
already become one of the most popular
features on Google home today over half
of all queries are from people who train
the assistant to recognize their voice
and starting today we're rolling out a
voice match to all seven countries
Google home will be available now
another popular feature is hands-free
calling you can use your Google home to
call any landline or mobile number in
the US or Canada for free without any
additional apps or accessories it just
works and I'm happy to announce they'll
be bringing hands-free calling to the UK
later this year and starting today you
could call out with your own personal
mobile number so whatever you're calling
will know it's you you just need to
verify your number to the Google home
app and of course with voice match we
can recognize your voice to make sure we
call your contact with your personal
number and history calling also has the
intelligence of Google built right in
just say hey Google call the bakery on
24th Street okay
calling no eval
bakery we do the hard work to figure out
which business you want to call thanks
to Google's deep expertise in local
search making a call has never been
easier I'm probably gonna order a lot
more pizza so to kick things off I like
the welcome Giulio lead designer for
Home Hardware
Thank You Ricci I'm thrilled to share
with you how he thinks design is
redefining technology in the home you
heard Rick mention earlier today that
everything in a hardware line is
designed to fit into your life the home
is the special intimate place and people
are very selective about what they
welcome into it you don't want to fill
it with black plastic complicated
buttons and random blinking lights our
vision is to build simple helpful
solutions that work in the background
helping you when you need it and staying
out of the way when you don't so here's
what that means to us we design for the
spaces our products live in and we take
inspiration from the materials and
colors that people already use to make
their home more warm and inviting second
when designing for real hopes form and
sites really matters for creating
something that actually fits into any
room or on any surface and lastly the
way you interact with our products has
to be so intuitive you never even have
to think about it and so simple that the
entire household can use it with that we
are introducing mini the newest member
of the Google home family
the first thing you might notice is the
striking simplicity of the design its
sleek and smooth with no corners or
edges and it's small enough to be placed
in anywhere in your home
it makes Google home more accessible to
more people in more rooms and as you can
see almost the entire enclosure is made
out of fabric
and it's not just about aesthetics its
core to the product experience that is
why we created this material from
scratch right down to the yarn it needed
to be durable and soft but also
transparent enough to let through both
light and sound this perfect balance
allows for all of mehness technology to
be thoughtfully tucked away underneath
the clean simple enclosure so the four
LED lights under the fabric are there
when you need them lighting up to show
you that it hears you or it's thinking
and you can control it by touch give the
fabric a quick tap to pause your music
adjust the volume or talk to your
assistant we thought a lot about how to
get great sound with such a small
product - we embrace mini circular shape
to project 360 degree sound so it's
really crisp no matter where you stand
in the room it would be surprised how
amazing the quality is and if you want
bigger sound you can easily connect mini
to any chromecast built-in speaker
wirelessly we created mini in three
beautiful colors coral chalk and
charcoal colored really matters in the
home this is the place where we choose
our drapes and carpets and pink colors
with so much care we brought that same
level of care for many for the chalk
color alone it took us 157 tries before
we found the perfect shade of grey so
that's Google home mini with all the
power of the goo
assistant you can make it your sous chef
in the kitchen
you're white noise machine and their
nursery your voice Ramona Priya TV in
the living room or your alarm clock in
the bedroom or all of the above Minnie
will retail for just $49 in the u.s.
gonna be available for pre-order online
starting today and in stores starting
October 19th from major retailers we're
also really happy to announce that
Minnie is coming to all seven Google
home countries so with that let's take a
look at this ad that will launch later
this week with this little thing
well it's dude a little mini you put it
in round it and control it with your
voice hey Google Play my fun playlist
okay playing now it's also or no control
and a white box and a sous-chef let it
cool for 10 minutes it can play this on
TV or that on the internet it can tell
you the weather will or if your flights
delayed because of the weather
and it knows the difference between you
I see
so if you go hey Google call Alex it
won't call your husband's friend Alex
it'll call your friend Alex colleague
Alex hey how are you okay gotta go girl
anyway it's May but st. people who help
you find stuff on the Internet so you
know no biggie it's smaller than a donut
in weighs less than a full-grown
chipmunk put out the nuts it's powered
by the Google assistant
so it has Google Maps Google Calendar it
gets you to all your music block of your
favorite shows all of YouTube and lots
and lots and lots of other stuff you
love oh good left 150 bucks yeah if
Google Hill minutes a little help at
home like only Google can okay so it's a
price point thing it might be more
approachable you know more people now 49
bucks put them all over your house we
also want to share how the Google
assistant continues to get better over
time
from the start we've been helping
everyone people with their everyday
routines for example one of my favorite
features is my day which gives me a
personalized briefing of my important
events of the day and with voice match
each member of the house can get their
own unique start to the morning routine
well soon we're going to be extending
routines in two important ways first
we're adding more routines to help you
with those everyday moments like getting
ready to leave for work coming home in
the evening or turning in for the night
second we're adding additional actions
to the routines so now when I say good
morning I not only get my personal
briefing but I also can turn on the
lights start the coffee maker and even
play my favorite morning playlist this
kind of help is exactly what I need to
get my day started now another ritual
for me in the morning is I'm always
looking for iPhone before heading to
work well Google assistant can help
there to just say hey Google Find My
Phone and will automatically ring your
Android phone even if it's on silent
mode and for iPhone users we just give
you a call it's gonna it saves me five
to seven minutes every morning
now we're also working to make the smart
home work better for you the Google
assistant can now voice control over a
thousand different smart home products
from over a hundred brands and even more
importantly we brought our deep
expertise of natural language processing
to make it easier to voice control in a
more conversational way so for example
if I want to change the temperature
I shouldn't have to remember the current
thermostat set it I should be able to
say hey Google make it warmer okay
warming up the living room your sister
knows what warmer means I will just take
care of it for you now voice control is
just the start we believe the next
evolution of the smart home is to bring
real intelligence to the home so it can
behave in a more thoughtful way your
home should smartly adjust to you not
the other way around so Google and nest
are working together to reimagine the
smart home to tell you more I like to
welcome Yogi CTO of Nest
Thank You Rishi a nest we like to talk
about the thoughtful hell one that takes
care of the people inside it and the
world around it we recently took a big
step forward in achieving that goal by
doubling our portfolio by shipping six
new hardware products when I love about
nest growing ecosystem is that we
combine the best-in-class hardware and
machine learning to help make people's
lives easier and your nest experience
reaches a whole new level when it's
combined with Google products let me
show you three examples of how we can
provide you with even more help a help
with nest cam good at home and
chromecast we can help keep you keep an
eye on your home chef with your voice so
if you hear some unexpected sound and by
the front door and I'm in the back with
the family room without my phone I can
just say ok Google show me the entryway
ok streaming the entryway and then I
realize it's not an intruder but my pet
pig Cayenne and she's found the leftover
lunch in my son's backpack sadly this
has happened more than once and if I
want to keep it for later for my kids I
can simply say ok Google save me this
clip to show them why we don't leave
food in our backpacks with our new video
doorbell nest hello we can also start to
solve some of our common pain points
through Google and nest integrated
computer techni computer vision
technologies of course most of us want
to know who's at the door before we get
off the couch through a feature called
familiar faces nest hello we'll be able
to
the people that you ask it to remember
so when their doorbell rings and nests
hello recognizes the person at the door
it will automatically broadcast that
information to Google home devices in
the house
auntie Suzie is at the front door and
you don't even have to ask
and if nestling doesn't know who's at
the door you can just say ok Google show
me who's at the front door and we will
stream your camera feed right to your TV
this is another great example of what
Google and Ness can do together and this
last one is my favorite your home can
soon get ready for the night just with a
simple command as Rishi mentioned you
can personalize your routine to include
actions for nest products so all I have
to say is hey Google good night ok let's
get ready for bed
I've armed your security system your
first calendar event is tomorrow at 9:00
a.m. your alarm is set for 7:00 a.m.
sleep well in the background my fitness
my assistant is also turning my security
camera on adjusting the thermostat and
turning off the lights this really
simplifies my life and gives me the
peace of mind that I cannot get any
other way
together nest and Google deliver an
ecosystem a product that makes your home
more secure and energy-efficient more
connected and entertaining with the best
home assistant experience our close
collaboration make this product work
seamlessly together and help us get one
step closer to a truly thoughtful
on that note to tell you more about
Google system let me welcome we should
be back on stage
alright so better integration nest
products if you have then you add home
to them and you can see the automation
goes King a more thoughtful home it's
just one way to help make our jointly
hectic family lives a little easier you
know the Google assistant already
provides a lot of help from using your
voice to order more diapers playing a
lullaby in the nursery checking the
traffic those piano lessons or easily
giving grandma a call now if you're like
me make me hard to gather the household
together for those family moments like
dinnertime a movie night well the help
we're launching a new feature called
broadcast it's real easy just say hey
Google broadcast it's time to leave for
school got it broadcasting now the
assistant will broadcast some message to
all the other Google home devices in my
house it's really great parents are
gonna love this feature kids in kids are
gonna hate this feature but that's what
makes it useful speaking of kids we
think Google home has a lot of potential
with to help kids and families voice
interactions so simple and easy to use
kids are naturally drawn to it so we
want to be thoughtful about what it
would take to deliver a great kids
experience we conducted research with
hundreds of parents and kids from across
the country from different backgrounds
so first we're announcing support for
family link accounts on Google home
these are Google accounts that parents
can create for children under 13 they
can manage it within the family link app
and as we all know kids have their own
unique way of speaking sometimes it can
be a little hard to understand even for
us parents well fortunately we've
improved our voice recognition accuracy
for kids so the assistant can understand
them too and finally we're introducing
over 50 new experiences with the Google
assistant to help kids learn something
new
explore new interests imagine with story
time or just share laughs the whole
family so let me show you how my kids
and their friends had some fun this
weekend ready to savor musical champion
which was the first planet to be
discovered using it I can tell you as a
parent it's great to see the kids
without their screens and sharing
experiences together as easy to get
started just say hey did it right let's
learn to play science quizzes for top-2
an astronaut or try hey Google let's
play a game to play musical chairs or
tackle a riddle
and finally hey Google tell me a story
to your classics like Snow White or
original stories like the chef to love
potatoes better bring this up Jack still
likes the stories and Star Wars
we're getting many other top brands in
the family space including Warner
Brothers and Sports Illustrated kids and
starting today we're opening up the
actions on Google platform for
developers to create experiences
specifically for families and kids all
these new family features will be
rolling out later this month across all
Google home devices ok finally I have
one more exciting edition to share
that's coming to the Google home family
big one
so this is a smart idea right because
now it becomes your Bluetooth speaker
your main Bluetooth speaker also of
course you can put them all over your
house this is a this is becoming a Sonos
competitor now
well I gotta make it seem like they
sound good say hello to peace our
biggest and best sounding Google home
ever
just like the pixel reimagine the camera
will do the same with sound but the
combination of great hardware and
software powered by Google's machine
learning capabilities that's cool now it
starts with a strong foundation of great
hardware the first thing you'll notice
is how we obsess over the base its to
4.5 inch woofers have 22 millimeters of
excursion and extremely high range for
their size that means these Wolfers can
move a lot of air allowing max to really
hit those low frequencies and max can
play loud really loud it's one of 20
times more powerful than Google home so
to fill any room in your house with
amazing audio now great hardware alone
isn't sufficient for great sound the
challenge of speakers today is that
they're tuned for ideal acoustic
conditions but they fall short in the
real world that's why it always sounds
different in the store than in your home
the sound great the speaker needs to
adjust to you in your home so today
we're announcing smart sound a new audio
experience powered by Google's AI it
allows max to adapt to you your
environment your context your
preferences so for example if you set up
a speaker on your wall on a shelf in a
corner fairly common places it can
dramatically change the sound balance of
the speaker and make the music sound
muddy and the vocals lose clarity well
with smart sound we automatically tune
the speaker to correct for this effect
using a machine learning model trained
with thousands of different room
configurations what's really cool this
is all done dynamically so if you decide
to move max a few feet it'll compensate
within seconds and overtime smart sound
will automatically adapt the sound to
fake your context lowering the volume in
the morning raising the volume when the
dishwasher is running or just a jus
adjusting the tuning bass the typing
maybe you're listening to whether it be
music podcasts or news it's about
delivering a consistent crisp thoughtful

clothes we gave max to a music lover to
get their thoughts let's take a look
I'm a producer in a DJs I'm not
classically trained but I'm obsessed
with music I listen to music all day
long I'm constantly being critical of
Milan music of Misrata here watch this
hey Google Play particular by Major
Lazer sure particular by Major Lazer &amp;amp;
DJ maphorisa here it is on YouTube every
room I have music my bedrooms living
room we'll turn it up
hey Google play the song that goes
whistles like Linda all right
no no better by Major Lazer here it is
on YouTube you can find the periphery of
walls and where it is located and room
have that technology to understand where
it is and to adjust appropriately is
amazing that sounds great and that's
this is the system if people could
actually hear what we're giving them
from what it leaves our studio that
would be amazing that's what they need
producer artists for love anchor will
turn it all the way up so this is
obviously this is a play at Sonos boughs
all the home audio systems that they try
to cover the whole home which I mean
that didn't exist before at least not
from Google as you just saw there's so
much amazing innovation happening in the
home space and at the same time our
phones have evolved become the most
trusted devices in our lives but you
ever wonder why the laptop experience
has been basically the same for the past
20 years so while the laptop experience
hasn't changed all that much how we use
technology in our lives
definitely has we live online we create
and collaborate more than ever we use
tons of apps every day and we're
constantly jumping between our phone
tablet and laptop to get things done and
have fun should we be able to do
whatever we want on whatever device is
in front of us we think so we worked
hard to combine the most helpful parts
of a laptop a tablet and a smartphone to
fit how we use technology today meet
Google pixel book the high-performance
Chromebook
takes a pixel of reimagines laptop
experience by marrying the best of
premium performance hardware the speed
simplicity and security of Chrome OS the
smarts of the Google assistant and all
your favorite apps pixel book is the
perfect example of how we combine the
best of hardware and software with AI at
the center we'll start with a stunning
versatile design pixel book is the
thinnest lightest laptop we've ever made
at just around 10 millimeters thin and a
kilogram light in fact it's so light I
find myself constantly checking my bag
to make sure I haven't forgotten it
pixel book easily adapts with a 4 in 1
design so it's built for the many ways
said you want to use it one key when
you're at your most productive
it's an incredible laptop fold the
keyboard underneath and easily watch
videos or play your favorite games use
pixel book as a tablet to catch up on
the latest news or read a book to Point
C it's the first convertible laptop that
actually feels gentles use as a tablet
prop it up into tent mode to share your
screen or follow along with the recipe
in the kitchen use it however you want
because pixel book adapts to fit the
office the classroom movie night or even
a long flight pixel phone fans will
appreciate our signature glass inlay on
the lid giving it not only a refined
look but improved wireless performance
the twelve point three inch touchscreen
display
is gorgeously high resolution with
vibrant colors deep blacks and enough
brightness to use outside even on a
sunny day we developed an extremely thin
keyboard that's comfortable to use with
soft touch keys and a backlit design
that helps you work from anywhere and
pixel books trackpad uses touch
processing algorithms that improve
accuracy and Palmer
with Intel Core i5 and i7 processors
pixel book packs a punch it offers
plenty of RAM to handle your
multitasking needs and gives you up to
512 gigs of storage the long lasting
battery provides up to 10 hours of use
from a single charge and plugging in for
just 15 minutes gives you 2 hours of
battery life you can even use your pixel
book charger with your pixel phone
giving you one less thing to carry
around
quick charge on the laptop and in
moments when you don't have access to
Wi-Fi pixel book is smart enough to
automatically connect through your pixel
phone oh we call this instant tethering
it's so much simpler than setting up a
hotspot on my phone and then manually
connection to it on my laptop now let's
take a further look at the software
experience inside pixel book this laptop
is fast it starts up in seconds
stays fast throughout the day and won't
slow down over its lifetime Chrome OS
provides a more secure computing
experience with multiple layers of
security and automatic updates no need
to worry about manual downloads or
annoying security patches to keep your
machine safe and your most important
files are available on your local drive
and securely backed up with Google Drive
so you can access them from anywhere
online or offline we're also excited
ounce that pixel book is the first
laptop with the Google assistant
built-in making it radically helpful
just like you can with your other
devices you can check the weather before
heading out for the day control your
smart home set reminders check if my
packers on your system is there for you
no matter what you're doing
and we've made it easy to interact with
the assistant and all the ways you use
pixel book when its intent or
entertainment mode and the keyboard is
tucked away simply say ok Google Play
future me
and that exact music video I had in mind
starts playing on YouTube other times
though it's not the right moment or
place to talk to your computer like if
you're sitting at a coffee shop or out
in the audience right now so pixel book
has a key that puts the power of the
assistant right at your fingertips
letting you type your request and we're
using your pixel book as a tablet it's
easiest to show your assistant what you
need help with on your screen that's why
we created the new pixel book pants whoa
a smart responsive companion for your
pixel book pen is not dead not yet
just hold the Pens button and circle an
image or text on the screen and the
assistant will take action when you're
browsing through a blog and discover a
new musician you can circle their photo
and the system will give you more
information about that from there you
can check out their Instagram page go to
their YouTube channel get a list of
their songs and more or if you're doing
homework it's just I can help with your
research oh like if you get stuck on a
really unfamiliar concept just circle
the word and the assistant will give you
everything you need powerful man the pen
is also handy for moments when it feels
more natural to write draw or take notes
like when you're using your pixel book
as a tablet the experience using a pen
should be like writing on paper to bring
that experience to life we partnered
with the engineers at Wacom and together
we built the fastest most responsive
stylus experience ever with just 10
milliseconds of latency 60 degrees of
angular awareness and 2000 levels of
pressure sensitivity pixel pixel book
pen uses machine learning for
handwriting recognition and demonstrates
how performance Hardware combined with
our expertise and machine learning
delivers a user experience that just
works better
and shouldn't the apps you know and love
on your phone also be available on your
laptop with pixel book they are pixel
book fully supports Google Play
alright guys how much is it gonna be
guessing me chat over there how much
what's the price
in fact it's never been easier to put
the final touches on your favorite
photos in Adobe Lightroom and then post
them straight to Instagram you can
listen to music from Spotify or download
netflix shows and movies for viewing on
the go pixel book is also perfect for
creativity apps like Evernote AutoCAD
and more snapchat is already one of the
most popular apps among early users and
we're thrilled to announce that the snap
team is working with us to bring an
amazing snapchat experience to the
larger screen on pixel book in addition

a thousand retail locations including
Best Buy pre-orders start today and
nouvion stores beginning October 31st we
can't wait to see how you use pixel book
to work play and create next Mario is
going to come out and talk about our
pixel phones okay brick they're doing a
pixel phones and I just want to remind
you guys as soon as this live event is
over I will have a hands-on video
immediately so don't go anywhere keep it
locked here we go pick some phones
at Google we believe in questioning the
status quo asking more from the world
around us is in our nature after all
Google was built on a single question
what if all the information in the world
was available to everyone everywhere a
big question for us is what if
smartphones got smarter and simpler we
set out the design of phone ourselves
because we believed we could make the
smartphone experience better the first
pixel phone delivered a clean and fast
UI put the Google assistant in your
pocket and brought you and brought you
the best camera ever in a smartphone and
we didn't stop asking big questions or
working to solve big challenges for
users today we're proud to introduce the
Google pixel to design for you with the
best of Google built in we've created
the new pixel in two sizes a 5 inch and
the 6 inch XL with thoughtful design
elements and improvements to the UI
throughout we're bringing you more
Google assistant capabilities we've
added new smart experiences to the
camera and will continue to deliver the
best photography plus we're introducing
some innovative new products to
complement your picks for experience we
do all this by bringing together the
best of hardware software and AI let's
begin with the design we've evolved a
pixels iconic look to be even bolder the
all aluminium body with a premium hybrid
coating
gives it a sleek and clean profile the
soft sculpted back with a distinct side
band feels comfortable and secure in
your hand the refine visor is made of
sturdy gently curved colored glass and
transitions seamlessly into the metal
body we've placed the fingerprint sensor
where your finger naturally Falls it's
extremely accurate secure and it unlocks
faster than any other smartphone we also
added a small pop of color on the power
button for a bit of playfulness over on
the front pixel two's front-facing
stereo speakers are precision tuned to
deliver the perfect balance of volume
clarity and frequency response we place
them so you can comfortably watch videos
in landscape mode without muffling the
audio with your hand if you prefer
headphones use your existing analog
headphones with the included adapter or
your digital USBC headphones for the
highest resolution audio all the way to
your ears or avoid cables altogether
with your upgraded Bluetooth 5.0 support
and high five codecs the smaller 5-inch
pixel tube features a full HD OLED
display and it's as smart as it is
beautiful the display intelligently
selects which specific pixels to turn on
leaving the others perfectly dark for a
100,000 to 1 contrast ratio that's twice
the resolution and more than 10 times
the contrast ratio of phones in its
category with LCD displays pixel two
comes in three colors kind of blue just
black and clearly white we love picking
the color names so let's talk about the
display on the XL the six-inch pixel to
XL was designed with an innovative P
OLED display technology we elegantly
curved the glass to bring the display to
the edges for a full screen immersive
viewing experience the screen supports
18 by 9 q HD plus resolution with over
4.1 million
pixels which equals 538 pixels per inch
for amazing detail we tune the display
to take advantage of the wide color
gamut for vivid and realistic colors
we've integrated a circular polarizer
which lets you enjoy the screen even
while wearing sunglasses and we've
optimized the displays on both phones
for virtual reality they're both
daydream ready the pixel 2 XL comes in
two colors just black and the stylish Li
simple black and white feel free to
choose whichever size pixel you prefer
because you'll get the same great
experience on both we don't set aside
better features for the larger device
both devices shot 7 water and dust
resistant and have an all-new battery
that charge is super fast you get up to
7 hours of charge is just 15 to 60 7 now
Sabrina from the pixel product owner is
going to take us through the new pixel 2
UI and some cool and useful features
thanks Mario we're constantly working to
make a smartphone experience easier and
more helpful and you'll see improvements
throughout the pixel twos UI that helena
starts before you even unlock the phone
let me show you the pixel twos new
always-on display you can see important
information like the time date email and
text notifications and reminders all
without pushing any buttons or unlocking
the device and there's more than just
notifications on your always-on display
have you ever heard a song you loved and
wondered what it was called
with now playing you can just glance
down to see the song name an artist on
your phone
what makes this feature so special is
that the music is identified without
your pixel to sending any information to
Google on device machine-learning
detects a music is playing and matches
it to a database of tens of thousands of
song patterns on your phone in this
example you can see that pixel recognize
the song perfect places by Lorde
from here I can tap on the song title
and I'm taken to this little assistant I
can add this on to my library my
favorite music service like google play
music or Spotify search the web for the
song or even watch the video on YouTube
this features brought me some delightful
moments over the past few months and I'm
finally learning who sings my favorite
songs ok so let's go to a live demo live
demo here we are on the new matrix were
using the live demo you can see here
I've selected one of our live wallpapers
this is from our new collection called
the living universe and if you look
closely you'll notice subtle movements
like the waves crashing on the beach I
love them at the top of the screen
there's a space called at-a-glance where
you can easily see the latest updates on
your day we're starting with calendar
events today with traffic flight status
and more coming soon in this case I can
see that I've got a mysterious meeting
coming up not sure what that's about we
place a Google quick search box at the
bottom of the home screen which we found
that it's easier to reach and we're
making it even more powerful it stays
with you as you swipe across your
screens of apps and widgets a quick tap
into the search box can help me find
anything that I need as I start typing
I can see web search results at the top
but also contacts and apps from my phone
I can even drag an app from here and
drop it right on my home screen we've
also made it faster and easier to get to
the Google assistant on pixel 2 with a
new feature called active edge just give
your pixel a quick squeeze where your
hand naturally holds the phone and ask
for whatever you need
no big speak no big speed button take
the break it to you I just I just
squeeze find it take a selfie one hand
no buttons
our research team investigated dozens of
ways to trigger the assistant but
squeezing the phone felt the most
natural satisfying and efficient after a
lot of work and machine learning
we're able to accurately identify an
intentional squeeze if we're really
proud of how it turned out and it even
works when you're voting in a case so
your assistant is just a quick squeeze
away making lots of common tasks on your
phone fast and easy from calling and
texting friends to controlling your
smart home to enjoying your favorite
music and videos and having the same
assistant at home and on your phone
means the experience is connected across
devices for example I can say to my
phone ok Google broadcast hey I'm almost
home with the pizza so get ready for
dinner and be my voice message is shared
with my family through the Google home
in our kitchen the routines race you
mentioned are coming to the phone as
well that's why we've also customized
routine specifically from long ago the
one I use most is when I'm on my commute
I jump in my car drop my phone in the
cupholder and say ok Google let's go
home
sure let's go your commute home is
currently 27 minutes with heavy
traffic if you take us 101 south you
have one unread text message it's from
mom
it says we'll bring dessert to dinner
tonight here's where you left off in
fresh air have a safe drive I'm Terry
Gross with fresh air super useful all
from resume is my choice right from
right where I left off my assistant even
adjusts the volume so I can hear clearly
on the road and automatically sends a
message to my husband letting him know
I'm on my way like all the new routines
that the assistant will support you can
customize this one based on your
preferences so with a quick squeeze
useful routines on-the-go and an
assistant that keeps getting smarter
pixal continues to be the most helpful
phone around pixel to launch with pure
Android Oreo with features like
notification dots picture and picture
and many more if you already have a
pixel you recently receive the Android
Oreo update and we hope you're enjoying
all the improvements as a pixel user
you'll always be the first to get OS and
security updates without having to do
anything your phone becomes faster more
capable and more secure all the time
next up like Aparna is going to share
some smart helpful new ways to use your
pixel to
have you ever asked yourself what kind
of puppy is that or I want to lose with
that pattern our phones can help us in
many ways
but sometimes the questions we have are
difficult to describe into a search box
as you heard sooner talk about we
believe that as computers can understand
what you see it unleashes a whole new
kind of assistance that's why we started
working on Google Lenz a way to do more
with what you see you're super excited
to bring a preview of land that's as
good as humans we're just getting
started with helping you do more with
what you see be the photo from five
years ago or something right in front of
you in time we want to bring lamps
everywhere super excited to bring a
preview of lens to pixel users first so
you'll start to see this icon appear in
Google Photos and soon Google assistant
we just talked about how the phone can
help you understand the world but it can
also help you place things into the
world that's right that's augmented
reality we see there's a powerful way to
bring the physical and the digital
together that's why we started working
on a our core our augmented reality SDK
for Android and we see that developers
are already using it to create some
amazing experiences I want to show you a
few examples here so let's take house
they're bringing the show room into your
living room using a our with League of
Legends you can watch one of the most
popular eSport games on an AR map built
by grab games and with Lego my favorite
you can build virtual models with
characters that really come to life all
the fun
no LEGO pieces to step on
we at Google are also making some fun
things and our teams have been working
hard to create this new experience we
call it a are stickers it's built right
into the camera and six clues it to
pixel with a are stickers you can
express yourself with playful emojis
like this one food characters here
there's lots to choose from and more
will be added over time our partners are
also making some fun stickers here and I
want to show some of them to you right
now so let's start with the Netflix
original my favorite show stranger
things can wait for season two ready to
see it okay time to set the mood lights
please okay here's Lea using the pixel
camera we're looking at the AR stickers
within the stranger things collection
yes okay
so let's pick up character let's pick
Demi Garden and place him right next to
me okay you need to have a cup of coffee
name notice how the creatures not just
sitting around where you put it right
it's not a dead sticker it's moving it's
reacting to what's around it it's alive
we really pay attention to the motion
the physics the lighting we want to make
it feel like it's actually here is it
let's have some fun this is a great
photo or video by the way please
but let's have some fun here Lia can be
dropped 11 into this
alright ok this is getting interesting
now we have two characters in the scene
and notice how they're not just reacting
to the environment around them they're
reacting to each other and they know
each other's presence that's a big
reaction these interactions make some
really interesting moments here Thank
You Mia now you can be the director of
all kinds of stories and share with
share these with your friends you have
more AR stickers to play with your
favorite characters from SNL YouTube the
NBA and just in time for episode 8 Star
Wars I've been playing with these
stickers at Zoey videos and they look
great and this is because the pixel
camera is specially calibrated for
augmented reality it allows robust
tracking even in low-light conditions
it also supports 60 frames per second
rendering of AR content
you saw how the camera can help us do
more with what we see with google lens
you saw how the camera can bridge the
physical and digital with AR but the
pixel camera also takes awesome photos
so to tell you all about it
we'll have Mario back on stage
thanks a bar now we hear everyday from
users of the first pixel phone that the
camera is one of their favorite features
you can see why in the amazing photos
that people post with the team pixel
hashtag last year pixel received a DxO
score of 89 that was the highest rating
that DxO mark had ever issued to a
smartphone with pixel - we have
reimagined smartphone photography for
great hardware and unparalleled imaging
software tuned by our engineers and
researchers today we're proud to
announce that DxO mark has issued pixel
to an unprecedented score of 98 that's
the highest score of any smartphone
camera let's talk about how we achieve
that and it starts with great hardware
the pixel 2 has a 12 megapixel F 1.8
aperture rear camera with optical image
stabilization we've integrated these
components with our HDR + computational
photography for every photo we take a
burst of shots with short exposure times
to avoid blowing out the highlights
within a line and combine each pixel
algorithmically for optimal color and
contrast all of this happens instantly
with zero shutter lag the results are
stunning with high dynamic range even in
challenging low-light conditions this
year would increase the dynamic range
and improved texture and sharpness and
combined with a new autofocus mechanism
an optical image stabilization to reduce
blur from shaky hands and get amazing
shots every time like this and this
pixel - also brings you portrait mode
but we're implementing it a little bit
differently we're applying Google's
unmatched computational photography and
machine learning portrait mode lets you
take professional-looking shots with a
blurred background to make the
foreground pop like
you might capture with an SLR camera
other smartphones do this by combining
the images from two cameras pixel to
does portrait mode with just one camera
and machine learning what's unique about
pixel 2 is that it can generate a true
depth map with a single lens so you get
beautiful portrait shots without needing
a second camera the way this works is
that the pixel to camera includes a dual
pixel sensor technology this means that
each pixel in an image can contains a
right and a left view the difference in
perspective from those pixels combined
with machine learning models trained on
almost a million photos means that this
works on really hard cases like a busy
colorful background and yes this does
work with objects too and there's more
portrait mode doesn't just work on the
main camera because of the quality of
Google's computational photography with
a single camera you can also take
portrait selfies through the front
camera on both the pixel 2 and the pixel
2 XL the pixel 2 takes amazing videos
too we're applying optical image
stabilization simultaneously with video
stabilization at the same time other
smartphones do optical or digital we do
but don't do both at the same time
during video recording on a pixel - the
OIS Hardware actively corrects shake
artifacts while at the same time the
software based video stabilization uses
intelligent frame look ahead to
stabilize the overall video we call this
fused video stabilization and it's
another example of Google's hardware +
software
+ AI working together the result is less
motion blur even in low-light your
videos look smooth and professional the
pixel 2 camera also supports a feature
called motion photos the photos you take
with your in for the photos you take
your pixel captures up to 3 seconds of
video
the scenes removing uninteresting motion
and applying our unique fuse video
stabilization technology to the results
but of course the proof is in the photos
and videos so we invited some
photographers and producers to test
drive the new camera and they were
stunned by what they can do with the
pixel - Jamie McGurk better known as
13th witness in on Instagram and
filmmaker Zac McTeague documented a
recent trip to New Orleans using just a
pixel - the film you're about to see
uses no attachments fancy rates for
lighting all of the video footage and
stills were captured on pixel - phones
without any image enhancements or color
Corrections
[Laughter]
okay so it seems it seems pretty evident
that the camera is gonna be one of the
compelling features about the next
version of pixel you can see here that
doing a demonstration they claim that
there's no fancy color correction after
the fact post production or rigs to
offer up greater stabilization I think
that interesting stand out from the
previous part of the talk about the
camera is that there's both optical and
electronic image stabilization happening
at the same time of course shaky video
is not something anybody wants and you
know everybody's out there trying to
vlog and do whatever else it is with
their devices having both forms of
stabilization hopefully produces a more
stable image and before and Spencer
color Corrections
now the pixel to camera is simple enough
and smart enough that your photos and
videos can look just as good so the
picture booth photo experience doesn't
end when you take a photo or shoot a
video we want users to be able to easily
find them and store them securely
without having to worry about running
out of storage
after all simple storage and search is
part of what makes a school roll so
we're happy to announce that pixel to
users will continue to get free
unlimited storage for all of the photos
and videos they captured in the highest
resolution including 4k videos and
motion photos this is a big deal this is
a big deal pixel users take twice as
many photos as typical iPhone users and
store an average of 23 gigabytes of
photos and videos per year in Google's
cloud if you handy is iCloud you reach
your free limit in less than three
months with pix or you can safely and
effortless effortlessly store all of
your memories for free with your
permission Google photos automatically
tags and catter
categorizes those thousands of photos
and videos will take with your pixel too
you can search for photos of your
friends of a specific location of dogs
all without the hassle of manually
tagging or sorting finding your photo
the photo you're looking for is our
problem and not yours we're delighted by
what we've been able to achieve with
pixel 2 in terms of photography and our
so excited by all the moments that
you're going to capture so to recap the
smart and simple pixel 2 has everything
you'd expect from a smartphone and some
things you might not a gorgeous display
that brings your apps photos and videos
to life an all-day battery that charges
super fast plus water resistance and
security features to keep your phone in
your data safe easy quick access to the

a Google home mini with each purchase of
a pixel - and pixel to excel for a
limited size you don't really have
Canada Germany the UK one in the US
so that's the new pixel the radically
helpful smartphone that combines the
best of Google hardware software and AI
we hope you'll love it as much as we do
okay
okay guys there we have it okay pixel to
pixel to excel I told you earlier in
this stream I have a hands-on video it's
coming out in moments in seconds
in fact it's coming up very soon so keep
it keep an eye on the channel I'm gonna
be publishing it any second year I have
four devices in that video that you can
check out closer that I get to actually
handle so the pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL
just like I said that's the video you
want to see so don't go anywhere not yet
all right so as you've seen we've spent
the past year reimagining a simpler more
helpful smartphone experience we've also
been working on some new products to
make your pixel to experience even
better let's start with the newly
updated Google daydream view our virtual
reality headset we kept everything from
last year that people loved and we made
it even better to start we have a new
lineup of colors that complement this
year is made by Google family we also
upgraded the lenses and the fabrics so
the headset has our widest field of view
yet and is super light and comfortable
of course what matters most in a VR
headset is where it can take you last
year we launched with 25 apps and games
and now we have more than 250
high-quality VR titles we've also seen
that people love going places with VR
videos so we're excited to announce a
slate of premium video content coming to
daydream including multiple new original
series on YouTube VR and on Google Play
Movies you can experience new IMAX
movies available for free to pixel to
owners so you get to hang out with
Tigers
run alongside elephants dive into the
ocean with some sharks and blast into
space
with pixel twos new front firing stereo
speakers these movies sound as amazing
as they'll under threat and now you
might have missed that front front
firing front fiery TV so your friends
and family can see what you're seeing
the new Google daydream view is the best
mobile VR headset on the market and will
be available for $99 today we're also
announcing a smart new audio accessory
that works perfectly with pixel to our
first pair of premium wireless
headphones they're called they're called
Google pixel buds our team designed
pixel buds for great sound delivering
clear highs and deep bass so whether
it's jazz house or a symphony it all
sounds incredible with pixel buds
controlling your music is super simple
because all of the controls are built
into the right earbud you simply tap to
start and stop your music or swipe
forwards and backwards to change the
volume now what's amazing is when you
paired your pixel buds with your pixel 2
you get instant access to the Google
assistant we optimized the experience to
be quick and easy just touch and hold
the earbud and ask your assistant to
play music send a text or give walking
directions all while keeping your phone
in your pocket it can also alert you to
new notifications and read your messages
pixel buds work great with pixel they
even give you access to a new real-time
translation experience it's an
incredible application of Google
Translate powered by machine learning
that's like having a personal translator
by your side to show you how easy this
experience is I'd like to invite Isabel
back on stage for a conversation in her
native language Swedish so Isabel is
going to speak Swedish into her pixel
buds and all hear the English
translation out of pixel twos front
speakers and then
I'll respond in English we go and she'll
hear the Swedish translation in her
pixel ones
to illustrate this today you'll hear
both sides of the conversation okay
hey Isabel how's it going he needs a Ben
who that nagging he open a pack that's
fast
what do you think of these cool new
headphones vertically under my cool
under her Lumina mitten the sign another
dollar to go make a mistake Oh blah so
what were your up here what color should
i get midna LuAnn hi we can fix the
Evalia hmm
yeah throw down sky blue one scallop
acid a rule you are brown or people can
make no CN or Fe under a gray today
between the tweeting there is speed
right it has to be fast to be used so
with pixel buds I can use real-time
Google Translate to have a natural
conversation in 40 languages or letting
you connect with the world around you in
a more natural way by rethinking how
headphone should work connecting it to
cloud-based machine learning and giving
you access with the touch of the finger
Gugu pixel buds come in a pocket-sized
charging case that provide up to 5 hours
of listening time with just one charge
and the case holds multiple charges see
you get up to 24 hours of listening time
when you're on the go
pixel buds are available in clearly
white kind of blue and just black -
beautifully compliment your pixel - and
they'll be available in November for
$159 and pre-orders begin today
the translation I mean we have one more
product to show you it's about
photography now we all love photos a lot
of our photos let us step back into a
moment with friends with family some of
our favorites are the candid ones like
this they capture the essence of the
moment but the problem is to get those
photos someone needs to be the
photographer on duty waiting to press
the shutter button at just the right
moment and we were thinking how do you
capture those fleeting spontaneous
moments while letting yourself be part
of the moment so we've been working on
that and I'm really excited to share an
entirely new type of camera that work to
make your pixel what we call it Google
clips and this first edition is
specifically designed with parents and
pet owners in mind so you can capture
more of those spontaneous smiles first
steps and first tricks now cliff's has
all the things you would expect from a
great camera a high-performance lens a
powerful image sensor it has a shutter
button but that's not what this camera
is all about we reimagine this camera
from the inside out starting with the
software and applying machine learning
to build a camera that takes photos for
you so you can enjoy the moment and
instantly get shots you couldn't get
before thank you
how does all of that work it starts with
an AI engine at the core of the camera
let's talk about what that engine does
when you're behind the camera you look
for people you care about you look for
smiles you look for that moment your dog
starts chasing her tail clips does all
of that for you turn it on and it
captures the moment so you can be in the
moment and because the software is at
the core
the camera it's gonna get smarter over
time
we also reimagine what camera hardware
should do for you clips is tiny it is
almost nothing so you can easily toss it
into your pocket and it's a hands-free
camera so you can get these amazing new
perspectives on your experience and get
yourself in the shot by attaching clips
to almost anything or setting it down
now from the beginning we knew privacy
and control really matter and we've been
thoughtful about this for Clips users
their family and their friends let's
start with the basics it looks like a
camera and it has an indicator light so
everyone knows what the device does next
it looks for stable clear shots people
you know and you help the camera learn
who's important to you and finally all
the machine learning happens on the
device itself so just like any point and
shoot nothing leaves your device until
you decide to save and share it this
approach to designing and engineering
clips required some significant
technical breakthroughs to miniaturize
the type of powerful machine learning
that only a few years ago needed a
supercomputer let's take a look at what
Clips actually captures so here's some
clips I've captured with my family at
home now as you can see it's not just
photos that clips is taking taking
little snippets that capture the whole
moment we call those of course clips you
can save them as a motion photo or
choose any frame to save as a
high-resolution still it's like having
my own photographer shooting and
choosing the best moments for me and I
just have to swipe to save to Google
photos which can automatically make
movies out of your clips in seconds so
that's the new Google clips a new type
of camera that brings together the best
of Google AI software and hardware tell
people more is
we captured genuine candid moments of
family friends and pets clips we coming
soon and selling for $249 take a look at
some of these great clips from our
earliest users enjoy regarding insistent
regarding this product right here is
this idea of like passive computing
right lately where the device or
software can predetermine what you might
want and then do it so you don't have
two buds and clips blends AI with the
best of Google software and high
performance hardware to create new
radically helpful experiences for users
this is our strategy for the Google
hardware team and you've seen it come to
life in all of our new products the two
newest members of the Google home family
the beautiful new pixel phones and our
premium pixel book laptop and of course
the Google assistant is the primary way
we bring an AI to our users your
personal Google is ready to get you to
help you need when you need it
talk to it type show what you see or
just give your phone a squeeze it's the
simplest way to get things done and it
just works so here it is
this year's made by Google family
we've created them as a single set of
products that are designed for you with
familiar elements from soft materials to
curved lines and simple stylish colors
they look great together and they also
work great together and perfectly
demonstrate our approach of reimagining
hardware from the inside out
