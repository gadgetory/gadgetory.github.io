territory you know me I'm always trying
to encourage the ambitious the strange
the weird this is what this is bone
cooler d DV die by this is a Willie do
special as usual a phone cooler an
active phone fan cooler for the hardcore
smartphone users likely gamers I would
guess 5,000 rpm semiconductor
refrigeration that doesn't get your
juices flow and I don't know what does
the cooling effect is two to three
degrees which not only ensures the
cooling effect of the mobile phone but
also prevents the phone from freezing
freezing Wow see this is like a
marketplace I don't even know about and
meanwhile it's probably booming in China
the heat dissipation effect is an
awesome definitely a winner among all
the mobile phone cooler that's like
that's like a Donald Trump type of
sentence right now
a definitely effective and awesome
cooler for all the needs necessary there
you go now will told me to go easy on it
he said it's a prototype I don't really
know how to go easy so I'm sorry about
that well oh it looks so cool I remind
you like when you shave your head you
know the Clippers power light I don't
know why it has a light frozen shell I
see the little tiny fan in there and
then there's some sort of conductive pad
des gonna pull heat away and this is
spring-loaded so it could fit various
devices I'll try it out on a couple
there is a micro USB charge cable to
charge that thing up will come come you
in the show I'm trying to do a video
you're over there screaming and yelling
this is the biggest release of 2019 so
far okay there was a keynote and they
hired Tim Cook for this you know with
live streaming it could potentially get
hot as well your phone your big live
stream maybe no no not at all who knew
what about vlogging well there's one
thing we should mention like here
everything has air conditioning like
everywhere you go is air conditioning
yeah boy like I've been places dude
I've been around your world pretty
fortunate I was in China I was in India
and I'm telling you it's not air
conditioning everywhere you go if you
leave your phone on the dash you know
hot it can get oh yeah it can cook yeah
cook an egg on it definitely so as far
as eggs go how do you like to eat them
uh I like some over easy sometimes
scrambled
you ever poached for watching is great
you poached further - the noodles wow
look at you you're a chef
yeah what about you it's mostly a lazy
thing I mostly just scramble it I'll put
a little bit of steak spice no no no no
not barbecue sauce steak spice like you
know it's a keg you've got like the
pepper oh yeah it's like a strong place
yeah
okay paprika and without this we are
typically we're cooking just right on
top of our smartphones exactly with it
now we don't have to do that anymore you
can actually use our stove instead it is
normal for the product to produce small
amount of steam or water drop during
operation mmm condensation all right so
I have a 1 plus 7 Pro over here goes
like this that's your look right there
look at you you're ready for a gaming
session right now you know I blew my
mind when we were in China everybody
talking about competitive gaming on
phones mmm for rural tournaments MLG
status but on phones do we have any
juice going on here I think we gotta
plug it in no battery it's a power
Cory's no battery you would probably
have your phone powered because if that
thing goes off you got a million dollars
on the line well they don't want
dangling the turtle let's do the stress
test with out and then with touch go
touch yeah it's very very cool when you
touch the side of your freezer
it's very how often you do that every
day whoa it's icy so what we're doing
over here I'm running a stress test on
n22 and I'm running a stress test on
what well and to to the stress test is
happening without the cooling factor
involved after that's finished I'm gonna
run it with the cooling unit and we'll
see if there's any difference all right
so the stress test has been completed on
here list the one I'm interested in
battery temperature you see it scaled up
over the course of the stress test to
around 40 Celsius by the end of it so
that's interesting that's that's the
area we're gonna be looking at I would
personally be happy just to see a lower
battery temperature than 40 Celsius by
the end of it yeah I think that gonna
make a difference I think that would be
cool anyway let's go ahead let's run
this test again with the cooler on and
we'll come back in a short moment when
these cookies are baked 96-97 yeah there
we go okay what do we got
battery temperature never quite hit 40
but it was right there like 39 well it
made a little bit of a difference a
little bit also the disadvantage on the
second test being the fact that the
device was already sort of heated up so
you got to keep that in mind
you're a degree cooler whatever that
means to you but as it says in the Box
there are limitations to this type of
tech and how cold it can actually be it
works a little bit who's it for I mean
it's pretty heavy-duty it's for the hard
core for the big dogs it's for the
oldest types if your phone has like no
water resistance you actually get some
water droplets on there I don't know
it's a cool-looking thing it's a funny
little contraption if you think you need
this you you're a certain person like
you already know probably all right
exactly what I need it's called the
cooler and it's out of control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
