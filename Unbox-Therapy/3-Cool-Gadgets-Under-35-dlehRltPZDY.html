listened this might be the most popular
series on all of YouTube now I can
either confirm nor deny that part of it
but who knows if you guys keep watching
it could very well become that this is
three gadgets under a certain price
point and today it's three gadgets under
35 bucks
this one is $34.99 this is 22 bucks and
this is anywhere from like 15 to 50
depending first off this little thing
here it's a stinger emergency escape
tool powerful steel punch life-saving
USB car charger fits in your cigarette
lighter section a lot of people have USB
chargers in there which is cool but this
one gives you a couple of extra features
a hardened steel spring-loaded punch
this little thing with a tiny little
flick can shatter glass in a previous
video I showed a glass breaking tool
that was built into a pen oh there's
something kind of satisfying about that
Oh what good is an emergency tool if
it's not on you or in your vehicle when
you need it it's also got a razor-sharp
seatbelt cutter
you crash you're trapped in the vehicle
this thing can slice the seatbelt you
can jump out save a life the whole time
it was charging your phone because it
was just your phone charger anyway 2.4
amp USB ports so 34 bucks for a 2-pack
or 22 bucks for one hey Jack a little
stocking stuffer for a loved one you
kidding me moms for their kids wives for
their husbands husband's for wives kids
for the moms this section here is the
powerful spring-loaded portion how does
that work though you just know ah
who you push it against the surface and
it pops out super powerful little indent
in there wow you know that scene which
is everybody's worst nightmare the car
veers off submerge into a pond or
something god that's the worst nightmare
everyone's had that nightmare at some
point
oh no problem I'll take my little
charger Cub ooh now there's also the
little seatbelt cutter on here it's a
sharp blade up here but it's protected I
think that's a genius little gadget to
have if it actually comes into play at
some point in your life that could
actually be priceless next up we have
this guy here now you guys might think
I'm weird for this one alright the
electro fan micro Wireless it's a tiny
little magnetic speaker but it's also a
sleep machine so I actually sleep better
with white noise in the background it
helps me sleep a little bit deeper and
then other noises going on in the house
are less likely to wake me up as well
this little device here gives you a
number of different options for sleep
related kind of white noise it says it's
got ten different sleep sounds five fan
noises four white noise and one ocean
for sixteen hours of sleep sound you'd
be surprised
trying to find good white noise on your
phone for some reason a lot of these
apps you can hear like where the audio
loop takes place it'll be like a little
click or a little flick and it's
absolutely annoying
maybe I'm about to sleep better than
I've ever slept before nice and we have
silica gel it's been a while kaboom oh
wow it spins look at that if you want to
have it as a little tiny party speaker
you push down on it and look at that it
can you can redirect the focus of it
power play pause skip tracks and volume
probably dead
Oh
oh my goodness that is so much better
than my phone
listen to how relaxing that time you
sleep with white noise a fan
this I think is better
tell me you're not more relaxed you're
lying okay this is the waves
that's pretty nice I don't like the
inconsistencies though
no too abrasive oh I mean listen it is
what it is right it ain't it ain't the
$3,000 dvla speaker that's not really
the intended purpose though and it's
probably not the reason I'm excited it
is kind of nice to have a little speaker
but really it's that white noise
capability it's way better than any app
I've heard in terms of the quality of
the sound last up we've got this little
guy right here I USB store you can see
this is the 16 gigabyte version but it
goes all the way up to 128 it works with
iPod iPhone iPad and Android very quick
physical storage that you can use with
your mobile device to offload images
store extra stuff maybe you want to put
media files on here and then quickly
move them over to your device this guy
right here can do it up to 32,000 songs
up to 200 full movies and not
everybody's addicted to the cloud yet
you should see what Jack's got in the
cloud it's a huge problem is it metal
feels like metal that's pretty nice all
right this is a crazy little contraption
a lightning connector boom on the other
side traditional USB connector you lift
this guy up here and now you see micro
USB gonna prompt me to head to the App
Store to get an app for this so mobile
disk that downloaded pretty quickly you
can see that this device here has 16
gigabytes free arrange your video files
your image files drag and drop into this
device and then you can play them back
right from here essentially this is a
way of not only expanding your storage
back and forth between the phone and the
device but also putting files onto the
device that wouldn't necessarily
natively be played back on the phone I
will link this down in the description
along with everything else that I talked
about so there it is three cool gadgets
your favorite series if you want to let
us know what your favorite keep those
thumbs coming like you've been doing</div></body></html>
