mentioned yesterday on Twitter and
Facebook oh by the way if you don't
follow me there in those places you
might want to do so I'll put links
somewhere on the screen or down below
but anyways as I mentioned yesterday I
received 65 bucks there's two sheets
here five bucks on the second sheet 65
bucks back from Best Buy
via their reward zone which I actually
just enrolled in recently and the
question posed yesterday on those social
networks was if you had 65 bucks right
now to blow and Best Buy
what would you buy or would you put it
towards something bigger I haven't
decided myself I'm gonna go in and take
a look and see what's interesting
hopefully I can find something under 65
bucks but knowing me it might go towards
something bigger I hope not but anyways
um I decided to bring you guys along if
you got any ideas about what you would
do with that cash put it down in the
comment section so I can check out what
you guys are interested in but otherwise
I'm gonna go in see how I make out and
as soon as I'm finished I'll come back
here and update you guys give you a
preview of what to expect on the channel
because whatever I buy is gonna get
unboxed and get naked on a channel you
know how it DOS and you guys I'll see
you in a quick second alright later
alright so I got back home from my best
bike trip and as you guys might expect I
had no trouble spending that sixty-five
dollars in rewards own cash in fact I
spent a little bit more as I expected
might happen and you guys probably
expect it might happen too but there
were a few things that I realized I
should have unboxed a long time ago and
I hadn't yet so I figured hey I'm gonna
catch up show you guys everything there
is you could possibly care about before
Christmas comes so without wasting any
more your time let's get a quick preview
of what's coming up on the channel so as
you guys will see over here a couple of
gaming related things we got Forza
Motorsport for the limited collector's
edition now I didn't know about this
edition I picked up the regular edition
and I really wanted this one it's got a
steelbook case as well as what looks
like an art book can't wait to check out
the extras that are included over there
I've also got Rocksmith for the ps3 now
this one kind of blue
pass me as well I don't know why I
didn't pick it up it's a really cool
kind of looking game here where you get
to hook up your actual real life guitar
to your games console and I also got
Metal Gear Solid 2 HD collection with
the three different metal gears you got
the number one two and three and they've
been uh pressed for the ps3 so you're
gonna get proper resolution better
graphics etc so we'll see what that
looks like on the inside and then this
was the splurge item a little bit
unusual but I've been looking at these
two helicopters every time I go in there
and I'm like to him those things look
cool so I said screw it they were on
sale I said you know what I'm gonna pick
one up so I picked up what's called the
Falcon jet pro it's got this cool like
teal color to it and I'm gonna get that
baby up and running pair it up with that
tank that I purchased a little while ago
and see if I can get that Toytown
destruction that you all voted for there
is a new weapon in the arsenal add into
the tank here I don't know what I'm
gonna use the chopper for maybe I just
run it into some of those little dudes
who the hell knows anyways you can see
over here I picked up my coffee that's a
big-ass coffee look at that baby there
and that's because I'm gonna get to work
and get all this stuff uploaded real
soon so stay tuned to the channel it's
the only place to be alright guys I'll
see you around
see you real soon later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
