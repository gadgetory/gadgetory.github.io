mentioned yesterday on Twitter and
Facebook oh by the way if you don't
follow me there in those places you
might want to do so i'll put links
somewhere on the screen or down below
but anyways as I mentioned yesterday I
received 65 bucks says two sheets here
five bucks on the second sheet 65 bucks
back from bestbuy via their reward zone
which I actually just enrolled in
recently and a question posed yesterday
I know social networks was if you had 65
bucks right now to blow at best buy what
would you buy or would you put it toward
something bigger I haven't decided
myself I'm going to go in and take a
look and see what's interesting
hopefully I can find something under 65
bucks but knowing me it might go towards
something bigger I hope not but anyways
um I decided to bring you guys along if
you got any ideas about what you would
do with that cash put it down in the
comments section so I can check out what
you guys are interested in but otherwise
I'm going to go in see how I make out
and as soon as I'm finished I'll come
back here and update you guys give you a
preview of what to expect on the channel
because whatever i buy is going to get
unboxed and get naked on a channel you
know how it dose and yes I'll see in a
quick second all right later alright so
I got back home from my best by tripping
as you guys might expect i had no
trouble spending that $65 in reward zone
cash in fact i spent a little bit more
as i expected might happen and you guys
probably expected might happen to but
there were a few things that I realized
I should have unboxed a long time ago
and I hadn't yet so I figured hey I'm
going to catch up show you guys
everything there is you could possibly
care about before Christmas comes so
without wasting any more your time let's
get a quick preview of what's coming up
on the channel so as you guys will see
over here a couple of gaming related
things we got forza motorsport for the
limited collector's edition now I didn't
know about this edition i picked up the
regular edition and i really wanted this
one it's got a steelbook case as well as
what looks like an art book can't wait
to check out the extras that are
included over there also got rocksmith
for the ps3 now this one kind of blue
pass me as well I don't know why I
didn't pick it up it's a really cool
kind of looking game here where you get
to hook up your actual real-life guitar
to your games console and i also got
metal gear solid 2 HD collection with
the three different metal gears you got
the number one two and three and they've
been oppressed for the ps3 so you're
gonna get proper resolution better
graphics etc so we'll see what that
looks like on the inside and then this
was the splurge item a little bit
unusual but I've been looking at these
two helicopters every time I go in there
and I'm like to him those things look
cool so i said screw it they were on
sale I said you know what I'm gonna pick
one up so I picked up what's called the
falken jet pro it's got this cool like
teal color to it and I'm gonna get that
baby up and running pair it up with that
tank that i purchased a little while ago
and see if i can get that toy town
destruction that you all voted for there
is a new weapon in the arsenal added to
the tank here I don't know what I'm
gonna use the chopper for maybe I'll
just run it into some of those little
dudes who the hell knows anyways you can
see over here I picked up my coffee
that's a big-ass coffee look at that
baby there and that's because I'm gonna
