today we're looking at a super
heavy-duty headset from Triton this is
the ax pro and what makes it special is
that rather than using emulation to
represent 5.1 surround it's doing it
through the use of multiple speakers in
each ear cup there are four physical
speakers in each ear cup and it's quite
the feat of engineering to have them all
working in conjunction to create a you
know audible 5.1 surround experience
something to mention is that this
headset will work with the PlayStation 3
Xbox 360 a PC or a Mac so even though
it's expensive at least you know it's
going to be compatible with whichever
device you hope to use it for as we get
inside the box the first thing we notice
is that there's another box and I fully
expect to see a number of accessories
and attachments in here because it is a
fairly complex headset the first thing
we see are some replacement ear pads and
they're also made of a different
material than the ear pads that are
pre-installed these have a smooth
leather like finish whereas the
pre-installed ones are felt same thing
goes for the headband which has a
replaceable pad as well I'll probably
leave the felt ones on these look like
they'll probably be hotter to wear for
extended gaming sessions that little
tool I think was to help you get the ear
pads on and off next we've got our mic
which is flexible as you'd expect and it
can either be on your left side or your
right side all you have to do is flip
the headset in the direction you want
let's get that out of the way next we
can pull out the headset itself
and this is a hefty headset I mean it's
not it's not portable well I guess it is
but I mean not in the sense of some of
the other options that are out there
it's definitely on the larger size so
here we can see our headset the amp and
the remote and rather rather than
struggle trying to get this stuff out
I'm gonna go ahead and skip forward so
we can be a little more organized there
we are so here's the amp I'll put that
down for a second and we'll get to that
but first we'll get the boring stuff out
of the way here is the documentation
from Triton first we have a mini catalog
outlining the different products
available through Triton and next I
assume is our user manual that's right
product manual and this could actually
be useful in this case given the fact
that the headset is fairly complex in
its abilities to be set up in many
different ways
here's the goodies box first we have an
adapter for the Xbox 360 microphone
input here is an analog breakout cable
obviously for analog surround sound an
optical cable which is the one I'll be
using out of my ps3 and a USB cable for
the headset connection to the amp next
we've got a slightly unusual power
adapter and the reason I say that is
because it's got two power leads which
is kind of strange but I do know that
one goes directly into the remote I
believe and the other one goes into the
amp here is our regional power adapter
let's go ahead and see how that clips
together it's actually a fairly nice
contraption here's that amp I was
talking about you can see it's Dolby
Digital certified we've got volume
controls
a time-delay a DC input here's the
analog output to a 5.1 analog setup our
mic and optical of course and here's
where the headset plugs in and as you
can see you can run two headsets off one
amp here's a better look at the remote
and as you can see it's got
independently adjustable channels which
is really cool it's also got a mic
on/off switch a voice volume wheel as
well as an Xbox 360 port in the event
that you're using this with an Xbox of
course we have an incremental volume
switch rather than a wheel meaning you
tap it and we've also got a little
legend here explaining your different
volumes based on LED colors here's how
the mic hooks in it locks into place
here's a better look at the mic here</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
