got a chance to sit down and announce
the winner of the very cool Eton Mobius
case this is that solar battery case for
your iPhone 4 or 4s very interesting
device if you haven't checked out the
video yet the inclusive unboxing video
I'm going to put a link somewhere over
here so you can go and check it out but
before I announce the winner I got a
couple of other updates for you guys I
know that a lot of you are going to be
upset that you didn't win but instead of
jumping to that thumbs down button turn
turn those thumbs up words how about a
thumbs up because I got a lot more
planned in the way of giveaways I do
love to give back to you guys for all
that hard work watching all these videos
and being part of this army so let's get
to some of those items a little preview
of what's to come this is not everything
but it's a preview of some of the things
I'll be giving away for free first and
foremost the Zelda Skyward Sword special
edition with the golden Wiimote and the
audio discs as well very cool package if
you haven't seen this unboxing once
again I'll put a link somewhere around
me here as well as down in the
description I know a lot of Zelda fans
are going to be excited about this
giveaway coming soon I've also got the
bricks in color shields if you didn't
see that video I'll put a link somewhere
for that as well this is for iPhone 4
and 4s it's a very cool protective
covering that doesn't change the
aesthetic of the iPhone - the color of
course whichever color you choose I've
got two extra white ones and a green one
I installed the juicy pink one if you
haven't seen that video these are really
cool so three people are gonna win one
of those and then lastly I've got
something kind of interesting it's a
copy of infamous 2 and you're saying
right now - that game is ancient why the
hell are you giving that away right now
and the truth is because it was included
in one of those console holiday packs it
still sealed might I add so it was
included in one of those holiday packs
and and I've already got the game on in
fact I unboxed a special edition I
believe it was called the collector's
edition but anyway the one with the
statue in the bag and all that stuff so
anyways I have no need for two of them
so I might as well give back to you guys
if you don't have the game it is a great
game and also you might want to give it
to somebody else who doesn't have it so
very cool and that's a couple of things
I got more planned as I said before but
I'm not going to waste any more time if
you're
crossing your fingers hoping you're the
winner of this Mobius I'm gonna get
ahead go ahead and announce it now so
you don't have to wait any longer so
I'll jump onto my iPad here and grab the
name of the winner the winner who
successfully tweeted out this contest it
was simple just click the tweet button
on the website and that was it

Arry ka and @ Barry can I'm gonna stick
your name somewhere over here as well

shipping information and I'll get this
baby out to you and hey if you don't
