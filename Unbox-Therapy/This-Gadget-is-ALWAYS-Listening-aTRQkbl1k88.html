called the capture with a k' because
it's 2.0 and i think it might have been
on kickstarter what is this thing it
plays back what you've just heard you
can tap it to save and share what you've
just heard it's always recording but
only when you tap on it after the fact
and let it know that you want the last
60 seconds I if you're in a kind of
environment where you got a guy like
Jack waltzing around this is exactly
what you need cuz the man says some
crazy stuff when he decides to speak
look at that oh ok charge it up yeah it
pairs via bluetooth good when it's
running it's blinking then you tap and
it will save the last 60 seconds maybe
you're at a bar some dude wants to fight
you're like no officer I've got the
recording you can see how it went down
yes
again looks like a watch actually looks
more like one of those Fitbit trackers
you get the charger was that magnetic
yeah does this have power needs to be
paired with your phone via bluetooth
before you can get started charging up I
downloaded the app by the same name
capture with the K saves the previous 60
seconds of audio every time you tap this
screen we just did something offering oh
that is weird dude yeah it's flashing
green every five seconds so it's in
listening mode so everything that's
happening it's recording now I should be
able to tap it twice from this mode at
any given point and get the last 60
seconds of discussion oh wow not the
buzz it's doing two different clips
maybe that's the issue it can store 25
clips before transferring via bluetooth
okay there there I went in listening
mode right now okay I think it was just
getting an update
now I should be able to tap it twice
from this mode at any given point and
get the last 60 seconds of discussion so
let me do that that was it oh no I did
that was it I didn't do it I didn't do
it on the right spot you got to tap it
right in the middle it's tapping YouTube
and I see what they're saying deliberate
it's not like huh
it's like hmm I'm getting them figuring
the top out from here it works every
time
hey how's it going nice to meet you blah
blah blah hey bowling
nice to meet you blah blah blah so this
thing's been charging for a little bit
longer the green is good Green is good
it means it's listening okay I got it
that was deliberate now I should get a
notification on my phone that it's
transferring so it seems like even when
it fails a transfer the clip is still
saved here so even if it runs out of
battery or this guy saves the last 25
clips when the charger goes instantly to
listening it's just so weird to hear
what I just said nerds
it's just weird the green is good Green
is good it means it's listening so in
here I can trim them add a description
add a filter change the volume reverb
etc I can attach an image or a picture
to these memories deliberate push okay
I'm getting the hang of it now they want
me to tap it again to retry so I mean
it's kind of a little bit hit-and-miss I
guess the good part here is that it's it
is always stored mmm it's only one file
maybe I did lose those two that time
it's a little janky knock knock who's
there double tap so far it's like 50/50
maybe knock knock who's there double tap
I don't know what to tell you guys it
appears to be working let's put it that
way it's just like when it comes to
transferring the clips to the phone
things get a little strange and I guess
you just put it on but you don't think
about it and then that moment strikes
and you're like and then you just got
all of that whatever that was and then
that moment strikes and you're like</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
