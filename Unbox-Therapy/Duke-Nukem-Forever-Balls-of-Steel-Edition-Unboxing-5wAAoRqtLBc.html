therapy and today we're taking a look at
the balls of steel edition of Duke Nukem
Forever and before we get in here I want
to mention that I've got two sealed
versions of this I'm gonna be giving one
away so go ahead and click the subscribe
button so you can be updated about when
that giveaway goes live until then let's
get into this box here so you know
exactly what you're gonna be eligible
for and exactly what comes in this box
if you end up buying it so first things
first we see hail to the king baby we've
got a bunch of different paraphernalia
in here I'm gonna go ahead and put most
of it to the side for now and after I
get everything out of the box then I'm
gonna give you a close-up of each thing
now you might see below here I've got a
book that's the official strategy guide
and the guys at Gamestop were cool
enough to give it to me for free I'm a
regular customer so they threw it in
let's put it this way they see my face
fairly often hard to stay out of there
you guys know so anyhow you can see that
we've got a dozen items or so here it's
lots of stuff in the most prominent
thing being the Duke Nukem bust that's
the last thing I'm gonna pull out and
it's got some serious weight to it now
I've heard people saying that it's made
out of plastic and it probably is but
it's definitely heavier than most
plastic items you feel coming from the
far-off lands in the east so anyway and
get you a close look at it you can
inspect it carpe Nukem is what it says
on the front and there you can see made
in China the wonderful land where
everything's made next we've got a paper
foldable Duke Nukem character big ass
Duke Nukem sticker a certificate of
authenticity for this edition
we've got our special casino style dice
then extra little logo on there we've
got a mini pack of cards and they
actually look pretty standard there's no
special images or logos or anything on
there they give you two poker chips not
sure why it's two but it is and then
we've got our special hardcover book
here with a lot of the artwork I like
these books they really do justice to
all the work that goes into creating
these games and help you to respect
exactly how sophisticated that work is
so next we've got a little comic book
Duke Nukem Forever comic book see all
the lovely ladies on the cover and as
you see it's super colorful super
graphic cool little backstory nice to
have we've got some postcards for your
friends and family or anybody who
happens to know and love Duke Nukem
there's a wide variation of images here
or you just keep them of course they're
collector's item just like the rest of
this stuff lastly we've got the game
maybe most importantly and I'm not
expecting any surprises in here but
we'll obviously have our super voucher I
believe it's called
let's take a look yeah there we go
bodacious add-ons a bunch of content so
let's go ahead and take a look at that
and then our mini manual which feels
like it's maybe five pages max these
manuals keep getting smaller and smaller
then again save the trees I guess I
don't know so lastly we've got the
strategy guide limited edition - it says
on it and like I said the guys at
stop were cool enough to throw this in
for me so they deserve some credit on
that that being said I had this thing
pre-ordered forever so they've been
holding my money for months and months I
think I deserve it deserve something
extra anyhow guys as I mentioned in the
beginning I'm gonna give away a sealed
balls of steel edition just subscribe
and stay tuned for that giveaway real
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
