therapy and today we're taking a look at
the HP TouchPad this is HP's first foray
into the tablet space at least as far as
an iPad competitor is concerned they've
had stuff out there in the market with
Windows on it but I don't consider that
to really be a true tablet true tablets
need to have their own dedicated
operating system and this one does based
on Palms original webOS but modified and
tweaked in a way that it might perform
better on a tablet platform so as you
guys know I've got a number of different
tablets with different interfaces and I
want to see how this one stacks up but
let's talk about the unboxing after all
this is unbox therapy so first things
first we've got a little bit of
documentation and this is always the
most boring part of the unboxing but
important nonetheless you need to know
what you're going to get in a box you
also got a microfiber cloth and let me
tell you I can tell already that this
device is going to require it it seems
to be one of those glossy fingerprint
magnets oh well it's got a pretty cool
little microUSB with some chrome accents
and also a way of keeping it organized I
don't say that often as far as cool USB
TV was a concern but this happens to be
one of them and also a cool power
adapter rather than be a square it's a
cylinder of sorts you got USB on one end
and of course your power prongs on the
other next let's take a look at the
tablet after all that's the most
important part of the unboxing here and
as I said and as I predicted this is a
gloss fest this thing is smothered in
gloss if you will now it feels good
though I mean it's sort of feels
comfortable just like an iPad 2 or
something like that and it it's pretty
light as well so you got your power
button up top it doesn't look like it
has any power I'm going to have to get
some juice in this to finish out this
unboxing but first let's take a look
around the device we got stereo speakers
so long as you're using the unit in
landscape mode and on the other side
we've got our volume rocker this thing
is very I pad asked it's
almost like everything is sort of in
similar location so if you've used an
iPad it probably feel familiar it looks
like a sim card expansion slot here on
the bottom top side has your headphone
jack along with your mic and as we keep
going down here
we also see our ipod esque power switch
on the bottom of the unit we just have
our micro USB now taking a look at the
front we have our webcam up top and as
we move down the device we'll see our
home button once again in the same
location as your iPad home button what a
surprise
so in order to get this thing up and
running we got to agree to HP terms and
conditions I think I'll do it what do
you say let's accept and I didn't notice
what you got a sign up for an HP web os
account this is a little unusual but I
guess I have no choice so here we go now
I'm going to hide this personal
information from you guys who knows what
you might do with it so after you've
done all that you get to this set up
complete window and it tells you it's
going to restart your device but it
takes a minute or two or ten this takes
a while so I'm not going to make you sit
through the monotony let's get to the
home screen so there we are after we've
rebooted now why not launch a web page
and just see how this thing behaves this
is not a review by any means guys this
is just an unboxing so I'm just going to
give you a quick look review is on its
way I'm going to do a big battle mode
comparison between the touchpad the
Galaxy Tab 10.1 and of course the
champion of this space for the time
being the iPad 2 so let's go ahead and
load up unbox therapy combine is a
half-decent website and as you can see
it's not the fastest on the market I can
tell right away but then again it's
loading up everything including the ads
so you've got to give it a little bit of
headroom because of that it's pretty
reactive to touch and it's a smooth sort
of interface as far as I can tell
straight away reacts to my input
immediately you've got this cool little
all settings menu up here that you can
toggle for brightness Wi-Fi any sort of
quick settings up here in the top right
corner I'll keep the brightness down so
I don't blind you guys it's actually a
pretty bright screen believe it or not
and then up here we've got a little web
tab for looking at some web settings and
preferences available in a browser now
as you back out to the interface here
you can see if you know anything about
webOS it's got this sort of multitasking
platform actually pretty similar to what
blackberry is trying to do with their
product and I don't have any of these
accounts set up obviously but I just
want to give you guys an idea of the
overall speed and feel so I'm going to
launch a few different applications here
again this is just as an overview photo
application seems to take the longest so
far but of course there's no photos in
there so kind of anticlimactic but
anyhow getting back to the browser let's
go ahead and try and launch another
window maybe a heavier web page let's do
engadget.com
about that and so when everyone goes for
when they're china show the benchmark
for a heavy page that page is friggin
loaded with content and as you guys can
see is coming up pretty quick
definitely well within the acceptable
range again this site is full of ads
full of content and one thing that I'm
super impressed with is this
pinch-to-zoom is crazy reactive it's a
there's no lag at all it's just maybe
maybe it's too quick I don't know it's
kind of crazy but anyway guys if you
haven't subscribed yet do so because I'm
going to be putting this tablet up
against the other market competitors and
hopefully with some testing we can
figure out which tablet might work best
for you thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
