PlayStation it's not every day there's a
new console well this it's not exactly a
new console it's kind of like a Midway
sword a new console it's the pro and if
you know me I got to buy anything that
has pro in the name cuz I'm a
professional this is the ps4 Pro and
you're probably wondering why does it
have that pro moniker what's so special
about this thing it just came out first
thing and probably most importantly this
is now a 4k gaming console now that's
not going to matter to everybody right
away because not everybody has a 4k TV
or display that's it going to hook this
up to but I love pixels if I could get
more resolution of course that's what I
want and this is the way to do it now
the PC people the PC gamers are out
there like but excuse me get whatever
resolution you want with some fat
graphics cards it's true but a guy like
me likes to sit back on the couch
sometime controller in hand super
relaxed I'll put the game on mute a
little NBA 2k 17 on mute with the
podcast running on the side
let's get inside I'm noticing that the
contents of the box and listed over here
looks like all the cables you're gonna
need are included spectacular graphics
if you don't have a 4k display you still
might see some minor improvements on a
1080p display you might get a few more
lines of vertical resolution maybe
slightly better graphics a more natural
appearance the thing has more horsepower
so theoretically even on a 1080p screen
is going to be some improvements support
for faster frame rates as well this will
stream 4k video from Netflix as well as
YouTube unbox therapy one of the first
shows in the world to be fully 4k
alright you can tell I'm excited here we
go
it's the old box inside the box trick
slides right out there's also some other
things that have been improved here for
one it's got a 1 terabyte drive in it
now one terabyte of storage and it's
also got extra USB charging capacity ooh
look how they did that that's a nice
little touch Jack the symbols from the
controller those are the feet that the
system stands on some attitude there
that's cool
it adds a USB port to the back so now
there's a third one two on the front one
in the back your land port for wired
connectivity if you choose to get those
sweet speeds there's also digital
optical audio out there's this auxiliary
port here for accessories and then the
HDMI out and I like how the power
connector is recessed in here two more
USBs these are the main ones that people
will use the buttons I like this I like
that they did this so I've had a number
of different PlayStation 4s but what
they've done here now is the power
switch is over on this side and the
eject switch is over here it's tougher
to mistake one for the other which
happens all the time especially with new
people that are using your PlayStation
maybe their Xbox users they come over
they're just slamming those buttons
getting the wrong results you can tell
seems stacked up I mean the design
aesthetic is pretty similar the pro is a
little bit wider this way it's a tiny
bit taller and the depth is roughly the
same it's got a little bit more
horsepower it's a little bit larger in
size in HDMI cable this is clutch you've
also got the very basic chat headset
it's to get you started I recommend
something better than this it's also the
new controller which I haven't seen this
one yet you can now see the light bar
from the front so essentially the same
there's also a micro USB cable and
that's about it so the unboxing
experience very similar to the stock
PlayStation but you're the one that
knows you've got a pro this also is
going to enable some improvements for
PlayStation VR some of those similar
enhancements that you might have gotten
on a 1080p display will also apply to
the PSP our headset you're gonna get
slightly smoother graphics enabled by
the greater horsepower of the pro unit
theoretically you'll have a better PS VR
experience smoother graphics and more
potential higher frame rates potentially
it's almost like a PC style upgrade
where same platform plays all the same
games but can just do so at a slightly
more optimal scenario there's a long
list of games that will see improvements
on the PlayStation 4 Pro so a quick note
about 4k resolutions in the ps4 Pro just
make sure that your display or TV
supports 4k at 60 Hertz to get the most
out of this now most newer tell
Asians do but it's something to check up
on before you invest in this system and
hope to get a beautiful 4k signal so
there you have it ps4 pro should you buy
it does it suck no I think I think this
is a cool step in the right direction I
think if you're on an old model and an
old TV it's probably a little too much
of a step because then you got to get a
4k display to really take advantage of
it and the system itself but if you
don't have a Playstation yeah you're
looking for something to do this holiday
season maybe you're a parent I say step
up to the pro future-proof yourself a
little bit so you're ready when you do
get that 4k display and if you already
have a 4k display then come on man get
yourself some extra pixels candy for
your eyeballs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
