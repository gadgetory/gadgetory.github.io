car what's the name of this car AJ no
idea it's a sedan no not like the old
roadster that they used to have I'll
give you a closer look right now so
here's a better look at it
it's actually quite breathtaking a real
nice looking vehicle and it's got some
really cool tech inside as well let's
see if I can get a better view of it for
you guys I'm gonna go around the other
side it's pretty pretty crazy pretty
crowded in here so you can see there's
actually a demonstration going on inside
right now
is a big huge touchscreen on the
interior the it looks like this
phenomena and why not is all a big huge
screen as well
a lot of interactive material inside
looks like it's got a web browser and
some other things going on multimedia
player down below it's all leather nice
luxury as well let me get let me back up
a bit give you a better look at the
whole vehicle oh the name Model S the
Tesla Model S for those of you wondering
nice big rims on there too anyway it's
an all-electric car right like all the
other Tesla vehicles like the Roadster
but this one looks a little bit more
usable a little bit more refined it is a
prototype of course but
there's probably gonna be a waiting list
for this one just like there was for all
the other ones a real nice looking
vehicle one of the many perks of coming
to this kind of show you get to see some
real cool cars to go with all the other
consumer electronics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
