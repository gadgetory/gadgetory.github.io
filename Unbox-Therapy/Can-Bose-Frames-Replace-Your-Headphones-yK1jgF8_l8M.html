you guys are hitting me up everyone's
telling me why didn't you check out
these Bose frames yet obviously legends
in the headphone Department what is this
it's a frame it's sunglasses it's
headphones what's it's all combined
what is Bose doing making sunglasses
well I'm about to find out these are the
frames these are the lenses I don't know
why do we have extra lenses well can you
tell me what's going on
Will's telling me nothing right now you
buy them separate so I guess it's just
to your own taste
they actually make these in a couple of
different frame styles this is my stop
we'll find out I got a big head so these
ones are called the alto black these
obviously more premium than anything
I've checked out in the past what is the
price point well 200 bucks okay not
crazy
now granted they're not gonna be perfect
for every single environment because you
can't wear sunglasses everywhere unless
you're Jack and he's always got
sunglasses indoors outdoors doesn't
matter at night Jack Nicholson there you
are
Bose Connect app I already have it
because I have both headphones that I
use there's a power switch on there on
the right temple it's also
straightforward I think I can figure it
out
unboxing experience to this point you
could tell it's uh what do you have you
have a case that looks like it is for
sunglasses that's because that's what
these are that ain't real leather ladies
and gentlemen this is the sunglass is a
classic type of frame Jack you like this
see that's it's like a Ray Ban sort of
you look at each individual arm and you
realize there's something else at play
you have these connection points over
here I'm guessing this how you charge it
up and that's gonna give you your charge
cable proprietary I'm guessing magnetic
so this fits on just like a magnet
that's actually pretty nice I like that
these lenses are are just gonna be the
same thing but mirrored finish so if
you're going for a different look you
have that option okay here we go three
two one actually these are not too
shabby am I fooling anyone Jack are you
fooled little fooled you might not
double take that if you sat in public
now it says ready to connect from me
over here so let's go ahead
you know Kirk you go you see the guys
they're listening to the audio at the
Blue Jays game they're sitting in the
crowd
you want to hear the commentary though
this is this would be perfect for that
those guys they can still hear their
surroundings yeah Jack that's your
surround I can hear the surroundings and
you need the shades anyway you're on the
bike you're recycler the jogging the
beach folk they got bees on as well with
the podcast playing with the audiobook
learning learning and living all right
let's play some tunes real quick here we
go that's it from now on Jack do videos
like this all right can you hear the
music right now
you keep Kirk hears it Jack hears it so
I do have it maxed out at the moment
okay first of all it sounds good like
I'm okay with it it's not a substitute
for headphones get that out of your mind
immediately your desist no no this is
this is soundtrack
that's a soundtrack it's so passive my
spatial awareness is normal but the
music is around you know what I mean
it's just bloating it's a layer within
the environment you're gonna hear it you
can hear it listen so this
implementation there's benefits and
drawbacks with the bone conduction stuff
there's more Rumble and vibration in the
low end this sounds like a small speaker
near your ear but it's very clear let's
see what happens when there's a lot of
bass nothing nothing well is that the
official performance on bass right there
terrible terrible bass just just just
just crunchy kind of scrambled eggs
mashed potatoes and popcorn popping all
right well you're coming in get in here
well what's the deal here well you got
all this detail break it down for me so
it does have a speaker on both sides
okay I've never met a one-button control
allows you to power yeah yeah yeah
if it's EPS and rejects calls koe and
call you simply pause music wails China
cannot work for Bose now so battery life
3.5 hours of streaming music it's up to
two hours charge time and 30 feet of
range okay okay ladies and gentlemen
these are not have fun does it not have
phone number replace your headphones you
know getting pumped up young and pumped
up your night a going to the gym you're
not lifting any weights that's not what
this product is okay you're not going to
lost in the tomb no you understand its
its secondary the music is secondary
when I put the temptations on there I
was okay oh it's bloating a little good
okay that's a different it's a very
specific genre not requiring a ton of
low-end you will put the modern stuff on
here Billy Eilish it turns into a
crunchy bar you ever had that chocolate
bar before yes that's great
yeah you had two crunchy with the toffee
in the middle it's a sponge talk yeah I
see this as a supplementary device it
will not replace headphones let's be
clear no let's be clear they do look
decent
the look is better than I expected your
weight is better than I expected
if you want any base you got to go
towards bone conduction you will get
some base there the bone conduction
thing is totally there is tickling you
there's a tickle so would you recommend
all no
No 200 you get some earbuds and some
sunglasses
maybe it's my lifestyle I just can't
immediately envision but guy like you
sure when I'm walking Otis go go for a
hike yeah
guy like you yeah I can imagine golfers
for some reason golfers I don't know why
he did it he did it he did it will he do
bringing the heat today
he's right golfers will love this you
won't try them on for the people you go
sir
let's see if it's for a guy like will I
can't see anything
what are you okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
