another video and today I have something
for you that solves a problem hopefully
it solves a problem for you that is the
scourge of the earth that happens to be
battery life the problem is up until
this point the expansion or extension of
battery life on your phone meant that
you needed this bulky thing now don't
get me wrong I love battery banks I got
a whole thing for battery banks I got 15
of them out here but if you can get it
in a case for your device that's also
compelling it's also appealing Apple
they came out with their own battery
case for the iPhone I made a couple
videos about it in fact in one of them I
even sliced the baby open to see what
made it what it is go watch that video
if you don't know what I'm talking about
but anyway this company here what do
they call thin charge thin charge and in
here is what I'm told
is the world's thinnest battery case for
iPhone according to the back here it
still got 2600 milliamp hours more than
a full charge for your iPhone 6s am i
right about this yes it can double your
iPhone standby time plus it's a case at
the end of the day so you're going to
get a little bit of protection out of it
and I need a knife and I don't have one
alright let's crack this baby open and
see just how thin the thin charge is oh
it's a gold one oh yeah that is you know
what this case kind of reminds me of is
the design of the iPhone 5 put the warm
tips their tips they're giving me tips
why is it warm tech warm tips is that
like hot tips but not so hot press for
one second to check the battery capacity
three seconds to start stop charging
there's an LED on this key and it'll
tell you how much battery life is left
in the case I like that you got some
feedback to tell you how charged it up
your case is you don't need to remove
your phone every single time you can
just of course charge the case and then
the case charges the phone know what I'm
saying looking around it I mean you have
all your cutouts you'd expect to have
microphone headphone jack how do you
to top comes off well that's easy just
how slim it is we're in 3 seconds to
start charging 1 2 3 oh sweet your
volume up button you just hold that baby
for 3 seconds and it begins charging
this is what Apple's charge case should
have been go like this now the case is
charging and pass through charging of
course to the device and essentially now
what do you have you have like a close
to a 5 thousand milliamp hour phone now
to get the Apple charge okay so this is
Apple's take on the charge case you got
this hump on the back I hope you guys
can see that just a very very strange
design and the crazy part about this
device here is it's only 1800 in 77
milliamp hours of juice versus 2600 so
this guy which again looks and feels
like a normal case slides in and out of
your pocket like a normal phone and it's
2600 milliamp hours and it's thinner and
shorter I mean these guys they've got
Apple beat their entire like giant R&amp;amp;D
department and thing charge over here
charge is pretty quick too we're already
up to 14% there's an LED indicator light
on the side it's flashing one time so
it's between 67 and 99 percent it'll
speed up in flash in two and three time
increments as it gets depleted and if
the green light is consistently on then
it's a hundred percent battery I think a
lot of people would notice next to no
difference functionally carrying this
around compared to just the iPhone
Barenaked that's it simple
why didn't Apple do this military-grade
stop yelling at me</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
