another video and today I'm looking at
something that I am very excited for I
don't think I've been this excited for a
product in a very long time I remember
seeing this thing when it was first
announced thought about blogged about
it's the analogue NT which is this
boutique style reincarnation of the
original NES that's the Nintendo
Entertainment System for anybody under
20 for me it is still the essence of the
entire video game world what this
company here is done with the analog MT
is upgraded the exterior of the
traditional NES in order to sort of
modernize it and give it a place in the
modern home entertainment setup using
the original NES hardware for the
internals which has been harvested from
old systems they're also incredibly rare
incredibly expensive possibly one of the
most exciting unboxings ever here on
unbox therapy that is the analogue NT
Wow completely aluminum enclosure cool
to the touch analogue NT first edition
designed by analog in Seattle Washington
the various ports for your controllers
you're still going to use the
traditional NES controllers on this
check out the upgrades here which type
of cartridge you're using so it's not
region locked you can use Japanese
cartridges or US ones you can mix the
audio in this location here between
auxilary or microphone that's
interesting analog audio outs over here
is where things are really exciting HDMI
out now that is the most exciting
characteristic to me that means you're
going to be able to connect this thing
directly to your flat panel set up to
your HD television and whatnot and then
this port on the back I believe is an
expansion port for Famicom stuff I'm
pretty sure on the top you see the slots
here now that's where you fit your game
in
oh that's a good look my friends there
you can see it with blades of Steel one
of my childhood favorites have all the
other consoles the latest ones but you
put something like this out there dude
what is that and how soon can I play it
Super Mario 3 Super Mario 2 wrestlemania
original super mario bros without the
duck hunt which is actually more rare
got to get the classic sia has a slot
for the Famicom cartridge I was right it
is a Famicom expansion part on the back
up to four players how cool is that also
inside the box they will include an OG
controller this is a must look at that
thing
how I conic is that controller be a
select start d-pad that's bringing me
back right there on its own power
adapter pretty simple single plug in and
you're done and that's it guys I come
over to your place you got that sitting
there you got this stack of games over
there I'm gonna be there for a while I
might ask you for a beverage maybe a
snack some popcorn and then I'm there
for a while I think it's that time that
we plug this baby in and I show you guys
a little bit of gameplay NES over HDMI
never thought I'd see the day let's do
it whoa
Oh junior college or pro hmm what
really I'm played in a while let me go
College the team's New York Chicago Los
Angeles Montreal Toronto Edmonton outage
bomb man
this is it's very clear the image and
it's running at 60 frames right now
1080p at 60 frames of course crop to
represent the four by three aspect ratio
of classic games and I just got to
remember I only have two buds to choose
from so I'm sure I got pass and shoot
oh-ho-ho-ho oh I'm I'm I'm in the zone
right now this guy can't catch me
okay so we got a four shoot Lee four
pass is there a body checking this I
can't remember oh they just scored on me
they just scored on me like first shot
oh ah
game just froze up that's like a real
life thing
the blowing thing but I will say it's
part of the ritual man it's the whole
ritual my body checking is weaksauce my
goaltending is ok though oh my
goaltending oh god get there Oh forgot
about how hard games used to be like
everything was hard nothing was easy
there were no easy games
I'm up I'm gonna leave it right there
one-nothing the best time to leave it
all right next up we have Wrestlemania
with the og mr. Hogan himself oh man do
you guys remember his intro music an
American fight for your right fight ball
your fight for your right it is this
rocky what am i singing right now
what should I have to do in this in
WrestleMania WrestleMania you know what
if I knock somebody down I'll be happy
Wow bam bam bigelow honky Tonk Man Randy
Savage Andre the Giant 7/4 Hulk Hogan
you say Hulk Hogan 6 8 303 pounds hell
yeah Hogan versus pokken oh wow
Oh
I'm getting beat up totally getting beat
up right now what do I need combos
somebody threw something in the ring I
think it was a weapon
well you know to be honest it's obvious
why it's so hard it's Hogan on Hogan
how can you be open where's she going oh
he pinned me man Wow
I how you gonna be Hogan even if you're
Hogan all right
so there you have it fun with the
analogue NT this thing is really cool it
brings something that is an important
part of my being into the modern era
it's a piece of art I don't know to me
so you really feel special putting your
old-school cartridges in there it's not
gonna be for everyone but it might be
for you if you're just the right kind of
weird like me all right thanks very much
for watching guys hope I gave you some
good childhood flashbacks if I did make
sure to leave a thumbs up down below and
I'll catch you on the next episode later
