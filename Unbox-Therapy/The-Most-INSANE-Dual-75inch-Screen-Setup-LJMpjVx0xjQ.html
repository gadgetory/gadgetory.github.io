single 75 inch TV oh I don't know maybe
two of them Vizio wanted to do something
big I said we'll help bigger your TV's
those are pretty big but if it took two
of them when you put them side-by-side
right oh we've been doing that with
computer monitors for how long the dual
monitor setup everybody knows about it
so why not the living room is it
innovative well of course it is that's
why I'm doing it maybe someone wants to
play video games in the other one
doesn't the 75 inch M series home
theater display from Vizio chromecast
built-in giving you access to your
favorite apps also use your smart phone
as your dedicated remote they call it
the ultimate remote well it's always in
your pocket so it probably is it
features high dynamic range better known
as HDR or HDR 10 Dolby vision ultra
color spectrum up to a billion colors 4k
Ultra HD because you know it's gotta
have the pixels and 32 active led zones
we have a couple of smart cast sound
bars the 45 inch vizio smart cast salvar
systems will they do
that looks so sick oh my goodness can
you believe it
dual 75 inch screens in a single living
room setup you want to watch a little
bit of Netflix also play some video
games enjoy a nice little film but it's
not just that either because these you
have chromecast and smartcasts built
into them I can select from my different
sources as you can see and if I jump
over to youtube I can select vizio cast
now I'm chrome casting but I don't have
a chromecast hooked up to that TV
because it is built-in and then from
there I can head back to the Smart cast
aspect that you can see I can control
the media from here so I don't need to
search for the remote control that's
kind of a cool implementation I'm always
losing the remotes anyways I'm trying to
show you what's possible I'm trying to
change the living room forever this is
all about tech overload that's a hundred
and fifty inches of entertainment
imagine it now video games movies sports
- sports that wants two games at once it
could be a party I should mention real
quick the subwoofers that came with the
sound system oh my goodness they go
underneath the couch and they grumbles
should we do a test I didn't touch your
remote just all off of here okay
check it out you feel it rumbled so from
google play music it's pulling the
artwork here so whether I'm in
SoundCloud or I'm using google play
music here or YouTube or whatever it
might be it's giving you a visual
representation as well now I expect that
for things like YouTube obviously but
with these other apps is kind of cool
too especially like the SoundCloud one
where it shows you across at the audio
wave get a nice big 75 inch
representation of that so there you have
it an absolutely insane setup courtesy
of Visio and the 75 inch displays who
knows this could be the start of
something groundbreaking it might be the
start of the dual screen living room no
longer relegated to just the office and
the monitors but no why not for
entertainment as well</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
