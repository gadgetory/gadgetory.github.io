one +60 in fact you can probably tell
from the box salute to speed there's a
McLaren logo this is the latest one +60
a collaboration between one-plus and
McLaren the speed that they're talking
about is in reference to some changes to
this device from the regular 1 plus 60
this one is gonna have a bit more RAM 10
gigabytes holy moly that's a lot of RAM
on a smart phone and also it's going to
have a crazy charge feature which is
what wheels probably in your email 30
minutes
oh they're calling it warp charge 30 and
that will offer a day of power while
they're saying a day's worth of power in
20 minutes in 20 minutes of charge oh
now we know in the past one plus has had
some of the fastest charging devices by
them improving that even further this
will probably be the fastest charging
device on planet Earth it's quite likely
and in case you were wondering about the
McLaren authenticity there is an
official product badge there so yeah
it's a real collaboration I do not know
how it differs in appearance from the
regular one plus 60 oh look at that
carbon fiber on the packaging ooh
so a special box as well look at that
right there fast and smooth that just
like you Jack or what huh whoa yikes
this is a real special edition going on
this is a heavy book what is in here Wow
McLaren historical stuff going on look
at the early 1 plus team wow this is
some thick stock as well will you
appreciate a thick stock of course you
do McLaren papaya orange and carbon
fiber speed design built for a fast and
smooth user experience see that jack the
color it actually makes the phone faster
that's not true at all obviously 30
watts of cool and safe power to charge
the 3700 milliamp hour battery to 50%
capacity in 20 minute holy moly
that is impressive so the device is over
here and oh it does look good what it
looks really good I thought it was going
to be super orange but
orange is just an accent oh that's a
pretty looking phone around the edges
here in the glass you have this amber
hue very subtle look at that on the
ridge
I've never seen an implementation like
that now of course the pattern on the
device has that carbon fiber look as
well you can see along the top there I
like how they did it it's understated
but a little special a braided type-c
cable in the same McLaren Orange look
that is a sturdy cable headphone jack
adapter in the same color in the fancy
charger right here capable of those
insane speeds 20 minutes for a day of
power there's a case they've also
included fittingly it is the carbon
fiber looking case look at that little
plaque McLaren MCO 33 edition carbon
fiber oh that's some actual McLaren
carbon fiber up there
that's McLaren grade carbon fiber that's
fun that's fancy so when you boot up the
device you might think that you know
that sort of looks like one plus sixty
and that's because they left it mostly
the same they didn't go overboard with
like a car on the background or anything
like that but it is a bit different you
can see the orange accents here to go
with the orange accent on the phone the
cable under the theme settings there's
now a McLaren option that's the one
we're looking at here but you can of
course switch back to the standard one
plus themes now otherwise you're looking
at a regular one plus sixty spiced up a
little bit you got more RAM so
theoretically more performance in that
department and then of course you quick
charge power brick to get it charged up
a little bit faster it's gonna be
pricier though so keep that in mind
what's the retail price going to be well
699 bucks it's a few extra bucks on top
of a regular one plus sixteen but if
you're a car fan a special edition fan
or just an orange fan you like the idea
of what might be the fastest charging
this out there a bigger Ram a bit of a
boosted one plus 60 plus a cool little
book and some McClair and carbon fiber
and I guess you get the case too so in
that sense maybe you can make the case
see that you see what I did I think it's
pretty cool I actually think it might be
my next switch as well I'm on Niska
right now it's no time for me I'm using
the pen but I got a switch to something
else eventually and I've had my eyes on
1/16 to begin with
now you add this special one to the mix
might be calling for my SIM card a
little bit making you might be saying my
name you think it's cool let me know
down in the comments and I already said
there you have it I already did that
which is what I normally would do at
this point right now I already did that
so there's no other way we can't get out
of here we're here forever now
