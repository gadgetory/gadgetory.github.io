recent video of course you did right
because you watch all my videos my
recent video the apex phones I saw so
much promise in that particular device
and also the response from you guys was
substantial I decided to keep the train
rolling down the tracks sort of that
apex phone obviously a concept but it
had some features and functions that
will eventually trickle down into the
marketplace in different ways probably
sooner than you might think now in front
of me it's not an apex this is a thing
that you can buy right now and the one
feature it carries from the apex which
is interesting to me is this in display
fingerprint scanner what we have dual
pixel sensors six gigs ram 128 gigs of
storage also you will see that vivo is
sponsoring the World Cup this year and
I've got a little bit of info a little
bit of Intel there they may be launching
something close to that
apex device at that moment in time who
knows for now it's the X 21 and I want
to see if this end display fingerprint
scanner is the real deal how about this
box look at that little color shift
going on that whoa why does that smell
so fresh like fresh soap wealth
it's like fresh soap in here this is a
whole new opportunity for manufacturers
some type of scent when you open a box I
just gave you a free one well who saw
more boxes they make you point it back
at me okay in case you can't see it
world cup baby a headset which looks a
little better than average I actually
look at that it's an in-ear style clear
case here with a rubber edge to it
that's one of the better three cases
that I've ever seen here we go
the x21 dual camera layout up here power
switch volume rocker above that SIM tray
is on the bottom of the device along
with the USB port and speaker let's try
to boot this up so the first thing I'm
noticing here is the display quality it
is AMOLED it's only 2k I would rather
have a high quality display then focus
exclusively on resolution above 2k look
at that that's a nice display there you
can get a sense for the screen to body
ratio so the back camera unit is two
separate cameras one of them is 12
megapixels the other 5f 1.8 and F 2.4
and then on the front it's a 12
megapixel selfie camera at F 2.0 it's
kind of a mid-range device with the
Snapdragon 600 series chip inside of it
and there's not any particular feature
here maybe besides the display which I
will consider to be outstanding
except for this feature that really
compelled me to look at this device this
retail version of the in display
fingerprint so that's what we're gonna
evaluate in this video so here we go
this is the moment of truth
register a fingerprint let's go now it
also gives you an option here to choose
the animation style for fingerprint
unlock there's three different options
here for an animation I think it's kind
of cool so you can see when the screen
is off you have this dimly lit section
where your thumb should go but it's very
dim that's quicker than it was on the
apex of course on the apex phone it was
implemented a bit differently the size
of the region that could scan your
fingerprint was larger the eventual tech
were hoping for is like the full display
or half the display so you don't even
have to think about where you're tapping
it but this implementation here I would
say gets the job done
maybe better than I expected the tech
behind-the-scenes that's working through
the display to read your fingerprint is
not the same security level as what you
would get out of a capacitive reader on
the back of the phone or below on the
chin region you might be giving up a
little bit in terms of security but I
think there's something compelling about
that trade-off also if you tap the wake
button then you can really see where the
location is
is it a complete substitute considering
the fact that you're giving up a little
bit of security I don't think so and the
reason I'll say that is because the rear
scanner doesn't really bother me that
much this is the one plus 6
I mean they've implemented it they're in
such a fashion that's not particularly
offensive to me and it's quick vivos
going after it and the implementation
here is beyond my expectation so that
says something on its own and in fact I
can't wait to see their next version of
this for something so new age and
high-tech seeming plus you get the real
cool anime look at that I mean you feel
kind of high-tech so I appreciate
ambition in this space and this is
another example of it and as that pad
gets larger the practicality is gonna go
up even further if we can get a full
screen or even a half screen version of
that like had sort of been pitched on
the apex now we're talking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
