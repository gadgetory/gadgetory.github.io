therapy and by request we are looking at
the on live game system you guys voted
for it so let's take a look at it first
more unboxings on the way don't worry if
you voted for a different product it's
coming up soon but let's talk about the
on live game system after all this is an
exciting product fairly unique in the
marketplace in terms of gaming consoles
you got the micro console on the left
and a controller on the right and my
first impressions of this controller
that from a size and weight perspective
it's very similar to an Xbox 360
controller except for the layout of the
analog sticks of course next you've got
the micro console damn that thing is
tiny unlike the other consoles on the
market but after all this is cloud-based
gaming so you don't need a ton of
hardware on your end a lot of the
processing is happening elsewhere we've
also got a little bit of paperwork from
online including this quick little
startup pamphlet that tells you how to
get everything up and running you're
gonna need to hook up your HDMI cable
LAN cable AC of course you're gonna need
power and then you're gonna want to
insert your double-a batteries into the
controller sync it up and you should be
ready to get on live now underneath this
flap is everything else you need to
completely get up and running if you
will you've got some cables down here
the AC adapter as well as two double-a
duracell so you're not gonna have to go
out and scramble to find some of
yourself I always enjoy when the
manufacturer gives you everything you
need to get started but something that
surprised me here is you also get a
rechargeable battery pack if you prefer
it's nice to have that option of using
either a rechargeable battery pack or
doublea's whichever is more convenient
for you at the time and that we've also
got this power brick a fairly small
power brick but when you consider the
size of the console you know it should
be small right you know you're not gonna
expect an Xbox 360 power brick the
infamous gigantic power brick so here
we've got the cables as well again
you're not gonna need to go out and get
anything you got everything you need to
get up and running right in the package
you've got your networking cable as well
as your micro USB cable for charging the
controller and then lastly you've even
got an HD M
my cable you guys know I get excited
when the manufacturer gives you
everything you need including the HDMI
cable what kind of a person gets excited
about an HDMI cable well I do because
this is unbox therapy where we get
excited about products right so here's a
better look at those cables there it's a
fairly long microUSB cable so you can
actually probably use the controller
while you're hooked up and here's a
better look at that HDMI cable as well
and here's a better look at the
controller this is obviously what it's
all about you're gonna be handling this
baby more than anything else and I'm
actually impressed that first glance
this thing feels real comfortable like I
said earlier kind of like an Xbox 360
controller you've got your micro USB
along the top and this is how your
battery pack is inserted as I mentioned
earlier your you can use the
rechargeable battery pack or you can go
with the double a version completely up
to you whichever is more convenient I
love having that option right there I'm
gonna leave the rechargeable one in
there for now and as I mentioned earlier
very similar to the Xbox 360 controller
except for the fact that the analog
thumb stick layout is obviously
different more PlayStation style so it's
somewhere in between a playstation
controller and an Xbox 360 controller
but from a size and weight perspective
it's a lot closer to the Xbox 360
controller a little bit more contoured
the way the battery fits in is almost
identical they definitely took some of
their design cues from the 360
controller if you're comfortable with it
you'll probably be comfortable with this
now the difference is on the bottom here
you've got some controls that you would
never see on an Xbox 360 controller
including play pause fast-forward rewind
and even a record button I believe
that's because you can record your
gameplay I'll find out more about that
later but I'm very interested to see the
features and functions of this device
after all I have no experience with it
at the moment but I do have extensive
experience with the traditional consoles
so I'm obviously gonna compare the two
and probably give you guys some feedback
about how it performs what to expect if
you're interested in this device as well
now on the frame of the front of the
micro console you've got two USB ports
and what I believe is going to be your
power button obviously you're also going
to charge your controller via those USB
ports and along back you've got
HDMI connector a separate AV out I
assume that's for probably a cable that
you can buy as an accessory if you don't
have HDMI you've got audio out as well
as optical audio out your networking
port as well as your power port fairly
straightforward should be easy to set up
and I can't believe how small this thing
is this would be real cool to travel
with bring to your hotel room who knows
so anyway guys if you enjoyed this
unboxing then hopefully you can like and
favorite this video if you want to know
more about this on live game console and
let me know down in the comments and I
might be able to do a review or maybe
some gameplay to give you guys a better
idea of what to expect if you're
interested in the console so if you
haven't subscribed yet please do that
too and until the next video which
should be coming up shortly I will see
you guys around the channel alright
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
