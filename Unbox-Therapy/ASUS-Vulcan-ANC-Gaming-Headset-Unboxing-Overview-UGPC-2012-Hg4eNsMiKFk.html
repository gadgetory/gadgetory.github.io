therapy and today we're taking a look at
the first item of many in the ultimate
gaming PC project this is from a soos it
is the vulcan anc active noise canceling
pro gaming headset which is part of the
republic of gamers lineup that a soos
offers this is a very high-end gaming
headset with a removable boom mic which
is very nice because they can also be
used as a high quality set of headphones
what's special about these is that they
feature active noise cancellation which
is very unusual in the gaming headset
market much more popular in the
headphone market and finally it's
starting to trickle down into some
gaming headsets so here's a closer look
at some specifications you have a 40
millimeter driver 85% active noise
cancellation for high frequency noises
like that that your computer makes etc
you get 40 hours of active cancellation
with one triple-a battery so that's a
lot of usage while you're engaging the
active noise cancellation so let's get
into the box take a look at what's
included you've got a little bit of a
manual here that explains the operation
of the headset you can go ahead and read
that if you want more details then
you've got the warranty information
these actually carry a two-year warranty
so that's a little bit better than what
most manufacturers offer at one year
here's a closer look at the carrying
case which is nice and rugged it's got a
little bit of a hard shell to it the
Republic of gamers logo and a really
nice tough zipper to go with it and on
the inside is where all the main
elements of this unboxing are included
to the right you've got the headset I'm
going to put those to the side for a
quick moment don't worry I'll get back
to the headset in a quick second but
first I want to cover some of the other
items in the unboxing first and foremost
here's your boom mic which as I said
earlier is detachable
so I'll put that down as well and here
are the remaining accessories you have a
dual mono adapter this is to be used on
airlines etc and then you've also got
your cable which is also a very
important component in this particular
unboxing you need this to get your audio
to the headset as well as to use the
microphone here is the mic and the
control module it's got a
volume wheel on it as well as a clip and
here's a better look at the connection
points which are gold-plated and very
beautiful so here's a closer look at the
main attraction which is of course the
headset and you're gonna notice some
very nice-looking styling black and red
which are two of my favorite favorite
colors and when put together they make
probably my favorite combo and as you'll
notice here you've got carbon-fiber
accents there are two plates one on each
ear cup that has this carbon fiber look
to it which is really nice here is the
ANC switch this switch is used to turn
on your active noise cancellation this
is also where you plug in your boom mic
and your audio cable here is what the
boom mic installation looks like very
straightforward very simple on the other
ear Cup is where you place your triple-a
battery and that's a pretty simple
procedure so I'm not going to show you
how to do that I'm pretty sure you can
figure that out and that battery is
gonna power the active electronic noise
cancellation so here's a closer look at
the ear cups as you can see they swivel
which allows for a significant amount of
comfort you've got really nice soft
supple materials memory foam and once
again that black and red color scheme
which I really really do personally
appreciate so here's a closer look at
what they look like when they're folded
up and ready for travel it's quite
amazing to get a headset of this comfort
level with this quality of materials
that can also fold up into a very
compact package when you want to travel
with it or use it just as a high quality
headphone anyway guys if you enjoyed
this unboxing please remember to like
and favorite the video as it does help
me out a bunch and remember this is item
number one in the ultimate gaming PC
project I'll be making a playlist of all
the different components and you'll be
getting more details and information on
this particular headset as the project
moves forward and as we move closer to
the official build video if you want
more information on this headset pricing
availability etc there's a link down in
the description so you can go check that
out alright guys thanks as always for
watching I'll catch you on the next
video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
