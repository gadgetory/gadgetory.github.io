and today we're looking at the Griffin
slap which is a wristband for your iPod
Nano 6th generation as you guys probably
know there are a number of products on
the market from many manufacturers that
attempt to turn your iPod Nano into a
wristwatch it seems like ever since
Steve Jobs made the announcement of the
Nano and hinted at the concept of using
it as a watch every accessory
manufacturer out there has scrambled to
get something to market the first thing
you'll notice when we pull it out is
that there's absolutely nothing else in
the box and that's actually not a bad
thing considering usually when we get
manuals with these kinds of simple
contraptions they never get read and
they usually just a waste of paper
anyway there you can see the watch strap
in action it's basically similar to
those wrist bands you may remember from
when you were a kid that served no
purpose other than to be slapped on your
wrist the material feels like a smooth
silicone as you see when you pull it out
completely it goes completely stiff and
rigid not unlike the human contraption
that behaves the same way sorry about
that okay enough with the perversion
let's insert the nano and just as I
suspected it is far more difficult to do
this than it should be especially when
you consider you're supposed to take
this thing in and out anyway let's fast
forward instead of watching me struggle
and as you see here you can set the
watch to come up immediately after you
wake up the Nano and it's super easy to
put on I mean that's probably the major
benefit it takes two seconds but
obviously you sacrifice a little bit of
security that you would have with a
proper clasp anyways I hope you guys a
check out the channel we got a bunch of
cool unboxings there and peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
