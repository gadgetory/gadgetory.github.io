in unexpected product and an unexpected
video to be honest in front of me is a
drink tray a McDonald's drink tray I'm
fairly certain that almost everyone in
the audience has seen one of these at
some point in their life now of course
you could tell straight away that the
difference is this cover that's on the
top of it now on here there's a little
message it says enjoy your McFlurry flip
this tray play your tune and that's
because this drink tray does more than
carry drinks if you flip it up like this
it's actually a boombox
more specifically the McDonald's boombox
a stereo a little mini acoustic system
of course there's no electronics in here
it's just gonna amplify via the design
now this particular product is
incredibly limited and I think they gave
out about a thousand of these so here's
what they say pop out the speaker insert
your phone share your summer memories
all that really means is lift up these
folds here and we'll listen to music
just off the phone and then once I put
it in the McDonald's boombox okay are
you listening well so that's the speaker
on the phone is it maxed out it's maxed
out here we go
that's what it looks like when you have
it set up and now of course it redirects
the sounds I hear it is without the
boombox and now with again this thing is
not gonna blow your head off
right it's not gonna be phantom the DVLA
phantom it's not gonna be the diamond
box it's not gonna be it's not gonna be
the most powerful bluetooth speaker it's
not powered at all in fact it's it's a
completely non electronic form of
amplification so like those old the old
school you see the horn on the top the
gramophone you're winding it it's it's
just it just gives it a little tiny
boost the other half of the equation is
the fact that it props your phone up it
kind of makes the listening experience a
little bit more social than just playing
it on your phone putting your phone on
the table you can see something you can
watch something collectively together
remember this thing was given out for
free free that's zero so it's not even
like I can evaluate it like a normal
product instead it's just a nice little
touch to an object that you're already
so aware of that you're already picking
up on a regular basis whether it's from
McDonald's or some other place the drink
tray this standard drink tray which has
been the same I don't know my whole life
now I'm starting to rethink me everyday
because a couple of cool matter loafers
a couple is probably many cool students
at the University of Waterloo who came
up with this design right here think a
little bit different you come up with
some cool ideas a lot of everyday items
could be a little bit more unique than
they are right now it's possible this is
evidence the McDonald's boombox look at
that fold it back down ready to go
what's your McFlurry sir well what you
mean you might have an iced tea you
might have a coca-cola I mean that's up
to you but then you get that you blow
some minds and I check it out it's a
little boombox it's kind of cute all
right that's what it is there is a
certain
amount of novelty here right that's half
the thing I mean they even know that
they put the cassette tape in the middle
they're a little nostalgia for you
either way well done students at the
University of Waterloo
I appreciate this kind of thought forget
about the mundane the boring drink tray
those days are over it is now the era of
the McDonald's boom box and where did
you see it unbox therapy that's where</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
