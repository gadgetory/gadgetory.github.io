Dave
2d himself also known as the laptop guy
of the Internet
I didn't say that aka laptop expert
listen I'm here today to tell you some
gaming laptop stuff oh boy I played it
you're the perfect guy to have here to
tell us what do we need to know okay
about r-tx what should we look out for
in gaming laptops hold on what should we
avoid sorry to interrupt this actually
feels like I'm on a talk show like is
that is that weird not that I've been on
its show and we're talking our takes
laptops r-tx laptops let's hear it the
good they are powerful as heck you have
a nice-looking one here by the way sure
it's a AC Zephyrus if I'm not mistaken
that could be the thinnest 17-inch
gaming laptop so the good is that it's
you know you're packin a lot of power in
this thing right which is great the bad
I want to say like 50% more expensive
than I think they should be so last
year's device it's the 2018 devices were
so good so like the 10th series like
1060 1070 1088 with like fast greens 144
Hertz 6 core CPUs this is like basically
everything that anyone has ever wanted
in a gaming laptop they had them last
year they were reasonably well priced
and they were good and now they're
selling these they're more powerful but
they're just so expensive this is the
big issue gaming laptop screens are
almost all 1080p screens the problems of
these r-tx chips are geared to higher
resolution stuff and you can't even see
them I think in videos trying to push
this whole technology of great racing
like raytrace graphics look really good
and you can do it with these cards you
can do with these new laptops but
they're just so few games that can
support it right is this a case though
where the hardware has to get out there
first
and then the software might you know a
little bit of both but I think the
bigger issue is that it's difficult to
recommend this product to consumers
there's no real reason to buy it right
now even though there's a lot of hype
yeah around RT XL RCX right now yeah
youyou really think that people should
just be looking at older stuffs Levy's
generation not just that I feel like
they should look at older so if you're
buying a gaming laptop
right now in 2019 you should probably
look at holder stuff and even if you
really want an art text device I'd wait
the year out wait full like the next
generation of art GX to come out because
then you'll know our are there games out
there that are going to be supporting
raytrace graphics is this really going
to be a thing if you're buying art TX
Harbor right now you're you're betting
that the technology is gonna immerse I
think it will but it's gonna be like
five years before we see Navy years
gonna be a long time like if you're
running ray-traced graphics on this
machine you're only getting like 60
frames per second it's decent
anything less than that you're not even
getting 60 frames per second for
raytrace graphics so how much is a
person spending then 3 grand 3 grand
that's where they got a go if they want
ray tracing these things need to come
down in price it's not there yet
manufacturers are smart they know like
they price their stuff in a particular
way so that you never feel like you're
overspending because they're they're
putting that extra money that you spent
on that product on things that the
cheaper companies can't do what universe
are you spending on a gaming laptop I
think you start losing value after 1600
once you spend like 16 1700 bucks you're
like that's their best bang for your
buck like MSI GSC
thats it I'm not saying that's the one
that's the day I'm seeing that you pick
that a one if I had to choose if you can
afford it the msi GST 5 right now has
some serious value because they know who
has access to a guy like you to D I mean
they can watch you on YouTube everyone's
all hyped up about the r-tx stuff and
you're saying forget about it for now
if money matters to you alright if you
got if you have a giant budget and you
just want the best of the best shirt
artix laptops days but if you if you
care about your money and where you're
spending it wow it's a better option to
go with last year's stuff so it's really
it's on the software developers now and
they gotta make screens that are higher
resolution if I mean if they want to
take advantage
can we name any games that are there's a
couple anthem is coming out soon
battlefield supports that are ready r-tx
ray-traced that's one game all right
you want to buy a $3,000 laptop for one
game there are a bunch of r-tx titles
that are coming out yeah some of them
are pretty big some of them look good
but it's like I'd say wait wait for the
developers to get on board with this
rate trade stuff before you commit
because $3,000 is a lot of money with
the keyboard being placed below yeah
where it would normally be they do it
for thermals yeah we shift it down and
then now all the hot stuff can vent out
a lot easier how's the sound on it Dease
a lot of gaming laptops have trashed
speakers though it's weird yeah how much
gaming are you actually doing a lot I
play a lot of games eat overwatch SR I
was I was masters grandmasters did you
come on here just to say that that's all
I want to see I'm done I played it a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
