sapphire crystal and the digital crown
allowing you to take an
electrocardiogram so pretty cool tweet
from Tim Cook yeah I saw it last night I
actually responded to it some people
misinterpreted what I meant
you explained yourself it's a really
cool story though it was a Tim Cook
tweet relating to the Apple watch
more specifically the feature which can
monitor your heart and perform what is
it an ECG an ECG measures the electrical
activity of the heartbeat and it's used
by physicians to help diagnose certain
heart can diseases and in other
conditions and this is the first ECG
product offered over-the-counter
directly to consumers yeah no this is
this is serious stuff this is the kind
of thing if you had an emergency and you
went to the emergency room they would
immediately hook you up to one of these
if it was anything related to your heart
or shortness of breath oh they would
hook you up to a traditional version of
this and they would get immediate
feedback on on how your heart is
behaving or rhythm irregularities
exactly and so when they first announced
the latest version of the Apple watch
they made it clear that it was gonna
have this feature in it and a lot of
people in the crowd you know they
clapped because people been talking for
a long time about these sorts of
health-related advancements in
technology that could actually help
people not just apps like health apps
where you input your steps or you track
your calorie intake but but kind of like
almost more turning you into a cyborg of
sorts where you've got this biofeedback
of like how your body is behaving and so
if you go back to the tweet new Apple
watch saved my husband's life this week
that's that's a crazy tweet mm-hmm only
two days old and it diagnosed a fib so
that's a heart condition and a hundred
and fifty bpm
he went to the ER and he never did in
the past with those symptoms you just
thought it was nothing
and of course in the ER they found a
major blockage in his arteries as a
result gave him two stents and now he's
good as new telling the world thank you
I mean it's a it's an incredible tweet
in the tech world to see something like
that where a device that anyone can walk
into a store and buy
could actually save your life so Tim
retweets with comment and then I tweet
saying this is the best commercial I've
ever seen which it is and to give you a
little more clarity on what I meant by
that it's like here's a real world case
of an individual having their life saved
by this piece of tech like what better
case can be made for why you should pick
one of these up it's like you decide
Apple watch or death that's an
incredible proposal that's a very
dramatic statement it is but like that's
essentially what they've encapsulated in
this quoted tweet which is very hard to
do now of course most people don't have
this particular heart issue and both
people aren't going to be dead if they
don't buy an Apple watch but here is an
example of that actually being the case
and that's that's a really compelling
reason to pick one of these up
especially if you're in a particular age
group where where individuals do have
more heart problems or something like
that it's also a major differentiating
factor for the Apple watch versus other
wearables like this is not popping up at
least yet in other smartwatches so it's
something that exists in the Apple watch
exclusively and we can't say the same
for other Apple products there there are
fewer and fewer features that are
specific to one particular device so
anyway a few people got mad at me
they're like they're like of course
here's the here's the troll Lou talking
about Apple but they didn't realize I
was sincere in that comment I meant it's
the best commercial even if it's
unintentional even if it's not
intentionally a commercial it's the best
that they can possibly do because it has
that real-world element and those highly
elevated stakes of like this dude's life
was saved because he bought an Apple
watch that's intense mm-hmm and with the
Apple watch there seems to be a lot of
praise the fact that it is a health
hardware
mm-hmm you know and with these companies
that is making you know smartwatches
do you think that it's a good move for
them to concentrate on you know health
tech it's kind of funny with these
smartwatches like trying to figure out
really what they're most useful for
because they've been out for a while now
and you still the adoption rate hasn't
been the same as smartphones for example
do people really want notifications on
their wrist do they want to be bothered
more do they want games do they want
specific apps I don't really know that
really depends on the individual but who
doesn't want this outcome that this
individual had so the thing about health
is it really encompasses everyone
everyone cares about health to a certain
extent assuming they're alive and
breathing now an ECG is one version of
an instrument that can kind of give you
feedback on where you're at from a heart
health perspective but of course there's
probably other ones other instruments
you might see in an ER in a hospital
that could potentially be miniaturized
and put into wearable devices that could
be interesting for people I don't know
is there like some version of that for
blood glucose for diabetics I don't know
but this is definitely one of those
things where it's it's kind of a
proactive measure where you're like well
maybe nothing's wrong with me but if my
tech can tell me before I know it that's
compelling and keep in mind this they
got the watch and it just happened two
days afterwards yeah you know that's
quick yeah yeah it's a it's a quick
result it's it's really interesting it's
it's an amazing store it's one of the
better tweets I've ever seen like I said
assuming everything is as it appears
it's an incredible commercial
advertisement unintentional commercial
for Apple pitching the idea of wearing
this monitoring device on your wrist
