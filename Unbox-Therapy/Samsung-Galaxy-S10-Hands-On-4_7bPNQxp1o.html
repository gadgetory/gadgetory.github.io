world it is a big release day or launch
day announcement day everybody's talking
about the new Samsung device the Galaxy
S 10 in front of me right now I have the
s10 plus with the hole punch the double
hole punch people talked about it it was
leaked the rumors showcased it and now
it's real it's in front of us and this
is our first look at it so here it is a
gigantic display of course this is the
Plus version and the first thing the
first thing you notice is how that hole
punch kind of vanishes into the
background of the default wallpaper now
I was like hey but people want to see
the scale of the hole punch so I was
like let me go into the wallpaper
settings here they blacked it out in
every single wallpaper but anyway this
gives us a better idea of the hole punch
setup when we're just inside of the UI
and you know I don't know it kind of
fits into the to the top notification
bar it's the exact same height which I
don't mind then of course not having it
in the center kind of moves it to a more
a less utilized area of your screen real
estate so this is kind of gonna be up to
the individual in terms of how you
compare this to a knotch kind of
scenario but I guess at first glance
aesthetically speaking you're used to
having some noise up in the top corner
cuz this is typically where this stuff
lives you know your signal battery life
and so on so it does blend a little bit
better than the center knotch
form factor wise it's similar in scale
to the current Plus series the s9 plus
though the back camera also received
some upgrades as you can see right here
we've got three camera units that means
this device has five cameras the s10
plus is a five camera smartphone is
pretty wild so that's a six point four
inch AMOLED display now I've said in
past I'm generally a fan of the you know
the Samsung displays on smartphones they
make so many of them and they've got
these vibrant colors lots of contrast
very pleasing to a wide audience this is
no exception at first glance this looks
really nice I don't know if it's much
brighter than the previous version I've
got it maxed out here for the purpose of
this video but it looks good I think
you're gonna be satisfied with it so
let's go ahead and launch these cameras
okay so this is the front-facing unit
and it also has a wide-angle now it's
not the widest maybe Kirk can pick this
up real quick so this is the wide and
that's the close nowhere near the field
of view that the pixel gives you for
example this one on the other hand it
gives you a quick bounce out slightly
you know you have the ability to
probably fit two people in the frame one
there one there but then on the typical
focal range that's what you're looking
at all right let's do the selfie test
real quick what do we have shall we just
do a max Beauty just for the all right
max Beauty here we go we got lips what
do we do to the nose we shrink it or we
make it bigger oh okay this is on the
big set are you seeing this Kirk in real
time
okay that's big we're shrinking it eyes
will you make those bigger okay
the chin what what would people want to
do shrink that the jawline oh we're
sucking in the jawline folks and the
skin tone okay here we go this is max
max beauty I'm gonna try to look as
pretty as possible here
this is not me ladies and gentleman
that's not that's pretty that's pretty
me and you know they've done a
compelling version of it here doesn't
look cartoony it just it looks like
plastic surgery like that's what it's
starting to look like actual plastic
surgery that you don't have to do for
the price of a new smartphone you get
the old tuck the old stitch and tuck
what would it I'm gonna get rid of that
I don't know it's not the best selfie
I've ever seen if I'm being honest now
when it comes to some of the
post-processing stuff that can change a
little bit keep in mind this is like a
first this is an initial hands-on
scenario so maybe we can pick up a bit
more detail maybe some more contrast in
the way that the image is processed but
right now I've seen selfies I like
better
I just noticed a cool animation watch
the the top camera unit when I click
back did you see that there's like a
little light effect around the whole
punch boom fancy I do have to say the
the feel I mean I hate it when people
say that it feels good in hand it does
though this one actually it doesn't feel
like a huge phone it's rather narrow
it's obviously slim and I kind of like
holding it to be quite honest I should
take you around the device real quick
because I just noticed we still have a
headphone jack that's gonna be a bonus
for a lot of people I'm glad they did
that I mean you have a big device you
have the room for it now you got some
extra versatility you need to plug a
standard set of headphones in the jack
is there I really don't need to tell you
of course type-c connector as well quick
charge capable on the rear it's looking
like we have the three lens three zoom
situation so the default in the center
shows two trees that's representative of
the focal range course we can zoom in
further that's a nice looking image
and then wider this is 0.5 zoom so
that's pretty wide I'm into that okay so
that's the wide lens standard one times
focal range and then the zoom so as you
can see there the AI picked up that it's
a face that it's a portrait and it made
various automatic adjustments okay cool
so now we'll just show you all three ooh
that's pretty nice okay so that's the
zoomed in mode that kind of turned out
well that's the medium or standard focal
range and then that's the wide the wide
is quite wide I'm a fan of that actually
then it barely even juts out in this
case like that thing look at that that
lays pretty flat I mean completely flat
really that's impressive for a camera
module housing a three camera setup
including something that wide I'm kind
of happy about that all right staying
into camera modes you can see there's
also a pro mode which gives you all
kinds of access ISO f-stop you can
control autofocus white balance I mean
everything you would expect in a pro
camera is in there that's nice to have I
also notice there is a super slo-mo it
captures 0.4 seconds okay let's give
this a shot
super slo-mo is always fun man is it
going right now holy that's point eight
seconds of actual video Wow okay yeah I
mean that's super slow-mo now I do want
to take a picture something colorful I
just want to see the way this thing
deals with colors knows that it's a
plant
we'll try the close-up
you know what man again this is initial
interpretation but this rear camera is
looking real nice right now
look at the detail over here Wow
that's looking like that's gonna be a
real performer on the rear camera
another thing I was curious about
specifically with this cutout design
when compared to the notch is like
what's it gonna do in video mode
obviously people watch a lot of YouTube
a lot of video on their smartphone so
here you can see in the YouTube app what
happens during navigation fits into the
notification bar but it also looks like
the notification bar itself is fatter
than it would normally be to accommodate
the whole punch set up so you lose a
little bit of screen real estate there
now so that's zoomed in on the YouTube
video player and they should give you an
idea of how that whole punch is gonna
look when you have a full screen video
playing ya can interfere a little bit
and then you're like that little area
around the outside of it it's not really
useful to have that is that even that's
not even a millimeter of extra screen
real estate like that you're barely
using of course it looks cool it seems
futuristic but strictly from a
utilitarian standpoint is that really
that useful I don't know if this is the
future of designs it really feels to me
like this is a stopgap to the eventual
no cutout no not situation
I mean we've of course seen slider
situations motorized camera pop-ups for
front-facing cameras this just happens
to be the latest incarnation but I think
a lot of it is kind of just the novelty
factor in general one thing I will say
is that this is gonna make people feel
like they really have a new device like
that's what that ends up feeling like is
that this is a new thing this is this is
not something that has existed before
you pull this out of your pocket you're
like that's not my last phone it doesn't
look anything like it but as far as the
practicality of this particular
implementation versus others I honestly
don't think it's a big difference
but then again I'm a guy who on notch
phones I turn
off I just black it out so I kind of
find them all a bit offensive at least
here they are giving you to front camera
options so you're getting two lenses so
there's a bit of a payoff a bit of a
trade-off you get one wide-angle one
standard so you get some extra equipment
in exchange for that cut out Oh most of
it sound is still traveling out the
bottom it's a good sounding smartphone
I'm into it it's a good sounding
smartphone they thought about it just so
we have a comparison let's try that dull
beeping again see if we did any
enhancing for it
oh yeah this track you can your little
bit it's in the mid to high range little
more a little more detail a little more
crisp knit a little more crisp this 50
crunch Rice Krispies Krispy Kreme Honey
Creek cocoa print
you know what this is a nice little
package okay this is not gonna be cheap
though holy smokes this is not gonna be
a cheap device be prepared to get up to
that thousand dollar range if you think
you're an s10 plus kind of person
battery information oh there we go
breaking news 4100 milliamp hour battery
at least on the plus version that's a
big battery so think people can be happy
with that got some quick charge you got
the latest Snapdragon it sounds good it
looks good it's got a lot more in the
camera Department than the previous
version it's got a bigger battery and
there's a lot going for it I'm gonna
play with this device of course I'm
gonna use this device of course the SIM
card is going to enter this phone and
I'm gonna let you know how it compares
to some other stuff that's out there and
I'm also gonna let you know if there's
enough value here to justify the cost
because that's the conversation in 2019
and you already know it but there it is
it's the s10 plus and of course you can
tell it's wrapped in a beautiful D brand
if you wanna know more about that look
look for the link in the description
there it is unbox therapy stay tuned for
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
