cool gadget series 3 under a particular
price point I think the most popular one
was under 10 bucks today is another
installment in the under $10 gadgets
these might be exactly what you're
looking for who knows
okay let's kick it off with this right
here the swiss tech lifetim warranty
solid stainless steel utility six in one
this thing is $7.50 it looks like a key
but it isn't the key at all in fact it's
a multi-tool micro screwdriver flat
screwdriver bottle opener serrated knife
blade Phillips screwdriver straight
nightly it locks securely onto your
keyring solid stainless steel $7.50 good
reviews on Amazon and look at this
little guy what I like about this one is
that it looks like a key let's see how
do I do this
yeah there you go just like a Swiss Army
knife so it pops open like that
here is your straight knife blade near
the top serrated blade beneath it
Phillips screwdriver a bottle opener in
this location right here oh here this is
the flat screwdriver right there this is
where it will close around your keyring
there is a very fancy bottle of
coca-cola the unbox therapy a custom
coca-cola if you haven't seen that video
go check it out it's kind of a crazy
story actually there we go
tastes like unboxed ever look at that
jacket look at that guy next up I've got
these little guys here now I've talked
about these in the past these are kind
of like a must for me the ones on the
right are about five bucks it's called
Grippit these ones over here called gel
tabs five bucks and something like seven
bucks or six bucks they're in the same
territory
these ones are completely Universal and
these ones over here they do make a
separate version for PlayStation for
three as well as Xbox products Xbox one
I've had issues with the material
wearing down on the stock PlayStation 4
controller so I've been using these grip
it's for a while in fact I made a video
way back in a day when the PlayStation 4
first came out about this problem on the
thumb sticks where they were wearing
down I noticed a problem on my
playstation 4 can
a couple of days ago and it's sort of
been getting worse I have a playstation
control over you now I haven't tried
these gel cabs but the grip it's they're
super easy to use practice open here now
these just wrap around the outside they
don't pop off they don't slip off
nothing like that it's immediately more
grippy you feel that little bit of
texture there this is on my controller
at home I use these things they're five
bucks that's a no-brainer
now the gel one it might look a little
cooler let's try it out okay so so it's
a slightly smaller surface area but it's
also sticky probably a little squishy ER
baby if you're into it either way I say
get one or the other
these ones I've used for a long time
they might sell out after I shout them
out on this video that's happened in the
past so I'm just giving you that little
word of warning right now no brainers
right here save your controller to get
better grip bingo be case tough I don't
know if you see that tough t up top
whatever this is a little cable
management device now you've got the
bedside table you've got your bed you
charge your phone there on the
nightstand what do you say bedside table
or night stays your table is there where
you charge every night but when you go
to reach for it the lights off you're
sleepy you're snoozy it fell back down
behind hey Dad the worse this thing here
aims to eliminate that experience from
ever happening again what it is sticky
magnetic contraption that sticks on to
any surface and then these little clips
that go on to your cable ensure that
it's where you expect it to be and it
can't fall down behind is a table it's
well under 10 it comes in different
colors too if you're not into the lime
appearance 3m sticky we're gonna put it
down over here now these little things
are the clips and they're magnetic they
have tiny little magnets and they give
you three of them and then you go ahead
we open up the clip you feed it through
so it'll sit up here like this and you
just pull it off you can pick the whole
thing up and be using your device while
it's plugged in drop it down on there
and it stays where you expect it to stay
next night you come back you just grab
it a number of different cable diameters
in there same kind of scenario here grab
one of
plug it in your charging playing and
then you're done with it you come back
to them to the magnet and it stays there
all right think of all the stress that I
just saved you with this simple little
contraption last item of the day and
what you're all here for the revolt
beard when it showed up I was like
excuse me what are we you think a beard
like this here comes easy the beard game
so I looked it up on Amazon and I was
like whoa people love this thing it's a
little bit over $10 it's 1095 but I
think it's suitable for this video
you got the neckline the step cut the
curve cut the goatee and the sideburn
and it makes sure that Union you have no
clue what you're doing all of a sudden
you're golden got your razor here you've
come down to the edge you lift it off
and and you got what you're looking for
now I'm doing the goatee edge right in
there I just liner up I'm doing the
neckline where do you want that line to
be your key to winning the beard game
