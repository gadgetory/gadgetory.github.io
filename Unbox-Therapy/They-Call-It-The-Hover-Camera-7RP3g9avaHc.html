now I got another thing that flies here
on the table today yes I'm excited you
should be too it's called the hover
camera they hit me up they're like you
want to be the first to take a look at
our hovering camera that'll follow you
around like a cool little buddy like a
little sidekick to flies you know what I
did
setting it over it's kind of a drone you
can fly it but it can also work
autonomously and just follow you around
and track their face it's super portable
it folds up you can see on the front
here it's got a 4k video camera 13
megapixel photo camera you just kind of
hold it there you just set it up and it
just hovers on its cover camera it uses
Wi-Fi to connect to your smartphone and
stream the video back to it
ooh cool little carrying case look at
the organization there Wow carrying bag
power adapter screwdriver kit the
charger extra propellers and the case
strap unbelievable ooh look it's tiny
here the batteries did I give you two
from the get-go they new look at that Oh
does a camera on the front this is the
one that's gonna shoot the video and so
on the battery attaches here on the top
so you just slide it in like this oh
okay
Wi-Fi network hover camera password one
two three four five six seven eight I am
now connected parently all you do you
hold it up you hit the button again and
you just leave it you let it do the work
you let it hover now I don't know I
don't have a I don't know
if you want to breathe down apparently
you just grab it I have a visual on what
the hover camera actually sees I'm
saying look at that face tracking you
can track a person you can adjust the
angle of the camera and then you can
have the hover camera do a 360 kind of
orbit mode wow that's that's strange
just let it go oh now you can see I can
keep pressing down but the sensors are
actually indicating how close it is to
this surface so in order to keep it safe
whoa whoa hello world you're now
watching unbox therapy through the
harbor camera boom up look at that
that's like airborne selfie mode right
that's through the other camera
recording Wow
so after you record a clip it downloads
directly to your device to your phone so
you don't need any kind of like separate
onboard storage and SD card or anything
like that there's also some different
control schemes available you can do
classic motion joystick it can track a
face for example or an entire person
in which case it'll follow and give you
this video shot of following that
individual you can also have it orbit so
that it moves around a point so you get
a cool shot like that or you can adjust
the camera from facing forward to facing
down if you want to get the ground it's
something you could take on a trip a
vacation or something get some footage
that would otherwise be unapproachable
by setting this little guy up in the air
at first glance it's safer probably than
some of those larger scale drones
especially since the propellers are
blocked off and most important I mean
like look at that that could fit in a
bag in a purse it's a lightweight this
is very tight quarters there's a lot of
expensive equipment here and with this
cage on there when this guy bumped into
stuff it was no big deal he righted
itself and that was it so maybe you're
trying to convince your parents you're
like listen it's time I'm ready for my
first drone and they're like you're
gonna you're gonna chew up the cat over
there with those propellers and you're
like no look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
