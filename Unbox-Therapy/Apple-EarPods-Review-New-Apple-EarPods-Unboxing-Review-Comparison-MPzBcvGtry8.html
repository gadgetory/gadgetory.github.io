therapy and today we're taking a look at
Apple's brand new earphones they are
called the ear pods for better or for
worse a lot of people are hating on that
name as you can see they retail for $35
here in Canada or around 30 bucks if
you're in the US but if you're gonna buy
a new eye device like the new iPhone or
iPod Touch don't rush out and buy this
accessory just yet because it will be
included with those new devices the
unboxing is pretty straightforward
you've got the earphones in a nice
little carrying case and then a bit of
paperwork from Apple explaining how to
use them but they're pretty simple if
you've ever used an Apple remote before
it works exactly the same way you've got
volume up/down play pause etc so here is
this nice little carrying case which I'm
happy to have I mean I actually don't
have too many carrying cases for ear
buds so it's a positive thing to get
especially in a cheap pair of headphones
or earphones like around 35 bucks
so you unravel the cable the familiar
white cable and you'll find these
earbuds in the inside that they're
calling the ear pods probably because
they look like little pods and they are
quite different from a lot of what's out
there in terms of standard earphones as
you'll see the grille portion on them
the portion that sound actually comes
out of is much smaller than Apple's
older model earphone I'll give you a
quick comparison here in a second and
because that grille is so much smaller
it's going to mean at least it should
mean that there's less sound bleed
coming out it's a more direct sound and
hopefully it can help isolate a little
bit better from exterior or external
noises so that those don't enter your
ear chamber so here's a closer look at
the remote as I said before it's simple
volume up/down there's a microphone in
and of course for answering phone calls
and you have a standard 3.5 millimeter
connector so let's go ahead and plug
these in and give you guys a little bit
of feedback and I'll tell you guys
exactly what I think so I had the chance
to listen to a number of different types
of music including some popular ones
right now like dubstep hip hop I even
threw a little bit of rock and sort of
more classical stuff at them and there's
absolutely no doubt that these
headphones perform significantly better
than Apple's previous generation earbuds
and the reason being is because the
audio is
delivered at a deeper point in the ear
canal offering greater isolation which
then results in a better frequency
response especially in the low-end so
there's less sound bleed and that means
better music for you but still these
things can't stack up against a proper
set of headphones like these ones right
here these are the sony xba-4 ever
they're about 50 bucks so not too much
more money and if you can stand to carry
around something slightly larger your
music is going to thank you trust me
especially in the low-end if you're a
bass head get a real set of headphones
links to these will be down in the
description if you absolutely need in in
the ear style earbud like something to
carry around and be super portable then
take a look at these ones here they've
got much bigger drivers they're called
the Marley Zion and those drivers are
going to mean that you can get better
representation once again in the low end
because of an improved frequency
response and the fact that you've got
removable and adjustable tips means
you'll get a perfect fit and it's after
all the fit that really determines the
sound at the end of the day especially
when you're considering an earbud so
that's a lot of information if you guys
want to check out those suggestions that
I gave you at the end of the video then
definitely look down in the description
there is going to be links there and
after all you know I'm not hating on
these Apple earbuds for 35 or 30 bucks
they are good value and for a lot of
people they're going to come for free
and they're definitely an improvement
over what Apple was already giving you
and they're comfortable so you know
overall I'm giving them a thumbs up but
just not to the same degree as some of
my favorite headphones or earphones that
I showed you at the end anyway guys if
you enjoyed this content please remember
to like and favorite the video as it
does help me out a bunch and I'll catch
on the next one all right later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
