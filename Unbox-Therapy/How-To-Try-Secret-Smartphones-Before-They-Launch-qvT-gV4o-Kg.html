front of me a smartphone that you may
have never heard of before
it's called the magic from honor and the
reason you probably haven't heard of it
it was it was never released here in
North America but that's not the whole
story
honor told me recently that they're
going to be launching a new program a
program in which you can get your hands
on smartphones that aren't only
international and unavailable but also
that haven't been released anywhere a
beta program for hardware and software
features for their devices so there's a
link down in the description where you
can actually join a Facebook group and
become a part of the testing pool so you
could theoretically have this phone in
front of you before it exists anywhere
else you a section you get to have my
job you get to see cool new smart phone
hardware before it launches anywhere
else I think it's pretty cool I know for
a fact if I didn't have the chance to
see stuff here on unbox therapy if I was
just a regular dude I mean that would be
really cool and not only will you be
testing that exclusive hardware but
you'll be giving feedback and kind of
helping to shape the direction of
features of upcoming features in new
devices it's pretty wild now this phone
here it's really unfortunate that he
never came to North America or or had a
North American variant because what
you're going to see here is that even
though this one has been out in Asia for
a little while it has a really striking
physical appearance that may just remind
you of some of the stuff you've seen
recently in the smartphone game okay
what you're going to notice here is that
you have this curvature this edge this
edge you can tell like is Samsung's not
the only one that can do an edge now
keep in mind this thing came out before
the new Galaxy s8 and you can see the
back there glass dual lens system thin
around the side and then a similar curve
on the front as well so it all boils
down to this slim edge on the side and
you get a curve both ways so it's like
the s8 or or even the s7 edge except
that the curve exists on both sides it's
kind
unusual design you'll see the rest of it
is essentially this aluminum speaker
grille USB type-c headphone jack crammed
in there volume buttons over here as
well as your power switch you've got a
SIM card tool power brick USB C cable
and a case look at that
you get a free case in case you want it
get a case in case you want it so there
you have your booted up it's got to be
some of the nicest Hardware essentially
aluminium and glass it's hard to even
pinpoint any plastic components here at
all it's got a 1440p display it's also
got a bunch of software features that
are unusual some AI features now this
video here is certainly not a review by
any means but instead it's kind of an
announcement of the opportunity
represented here now this this is not
something like I said that you've seen
before it's not even something that you
could have gone into a store and picked
up the world of smartphones is actually
quite a bit more vast than what's
happening just here domestically and I
know you guys are tech fans I was like
this is something cool this is something
you might want to hear about so if you
want to get your hands on a device like
this like the honor magic or whatever
the next version of it is head over to
that Facebook page sign up and then let
me know I'm actually curious I'm gonna
I'm gonna follow up I'm gonna make sure
that some of you guys actually get your
hands on this stuff and play a part play
a role as a beta tester potentially
influence future devices and this is a
manufacturer that actually wants to
listen to what you guys have to say so
there you have it a top-secret device
that you probably haven't heard of and
your chance to get your hands on one
pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
