another video and as you can tell today
it's something rather large in fact so
big that it barely fits into the space
here this is a 34 inch monitor from LG
very similar to the triple monitor setup
that I have on my desk in my office but
this one's a little bit different it now
has an adjustable stand and it doesn't
have the Thunderbolt port so if that's
not something that's important to you
this might be a good solution it is the
34 you c87 see it will still work on Mac
many Apple laptops have an HDMI out you
can use that with this or you can use an
adapter cable to get from thunderbolt to
DisplayPort or something else it's an
IPS panel it has a four screen split
option if you want to set up different
workspaces 3440 by 1440 again I have
three of these or very similar models in
my setup
they are the UC 97 I believe without the
adjustable stand which is something that
I kind of wish they had so this might be
a cool compromise so let's go ahead jump
inside the box and check it out
Wow they give you all the cables display
port HDMI have one just in case little
cable management screws now I notice
right away this one is black on the back
my UC 97's are like a goldish color here
is the adjustable stand cool so just for
simple screws now key thing to remember
there's a piece of styrofoam inside the
box which has the curvature of the
display and they advised for you to
place the display down onto it when
you're working on installing the stand
okay
so this is like a dark grey kind of
metallic look the bottom here we have
the locking mechanism
oh hello
I always forget how big these monitors
are it's amazing I have three of these
on my desk or three that are this size
in this space here it's just massive
look how big look at that okay look at
that
Wow so the question is why would you
want a super wide or ultra wide display
like this besides the fact that they
just look incredibly cool well in my
particular case it's usually quite
boring it's just work it's multitasking
I can set up many windows whether that's
a text document an email client or
multiple browser windows or even
multiple YouTube videos yes it can play
YouTube videos
it can even play videos from my second
channel more top 5 if you haven't
checked it out yet you definitely should
also this is the native format of a lot
of Hollywood cinema 21 by 9 to be more
specific the fact that it's an IPS
display is important because you're
going to get probably the best viewing
angles of any display technology in this
case we have the display hooked up to a
13-inch MacBook Pro and as you know if
you work on a laptop this extra real
estate can really improve your
productivity it's connected to the HDMI
port but as mentioned before you have a
DisplayPort option if you prefer to use
that and there's also USB expandability
so if you have a laptop set up with this
you can leave some peripherals connected
to the display anyway guys and that
wraps up this video on the new LG ultra
wide display and I've already forgotten
the model name so if you want more
information pricing and availability the
links will be down in the description of
this video thank you very much for
watching as always if you enjoyed this
