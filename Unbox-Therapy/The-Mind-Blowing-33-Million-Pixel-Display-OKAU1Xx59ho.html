know done like a thousand videos maybe
more
well how many videos have we done 1200
video every so often a product that
shows up here and it's just like whoa
this is that product today first glance
you like I don't get it it's a monitor
big deal seen on five one but this one
is different
this one packs more pixels than anything
I have personally ever feast into my
eyes upon 8k monitor 8k 7680 by 40 320
pixels at 60 Hertz what oh my how do you
even what do I even what am I even met
so many pixels that you're gonna need to
feed this thing to display four cables
to juice it up now I do feel the need to
tell you that this is very premium at
the moment alright it's not inexpensive
price fluctuates a little bit but you
can expect somewhere around 4 grand for
this thing so you better be serious
about your pixels 100% Adobe RGB srgb
rec.709 and 98% coverage spin it around
to the back here Jack can pick this part
up for you there you can see the two
display ports that I mentioned earlier
as well as a bunch of USBs 4 USB ports
so you can keep your peripherals plugged
into this thing and then a single USB
cable to the system that you're using
the display size itself 31.5 inches
diagonally what do you say shall we jump
inside this box microfiber cloth quick
start power to display ports and USB
upstream for the USB hub as you'd expect
the stand has to be pretty heavy
bootable base stay still monitor moves
plus the cutout for your cables very
modern and sleek design you've got to
get the right eye line on there look at
how much it goes up and down very nice
there's a little release button here no
screws necessary it just clicks right in
if I wanted to release it I would just
push there whoa so you could do the
full-on portrait setup that is
my case here I'm using a GTX 1082
DisplayPort cables up into this and it
just it immediately figured stuff out
now what you're looking at here is still
a scaled image because of Windows if I
go to display settings here you can see
I'm at three hundred percent which is
Windows recommendation if I went all the
way down to a hundred percent check this
out like what happened to that text
there can you even see that now in its
native resolution that's how small text
appears so I have downloaded some images
here which are all 76 80 by 43 20 or
higher keep in mind you're gonna have to
go off my reaction here you're viewing
this video in 4k
unfortunately so watch me as I watch
this here we go ah oh my that is
obviously a stake in the lens and the
camera sensor like any you know certain
areas of the frame are gonna be sharper
in here to my eye I've never seen that
much detail on a stake in my entire life
will look right here look right in here
the glistening ridiculous ridiculous
ooh Golden Gate Bridge obviously a
different aspect ratio here kind of a
panorama I mean we can see individual
cars over here there's so much
resolution to work with here I mean I'm
like a detective I can get this guy's
license plate over here okay I might be
exaggerating this is Los Angeles at
night with this cool blue hue going on I
don't know if you guys can fully
appreciate this but look at that I mean
you can individual windows over here
it's just so much more resolution than
4k this is maybe my favorite and I'm
still unsure if it's a real photo or
computer-generated but it doesn't really
matter when you look in this section
right over here I mean even at a 10x ooh
look at that in there what are you
talking about up into the trees here
I've never looked at another 8k one so
I've never seen an image this wonderful
surprisingly the streaming is working
pretty good over our wireless network
this is an 8k video and I mean it kind
of speaks for itself to be honest
there's actually a surprising amount of
very beautiful 8k footage on YouTube
that you can enjoy if you
one of these monitors obviously very few
people do but there are 8k cameras out
there and this is the effect you can get
this is what individuals shooting on
those cameras this is what they see
before they publish this is better than
some of the still images I downloaded
each frame a ridiculous amount of
resolution as of right now these guys
are ahead of the curve gaming that's a
whole different story when you're
pushing this many pixels but certainly
for any kind of photo editing graphical
work where you need to see incredible
detail as of right now what else are you
gonna put on your desk besides you've
probably got four or five grand burning
a hole in your pocket right I'll do
something with it yourself a few extra
pixels actually this is the perfect time
to ask you a question what resolution
are you watching this video on the
display you're using right now what's
the max res I bet it ain't a cake this
episode of unboxing has been brought to
you by the tick watch s &amp;amp; E as well as
the tick o many now if you guys are
unfamiliar with this this is the most
affordable watch that features Android
wear and they've had two different
models here so this one on the right
this is the e model and you can see it
comes in a couple of different colors
and this one is the S model you can see
the detail around the bezel on this one
also comes in white and black now to
charge this guy up you have this
portable charge cable it just slides on
there like that boom charging so these
guys raised over three million dollars
on Kickstarter and have recently began
shipping this model out it's got
enhanced GPS tracking step counter heart
rate monitor and so on and since it runs
Android wear of course you have the
entire universe of Android wear apps
that you can load on here it's also a
water-resistant ip67 this right here if
Jack can pick that up and that is the
heart rate sensor so if you're looking
for an affordable but still high quality
Android wear watch you're gonna want to
check out tape watch now next up is to
take home mini which as you might have
guessed from the name it's a lot like
the Google home mini but with some added
functionality in fact this device here
is a little more rugged its splash proof
and this one is truly portable because
it has a built in battery I remember
when the whole mini came out you know
that'd be nice as a portable speaker as
well well that's what this one here
this is what it looks like and you'll
notice it even has a little carrying
strap and since its splash proof you can
bring it down to the beach and so on
plus you have large tactile buttons but
then the convenience of having Google
assistant built-in so you can ask it
questions you can search things and so
on so thanks to tic watch and take home
