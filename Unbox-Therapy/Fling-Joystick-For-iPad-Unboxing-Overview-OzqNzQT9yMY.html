therapy comm and today we're taking a
look at the fling joystick for your iPad
or iPad 2 and with this device claims to
do is to take your thumb in put on your
capacitive touchscreens and make it a
little bit more tactile a little bit
more similar to what we're used to via a
traditional controller
now these secure themselves to your
touchscreen using suction cups so
they're not going to harm the screen and
they're not going to be permanent you
can take them on and off depending on
whether you like to use them for a
certain game now certain games are going
to work better than others that's just
because they're not really programmed
for use with these these are an
aftermarket product the flings come with
a microfiber case which does double duty
it's also going to act as a cleaning
cloth for your touch screens which as we
all know tend to attract fingerprints so
there's what the device looks like and
as I said you get a couple of them
they're easy to take with you but like I
said they won't work for every game so
you're going to need to sort of use your
head and understand which ones it would
obviously work for and which ones it
wouldn't a good example of it working
properly is with super mega worm here
and as you can see I get that nice
arcade feel with the thumb stick that I
probably couldn't get with just my thumb
allows you to slide around the screen a
little bit easier and get a more natural
feel so anyways I totally recommend this
product if you game a lot on your iPad
it's going to make gaming a lot more
comfortable</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
