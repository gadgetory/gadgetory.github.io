this gaming laptop actually claims to be
the smallest the thinnest 15 inch gaming
laptop ever and it's from Razer and I
think that's exciting I think it's
interesting it is one of the downsides
of gaming laptops they tend to be bulky
in order to fit in those heavy duty
graphics that you're looking for then in
light and gaming to this point haven't
really gone together in a package that
has made sense razer claims to have
fixed that here is the specification
it's the blade 15.6 inch and here you
can see the spec line there is the 144
Hertz gaming version of the panel of the
display which is only 1080p and then
there's the one I have here I'm just a
junkie for resolution this is the 4k
version UHD at 60 Hertz this 4k version
it's also a touchscreen if that's
important to you including the 512
gigabyte SSD gtx 1070 baked-in as well
oh you know what they might be right
look how thin this boxes holy smokes
very thin laptop box power brick is no
joke that's a bit of a powerhouse and
you can see that its proprietary mmm
simple branding simple product design
matte black finish it kind of looks like
a tool it looks industrial I like that
ooh nice and simple you see the keyboard
layout the speaker location what a
perfect location for speakers why not a
larger trackpad as well I noticed
straight away gtx 1070 max-q design and
of course that 8th gen core i7 which is
6 cores 12 threads up to 4 point 1
gigahertz
holy smokes on your laptop and you're
really complained probably not and even
though it's 15.6 inches in display size
it's actually smaller than the previous
version 14-inch razor blade laptop so
they've packed more into less here we
have Thunderbolt 3 USB 3 1 HDMI a mini
DisplayPort and a Kensington lock and
then over on the left we have the power
port 2 more USB 3 ones and an audio jack
very sturdy though immediately we get
the green backlighting it is quite
brilliant as you can see there on the
sides we have this crazy slim bezel and
even the top which houses the
front-facing camera is pretty slim
comparative to what I've seen in the
market and the trackpad very smooth
texture as well as a precise response I
am impressed at this point this is also
a touchscreen so I could just reach up
at any point and touch the display if I
choose to all right so let's get a taste
for this display this video
I mean you've obviously seen this video
right can't skip this bit look at that
look at that thing so far display 4k oh
man
that's an image now the speakers I don't
know are they good I'll turn it up with
this
we're not liking the speaker's so much
right now let me load up some SoundCloud
I always sort of put him in like the
average territory I think people are
gonna be more inclined to use headsets
anyways as it be arrows with the game on
does these speakers sound a bit better
and pub G here these speakers sound a
little bit better we're gonna see what
this thing is like in its wheelhouse
this is pub Jean Forte 3840 UHD one
thing I can guarantee you guys is that
this is not gonna last long
oh wow that's nice little weapon
straight away I'll take that let's go
find some 186 alive the sound effects
they sound so much better than these
speakers did with music someone's in a
vehicle where is that
look at this maniac
oh he got me that's why a lot of people
are gravitating towards razor in the
first place they want the GPU and so on
but as I said before there's different
ways you can spec up this laptop to suit
however you see yourself using it
starting 1899 with a 1080p 60 Hertz
display and then all the way up to the
model that I tested here $28.99 for the
15.6 4k display and then the 144 Hertz
versions in the middle something to
mention the weight of the device does
change depending on your screen choice
as well in the entry-level model
actually the most portable it's gaming
it's for gamers it can game but at the
same time it sort of has the appeal that
like a MacBook does for creative
professionals where it's a simple design
it's not screaming at you I'm a gamer
you don't just game on air that becomes
your main laptop you spend a fortune on
it so do you want it to only distinguish
one part of you even though you do all
these other things on that system it's
your work laptop it's your creative
laptop and it's your gaming laptop and I
think Razer from a design and brand
perspective has done a good job of
finding that balance so there you have
it the brand new blade I have a link in
the description if you want to learn
more about the specs or see the other
models its power when you need it its
simplicity when you don't it's kind of a
do everything type of setup today's
episode of home box therapy has been
brought to you by hims I have one of
their kits in front of me right here and

as a topical solution and even a
multivitamin supplement that can help
