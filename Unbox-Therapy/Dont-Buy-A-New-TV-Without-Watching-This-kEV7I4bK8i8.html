OLED in the past o LED incredible
television technology that gives you
this wild contrast this black level that
the old tech simply couldn't produce and
I've got one sitting over there we have
people in the studio people come over
I'll throw on the jungle book minds are
blown this is the latest model
it's the c7 2017 model but here's the
thing in many cases people don't
necessarily take advantage of all that
contrast and all that resolution is a 4k
TV and the reason for that is that
people aren't feeding the right signal
the right content into these displays
you go to somebody's house they've got a
nice 4k panel and then they're feeding
it their old cable box
Dolby is hoping to change that so they
decided to sponsor this video send out
this really cool new TV so I can test
out some of what they've been doing to
improve the actual viewing experience on
the latest tech this TV here is one of
the first to feature active HDR with
Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos now Atmos
refers to the sound you're hearing birds
chirping it sounds like they're on the
ceiling it sounds like they're you know
way off in the distance but it's all
coming from a single audio source now
the way we're going to test this all out
is through an app called dolby access
it's on this display there's actually
more content lately that's capable of
taking advantage so not just through the
access app but also hundreds of things
on Netflix Amazon and a bunch of other
places as well so this is the kind of
thing when your friends come over it's
like hey man that's a cool TV but like
what's the difference between the one I
have at home and this one you boot up
the access app and you're like oh here's
the difference let's open this up
Wow look how big this thing is
probably need you going here oh they're
good all right so we have the TV booted
up now it's amazing to see how thin this
sheet of glass can be as I mentioned to
you before this is all about feeding
some content to the display that can
actually take advantage of the
capabilities so we're going to be
looking at the Dolby access app now this
is stuff that's tuned up to do this TV
justice
so Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos demo
what do you say 2 minutes and 11 seconds
shall we roll the clip jack you are
about to experience a revolution in
entertainment technology
vision is cinema HDR that brings TV to
life with dramatic image astonishing
brightness color contrast dolby atmos
puts you inside the action
with bigger more encompassing sound that
fills your room even overhead
so what you guys are kind of seeing with
it with it on and off toggles there is
you're seeing a far more vivid image
that's the HDR tech that you're
witnessing there so it gives it is
obviously far more color depth contrast
and so on how about that shot right
there Wow the purpose of these demos is
to kind of indicate to you some of the
stuff that the TVs doing when you feed
it sources that you want to watch here
you can discover who's streaming stuff
currently in Dolby vision you can see
Amazon Instant Video Netflix and Vudu
they've all got hundreds of titles that
are capable of taking advantage of this
look at this guy you can move that slow
cuz of the camo unbelievable you see the
difference there who better than a
chameleon for color
oh ho ho
[Laughter]
so I'm just on Netflix now and I'm
noticing as you scroll through you can
see that certain content is actually
Dolby vision capable for example chef's
table here if you see that little badge
up there see here we go
abstract the art of design Dolby vision
at this point it's hundreds of hours of
stuff that's capable but that number is
growing that inventory is growing not
just on Netflix but also on Amazon and
Vudu as well so here you can see on
daredevil you have the vision badge this
is actually a great show to kind of take
advantage to show off the aspects of the
display and of course Dolby vision you
know if you're snowboarding without a
shirt on you have to be good right the
shirt comes off you better back it up
you're playing basketball in the public
courts you take the shirt off you better
back it up you're mowing the lawn at
home you take the shirt off
you better back it up you're going for a
job down the street you take the shirt
off you better back up
Dolby it's unbelievable you already knew
that you've been watching movies you've
been seeing that symbol for years but
now it's at home in your living room I
mean we're talking about 4k resolution
packed into here on OLED with the sound
to go with it and the HDR I mean it's a
whole thing you might have a you're
gonna have an emotional reaction all
right you want to learn more about this
read up a little bit
what exactly is Dolby vision and so on
