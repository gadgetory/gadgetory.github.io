with another video and today I have
something in front of me as usual but
this time I have no idea what's inside
in this case I see this symbol which
looks aggressive and scary I mean it
says battle box on it okay and I sort of
know what it is it is a survival box or
at least there should be survival slash
tactical gear inside of it but I have no
idea exactly what it is we're gonna find
out together in classic unbox therapy
fashion whoa what is this Hey what are
we working with here grass this dry
grass I already found like a little
blade thing it says mi L on and I think
that's military battle box survival and
tactical gear cool alright so it's a
subscription box they send you one every
month well here you can see the value of
the various boxes I think we have the
Pro Plus you know the pro or the pro
plus what is this some kind of like
renewable packing material I'm gonna
place that down softly okay cool we have
the survival guide here the Department
of the Army Field Manual whoa yes my
five-year-old will is really gonna like
this identifies various creatures this
is cool
alright so you keep this with you and
all of a sudden you can survive in the
woods or at least that's a step in the
right direction the Kershaw black wash
series think this is a knife whoa
pretty solid dare I say a new unboxing
knife whoa oh that's no joke don't try
this at home
look at that even cuts through the
organic packing material it's got a
little clip on it it's got a frame lock
on it you see right here that's what
holds the blade up gives it rigidity
structure to put it down you push that
over to the side and clamp it down nice
little package I like the color too
rugged looking metal finish solid next
up emergency blanket up to 90 percent
reflection of body heat really it's kind
of like a foil
I probably shouldn't use this right now
like I should save this for an emergency
it's hard to believe that a material
that thing could reflect 90% of your
body heat all right I need to save this
for a real survival situation it's a
mirror a survival signal mirror with a
little compass in it flash this off the
Sun hold the mirror close to your eye
slowly turn and angle the mirror so the
aim indicator is on the object you wish
to flash you can thank you flashing
people from a distance so they come to
help you this is an old-school compass
when I was a kid I always wanted a legit
compass like this look at this again
tried and true
old school tank doing the job Solar
Charger for iPhone and cell phone now
everybody here certainly understands
that so it's part of the case lay it out
like that
there's some old-school phones listed on
here nokia and 76
sony ericsson kay 750 i think i had that
phone got micro USB that's the important
one of course a little flashlight LED
flashlight probably needs a battery oh
this is cool aqua mira frontier
emergency filter water is a big issue
when you're out there trying to survive
you might see a stream or something and
you're like damn that looks clean and i
just want to drink from it well there is
some bacteria and whatnot that's in
there no good you don't want them you're
gonna get diarrhea so this this little
joint here this little um filter where
the straw allows for you to drink the
wilderness water the wild water active
carbon helps reduce waterborne chemicals
and also improves the taste oh this is
cool too a fire starter kit right here
this oh this actually has some signals
imprinted on it
various smoke signals for emergency
situations you strike this thing I
believe with this other side of the
object or with a hard surface a knife
blade something like that and you can
create sparks fairly easily probably
with this grasses for eat eat in tool
eaten tool what a name a rugged
stainless outdoor spoon for bottle
opener screwdriver pry tip and metric
wrenches and a carry carabiner does
everything that's cool that's way more
useful than you might imagine
life death situation where your spoon
lists for CLIs carabiner lists bottle
opener this you need that this is
can opener isn't it yes this like a
military can opener AJ from the control
room agrees this is a can opener but if
you found a can of food during the
zombie apocalypse that's like that's
gold
it's a gold mine right there you know
what listen you guys have all the tech
and gadgets in the world can you even
survive didn't think so
look at how rugged this all looks
instantly more rugged rugged meter
elevating survival and tactical gear
