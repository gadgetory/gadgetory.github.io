another video and as you can tell I'm
not in my usual studio environment
that's because today we're gonna take a
trip down memory lane together in this
completely unusual virtual reality space
we're gonna look at retro gadgets
important gadgets in my life oldschool
unboxings where the cameras weren't
turned on we're gonna take a trip down
memory lane maybe a trip inside my mind
I know it sounds crazy but pick up your
phones take a look around because you
can move around in space so let's kick
it off without very first retro gadget
Jagger please place it right here the
iPod mini of course an important gadget
in my life and many of yours as well
this was the shrunk down version of the
revolutionary iPod that completely
changed the game in both tech and music
so let's jump inside the box and take a
closer look at the iPod mini circa 2004
which is just like just like the first
day it was ever open oh this thing also
worked both
first time ever windows people being
taken care of by Steve Jobs that was a
big thing
very good so inside the box you were
first greeted with the actual iPod and
look at that in the gold color long
before there was ever such a thing a
gold iPhone it even to this day you can
tell that that's design language it
keeps up it holds up I mean some people
could even make the argument that this
thing is better-looking than some of the
modern stuff look at the shapes aluminum
anodized that came in a few different
colors actually in of course the
important click wheel on the front now
you guys want to take a closer look at
this so please jack represent it in this
location right here thank you very much
all right inspect that more closely as I
move along you can see here you have the
classic third pin connector on the
bottom that of course has changed a
number of times leading up to modern
devices and on the top you had this
unusual headphone jack how about that
Apple a headphone jack and a device this
big where's it at on the iPhone 7 huh
and there's also this hold switch right
here so this was important if you stuck
this thing in your in your pocket to
very quickly put it on hold so that you
couldn't accidentally hit buttons but
your pocket wasn't the only place that
you could keep an iPod mini no because
they gave you oh yes it's very
fashionable clip belt clip now Jack I
want you to show them this as well okay
put it over here in fact actually get
rid of this one look at this clip this
was important not just so that you could
have a secure place to keep your new and
expensive iPod but also so you could
show the world that you were high-tech
iPod mini and you weren't using those
old-fashioned cassette players anymore
now this thing is booted up and I just
want you guys to appreciate this
wonderful sound that the click wheel
used to make when you scroll listen
listen very carefully oh my goodness how
perfect is that but that's basically how
the navigation worked you could move
through it like this this is pre
touchscreen as this pre iPhone right so
you can move between music and settings
in such a fashion hit the middle button
in order to jump into the next menu very
intuitive for the time now also inside
the box you had this look at the size of
this power brick in comparison to the
actual iPod mini that's really amazing
you could power up an entire laptop of
something this size and it also featured
a FireWire connector and a firewire
cable now you youngsters out there you
have no idea about firewire at all give
them a closer look put this right here
look at this connector that was the key
to all of your dreams back in the day
not just to charge your iPod but for
video editing most video cameras had
this connector it was called firewire
400 it was super complicated at the time
but it was fast and it was reliable so
there you have it
iPod mini a super innovative product for
its time coming out in 2004 and storing
a thousand songs on it if you were a kid
back then and this was under your
Christmas tree you or a happy camper all
right leave a comment down below let me
know which retro gadget you want to see
on an upcoming future video of this
futuristic unboxing experience and trust
