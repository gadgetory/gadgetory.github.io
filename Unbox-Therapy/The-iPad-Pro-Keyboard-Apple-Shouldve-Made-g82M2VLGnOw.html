know you like to get out there laying on
the beach getting a suntan you didn't
get a Sun Tan Jack's back from vacation
ladies and gentlemen so if you're
wondering why the the side angle there
is wobbly and whatnot it's cuz Jack's
back just so you know what is this it is
a solution to all of your problems I did
a little challenge I tried to use
nothing but the iPad pro as my main
computing device no computer of any kind
the keyboard case if you recall is a bit
critical though it was the thing that
kind of pushed me back to the laptop
lifestyle because this is just not a
very satisfying keyboard you know
there's no tactile feel to it it's not
that satisfying so I couldn't wait to
get back onto a laptop because I do have
to do a fair amount of typing so I said
hey maybe Apple should have done
something more similar to what Microsoft
has done in the various surface products
thank goodness for third-party
accessories today Logitech has launched
the slim folio pro it's for both the 11
inch iPad pro and they're also making it
for the 12 point 9 inch iPad pro
bluetooth low power consumption it has
adjustable backlit keys iOS shortcuts
built-in three-month rechargeable
battery that will get Jack's juices
flowing what does it say on the back
here look at this they show you how to
use it turn your iPad into a laptop with
one click so they're just saying it it
looks like they've got a very specific
demographic here as you can see they
both look a lot like me
here we go look at the backlit keys how
fresh is that look right there so yeah
it's definitely fatter than Apple's own
product that's for sure like if you look
at that you can tell right away okay
opens like this whoa would you look at
that little keyboard right there I don't
think I need the paperwork I'm gonna
peel off protective covering dere
protective thing up here this material
on top it's pretty soft its pliable for
inserting your iPad into it and it also
has a + - you can still have access to
those buttons there's still a cutout as
well for the camera units but it will
check the corners of your device unlike
the current implementation as you can
see this is Apple's product the device
is quite exposed now the convenient part
with the official case even though I
don't like the keyboard is that an Otis
hair right there that is definitely Otis
stop shedding okay it's that time of the
year spring spring is here the dog's the
cats the deer the geese the ganders the
interface that's the real advantage you
just clip it in this one on the other
end you gotta insert the iPad into it
and then oh we think we're taking
screenshots alright getting it on and
off is nowhere near as satisfying as the
official keyboard case appeal that peal
that coming out as fast
it's the corners that give you a problem
don't think ah not that okay I can live
with that I can manage Oh
magnets this guy flaps to the back and
sticks right here this guy clips down
into it now of course the Apple pencil
as well and then this keeps the pencil
in place they're on to something can you
tell me the weight of this product will
its 1.2 pound popping it open from 0 to
100 look at that
boom boom you're working well let's
unlock it there it is slim folio Pro
this is a test you know what it's
already better it's already better than
keyboards already better lazy dog it's
already better it's way better you hear
that it's like typing on a 2x4 it's not
satisfying you're gonna get sick of it
this on the other hand you could start
to make the case I can type on that I
can type on that you still have your
Apple specific keys we have controls
here for the backlit keyboard you have
your volume keys a dedicated Bluetooth
key
let's go completely let's go completely
dark there we go
one two three so that's as bright as it
goes it's comparable to a laptop
keyboard
who knows for the right customer that
was thinking iPad pro as a replacement
maybe this takes you a step closer three
months of battery life on this thing
without recharging it you have
protection for the iPad itself you have
a spot for the pen which it stays
charged with this added little flap here
you got more confidence in the pen
staying put all these speaker grilles on
it they remain completely exposed USB
type-c so you can use the same charger
that you charge the iPad with I think
it's a better but what's the price well
did they announce a price 179 USD 119
USD I don't know about you for me it's
kind of a no-brainer I get it there are
advantages here magnetic connection only
the iPad comes in and out easily what
that convenience is worth to you is it
worth the sacrifice of a nice tactile
keyboard a little bit more protection
logitech slim folio pro I actually think
Logitech is gonna sell a lot of these
things that's what I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
