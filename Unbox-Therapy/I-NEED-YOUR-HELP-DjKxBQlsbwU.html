request for you guys I need your help
you may remember that I recently unbox
the BenQ joy bgp to projector little
portable projector on the channel it was
two videos ago I believe and the reason
that BenQ sent me that projector in the
first place is because I agreed to take
part in a promotional contest that
they're having via their Facebook page a
specific Facebook page that they set up
specifically to promote this particular
device it's a brand new device and I
want to ask you guys to come over there
and hopefully vote for me because
obviously the only way to win is to get
the most votes so I said hey I'm going
to turn to the unbox therapy slash beast
feed army put this one out to you guys
and see if you can come and help me and
we can win this thing together now it's
not just about me believe it or not Ben
Q has done one better they've made it
possible for you the voter to win as
well there's going to be prizes given
out to people who vote so you can vote
as much as one per day once per day I
should say so you can keep jumping back
you can share the contest with your
friends family relatives however the
hell you think you can help and it's
much appreciated I want to preach I want
to tell you guys in advance that I
appreciate whatever it is you can do to
help me out because uh you know oh after
all I want to win and and I hope that
you guys can win something too so a
really exciting contest I want to say
thanks to Ben Q for letting me take part
and for sending me the projector so
anyways otherwise the link is down below
as I said before click through follow
the instructions and hopefully we can do
this anyway guys that's been a quick
little update hopefully you can tweet it
out share it am i repeating myself I
think I am as you can tell I'm trying to
promote nothing to I sound like a
politician
I need bolts car hits are you guys so
hopefully you could do that and I'll see
you on the next one thanks again thanks
in advance later</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
