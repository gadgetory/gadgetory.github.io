therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Kindle Fire HD this of course is
Amazon's brand new tablet and as you
guys can tell it ships in Amazon's no
fuss packaging which is not too pretty
to look at so let's go ahead get inside
and start the unboxing and just like
that it's over because there's not too
much in here all you've got is the
Kindle Fire HD followed by a micro USB
cable now it is a little bit longer than
usual so that's worth mentioning but
there is no wall adapter to charge this
thing up though wall adapters that
you've got lying around for other
devices will work so let's get straight
into the main attraction which is of
course the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD there
is also an 8.9 inch available if you
guys are interested in pricing and
availability on all the different Kindle
Fire HD s I'm gonna drop a link down in
the description but taking a closer look
at this device you'll notice a forward
facing camera followed by a microphone
on the top these are going to be used
for video conferencing of course on the
back you'll see a nice Kindle Fire logo
with this soft touch material around it
which has like a rubberized finish feels
pretty durable
there are also stereo speakers which is
a plus in the tablet space and these
ones are really loud I've actually
tested them out and they're quite
impressive for tablet speakers on the
top you've got your headphone jack
volume rocker and power button and then
on the bottom of the device if you're
holding it in landscape mode is where
you'll actually have your ports to
interface with the device charge it etc
so pretty straightforward design from
that standpoint after you get it booted
up you get greeted with this little
quick intro which is pretty
straightforward to set up it takes a
couple of seconds a couple of clicks if
you've already got your Amazon account
which I assume you do because you
ordered the tablet but getting a closer
look at the interface here you could
tell that it's a skinned version of
Android skin so much that there's not
even much of a resemblance to the
traditional Android interface now
depending on where you sit that can
either be a good thing or a bad thing
this device is sort of built from the
ground up for the consumption of content
whether that be Amazon content or
through the web or Netflix etc I'm gonna
give you a quick look at the web browser
here I'm gonna launch open the Beast
feed calm that is my blog by the way for
those of you have
visited it before I'll drop a link in
the description if you want to check
that out - but as you guys can tell it
you know it Scrolls really quickly
everything looks good of course my site
is pretty light it's mostly just simple
blog posts not too much in terms of
multimedia heavier sites perform a
little bit slower although pinch-to-zoom
and whatnot here you can see BBC news is
you know pretty reactive I can
definitely tell already that this device
is a lot faster than the previous
generation fire which to me was quite
laggy but obviously as I get a chance to
play with this more I'll get a better
impression of just how quick this is and
I'll let you guys know in the full
review video which will be coming up
shortly anyway guys that's been a quick
look and unboxing of the Kindle Fire HD
the seven-inch model if you guys enjoyed
this unboxing please remember to leave a
like and favorite down below as it does
help me out a bunch I appreciate your
viewership and I'll catch you guys on
the next video alright later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
