for this video is to go over some of the
questions I've been asked in
relationship to importing one of these
guys here the PlayStation Vita if you
haven't seen my unboxing video yet I'll
put a link somewhere in the description
and probably in the annotations but I
got a bunch of questions ever since that
unboxing video saying you know Lou where
did you get it from how much did you pay
should I import it now can I trust this
website or all that kind of stuff what
else should I get with it I've seen all
those questions and so I decided hey why
not sit down and do a video addressing
some of those and then that way you guys
can decide for yourself whether or not
it's worth it for you to import the
device or if you want to wait for the
proper worldwide launch to get your own
local version so first things first this
device the Japanese model will work
completely fine anywhere in the world it
is completely region free so that's not
something you have to worry about
something you do have to worry about is
your wallet because it's going to cost
you more money to import it now from
Japan than if you are to wait for
example I think all in I'm probably
somewhere around $500 on this unit here
which you know is quite a bit of money
granted I wanted to make the video to
get the content out there for you guys
so I'm not your average user that's just
going to want to play the device you're
going to be able to buy it locally here
for almost half price so you know that's
something to consider so where do you
buy from Lu where can I get this I
bought mine from a website called
NC SX and what's cool about them is
they're actually us-based
so they've got a little warehouse or
shop or whatever in new york in new york
city actually and they they handle the
importation process so you don't have to
worry if you're in the US about duties
and taxes and things like that you know
as far as you know taking an
international shipment
the other one is play age' and they're a
huge sort of company you can import
anything from japan through them you can
check out their website is play - Asia
comm links to both of these stores are
going to be down in the description so
you guys can check them out for yourself
the prices are very similar granted in
one case you're shipping from the US
sort of location to yourself and the
other ones coming direct from Japan so
that will probably take a little bit
longer or cost you a little bit more
shipping if you go to play Asia route so
the other thing to mention is what you
know a lot of people have asked me what
should I buy along with the PlayStation
Vita and you know it's I actually didn't
know at first that this thing really
really requires one of those proprietary
memory cards anything that you're going
to download from the actual store from
the PlayStation Store the PSN store is
going to require a memory card a
dedicated memory card even some games
for example you'll get to a point where
you've got to have a memory card for
example uncharted it's gonna require a
memory card for game saves etc you can
get it up and running without I believe
but you're gonna need one eventually no
matter what so definitely get a memory
card if you do decide to import this
it's going to be a headache if you
receive the device and then you go oh
damn I didn't get a memory card and
you're gonna be sitting there for two
months you can't really do a lot of
things on the system without having it
so you don't want to do that so get a
memory card and there are a few
different sizes available when you get
up into the higher sizes it's a major
major investment so not knowing how
you're going to use this memory card in
the meantime before the major worldwide
release I'd say don't invest in a huge
memory card wait until you know you can
get one locally at the regular retail
price instead get yourself just
something to hold you over so either
four or eight gigabytes in terms of
memory card games some games translate
better to North America than others some
have you know can completely be played
in English for example uncharted golden
Abyss you definitely want to import that
one again the price is going to be
jacked up I've seen prices anywhere from
$75 to about $90 for that game plus
shipping and you know that's obviously
expensive for a game that's destined for
a portable device so that's something to
think about as well and I think I think
I've pretty much covered everything
definitely get Uncharted get yourself a
memory card and my recommendation is to
use NCS XCOM because that's where I got
mine from in terms of extra taxes and
duties there wasn't any brokerage I'm in
Canada for those that don't know but I
didn't pay any extra brokerage all that
I paid was GST which is normal for any
international shipment just to pay GST
on the value of the device so not
no no sort of scary charges that I
didn't expect just what I expected so if
you're in Canada or elsewhere in the
world that has local taxes you're
probably just gonna pay the local tax
and obviously the other thing to note
jeez this is going on and on sorry about
this guys but the the last thing to note
is the fact that Japan uses the same
power standard as North America so
you're not going to need any power
adapters or anything like that but if
you live elsewhere in the world
you might because the Japanese model
comes with the regular North American
style two prong power adapter and if
you're somewhere else you might need a
physical adapter to adjust for your
local power standard I think that is
everything I hope that I have given you
some useful information to help you
decide if you are interested in
importing the PlayStation Vita or not
after all it will be out relatively soon
here and it'll be for a lot less money
so you might want to consider waiting if
you're not you know one of those crazy
people like me that has their hands on
the new gadgets as soon as they're
released anyway guys until next time I
