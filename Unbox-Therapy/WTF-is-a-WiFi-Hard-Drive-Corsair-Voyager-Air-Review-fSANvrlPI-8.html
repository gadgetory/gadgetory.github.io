going to take a closer look at a
previously featured item on unbox
therapy the Corsair Voyager air wireless
hard drive so if you haven't seen the
unboxing video I recommend going back to
the channel right now doing a search for
Voyager air or checking the description
to this video where I will hopefully
post a link to the unboxing video it's
pretty straightforward it looks like a
regular external hard drive but it does
a lot more and in this video I'm going
to be showing you how to set it up and
how to get the most out of it or a
device like this so the Voyager air has
Wi-Fi built into it that's really the
killer feature here and it has a battery
so you can load this thing up with all
your multimedia files and then all you
need to do is power it on and all your
mobile devices can connect directly to
it to stream that multimedia from it
it's available in two sizes 500 gigs and
one terabyte so way more storage than
whatever mobile device it is that you're
rocking even if you have like a 64 gig
or even a 128 gigabyte device for a lot
of us that's still not enough storage
for the kind of multimedia that we like
to store whether that's TV shows or
movies and in this case you can have a
central hub in your household so your
girlfriend can log in and set up a
folder your kids can log in and set up a
folder so every person can keep
something in a central location you
could also use it for backup say you
want to keep stuff on your mobile device
locally but then put it somewhere else
so you have access to it when you're
away from that particular device so as
you can see it's a versatile solution
and really it's way better than just
having an external hard drive setting it
up is incredibly easy to do all you do
is plug it in put the power button on
and then open up Disk Utility the reason
I'm opening up Disk Utility is because
the drive comes pre formatted NTFS which
is the file system that Windows operates
under and since I'll be using it with a
macbook pro in this particular case I
will need to reformat the drive to Mac
OS journaled this is incredibly
straightforward if you're on the Mac
like I said plug the drive in via USB
turn the power on and then go ahead and
launch Disk Utility you want to erase
the drive with that new file system and
then you'll be good to go you can both
read and write
from it at that point but as I said
before if you're on Windows you won't
need to do this step you could just get
up and running plug the drive in and
start dragging media files over to it
immediately so the next thing to do is
to find some video files to drag over to
the Voyager air so I can demonstrate the
functionality to you guys for the
purpose of this video I'll be using some
previous unboxings that are in their
native format h.264 but this thing
supports a number of different video
files everybody has some questionable
video files on their computer and I'm
not gonna judge you you know that's
completely up to you that's your space
that's your hard drive you do what you
want with it or SSD for that matter you
should be using an SSD all right I'm
going I'm going off on a tangent here
but anyways yes you just drag the video
files over and then they will live on
their own on your wireless hard drive
the next thing you need to do is to
launch into the Wi-Fi so the drive will
emit its own wireless network which is
called Voyager air after you've logged
into that network you will then have
access to those video files through
clicking on just a simple little folder
and there they are now I am streaming
these video files off of the Voyager air
instead of locally but this isn't really
the killer functionality because there
are a lot of ways to do this with a
laptop or desktop computer where things
get really interesting is when you start
to stream wirelessly to your mobile
devices Corsair has developed an
application for both iOS and Android
it'll work on iPad iPhone Android phones
Android tablets and it simplifies the
process of grabbing your video files
from the Voyager air all you need to do
is download the app from the App Store
go ahead and install it and then launch
it and from there you're pretty much
good to go all of the files on your
Voyager air will show up immediately
within the app and you just go ahead and
launch them and watch them and
everything happens wirelessly so you
never have to move the file to the local
device in order to watch it but if you
do decide to save some files from the
Voyager air if you say you want to watch
them without the device in the future
you can do that that's built right into
the application as well so it's
incredibly convenient and versatile so
you can watch stuff locally download
from it and all you're going to need to
do on the iPad is the same thing that
you did on your laptop you need to log
in to the Wi-Fi
it's being emitted from the Corsair
Voyager air and from there boom you have
access immediately so that wraps up this
more in depth look at the Corsair
Voyager air wireless hard drive it is
available in a couple of different sizes
so I will drop the relevant pricing and
availability links down in the
