therapy and today we're taking a look at
the newly released Nexus 10 from Google
built in conjunction with Samsung this
thing's an absolute beast and it's
packin a vanilla Android experience
which I'm always a huge fan of on top of
that and maybe even more importantly it
has a fantastic display with an
incredible resolution 2560 by 1600 to be
exact for an effective PPI of 300 in
simple terms the best resolution you can
get on a tablet it surpasses even that
of the retina display on the latest
generation iPad now jumping inside the
box will notice a couple of accessories
that come along with the tablet and a
little bit of paperwork from Google and
Samsung we have a microUSB to USB cable
this will be used of course to charge
the device by plugging it into this
power brick that is also been included
taking a closer look at the actual
tablet on the bottom you'll notice this
unusual connector this will likely be
used in the future for docking the
device it reminds me of a connector
available on the Galaxy Nexus which I
used for a dock on the side of the
device is where you'll find your
microUSB port as well as your headphone
jack and as we spin around to the top
corner that's where you're going to find
your volume rocker as well as your power
switch the only other port that you're
going to find on the device is a micro
HDMI which will be used for
high-definition video output looking at
the front where the screen is you're
also gonna notice two well hidden
speakers that's correct you've got
stereo speakers on here and they're
right where they should be on the front
of the device so you won't have muffled
sound like some of the competitors that
put the speakers in different locations
you've also got a forward facing and
rear facing camera and it features a
really nice grippy texture on the back
of the unit meaning you can hold it
comfortably with one hand which can't be
said for every single tablet in this
specific form factor at around 10 inches
so getting a closer look at the screen
I'm hoping that you can appreciate some
of the sharpness it is very difficult to
portray to you through a video like this
just how sharp and crisp these displays
are because
chances are you're watching this video
on a screen that features a lower pixel
density than that of the actual tablet
but something else worth mentioning is
just how snappy this device is I'm sure
some of it has to do with the hardware
but I also think Google has done a great
job of optimizing their operating system
because the same can be said for my
Nexus for everything is incredibly
snappy on my phone as well so Google is
doing some great things in the mobile
device space this is a very beautiful
device to use and to look at and I'm
really starting to appreciate it I'll
probably have more insight as I spend
more time with it but this is just being
the unboxing and first look thanks as
always for watching guys if you enjoyed
this content please remember to give it
a like in a favorite as it does help out
a bunch and I'll catch you guys on the
next video thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
