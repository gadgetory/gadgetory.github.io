back with another video and it's another
one in this tech deals series three cool
tech deals
if you missed episode one go back and
check it out basically I find three cool
tech things on Amazon and then share
them with you and they're usually on
sale so let's go ahead and get into it
first item of the day is this QQ tech
mini Bluetooth keyboard now you're not
buying this for the name but what this
is is a little portable wireless
keyboard and trackpad that allows you to
lay back on your couch and control your
computer or Android device in this
particular case as you can see here it
has a pretty cool looking design it
looks like it's backlit as well I have a
Mac Mini hooked up to my television at
home and I use a device like this to
control all kinds of media so these are
really convenient much easier than
keeping a mouse and keyboard separately
so this is $19 regular 30 as you can see
it has great ratings oh look at that it
will switch between Android Mac and
Windows it has a rechargeable battery
which is good and it does have a
backlight yes I was correct it has a
backlight which is good it will require
Bluetooth I believe but there are cheap
dongles you can add if you don't have
bluetooth on your device next up we have
Jack's pic of the day that's right Jack
gets a pic 2 and we're looking at a
portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker
that's only 20 bucks from a company
called photo
and waterproof so what that means is you
can actually use this in your shower why
would you want to do that Lou I'll give
you a couple of good reasons you're
strapped for time ok your life is hectic
but you don't want to miss your favorite
podcast which is half an hour so you
need to chew up some of it somewhere why
not while you're washing your body it's
as good time as any as long as you can
still concentrate on the body washing
because nobody is going to enjoy the
alternative of subpar body washing but
it's also just a rugged speaker that you
can take with you wherever you go strap
it on the outside of your backpack for
example have music wherever you are and
not have to worry about the durability
of the speaker itself very cool a little
cheaper than usual it also has a
built-in microphone which means that you
can answer phone calls and whatnot right
on the speaker while I'm doing that
action right there now these videos are
intended to be quick so here we are on
number three and this is a useful little
cable and you're probably wondering why
is there cable in these show cables are
boring sure maybe they're a little bit
boring but incredibly useful and you can
never have enough and this is a special
cable because it is both a lightning
cable as well as a micro USB cable these
are the most useful things ever I have
tons of these simple little attachment
on the end changes the interface if
somebody comes over to your house
they're looking for a quick charge they
have a different device guess what
you got them covered with this special
cable and it's cheap you see the list
price is over $30.00 you can generally
find them for cheaper than that but at 8
bucks that's a win and then all of your
cables are transformer cables who
doesn't want transformer cables you know
what I mean
cables that transform iphone/android
living together in harmony right here on
unbox therapy and in your life all right
