another video and today I've got
something for you that from the outside
looks pretty standard but it's got a
special feature that might just surprise
you but before we get completely inside
let's take a look around it's got a
nylon construction very slim very slim
profile zipper on the outside put your
stuff in there that's kind of the point
back side padded back padded shoulder
straps relatively standard compartment
here as well for a laptop that is that
is very soft enjoying that all right Lou
I get it what's the big deal here it's a
backpack and then and then nnn-no from a
company called cocoon excuse me what am
I looking at
this gridded organizer is what makes
this cocoon company famous now you could
buy a standalone grid it to slide into
your bag or you can buy one of their
products that has it built in you've got
this series of elastic bands in this
weave formation and what that allows you
to do is set everything up and for each
object you decide to take with you a
home a little nook a little cranny a
place to relax could be up here could be
this little corner could be somewhere
else let's load this baby up okay so
I've got a bunch of stuff now stuff that
I normally travel with these are the
objects that get dumped just into the
main compartment of the bag and are
essentially disorganized most of the
time let's go ahead and see what happens
when I try to fit them all into the grid
system
whoo okay so here you can see the setup
a rough idea of what I might be
traveling with there's a dedicated spot
for everything now in the first place
when you're mapping it out it might be a
little bit confusing as you wonder what
to put where I actually found it useful
to kind of like mentally place them out
what do I have here okay so I have my
Nexus 6p a power brick for my MacBook
Pro portable little battery to which I
will carry then this tiny little USBC
cable I've got some toothpicks I'm a big
fan of toothpicks in general these are
my little ear planes ear plugs you're
playing to your plugs that's one of my
most prized possessions I know that
sounds crazy but these things have saved
my brain so many times I have a Space
Pen which is a new addition it will
write upside down these are cool little
portable pens got some gum of course the
secret wallet you guys know this from
that previous video this my favorite
cable on the planet which has every
connector in the world an extra power
brick that's pretty much it you could
use this for anything it doesn't even
need to be tech or gadgets whatever it
is that you're trying to organize then
this guy flips up on top
zips down and when you pop that back
open it's where you left it and where
you expect it to be you want to remove
something real quick you got it it could
be tools
it could be survival stuff it could be
tech stuff it's up to you that's the
beauty of it what will you put inside of
your cocoon</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
