therapy and today we're taking a look at
the in case perforated snap case for
your iphone 4 works perfectly well with
your iPhone 4s as well as you guys see
on the back here I picked it up at the
Apple store which means I paid premium
price there's always a price tag to
match when you shop there 3495 and you
definitely are not paying for the
packaging because this thing is like an
egg carton that's literally what it
feels like of course they get away with
that nowadays by claiming it's
environmentally friendly and I'm sure
that it is completely recyclable and all
of that but who really cares you're
gonna toss it away what matters is the
case now this is not a super uber
protective case there is no screen
protector included even but it does sort
of maintain the design aesthetic
especially if you've got a white iPhone
instead of sort of bulking it up and
turning it into a completely different
looking device you've got your cutouts
in all the necessary locations and since
it's perforated if you have a skin or
something applied to the back of your
iphone whether it be black or white that
skin will show through so you could get
some cool color effects it also includes
a stand which has two different angles
these are obviously useful if you're on
the airplane or at lunch you want to you
know prop up your iPhone to watch some
video or something nice to have it
included not a huge cost to the
manufacturer so why not so upon further
inspection here it's very very smooth
there are no sharp edges anywhere should
be safe for your phone and I'm gonna go
ahead and insert the white iPhone 4s
here and it all clips in real nice real
easy probably super easy to remove as
well and as I mentioned before
everything is accessible as it should be
including your hold switch which
sometimes is hard to get at when the
phone is installed in a case not in this
case here literally case not in this
case so you've also got your volume
buttons accessible the entire bottom is
open which is a plus and a minus it
means you're going to get good audio out
of your speaker and your microphone is
going to pick up your voice real nice
but it also means you're not that
protected down there so here's a better
look a closer look at that camera cutout
education though on unbox therapy we got
to get you closer than the average
unboxing
there you can get a look at the sort of
shine coming off of the case and here's
a better look at that cutout that I
mentioned earlier it really leaves the
phone sort of feeling almost identical
to how it would feel if it was case list
you don't really even notice that you've
got the case on there and the only sort
of branding is this tiny little in case
logo down here which is very subtle it
doesn't sort of overpower the case at
all now my thinking was as I mentioned
before that if you have some sort of a
sticker decal on the actual phone
underneath this say it's orange or blue
or somebody real cool having the effects
of the other color showing through the
perforation that's that's my ID I might
do that in the future or show you guys
that in the future so here's the stand
as I mentioned before it's got two
angles depending on the way you're
setting and the way you want to watch it
something you can just throw in your bag
or throw in your pocket if you want to
you know enjoy video content on the road
anyway guys if you enjoyed this content

high-resolution pictures in full
