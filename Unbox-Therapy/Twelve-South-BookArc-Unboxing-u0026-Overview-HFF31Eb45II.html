therapy and today we're taking a look at
the book arc from 12 south now what this
device does is it takes your MacBook or
MacBook Pro and puts it in an upright
position
the reason this might be beneficial to
you is if you have your MacBook or
MacBook Pro hooked up to an external
monitor and you don't necessarily want
to use the internal display it's also
supposed to help with cooling a little
bit because being in that upright
position is actually a lot more of the
aluminum chassis being exposed to the
surrounding air rather than your desktop
like all 12 South products this box is
real nice probably too nice of a product
it's like a high-end cigar box and as
you guys can see the device is actually
fairly simple it's an aluminum slab with
a cutout in the center where you place
your different rubber adapters depending
on which model of MacBook you're using
next we've got a little bit of paperwork
a little thank-you from 12 South Saul
ways nice after all money ain't
unlimited it doesn't grow on trees you
should say thank you every time it's
being spent anyway we've got our adapter
pieces and these are gonna allow for the
13 15 and 17 inch models of the unibody
's and also some of the older ones there
isn't one included for the air but it is
an accessory that you can order or you
can buy the book arc specifically for
the air up close we can get a sense of
the quality we've got an embossed 12
logo there we've also got rubber feet so
it ain't gonna slip there's the models
that this one is compatible with and
here's how it looks once you have it all
set up a nice desktop replacement clean
and clutter-free anyway guys visit the
channel and subscribe it'll really help
me out thanks</div></body></html>
