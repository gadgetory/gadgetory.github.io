along
continuing the component unboxing for
the ultimate gaming PC project as you
know so we're gonna move on to the power
supply this is an absolute beast here
from Corsair and this is the ax 1200 I
which is a digital ATX power supply and
it's going to be quiet efficient fully
modular as well which is a big deal in
the power supply world at the moment it
is part of their Professional Series
platinum let's go ahead jump inside the
box and take a closer look at what you
get so I'm gonna need the knife my
trusty little knife for this one here go
ahead and cut the seal here there we go
nice and quick so you've got a huge box
inside of the original box nothing else
in there so there we have all the
goodies included a little bit of
paperwork to get us started out I'm
telling you here to head over to Corsair
comm /a x 1200 i in order to download
the latest version of Corsair link that
of course his dashboard software to give
you more information about your power
supply how its operating when in use
then you've got of course your user
manual and this again is something you
probably should read in order to better
understand your power supply oh wow we
got a really nice corsair case on top of
the power supply you've got your
standard power cable let's go ahead and
open up this little package here if
that's going to be easy enough to do so
in this particular bag right here you've
got your corsair link digital module
then oh there's something else here oh
look at this they give you a little tiny
voyager mini flash drive as well i was
unaware of that that's pretty cool a
retractable voyager mini flash drive
you've also got this nice bag here nice
nylon tough bag once again with the
corsair logo
and this is gonna give you all of your
different modular cable options here you
can see you've got your CPU power you've
got everything you're going to need to
potentially hear your motherboard ATX
this is SATA so you've got a ton of
cable options in here depending on
whatever kind of configuration you've
got this black weave as well so you're
not going to be hurting for cables and I
mean these from this modular design is a
real improvement over the old days when
you had to have all the cables hanging
out of your power supply even if you
weren't using them they've even included
some zip ties here in order to further
allow for cable management I'll open
this bag up real quick so you've got
some zip ties and you've also got of
course your corsair case badge if you so
choose to put that on I'm using the
Obsidian 800 D case so I don't really
have to put the case badge on I'm
already representing the brand in that
sense you've got some K screws and then
lastly what is this some other kind of
sticker here oh it's a little piece a
little piece of foam padding so let's go
ahead and take out the actual power
supply this as I said before is
definitely a beast and it comes in this
velvet-like carrying bag is it knotted
it is it does have a knot I'll go ahead
and get this removed it's a drawstring
tight bags and keep tighten it up for
storage if you need to so here it is the
ax 1200 eye power supply and you can see
once I get it out of this wrapping here
I'll show you all the modular connection
points there we go we've got a nice
matte black finish on it
you've got the Corsair logo on the side
as well as the ax 1200 i logo there in
that same location here is where all of
your connections will take place all
your modular connections you've got
peripheral and SATA over here six plus
two PCIe four plus four CPU 24 pin ATX
and a communication port and also a
self-test button and an LED light I'm
gonna show you know if that's an LED but
this is a light and
on the bottom you've got this large
cooling fan which is obviously necessary
for a power supply of this magnitude and
another really nice this is actually an
extruded Corsair logo on the bottom so
there you have it that's a quick look at
the Corsair ax 1200 I power supply with
an incredibly modular completely modular
design a number of different cable
options going to be available to you and
of course Corsair link digital so you
can get real-time feedback on the
performance and efficiency of your power
supply this is going to be installed in
the ultimate gaming PC just like a lot
of these other things that I've been
mentioning and we're talking about in
these unboxing videos leading up to it
there was one more thing that I wanted
to mention that was on the back of the
box right here about digital power
supplies because this is a digital power
supply also got a seven-year warranty
that's one more thing to mention as well
but digital power supplies use digital
digital signal processing I think this
says right here so they're gonna have
tighter voltage regulation and that's
going to mean better overall stability
in your system and power delivery so
anyways as I said before that is the ax
1200 I from Corsair a part of the
Professional Series platinum I believe
this is their top of the range power
supply so it should do a really good job
of handling all the different components
that we throw at this ultimate gaming PC
I don't have my graphics cards yet which
are obviously gonna be major
power-hungry devices so once I get those
then you guys get a better idea of how
we're going to use all of this power so
anyway guys I'm gonna keep it moving I'm
gonna keep rolling along like I said
before if you guys enjoyed this content
as well as this entire project remember
to Like and favorite the video as it
does help out a bunch and I'll catch you
guys real soon on another component
unboxing we're gonna blaze through them
we're gonna get to this build trust me
all right later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
