therapy and today we're taking a look at
the crystal white PlayStation 3 limited
edition bundle it is just launched but
it is still available for purchase so if
you're interested in pricing and
availability on this bundle check out
the link in the description I've made it
very convenient for you this bundle
includes one year of PlayStation Plus as
well as three games you're going to get
Ratchet and Clank all for one
LittleBigPlanet - and infamous - but
that's not all you're also going to get
a large 500 gigabyte hard drive which as
far as I know is the largest hard drive
you can get in any of the ps3 models at
the moment I have also unboxed a number
of different ps3 consoles including the
slim the super slim in black and now of
course the super slim in white if you
guys want to check out those other ps3
unboxings those links will be down in
the description as well anyway let's
talk about this unboxing right here as
you can see the first thing that happens
is there is a box inside of a box this
one is the actual console box here you
can see the ps3 that we're about to take
a closer look at this is the white
crystal white model as they're calling
it now I'm excited for this because
normally when Sony releases a white
PlayStation 3 it's only in Japan at
least the only other ones I've seen have
been in Japan if you guys have seen them
here in North America in the past let me
know down in the comments but I have not
as far as I know this launch right here
for this super slim white model is going
to be North America wide I got mine
locally here in Canada but of course
that Amazon link will work for you so it
is available in all of North America as
far as I know talking about the unboxing
you've got your cables as well as the
white controller so not only is the
console going to be crystal white of
course the controller has to match as
well it is unusual to see something so
normal and regular as a PlayStation 3
not in black especially the controller
because I have so many of the black ones
and other colors as well I got a red one
got a bunch of them but white looks cool
as far as I'm concerned so you have the
super slim console which is tiny it's
it's really slim obviously hence the
name and the other thing I like about
the ps3 compared with the other consoles
is that they built the power adapter
right into
unit so all you have to connect is a
power cable there's no gigantic power
brick like the Xbox has so let's take a
closer look at the controller here you
can see it's just like any other
playstation controller besides the fact
that it's white and blending into the
table quite well in terms of cables you
have a USB cable to charge up that
controller as well as a standard AV
cable I really get upset that the
manufacturers don't include an HDMI
cable you guys have heard me rant about
it before they should really include
both for the cost of an extra HDMI cable
I mean it's it really wouldn't hurt them
that much to include it and chances are
you're going to want to connect this to
an HDTV to take advantage of the fact
that it outputs in HD signal if you're
still gaming on an old-school television
without HD I want to know down in the
comment section if anyone still got a
ps3 hooked up to an old-school CRT or
something like that so here's a closer
look at the controller as you can tell
it does blend into this table right here
but it is a nice look as far as I'm
concerned it's kind of got that
stormtrooper white look to it it matches
the console real nice the console is
actually two-tone and as we move across
you can see you've got the button for
power as well as an eject button which
slides the disc tray overall super
Slim's work in this fashion right here
it's a very satisfying little slide over
but you do need to manually close the
disc tray as you can see right here
besides the USB S on the front the rest
of your ports live on the back you're
going to get an Ethernet port as well as
an HDMI optical audio you're going to
get that standard AV output that I don't
recommend you use unless you have to as
well as the power port for connecting
that simple power cable that I mentioned
earlier anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
this unboxing if you did please make
sure to leave a thumbs up down below as
it does help out a bunch and as I said
earlier if you're interested in
