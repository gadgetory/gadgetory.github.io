going to take a closer look at some very
stylish headphones these are the
sennheiser momentum on-ear in a couple
of different colors so without any
further hesitation let's take a closer
look
so in studio today we have the blue
version on the left and the ivory
version on the right but these are just
two of many color variations available
in fact there are seven in total so
there's also pink green black brown and
red if you're interested in checking out
any of those alternative color
variations simply click through the
links down in the description those will
take you to the product purchase pages
where you can not only see pictures of
the other colors but also specifications
pricing availability etc anyways let's
get to the unboxing after all this is an
unboxing and overview video we're going
to get started with the blue version of
the momentum on-ear now these feature
what Sennheiser is calling a custom fit
the headband and ear pads of these
headphones are covered with a super soft
breathable and durable Alcantara if
you've never heard of that material
before it is essentially like a
microfiber so it should be a little bit
more breathable than your average
synthetic material like a synthetic
leather you've got a little bit of
paperwork inside the package and one of
the nicest carrying cases I have ever
received with a set of headphones so
major points to Sennheiser for including
such a nice carrying case
but they've even gone one step further
by including an extra carrying bag so
you've got a bag and a case whichever is
your preference you have two options to
keep your headphones protected free of
dust moisture etc there are a couple of
different cables included this one is
the more basic one which is a simple
mini jack to mini jack cable but
Sennheiser has also included a more
advanced cable which features an inline
remote they are referring to it as the I
remote which will support Apple devices
like the iPod iPad and iPhone it has
volume controls as well as a play/pause
button and also the ability to answer
phone calls with a built-in microphone
this cable is 1.4 meters in length
giving you lots of play when placing
your device in your pocket or backpack
it shouldn't have trouble reaching your
smartphone or other audio player the
cable also terminates into a right angle
connector which is my favorite it's it's
more low-profile and I've always been a
fan of that
as always it's difficult to portray to
you through video alone what the quality
of materials are like when reviewing a
product or unboxing a product but take
my word for it having played with so
many different headphones here on unbox
therapy these are some of the nicest in
terms of build quality now I am NOT the
hugest fan of on ear style headphones I
much prefer a studio style kin that fits
around the outside of your ears that's
because I spend an enormous number of
hours with headphones on my head every
day but I have enjoyed using these for
portable endeavors when I travel between
my office and car and I don't want to be
quite so intimidating carrying around
gigantic headphones on my head so if
you're the type of person that's always
on the go and you're looking for a more
portable solution than an around the ear
style headphone these are definitely a
good mix of portability and sound
quality so before we close out today's
video I want to give another big shout
out to Squarespace for helping make this
content possible it's probably the
easiest way online to get a website up
and running incredibly fast you can do
all kinds of stuff like put a photo
gallery you can put a store in there if
you want to sell merchandise they've got
so many templates to choose from that
you can set something up to your taste
I'm pretty much certain of it there's a
link down in the description so you can
check out Squarespace for yourself this
is what my website is built on so I'm
obviously a big huge fan and you
probably will be too alright guys so
that wraps up this unboxing and first
look at the Sennheiser momentum on-ear
headphones let me know down in the
comments which pair you prefer which
color you prefer the relevant pricing
and availability links will be in the
description if you enjoyed this content

episode thanks for watching later guys
