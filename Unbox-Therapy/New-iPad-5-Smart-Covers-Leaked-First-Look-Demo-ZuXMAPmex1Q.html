with some new information regarding this
right here what is likely the next
generation of full-size iPad or the iPad
5 I showed you in a previous video how
this one relates size-wise to the
previous generation of course it's still
speculation we don't know for certain
that this is going to be the next form
factor but I've got some new evidence
that appears to point in that direction
these are the Smart Covers for the next
generation of iPad or the iPad 5 and
they match perfectly with the dimension
of this one right here that's below me
available in a number of colors as you
can see they're being manufactured by
the thousands so without any more
hesitation let's go ahead and take a
closer look at the next generation of
Smart Covers for the next generation of
iPad so the first thing you're gonna
notice as we zoom out here and you get a
closer look at the selection of colors
it's a bunch of familiar ones that are
carried forward from the previous
generation you've got red as the first
one I'll show you here followed by pink
and next up is a pale gray kind of tone
one that I didn't notice here is the
darker gray version anyways you've got a
burnt orange that's been included in
this shipment as well as this kind of
lime-green ish there's a white one a
black one and then lastly you have this
very popular blue color very similar to
the color of the new blue iPhone 5c
anyways nothing too exciting there as I
said you probably recognize most of
these colors the more interesting part
is the fact that they fit this
unannounced iPad 5 chassis that I
featured in a previous video they fit
exactly and they function as you'd
expect any Smart Cover to function as
you can see you can fold it up and you
know use your iPad in the standing mode
the dimension is bang-on it is exact I
also noticed this part number on the
hinge portion the back portion that
might be interesting to some of you but
the real story here is the fact that we
have this mounting evidence pointing at
a brand new form factor for the next
generation of iPad and the more evidence
that gets compiled by us and other sites
that are getting their hands on
components etc the more likely it is
that this is exactly what the iPad 5
gonna end up looking like anyway guys
that wraps up this video right here if
you didn't catch my original comparison
of the last generation I've had compared
to this leaked chassis on the right hand
side what will maybe be the new
generation of iPad you can check out
that video through a link down in the
