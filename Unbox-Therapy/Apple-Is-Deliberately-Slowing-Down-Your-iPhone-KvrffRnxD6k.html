talk about this recent situation with
Apple specifically regarding the iPhone
and this idea with software updates come
slowdowns to previous models I became
aware of this just like you did I have
to admit when I was reading it and I was
looking at the different screenshots of
the geek bench scores and so on I have
to be honest I wasn't surprised hey man
new phone just came out why is mine
slowing down is Apple trying to tell me
something this is this is something that
people have talked about for a very long
time both of you that aren't familiar
with the back story here's how it breaks
down
Apple recently put out some new software
a user I believe on reddit noticed that
their device was substantially slower
than it had been previously with one of
these recent software updates he ran
some numbers did some comparisons and
figured out that yes there was a
performance decrease in his previous
generation iPhone with the new software
install turns out he wasn't alone people
were basically wondering if this was
something that Apple was doing
intentionally or if it was more of a
nitch scenario now you can see in front
of me here I've got an iPhone 6s and
I've also got the latest iPhone 10 now
of course Apple would love for you to go
out and buy this new one as soon as it
comes out what are you doing sitting on
that old one there come on pull out your
wallet we'll take a few of those pennies
that's how all businesses runs they want
to compel you to upgrade to the next
generation and to do so frequently real
question now was there or is there
something nefarious going on create a
scenario where your phone is not
performing the way that it used you so
that you have to go out then and feel
forced to do an upgrade Apple responded
they came out and said yes this is
happening and here's why the thinking
here is that battery life over time is
going to get worse and one of the ways
that you can mitigate some of that
decreased capacity is to lower the
performance of the device so Apple has
essentially made this move in favor of
battery life over performance now I can
kind of see where they're coming from
for users who are holding on to older
devices it's possible that battery life
is more important to them especially
when you consider the
performance enthusiasts are the ones who
are more likely to upgrade to a new
device to begin with and the people who
are holding on to or recycling old ones
might not be such power users we could
have a huge discussion about which is
more important performance or battery
life it's obvious based on apples
statement that they've made their move
now I think a lot of people who hit me
up on Twitter expected me to come in
here make this video and just go after
Apple to try that again
oh-ho I kind of get what they're doing
like I kind of understand why you might
prioritize battery life the real problem
for me does it have to do with that
decision it has to do with how Apple
went about it by not making people aware
in advance or possibly even giving them
the option maybe you're on this phone
right here the success and maybe your
battery is substantially depleted from
the original capacity when you get that
new software update what about a little
checkbox performance over battery life
or maybe you want battery life over
performance see the problem without
presenting that option is it allows
people on the internet to go down all
sorts of rabbit holes with the
conspiracy theories and so on in fact
it's so far down that path now that
there are two separate class-action
lawsuits that have been filed against
Apple for what some consider to be a
shady business practice now at this
point I do think it's worth noting that
Apple it's that brand that's under the
microscope in a way other brands aren't
at least not to the same extent people
will really look into it and try to
discover these small little tweaks and
and unusual behaviors because a lot of
these stories they have legs you know
people want to know people want to
report on it so it's a possibility that
these types of practices are in place
with other manufacturers as well and it
just hasn't been discovered yet anyway
in my opinion this is something that's
become a big deal that really didn't
have to the opportunity existed for the
user to make that selection
you know you probably still would have a
lot of people picking battery life
anyways and one of the side effects of
Apple's decision here battery
replacement businesses are skyrocketing
in terms of activity because everyone's
thinking oh I can get better
formants out of my iPhone 6's just by
replacing the battery perfect so I want
to send the question to you guys if you
have an older generation iPhone would
you be more likely to select battery
life over performance or performance
over battery life we can use the comment
section down below
determine which is more important to
users via trust Apple do you trust any
of these companies at the end of the day
everyone's trying to make a buck and as
a consumer that should always be front
of mind for you you can make the
decision options are good this episode
