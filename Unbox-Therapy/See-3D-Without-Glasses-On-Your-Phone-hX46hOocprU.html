talking about it it was gonna be on your
TV's it's gonna be on road signs and
everywhere you look the world was
supposed to be three-dimensional here's
the thing you never really caught on I
think the biggest part of that reason is
the fact that you had to wear these
funky looking 3d glasses and people
didn't want to wear them the real thing
that got me excited at the time was this
idea of naked eye 3d that's right I said
naked 3d without fancy funky glasses
this is a phone from a company called
alien line they were like we have a
naked eye glasses list 3d smartphone I
did a little bit of research found out
that it's an IndieGoGo campaign
happening right now I'm gonna have a
link in the description if you want to
check it out but their claim here is
that they've got the 3d smartphone of
your dreams and it will not require
funky glasses seems pretty crazy let's
take a look at this phone so it's gold
and look at that big badge not for sale
so they've certainly sent me their
prototype I hope it's not their only one
but they sent it to me it looks to have
maybe that's a fingerprint reader on the
back I mean a pretty standard smartphone
layout power brick micro USB cable and a
headset okay so pretty standard stuff
the bang and intro track now the first
thing I notice is the display in general
kind of has like almost a layered look
to it when I do that make that little
adjustment you can see how it's
different essentially you're looking at
a pretty basic Android layout but the
magic happens in these icons up here k
3d X gallery 3d video camera 3d player
and 3d camera obviously you're not going
to see those things on a standard
Android device that is unusual I'm
fairly certain that you will not be able
to make that out because after all you
are looking at a single camera lens not
you know stereoscopic eyeballs maybe one
day it can take 3d content movies and
make that available
we'll hear without the glasses all right
so I don't know I mean what duh ooh whoa
whoa
that is very 3d the thing he's poking me
with it's right around this range again
you can't see that what do you see you
just see oh that's actual 3d Wow
I did not expect it to be this effective
I really did not it looks good
it's almost like the effect gets better
and more comfortable the longer that I
look at it they've pre-loaded some
provocative images in here would you say
that's provocative Jack look at the
images all in the gallery it's it's
obvious who loaded this up this must
have been Jack effect my understanding
to make your own 3d images when you snap
a photo you keep moving upwards got it
that's super bizarre for verification
we're bringing Chaz in he's gonna tell
you people oh well what do you see it or
not I can see it he's got like a bunch
of tools and it looks three-dimensional
these are not 3d glasses after today
yeah it's working with or without the
spectacles Chaz say hello to the world
say hello there there he is
okay so the last one to try here GMAX 3d
game maybe like a little bit of a 3d
effect it looks mostly like a 2d game
with like a little bit of extra tiny bit
of depth
honestly I've tried a lot of different
3d on TVs and such this is some of the
most effective 3d I've seen and you
can't really see it but I promise you
these are legit 3d video files naked
eyes these are naked eye well they have
these glutton these eyes are naked okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
