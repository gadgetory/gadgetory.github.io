Jay humble this is one of the most
requested items I've ever had Lou you
gotta try them out now some of you are
private like what's this angle and why
should I care right so I made a video a
little while ago about these headphones
that use a technology called gon
conduction look at me I'm moving a box
in what else am i I'm playing basketball
maybe they actually don't sit over your
ears but instead behind them I was
impressed with those joggers bikers
where you can't obstruct your hearing
but you still want to listen to
something while jungle took it a step
further rather than have a dedicated set
of bone conduction headphones they built
the bone conduction into sunglasses so
now they just looks like a regular pair
of sunglasses but you're listening to
music now these things I think they
earned a bunch of money on Kickstarter
people were all pumped up they were like
well that's cool I got the sunglass that
no one needs to know that I'm listening
to something some extra lens colors
that's like the smokey type of black
there this one is blueish kind of
reflection to it the Panther I believe
is the official name the jungle Panther
some stickers decals lots of them Jack
can put these all over his skateboard
whatever he wants to do okay cool
how do we get this guy open over here
now they connect your device via mother
the mother of my children that was the
mother of my children calling now they
use Bluetooth to connect your device
right so anything you want to broadcast
it's happening wirelessly it'll work on
iOS Android you name it how do I will
write for plus hours of playtime it has
a touch control on the arm of the
sunglasses hard case here
there they are and that's what the
sunglasses look like kind of look like a
pair of Oakley's or something like that
now the magic happens in the backside
here this is where the bone conduction
magic takes place so if I press this
down see that if I hold it it's flashing
blue that should mean that it's in
bluetooth pairing mode jungle panther
and we're paired whoo okay so I've got a
little tint going on I'll be back
they feel like regular sunglasses am I
fooling you Tom they look like regular
sunglasses or what we're gonna play
something here it's kind of this odd
sensations out of my ears obviously I
mean I still hear my surroundings the
music is kind of almost like a
background track right now all right
because you can feel the vibration this
is not an exact one-to-one replacement
for a non ear over ear in-ear headphone
right it requires a slight shift in your
expectations it's not like this pounding
thumping it's just like music is on kind
of in your head it seems to be
originating from within the low end
probably suffers the most in this
particular scenario to have something on
when you're out and about so they're
still making noise right but it's Bose
seeing a form of vibrations it kind of
sounds a little bit muffled until you
put them on I mean I wish it was a
little bit louder let me try a podcast
real quick the world-famous New York
Rick of the MMA our Ariel Helwani
actually I feel like podcasts actually
sound a little bit better I think the
reason for that is because these things
do well in the kind of mid-range in the
treble zone maybe more so than the
low-end you're trying to get your
podcast in on the way to work you like
to take the bike these work these do the
trick
okay so tom is calling me right now and
this thing is blinking can I just answer
it from here I want
I can with the touch I can just touch
the side to answer it okay now Tom how
do I sound like decent or what like a
bluetooth situation in a vehicle yeah
you know what you sound pretty good too
did you ever think you and I we'd be
conversing over sunglasses before no you
didn't think so
I got a news flash for you that's what
we're doing I'm gonna hold these up to
the microphone tell the people something
really important okay well done tom you
can pause it by tapping here and I
believe you can also skip tracks by
swiping oh that did work the bone
conduction thing is kind of a different
thing than what headphones are capable
of right now an alternative maybe you
need to keep your faculties about you
all right now not everybody needs to be
involved but you don't mean to be cut
off from the universe I'm pretty sure
it's is gonna be the same right moss
green blood ruby ash titanium Oasis blue
I just noticed that these lenses they go
from blue to yellow it's kind of cool
I'm the kind of guy when I look at a
Kickstarter I look at some new emerging
product I'm always there's a healthy
dose of skepticism from the get-go but
in this particular case I would say
these things met my expectations it's
pretty much how I expected them to
operate I didn't see them as a
replacement for headphones but instead
to listen to things on the go an
alternative way imagine you're at the
Blue Jays game at the baseball game and
you have the broadcast on you're
watching the game with your sunglasses
as you would be and then you could be
streaming from your phone in the actual
audio broadcast and it's not even gonna
be bothering anybody the types of
scenarios in which these are perfect
have it necessarily all been discovered
yet these are 119 bucks
and there's a lot of colors so it looks
like this still on pre-order how much
money did they raise two million bucks
eleven thousand three hundred forty nine
backers it will not sound as good as
giant over ear headphones or even
earbuds for that matter but the tech is
different and that's the reason you
probably want these and I love to see
new tech companies try and vicious
things who knows maybe the b2 takes it
to another level
we'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
