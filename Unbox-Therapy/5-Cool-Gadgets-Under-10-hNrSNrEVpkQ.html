inexpensive products are concerned I
hear it a lot Lou $3,000 speaker what's
going on here all right we need to value
stuff we need something I can afford
this is five unique strange unusual
gadgets under $10 what do I have in
front of you I want to start with the
flash band
smartphone led fan now it is kind of
chilly where I'm located but maybe it's
not for you
in fact I recently traveled to India and
it's surely not chilly there maybe you
want something like this a little fan
boo you off that plugs into your phone
and I guess it looks cool at the same
time they make a few models black and
white color plug it into your smart
phone your smart phone powers it these
are a little over 10 gotta be honestly
these are like 13 bucks but still okay
close enough oh it's a tight fit
hit the button Oh
oh wow it's more powerful than I
expected and the lights I mean you're
putting on a show all of a sudden sort
of flip it up and this is you that works
for thirteen USB type-c also micro and
iOS I think that's pretty cool in the
same department the USB light I'm gonna
open up the black one here plug it into
a USB port this product can be used with
a power bank laptop and all other USB
devices dependable and bendable I don't
know if it's dependable yet I have a
small power bank over here
and let's see what happens boom you see
you see that that's I mean it's an LED
why is it flashing now if you bend it
it's off
no is this faulty is this do a let's try
another one all right so you plug it in
maybe you have a power outage need a
real quick flashlight that can last for
a really long time and doesn't require
removable batteries double-a batteries
or something like that a little bendable
hopefully dependable USB light okay next
up we have something that just arrived
today it's called Ella pack these guys
they have a pretty basic kind of
proposition here which is that
everybody's got a charge cable or some
headphones sitting around so in your
house you might have a bunch of
different charge cables
one of them's yours your sibling they're
stealing your cable who knows what
they're up to they all look the same and
you can't prove it after the fact comes
in a bunch of different colors I mean
this is this a basic lightning cable
that's actually not so bad and I guess
the intention here is that you cut it to
size also we're gonna come back to this
we're gonna put Bowl to work he's gonna
show us the finish product there the
next one is probably my favorite of the
bunch this is really cool this product
here is called life light emergency LED
bulbs it's a four to five hour emergency
life of course there's all kinds of
smart bulbs out there in the world
you've seen them in the past and they're
cool nothing wrong with those this one
kind of takes a different approach
there's no app for it nothing too fancy
like that and that's part of the reason
why it's inexpensive and the key factor
with this is when the power goes out it
keeps running so it has a built-in
rechargeable battery it'll be charging
up as it sits in your socket and then
when the power goes out this thing still
has five hours of battery life now I
have one set up in a lamp over here I go
ahead I turn it on it works I turn it
off continues to function you're like I
don't get
you what's the big you've got them it's
plugged in oh is it is it how about this
that is the prong that's juice coming
from look that's all the cables right
there that's juice coming straight from
the bulb and you can see the switch
still function in the event of a power
outage these babies they just fire on
your switch still works I'm not gonna
ask questions it just does that's pretty
cool especially at the price point these
things for 4:30 and then you get for
free is well under the $10 price point
of the other items in this video and I
don't know if that's just genius all
bulbs should have that they also give
you this little clip adapter so this
thing they include in the Box this
little clip with a hanger on it this
will then act as a switch it doesn't get
hot because it's an LED and once again
it's durable - that's not glass 10,000
hour lifetime to a loved one in the
event of a power outage they're gonna be
thinking about you when that light kicks
on it man I love that person and I love
you you're always thinking about me now
it is worth noting they're not the only
people who make this type of bulb but
there's a few others on Amazon as well
but this is the one I tested and it
works and it's cool and it's cheap I
could say whatever I want please leave
so mo is finished with his arts and
crafts project eight bucks for two of
these I guess it's a little cheaper than
just replacing the cable I don't know
about the value there when you could
just grab another cable look at this I
don't know different colors Ella pack
it's kind of interesting this is not
nylon it's more of a plastic material
but nonetheless that's what it ends up
looking like and it's definitely cooler
than the original cable it's probably
not gonna tangle as easily either there
you have it all right why don't we have
last up maybe the most exciting this was
most selection for the day the storm
proof sweep fire strike able fire
starter windproof waterproof made from
renewable biofuel this will burn for
seven minutes each ten bucks $9.99 for
20 of these fire starters it's made from
sugarcane that's interesting outdoor use
only
all right we're taking a real
don't try this at home maybe we are
outdoors you just you just don't know
that this is an outdoor studio you would
never know all right with the backdrop
keep your unused fire starters in this
plastic wrap okay so that's what it
looks like there a little bit of water
here
I guess I'll dunk it Oh dunkaroo
that's properly wet look at that let's
try to strike it when it's wet Oh baby
whoa
that is that is a serious plate hope
suffocation water ain't gonna stop that
thing once again this is for outdoor use
only
don't try this at home I'm a trained
professional that's the face of a
professional right there yeah anyhow
there it is bunch of cool gadgets under
or right around ten dollars now you
can't possibly say that everything I
show and this channel is unattainable
you're probably afford some of these and
say that you participated in the full
extent of the unbox therapy universe by
potentially enjoying one of these
yourself okay good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
