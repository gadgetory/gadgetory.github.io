therapy just got back from the Apple
store got one of the brand new nanos as
well as a watch strap I'm not gonna
unbox the Nano here I've already done
that I'll post a link in the annotations
as well as down below in the description
but let's talk about the watch strap
this is the carbon from I watches and I
can't wait to get those new watch faces
that were released at the last keynote
onto a real nice watch strap I did unbox
another eye watches strap in the past
I'll put a link to that as well in the
description it was the Q series it was
cheaper than this this one was about 50
bucks and as you can see you just get
the watch strap for your hard-earned
cash that's about all so if your budget
minded you might want to look at that
video that's the Q series this one is
the Carbon series but you do get an
upgrade in quality this one has a metal
clip in the center instead of plastic
and leather strap with a carbon fiber
exterior it's not actual carbon fiber
but the pattern has the appearance of
carbon fiber with some nice stitching
around it does come in different colors
you can get that stitching in a number
of different colors black red this is
the silver I guess you'd call it or
charcoal maybe and it feels really light
it's got AI watches branding all over it
but as you can see on the inside of the
band it is leather so you got to slide
your ipod nano on there it's a little
bit nerve-wracking at first you don't
want to scratch it but it does slide on
nice and once you get it in there you
feel a click you feel in here a click to
let you know that you've done it
correctly so that is a little bit
reassuring you still get access to your
nice Apple logo on the inside of the
band and of course all of your buttons
ports everything necessary to operate it
so you don't have to pull it out of
there every two seconds which is nice of
course now the reason you buy a strap
like this is to put you know the watch
up on it the watch face stopwatch so on
and so forth but this version is hasn't
been updated yet so I got to throw that
in the computer I'm going to do in a
second and show you guys all these new
watch faces but here's a closer look at
the band and there's what it looks like
when it's on I got to say I'm not sure
if I have a huge wrist or if this strap
is small because I only have a couple
extra holes left on the band so if you
got a really big wrist this might not
work if you
small wrist it probably will so children
are welcome welcome to buy this I guess
but a super light I mean I don't even
feel it there now you're gonna want to
hook this up to your computer get it
updated straight away so that you know
you can get those new watch faces I
called my watch pod hit the Update
button in a few seconds you're gonna see
this upgrade here all the icons are
gonna get bigger by default you can
change those if you want to go back to
the old style and you want to go into
date and time and just like that you get
all the options in the world everything
from Kermit the Frog to some pretty
advanced looking clocks you know and the
basic ones that we had from before white
and black face you've got a slightly
older style London style and this one
that's like looks like some of the Nike
watches I knew there's an understated
gold one there's some incredibly
technical looking ones this one has a
mechanical appearance to it like a like
an actual watch that you'd wind or
something this one has the date on it
that is useful and a digital readout and
an analog readout so as you guys can see
this so much to choose from you can
personalize your nano and pick whatever
works for you you know I have a few that
are my favorites and I keep on there
most of the time first and foremost
there's this one which is like an
old-school looking clock this one
because it's super easy to look down
glance from a distance and see the time
this one cuz it just looks cool and if
you're a super badass you just throw
Mickey Mouse on there wait for somebody
to say something anyway something else
you guys need to do is make sure that
the nano wakes up to the clock by
default because otherwise they're gonna
wake up to the last place you were so if
you're in clock you will wake up to the
clock but if you're not if you're just
in the menu or something you won't so
you got to jump into settings once again
you want to pick date and time and once
you're in there you want to put time on
wake you want to activate that time on
wake once you do so it's gonna wake up
to your clock whatever clock you chose
by default no matter what you were doing
or where you were so real cool stuff
anyway guys I'm gonna put together a
review on the concept of wearing your
nano as a watch and if it's practical
and if you should consider it
and if you like this content here and
you want to see that then be sure to
LIKE and favorite this video as it does
help me out a bunch whenever you guys do
that and definitely stick around a
channel because I know a lot of people
have been interested in this concept and
it is a little bit different it's a
little bit strange but I'll let you know
about the ins and outs how everything
works and whether or not it's for you so
anyway guys until next time and as
always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
