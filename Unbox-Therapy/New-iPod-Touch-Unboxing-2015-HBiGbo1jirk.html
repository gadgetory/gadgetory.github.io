another video and today we are checking
out the newly released iPod Touch now I
know it looks a lot like the previous
generation but there are some
significant improvements in this one and
that's important because this device
hasn't been updated since 2012 whoa
many expected to touch to have been
updated a long time ago that didn't
happen but here we are today with the
new improved version it now has the a 8
processor so it's about six times faster
than the previous version it's got an 8
megapixel camera that's a big
improvement over the previous one as
well it's got better Wi-Fi 802 a
gigabyte of RAM and the new m8 motion
coprocessor processor processor which is
capable of unlocking all of the various
fitness functionality that you're used
to in the latest iPhone now it's in the
iPod touch also some new colors the one
that's in front of me here is the gold
version 32 gigabyte gold you can also
get it in a new blue and a very flashy
pink which would be perfect for Jack
alright so let's go ahead and open up
this new iPod touch and as you know
Apple always bring in the heat with the
very slick unboxing experience ooh yes
sir look they know how to do it what can
I say
there's the gold now my first choice was
the blue in fact I have a blue one
that'll be here on Monday but this was
available in stores who are like you
know what people want to see this new
device let's go ahead and pick one up in
the store so I have two I don't know
what that means
does that mean I'll give one away
possibly a little bit of paperwork how
to use your iPod Touch lightning cable
and the world-famous
ear pods this thing is so tiny so slim
so maintenance feels so small here it is
compared to my s6 active and you can see
it's absolutely dwarfed but that's a
good thing for a media player as I
mentioned it used to have the little
Loup in the corner there where you could
pop it out and put it on your wrist they
gave up on that concept apparently the
front-facing camera is also improved it
can now do burst photos that's right
burst selfies I know you need that
nobody needs that now the price points
have remained the same there is now a
128 gigabyte version of the iPod Touch
that's also new you're gonna have
essentially the same experience as an
iPhone experience on here hello there
let me grab this and I'll do some video
as well okay so it cropped in a little
bit when you start to record video this
is the dreaded portrait mode video that
we're watching right now and in
landscape there we go
quick little sample of the improved
photo and video quality so it's kind of
like a cool little cool little half step
and it starts at 200 bucks which is
really affordable this is the new iPod
touch in gold got a blue one coming like
I said gotta figure out what to do with
that might end up in one of your hands
alright I'm actually done now wait I
didn't test the forward-facing camera
that's improved let me do a burst selfie
real quick on the way out
whoa can you hear that wow that's really
quick
people are serious about their selfies
aren't they they are all right I'm
actually done now look at that it does
look good you got to give that to the
ipod touch all right thanks very much
