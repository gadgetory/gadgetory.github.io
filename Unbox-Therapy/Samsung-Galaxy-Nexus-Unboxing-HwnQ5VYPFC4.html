therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Samsung Galaxy Nexus the mythical
beast the monster with the large screen
it was once called the Nexus Prime but
that didn't last too long here it is in
the flesh and as I said earlier it's all
screen top-to-bottom and that screen has
a crazy resolution 1280 by 720 that is
HD in your pocket if you know what I'm
saying I'm gonna put the device down for
a second give you guys a taste of what
else is included in a box after all this
is unbox therapy we've got a little
power brick a little bit of paperwork
here in French and English after all
this is a Canadian device at least it
was shipped and sold here in Canada
ahead of the official launch might I
might I say we've also got the standard
Galaxy series headphones a USB to
microUSB cable I'll give you a closer
look at that in a second and a semi
large battery forget that a large
battery you're gonna need it to you know
power up that big screen so here's that
micro USB it has a nice sized nub on the
micro side so probably a little bit more
rugged hopefully a little bit more tough
and then we've got the standard Galaxy
series headset if you've ever owned a
galaxy device you've probably seen one
of the standard 3.5 milimeter a slight
in-ear style the exact same ones that
came with the Galaxy Tab 10 1 and even
my original Galaxy S so these have been
around for a little while you've got
your inline a microphone and remote for
answering and ending calls of course
kind of important for a phone and here's
a closer look at that power brick kind
of Apple esque nice portable compact
Samsung insignia across the top so here
is that large battery that I gave you a
glimpse of earlier it is actually
seventeen hundred and fifty mili amp
hours that is the rating so you're going
to get some decent battery life but
we'll have to wait and see how it holds
up to this huge screen here it is I
guess that's the money shot right there
it has a nice textured finish along the
back of the device but it's really all
about this nice curved display on the
side of the unit we have these little
metallic contacts for docking the
it's real easy to dock in the official
dock we have our power button on that
side as well and then on the bottom of
the devices where the microUSB the
headphone jack is and then we've got our
volume rocker on the left side of the
device on the back side is where you'll
find your camera your shooter as well as
an LED flash and that cool textured
finish that I mentioned earlier it's
kind of a grippy material so you're
probably not going to drop this thing by
accident I sure as hell hope you don't
on the front of the device it's pretty
simple as I said it's all screen you've
got your spear headphone or speaker
whatever you want to call it up by your
ear as well as your forward-facing
camera now let's go ahead and cert the
battery boot this thing up and see if it
blows us away as I'm expecting you got
to clip the backpack on it's a little
bit finicky but you're not going to do
it very often so here it is the nice
fresh Google logo no branding here at
all no motoblur no TouchWiz the vanilla
experience if you will that always gets
me excited its unadulterated Android Ice
Cream Sandwich are you guys excited well
you can probably tell that I am but a
brand new boot up screen as you notice
every some things have changed a little
bit as far as the set up I'm not going
to bore you guys with that let's go
ahead and test the browser let's see how
much faster it is let's go ahead and
launch up unbox therapy comm why not hey
if you guys haven't checked out that
website go ahead you might enjoy what's
going on over there plus I'm going to
have high-res images of this particular
device over there so that might be worth
your while and anyways as you see it
loaded up real quick I have a heavy site
by that I mean I've got a lot of
high-res images loading ads the embedded
YouTube videos are tough to load as well
so it did a great job some of the UI
things have changed of course there's
too much to totally go over everything
there is to cover in this unboxing so
you guys know I'm gonna let you know how
everything goes with this but the main
thing here is this screen this crazy
screen it is incredibly tight from a
pixel density standpoint that means
you're not going to see any dots any
pixels on here just nice crisp text it's
unreal I can't portray it to you through
camera through the camera through the
video technology that I'm stuck with
here
so here's the device compared to my
Nexus s obviously the last Google
branded device and as you can see
they're not that different they have the
same curved design the the Nexus S is
obviously a little bit smaller but from
a weight standpoint they sort of feel
similar I'd say weight wise although the
distribution is obviously different but
not a huge change here as far as putting
in your pocket carrying it around my
hand can reach anywhere on this gigantic
screen which actually surprises me in
portrait mode you get a nice big
keyboard and it gets even better in
landscape mode as you guys can see this
is this is like a mini tablet to be
honest with you I mean this is a nice
big screen and you can also see that the
software Android buttons have flipped
around to deal with the landscape mode
very cool I'm very excited enjoyed every
second I've spent with this phone to
this point as you guys can tell you're
definitely going to want to subscribe

proper review for my opinion might take
all that kind of stuff anyway guys if
you enjoyed this video hopefully you can

subscribed yet you might want to do so

this phone on its way as well as content
