me you've probably never seen it before
based on the thumbnail the title you
probably at this point trying to know
what we're dealing with an incredibly
limited edition phone that never
launched in North America it was
strictly in parts of Asia it's a vivo
device and the craziest part about this
it's a Steph Curry phone a Steph Curry
smartphone for vivo you know what that's
kind of cool
it kind of reminds me of the sneaker
game a little bit in fact the box almost
looks like some sneakers don't take
yourself so seriously all the time you
won't do a Steph Curry phone do a Steph
Curry phone I was able to get my hands
on x-play six vivo Steph Curry phone
it's right here in front of us today as
far as I know this is the first NBA
player smartphone Jordan didn't have one
I don't think LeBron has one you could
start a trend here who knows and kaboom
we have another box in the Box you can
see Steph with the jump shot right there
what a beautiful jump shot
we've also got the signature still
sealed there's some people are gonna be
mad at me for busting this seal because
like I said it is a collector's item
this thing it goes first it goes for a
few dollars we have a limited
Steph Curry stick on older slash stand
and these are very popular this acts as
a stand for the smartphone you can slide
your finger through it and it's like one
of those a confidence thing when you're
holding your phone you're not gonna drop
your phone like that limited edition
Steph Curry wristband you got the Golden
State logo so if you're a superfan at
this point you're starting to get happy
now if I lift up this next tray here
look at that Steph Curry himself beau
just tossing the ball around and then a
sports towel look at that Golden State
number 30 sports towel okay it's all
part of the special package the Steph
Curry phone it's hard to believe it's a
real thing let's break the seal it's
called unbox therapy not collect forever
therapy we need to see what it's like
even if it's a collector's item okay
little gold accent on the side here's
the device ooh
so fancy Oh specialty case this is the
case you would have got with this device
and this is because you're special and
you bought the limited edition a headset
interchangeable irritation it looks like
USB charge cable and a power brick let's
unwrap it
oh-ho-ho-ho-ho that is flashy that's a
Golden State blue right there
a real vibrant blue and the antenna
bands are in the Golden State yellow so
the whole thing kind of ends up looking
like a Jersey it's like you're wearing a
Steph courier is he on your phone look
at the attention to detail yours on the
inside of the headphone jack there's a
yellow accent and even I don't know if
Jack's gonna see this on the inside of
the micro USB there's a yellow accent as
well you see the dual camera setup over
here let's boot it up whoa look at the
skin on that that's wild
Golden State team wild so Stephan Korea
they're a media player with the Golden
State logo and color scheme the
hiim icon to change the theme as a
golden state jersey your photo albums as
Steph Curry right on it I mean the
camera icon is in Golden State color
this is all software and so this is
adjustable but of course I mean let's be
honest if you're going with the Steph
Curry limited edition phone you you kind
of have to rock the whole package here
we actually have the Pro Bowl video for
this device what can I say guys I mean
it's cool look I get it alright this
phone it's not for everyone it's for
enthusiasts it's for people who have a
particular passion they went all out
sort of with the color scheme they
switch the antenna bands it's a bit of
fun the NBA has exploded particularly in
China there's excitement around those
personalities you probably would have
never known that this device and this
collaboration existed so I wanted to
bring that to you a nice little piece of
smartphone history you might not be
aware of I'm not really gonna evaluate
this phone the real purpose of
showcasing this now is as a collector's
item as something special and limited
but I'm sitting here thinking about what
my version might look like if I could go
in there and tweak a few things on some
of my favorite smartphone what
modifications would I make how would I
make it special so there it is the Steph
Curry phone unbox here on unbox therapy
it might not be for you but if you're a
Steph Curry fan or an NBA fan I can't
think of a more basketball phone than
this thing right here put it in the
archives put it in a glass case say
you're one of the few you got the Steph
Curry phone lucky you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
