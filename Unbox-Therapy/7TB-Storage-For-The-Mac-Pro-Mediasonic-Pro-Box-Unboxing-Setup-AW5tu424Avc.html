taking a look at a product from meadia
sonic it's an inexpensive external
storage box for three-and-a-half inch
hard drives it is incredibly simple and
straightforward it just takes a bunch of
these guys three and a half inch drives
and turns them into external USB 3 or
eSATA storage now in this particular
case there's no RAID controller built-in
I'm not really interested in using raid
functionality with this enclosure this
is just a bunch of disks that I want to
use for different files media files
backing up etc and since I had a couple
of 1.5 inch long point
1.5 terabyte 3.5 inch drives sitting
around I was like you know what why go
and get a really super expensive
external box that already has the drives
in it when I can get an enclosure and
use this stuff I already have plus I
have a 4 terabyte drive so I'm gonna be
putting 7 terabytes of storage in here
along with leaving one bay open to
expand at a later date maybe with
another 4 terabyte again this is really
inexpensive I will link it down in the
description it should be around a
hundred bucks depending on where you
find it very useful for individuals who
are on a laptop or in my case I'm back
pro which doesn't have a ton of internal
storage so I can sit this thing away
from the system if it makes a little bit
of noise not such a big issue and I can
hide it in a cabinet and just have one
single USB 3.0 cable going back to the
Mac Pro alright let's go ahead and unbox
this thing and take a closer look and of
course install all of the drives that I
have over there now I don't expect too
many surprises in here probably just the
Box a power adapter a USB cable the box
number one and item
there's a 16 terabyte capacity on here
apparently and as I said before it has
eSATA functionality so in theory if you
had a RAID controller you could use use
this with raid functionality if that's
something you're looking to do through
that use data for but of course eSATA is
not all that quick these days compared
to USB 3 or Thunderbolt for that matter
maybe if you have some old eSATA
functionality that that's sitting around
an eSATA card installed in an old PC or
old Mac Pro or something like that so if
you have eSATA equipment this will
support that so it's a nice tiny little
box here build quality feels really nice
this is metal up here on the front you
have the pro box logo forebay enclosure
a little bit plastic here protecting the
front there's some buttons on the on the
front as well there's an interface
button the sync button a fan button it
does have either automatic or manual fan
control depending on what you're going
for there is an internal thermal sensor
which will be able to adjust the fan
speed in conjunction with the heat of
the drives that are installed in there
since I'm going to be using this as just
a bunch of big discs I won't necessarily
need to worry about the sizes of the
drives matching like you would in a raid
configuration this door on the front let
me see oh cool ok you just there you go
it's spring-loaded you just push down
and then boom just like that this comes
right off and you have a hard drive one
hard drive two hard drive 3 and hard
drive for the pinch they're easy that
comes off this comes out and that's it
you have all of your connections in the
back there I guess I might as well go
ahead and attempt to ok let me just show
you the back the side in the back first
before I install the drives here's where
your power port is for your power
adapter which I assume is in this box
over here yep power adapter power cable
a USB 3 cable eSATA cable cool and
the cages it looks like these are going
to have to be installed onto your drives
yeah onto your drives before they go in
so there is a little bit installation
required so this little booklet here
will get you started
normally I don't read these things but
in this case it's useful when you're
dealing with anything mechanical the
back you can see a fan as well as your
eSATA connector and a USB 3 port and
then if I pull this off what is that I
don't know I think this is only used
when you have another interface they do
make different models of this pro box
and so maybe if you add a third
interface like firewire or I don't they
don't make a Thunderbolt one but maybe
if there's another interface on your box
it'll probably use that section right
there so otherwise a pretty stock
looking box now it is time for me to do
the installation so I'll probably speed
through this part and come back after
I've got these things installed compared
a lot the Nomad moves I never faked them
over like the white you'd be through
just a stake home pin with your eyes but
it chased the surf a table shot my
Labradoodle egg will take my pounding on
the favour by this idea someone to do it
right out of Flushing percussion gushy
after this session Rachel the luncheon
on my Scandinavia serve up a puffy
trying to show the dog on the mouth
nothing nothing many plus to the neck
which you expect I'm with that shoulder
respect say she's your topic okay so
there you have it very easy installation
actually this is pretty heavy now much
more solid than I expected it to be for
the price feels robust the drives
install very easily there is a little
bit of tool work involved but it's dead
simple and they include a mini
screwdriver which is awesome of course
you're going to want to put your extra
little thing here your extra little
adapter in a safe spot for when you want
to expand the last Bay or maybe you
already have done so when you purchase
this thing if you have four drives but
these are just they basically like
little handles so that you can get the
drives out easily when you want to they
do make a raid version of this if you
are interested in setting up like a raid
5 raid 0 raid 1 you're still stuck with
USB 3 instead of say like Thunderbolt 2
on the new Pegasus product but that's a
totally different price bracket so it's
it's hard to even compare but the main
thing here is that now I have 7
terabytes sitting here 7 terabytes of
external storage very inexpensive device
so if you've got hard drives lying
around this is a great way to utilize
them in one convenient little package
with one USB cable instead of say
getting an independent external
enclosure for each of those hard drives
and then having a bunch of different
drives sticking out of the back of your
PC so I'm gonna go and set this thing up
with my Mac Pro do some backups do some
tests put my move some of my media over
here and I'll probably use the 4
terabyte internal drive as a backup
drive a time-machine drive and then the
other two 1.5 terabyte drives as just
extra storage because I've only got 1 TB
of SSD I can't believe I said only 1 TB
of SSD I've got the 1 terabyte Mac Pro
so it's not really enough for all of my
extra media etc so therefore what I'll
be doing is just keeping the OS on the
one terabyte SSD the applications and
then whatever project I'm currently
working on because it is very quick
obviously internal SSD is about as fast
as you can get the model name and number
is kind of not very attractive
f2 - s u3 s - anyway I'll link the
product down in the description if you
are interested and as always if you have
any questions about this product or
anything featured here on the channel
make sure to ask me on Twitter it's the
place where I'm the most active I am at
unbox therapy thanks as always for

content make sure to leave a thumbs up
down below and I will catch you on the
next episode later guys so not only is
Squarespace a great place to set up your
very first website it's also a great
place to set up your very first web
store that's because they've got
commerce functionality built right in no
extra charge
it's there and it's very easy to use in
fact I have already implemented it on my
site unbox therapy comm we sell some
t-shirts and some stickers just basic
stuff but it works just as well for
digital merchandise so if you're a
musician maybe a hip-hop producer or
you're in a band and you want to start
to monetize some of your content it's a
great way to reach out to fans and to
actually sell some stuff to them the
interface is incredibly easy to use
trust me I was intimidated at the
concept of e-commerce in the beginning
and having used the Squarespace service
I am not intimidated at all anymore in
