first I was like what is that is that
just a mousepad but it turns out it's
kind of a combination scenario now in
this channel I've looked at so many
different mice in fact it's a specific
area of interest for me constantly
upgrading from one to the next and
usually that's in the Logitech
performance range all right but it's got
all these New Age features but one of
them is not extensive battery life when
I looked more closely at this box right
here that is an interesting concept the
best of CES 2018 this is a combination
scenario the pad charges up the mouse am
I right about that is that what's
actually going on here razer hyper flux
wireless power technology for seamless
uninterrupted power so you've got two
gaming mouse you're gonna have a gaming
mouse pad anyways but now you're not
tethered by any kind of cable at all
because the pad itself is wirelessly
charging up and powering the mouse
that's not really where it ends because
it is a razer product so you know
they're gonna go overboard with the RGB
colors powered by razer chroma 16.8
million customizable color options so
it's gonna glow on your desk fit into
your whole gaming aesthetic it's got a
16,000 dpi 5g optical sensor hyper flux
wireless power there is the mouse
Mamba hyper flux some nice grip on it
actually quite comfortable you have your
forward back button or whatever you
choose to map that to still has a
microUSB port textured scroll wheel as
well something very satisfying about
that they're a micro USB cable which is
braided oh cool alright so here's the
mousepad it's actually a pretty generous
size as well oh oh very cool the way
they did that so reversible so if you
like the softer more classic mousepad
feel that is very soft then you have
that option to lip this up and go for
the harder surface as well if that's
more your style quite satisfying in fact
well which which one you like better
you like the soft surface most gamers
aren't even dealing with Wireless lack
of latency lack of potential lag and so
on that could be introduced
wireless this piece here will be plugged
into your PC or your laptop doesn't
really matter perfect okay cool
I've got the blade system here the
17-inch the big one let's see what we're
working with here some yellowish green
along the edge I like it it's more
subtle than I expected congratulations
getting your razor Mamba hyper flux
connected wow that is a nice smooth
mousing experience so far expand your
arsenal by doubling the number of
customizable buttons with razor hyper
shift technology now the mouse has its
own RGB coloring as well on a razer logo
over here as well as up on the scroll
wheel LED indicator here as well when
it's on the pad and then that goes away
when you pull it away let me give the
other surface a shot
oh man that's like a soft pillow much
quieter as well you want give it a shot
well
oh that's smooth that is it's crazy yeah
very smooth give that one a shot there
now I wonder if we should turn off some
lights here to really experience the RGB
effect ooh wow look at that glow oh my
goodness
aggressive so here we've got the Razer
synapse software and the whole goal here
is to make it easy to customize your
experience with your razor peripherals
so we can see the Mamba hyperflex over
here if I click on that we can go in
here and customize all kinds of aspects
about the mouse and we can create
different profiles for different devices
we can adjust the brightness of the
overall lighting it's at normal right
nomina boost this up to bright the
effects available to you are everything
from spectrum cycling like it's doing
right now changing colors to breathing
reactive settings here this mouse and
mouse pad integrates really well with
this particular laptop I mean it looks
good collectively prompts the software
right away the question is for somebody
like me can this replace my current
mouse setup with the MX master 2 s that
one actually has a couple of extra
buttons that I use frequently this idea
of the mouse pad powering the mouse so
that it remains wireless is something I
really into I don't think competitive
gamers are gonna be the first ones to
shift over to this type of setup is a
lot of them are very particular for me
the thing is smooth and quick this thing
is cool and they're gonna be really
happy with the overall fit and finish
and the fact that they never have to
manually plug their wireless mouse in
anymore
I think it's kind of cool that's my tip
today's episode of unbox the P is
brought to you by the vast 35 inch
curved display did you just die did you
just die here we're right in the middle
of it and you're dead already this is a
gaming monitor on a budget this thing is
$5.99 on mass drop it's got a 34 40 by
1440 resolution it's got three HDMI
ports and a display port the display is
a hundred Hertz it has an internal power
supply so there's no power brick also
the power cable plugs in on the side
here and it has cable management at the
back it also has a headphone jack
can actually go into portrait mode
obviously not the ideal scenario for
video games possibly for productivity
you can stack up a couple of these
together two millisecond response time
you can get your fortnight in there and
hopefully do better than Ryan has done
here he placed 78 we called on him for
this one thing this one time that is not
representative of his actual skill level
we were playing this this game last
night Ryan finished fourth quite
impressive for a man of his stature
anyway it's on mass drop the link is
gonna be down in the description I mean
that's a budget deal you've been waiting
you got that ugly monitor on your desk
maybe you're gonna get a performance
advantage here you see a little bit more
all right you look around the corner you
catch an extra kill or two you make it
to the final five I've come third I'm
gonna win a game though tonight I'm
gonna win the game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
