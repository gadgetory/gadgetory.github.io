coverage what's up guys Lew here and
I've got an unusual one for you from the
show floor here at CES 2013 this is a PC
case from in win and it is called the D
frame as you can tell incredibly unique
might be to your taste might not but the
concept here is to have a completely
open design chassis that's going to
provide an incredible amount of airflow
for the components that you put inside
of here it's also going to make upgrades
incredibly easy to do and give you a lot
of space to work on your next build when
it ships to you it'll come in a couple
of different pieces so you actually
construct the chassis on your own this
means that the box size and the shipping
expense will be a little bit less but it
also means there's a little bit of work
for you to do though the fasteners are
fairly large and you can probably build
the thing in a couple of minutes it's
not really a big deal so once again it's
called the D frame and it will fit a
standard ATX or micro ATX motherboard
standard power supply as well you've got
one spot for a drive bay a 5.25 inch
drive man and a bunch of slots for
traditional three and a half inch say
hard drives for example there's acrylic
windows on each side so you can see
through and admire all of your
components even in the areas that are
not open-air the PSU installs on the
back and it is completely open-air in
that location so a lot of cooling around
your PSU as well as all your other major
components you can fit a couple large
graphics cards in here and once again
the whole concept here is to get air
flow for all those components
potentially making things like
overclocking a little bit easier to do
if you're hoping to do that only on air
cooling now it does come in a couple of
different colors I showed you the orange
one first this is what it looks like in
red I believe it is a powder coat finish
because it feels pretty tough and
durable so you probably won't have to
worry about too many chips on the paint
I believe you can use the case in either
the stand up form factor so standing
upright on your desk or you can lay it
down in the fashion that the red one is
here so that's completely up to you
whichever you prefer so as you guys can
tell an incredibly unique case here from
in win as I said earlier might be to
your taste might not but for an
enthusiast it allows for a lot of
adjustability in your personal
configuration and it also gives you a
cool way to show off all your awesome
anyway guys a lot more to come from CES
2013 coverage as I said before a huge
inventory of stuff for me to get through
and lots more for you to watch subscribe
if you haven't yet thumbs up down below
and I'll catch you guys on the next one
so I just finished checking out Jim
count of 5 that's Ken Bloch latest video
and right now I'm standing beside his
car which is even better that's because
I'm out here at CES 2013 and I get to
see all kinds of cool things including
Ford vehicles they've also got some
really cool features including sync sync
is about helping you keep connected
while you're on the go one of the most
useful features of sync is its ability
to control what you listen to sync app
link gives you the power to control apps
like Pandora and slacker radio with your
voice sometimes you want to listen to
your own tunes sync makes it so easy it
gives you hands-free control of your
music digital music player USB Drive or
any other compatible storage device even
better if you ask it to play similar
music simple leaving use your tunes to
make a playlist thanks again to Ford for
powering unbox therapies CBS special</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
