brought to you by Squarespace so I got
some prize and I got a cheeseburger
Hey
I'm gonna hit it with the milkshake now
yes sir
that's what you need to do when you take
a brand-new unreleased car Alfred
car drives nice really because that's an
electric this is my first time driving
an all-electric car so we have a couple
of displays up here this one is
dedicated to how much range you have
remaining you can see it says 41 miles
there the car can do between 80 and 100
miles depending on conditions whether or
not you're using air conditioning and
stuff like that it can recharge then in
3 hours so a fairly quick recharge I
believe on 240 volts in cooperation with
charge point so if you have a charging
station on the charge point network near
you you can obviously use that to
recharge as well the information system
here is controlled down here rather than
be touch which kind of makes sense
because this is where your hand
naturally is in this location and this
is a bit of a reach and so by turning
this dial here I can I can affect
changes up on the display here and you
have a d-pad as well as a menu button
this menu button will bring up you know
multimedia stuff navigation bluetooth
for your phone etc and you just click
down to select a particular one and I
thought it was pretty cool when the
hotels actually showed up you can see
them over there on the left hand side if
we go down this strip it'll probably be
even better-looking just waiting for the
world's longest light the whole car the
hope the whole concept here is to heaven
as renewable materials as possible in
use so the wood up here in the front
he said that was eucalyptus wood right
now I
it's an open port wood so it doesn't
need a lot of chemicals or finishes on
top of it same thing on the doors this
material over here was a made out of
recycled plastic bottle there's a lot of
tech inside of here but we were told
that there's gonna be an option for a
park assist which is kind of on on
another level at least for what I've
heard of a park assist feature where if
you're in an urban environment it'll
actually scope out would-be parking
spots on the sides of the road if it
sees one that is sufficient in size for
this car to fit it'll notify you at
which point you can either select left
or right and enable the auto park or
Park Assist feature so that it can park
itself into that spot but that's kind of
the next level as far as I have heard
the part of it where it's gonna be able
to identify the spot prior to you
needing to see it or pick it or whatever
which is part of the battle when you're
trying to drive through an urban
environment is seeing where those spots
even exist
so yeah the car is gonna be $41,000 to
start and then of course if you trick it
out with everything you can add it'll go
up from there obviously there's more and
more sort of activity in the
all-electric space and it appears to be
bringing prices down but in terms of fit
and finishing quality inside it feels
like a BMW the interior space see if you
can show them the backseat like yeah I
was told that the interior space is
equivalent to a 3-series BMW so a
reasonable amount of interior space and
a lot of headroom like I'm 6 feet tall
and I'm nowhere close to that headliner
there and the window there actually
gives you a perception of even more
space so you don't feel cramped in here
at all even if you're a slightly bigger
person when we were back at the in-n-out
burger we got all kinds of people paying
attention to the car and seeing it and
being like what is that it looks so
unusual etc mostly like really positive
feedback the entire frame of the vehicle
is actually constructed using carbon
fiber and aluminum so most of the body
is carbon fiber and back at the
Convention Center you can actually see
just the body the frame identified and
it's amazing how much of it actually is
carbon fiber and that's been decided on
they've chosen carbon fiber for a couple
of different reasons it's strong while
still being lightweight so it gives the
car a better level of efficiency than if
they had have done with traditional
materials and then on top of that it's a
relatively renewable material Oh another
thing I forgot to mention that happened
when I first got into the car was
somebody pulled up really tight behind
me or was trying to get in and it was
identified on the screen that there was
an object really close to me so it has
proximity sensors all around it and it
was actually really cool and really
responsive as soon as I pulled away it
removed that sort of warning so it
didn't need to be prompted like I didn't
need to turn it on or it wasn't only
when I was in Reverse or anything like
that
if the same interior spaces the face
here
with a much shorter wheelbase because
let's take a picture with my boys it's a
cool shot
as far as cycling did anybody else
realize about cycling pieces right now
