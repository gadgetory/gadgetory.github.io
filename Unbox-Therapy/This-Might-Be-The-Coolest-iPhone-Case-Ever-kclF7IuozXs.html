cool it's called the ink case and it's
for the iPhone 7 they also make it for
the 7 plus this is a second screen that
goes on the back of your phone in the
form of a case it's an e-ink screen I
don't even know did we test the previous
vert no I've always wanted to so today's
the day what's inside the box is it any
good is a useful at all or is it just a
gimmick better yet
does it suck that's what it's gonna be
like the second screen for your phone
Inc case well you can see the way
they're using it in this image over here
as a reader for a book an e-reader when
it comes to fatigue with the eyes and
whatnot with an e-ink screen you kind of
avoid that a little bit because it's not
emitting light instead it's reflecting
light kind of like a Kindle on the back
of your phone syncs wirelessly via
bluetooth
read it later function for news articles
that sounds cool photo wallpaper you can
see you could have your significant
other there if you like shock protection
Bluetooth 4.0 so you know it's gonna be
low power consumption and the screen
itself is 4.3 inches on the 7 version
and on the 7 plus 5.2 inch e-ink screen
ok ooh it's almost in the realm of like
a battery case but not as heavy you see
it has buttons on it that almost remind
you of Android there
I suppose that's gonna be how we
navigate this screen here you solve all
your cutouts no twisting or bending that
makes a lot of sense a cable kind of an
interesting cable look at that
attachment there I'm assuming magnetic
look at that that's a kind of nice way
to charge it up you guys know I'm a huge
fan of magnets here right
picking tool well I mean that's that's a
guitar pick
oooh so fresh it's booted up now and
you're seeing this nice high contrast
eating display which I have to admit is
kind of new for me so these buttons down
here are the touch buttons the screen
itself is not a touchscreen eBook
there it is that's what its gonna be
like oh here's some different
backgrounds I can choose and this was
like calendar maybe oh this is that
dashboard kind of look your activity how
many steps you've taken how many floors
you've climbed the distance you've
traveled it tells you the weather
upcoming events if you have them in your
calendar and then reminders so that's
that's kind nice now of course there's
an app for this oh cool so check this
out I can manage the reader the
different books Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland will do you ever seen Alice
in Wonderland yeah it's unbelievable
right yeah I got a check that out again
photos as well so I can allow my photos
to be displayed on there so I'll go
ahead and allow photos what were these
images from from the case that prints
out print PR ynt if you didn't see that
video go check that video out how about
this one crop it like this save so the
app lays things out from reader photos
read later widgets and then my ink case
which I'm gonna select right now I'm not
paired so I'm gonna pair it up I can
pair right from the app oh wow this is
cool alright so now it's gonna be able
to track my fitness stuff from the
health app adjust the font size and the
text alignment I'm gonna send this photo
to inked case whoa and just like that
not sure why I would want that photo
specifically on the back of my case
permanently so I've got popped it
installed now so I'm gonna try to send
some news over to the case here's a cool
one the life death and legacy of iPhone
jailbreaking so that's in my pocket now
do you think that shows up on in case
there it is now the article that I saved
to pocket is available inside the ink
case no Google's not a bird bringing the
Internet to rural India maybe I want to
read that later I'm gonna add it in
there look at that
you see in that check I can go ahead and
read this article with low power
consumption and with no I string right
where I have my phone already I just
flip it over now the photos thing is a
little bit less compelling for me if you
have kids or something sentimental that
you want to keep on the case all the
time even when the display is off or
maybe you just want to look at my face
right there you can have it I'm more
inclined to have this last option here
info display if I go to widgets here and
just like that this will now be updated
with whatever's on the phone oh we
should probably put the phone in okay oh
this is just for removal jack slide it
in there you can have just this analog
style digital clock but look at that you
know what I think this thing is kind of
cool to be honest
says here that standby time where is
that standby time is five days and has a
four hundred and sixty milliamp hour
battery I think once you get the hang of
this thing it can actually be quite
useful and you might end up saving a ton
of battery life on your phone a lot of
the reading you're doing there you can
offset to this e display and probably
your eyes will be a lot better off it's
kind of like strapping a tiny little
Kindle to the back of your phone and you
hardly even notice you're carrying
anything extra I think it's cool and no
I do not think it sucks</div></body></html>
