therapy and today I've got a speed test
for you this is the 13-inch MacBook Pro
with Retina Display that I recently
unboxed and featured on the channel if
you haven't seen that unboxing video I
definitely recommend you go and check it
out I'll link it down into the
description so you can go see it now the
purpose of this video is to find out
just how fast this system is and I'm
gonna be using a couple of different
tools to try and figure that out
the first one is called Geekbench and
this is probably the most popular
benchmarking tool in the Mac world and
rather than make you sit through the
entire process it does take a few
minutes to get a benchmark figure once
it's all done I'm gonna speed forward
and we're gonna jump to the eventual
Geekbench
score and you might be surprised at the
results I actually was myself but then
as I gave it a little bit more thinking
I realized why so here is the Geekbench
score it's 6 7 33 6733 and this is an
overall score representative of a number
of different characteristics that are
tested in Geekbench as I scroll down
here you can see it gets significantly
more complicated you've got
floating-point performance memory
performance stream performance etc
there's a number of different
characteristics and rather than get too
complicated with it let's concentrate on
the main figure 6733 which is
representative of how everything comes
together the whole system performance
and then when we compare that to some
other popular Mac's these are popular
Mac benchmark scores here Geekbench
scores I should say and you'll see as I
scroll down there's Mac Pro's there's an
IMAX there's MacBook Pros and there's
even Mac minis that we have to pass to
find where this new system is gonna fit
in in terms of an overall score now at
first its kind of surprising you think
wow this is a $1700 machine at base
specification which is the model that
I'm testing here and the reason it
scores lower than some less expensive
machines is because it's got to push an
incredible amount of pixels out to this
Retina display and it lacks the
dedicated graphics that the 15-inch
MacBook Pro with Retina display and
regular 15-inch MacBook Pro have on
board so the next benchmarking tool that
I'm going to run
this system through was called Cinebench
and if you're unfamiliar with this tool
it's gonna be really GPU intensive it's
gonna throw 3d imagery moving imagery
much like a video game at your system
and figure out just how fast your system
can render it back and the exact FPS
that it does it at and of course like I
said earlier the fact that this system
doesn't have its own dedicated graphics
card means you're gonna see a
performance hit in this particular test
there's a secondary part as well
Cinebench also tests your CPU by using
this two-dimensional image super high
resolution version and rendering it each
little box at a time so you're gonna get
a CPU figure a CPU score also out of
this particular benchmarking tool so
once it's all completed you get two
scores the OpenGL figure once again very
graphics intensive you can see here
you've got sixteen point nine two fps
that this system is capable of and the
CPU performance is two point eight two
points that doesn't mean much right now
tell you what the 15-inch MacBook Pro
with Retina is capable of in a quick
moment you can see this is the base spec
for the 13-inch at 2.5 gigahertz and two
cores I really wish there was a quad
core option for the 13-inch Pro because
then it could deliver scores much closer
to the 15-inch model with an OpenGL
score of 34 point eight FBS and a CPU
score of six point one two so as you can
see it's much faster for graphics
intensive tasks as you might expect
having that extra processing power and
of course the dedicated graphics if
you're into multimedia you're definitely
gonna want to look at the 15-inch over
the 13 but don't get me wrong this is
still a magnificent machine when you
consider the form factor the size and
weight and the beauty of the screen you
can kind of accept some of those
drawbacks comparative to the 15-inch
model actually this is a good time to
remind you guys I'm having a big
giveaway this Sunday I'll link the
giveaway video down in the description
you just saw it up there on my channel
page if you haven't seen that giveaway
video you should check it out and one
more thing actually that I want to talk
about you're looking at my Instagram
photos here some of you guys follow me
on Instagram and I had a cool idea I've
got a lot of stuff lying around here
small items that don't make sense for
big giveaways and I'm thinking I might
come up with a creative way of giving
them away on Instagram or Twitter
anyways if you don't follow
yet on instagram i'm unbox therapy as
you might imagine that's my name and on
twitter at unbox therapy follow me in
those two place i'm gonna come up with a
creative way to give a giveaway a bunch
of smaller items phone cases and things
like that so stick around and find out
what those are on those two social
networks anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
this speed test of the 13-inch MacBook
Pro with Retina display these are the
figures these are the facts and I'm just
making them clear for you guys if you
enjoyed this content make sure to leave
a like and favorite down below as it
does help out a bunch and as I said
before big giveaway is happening
tomorrow or actually today now because
I'm up late so Sunday 5 p.m. Eastern
check out the giveaway video in the
description so you don't miss out see
you guys soon alright later</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
