Friday up here in Canada that's not such
a big deal believe it or not the big
stores have tried to get on board jump
on the US bandwagon but it ain't working
out too well they got no lineups
nobody's trampling each other nobody's
getting pepper sprayed and nobody's gets
shot
that's for sure in fact people aren't
even lining up they didn't even really
line up at all last night as far as I
know and I'm gonna go check out the Best
Buy see if there's anything worthwhile I
mean as far as I understand there are
some good deals the EB Games is just
over there and they've got some some
newer titles for some great prices you
know Batman I think is 29 bucks
I think battlefield might be as well so
there are good deals but people aren't
going crazy for them and the reason I'm
out here is because I'm looking for that
new Zelda 3ds you know the limited
edition Nintendo 3ds with the Zelda
paintjob one unboxed app for you guys so
I'm gonna check out the best buy first
and I'll give you an update once I get
over to the EEV games all right what's
up guys so I just got out of the local
eb games here after going to the Best
Buy they had some great deals actually
for Black Friday but not many people
seem to care anyways I picked up some
cool stuff you're definitely gonna want
to check out on a channel first and
foremost I was able to find the 3ds The
Legend of Zelda version with the special
paint job the game included I'll give
you guys a closer look at that I also
picked up halo combat Evolved
Anniversary
I hadn't picked that up yet a little bit
late to the party but I'll show you guys
all about that and then I also got this
heavy duty high-end headset it is the
ear force Delta a special modern warfare
3 Edition it's wireless 7.1 surround
anyway stay tuned I'll show you
everything that there is to know about
that headset any other stuff sell the
3ds you know how it goes take me a
little while to produce the videos well
