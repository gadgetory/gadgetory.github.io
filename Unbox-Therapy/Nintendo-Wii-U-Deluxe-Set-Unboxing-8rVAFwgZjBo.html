see I've got a Nintendo Wii U in front
of me I know I'm late to the party on
this unboxing this has been sitting in
the office and I've been so busy with
the ultimate gaming PC project that I
haven't had a chance to take a closer
look at the Wii U but we're gonna jump
inside right now better late than never
and you guys are going to get to see my
initial impressions and then hopefully
in the coming few days here I get it
hooked up to a TV in the new office
space and maybe even give you guys a
review if that's something you want to
see if you want to see more coverage on
this after the unboxing make sure to
leave a thumbs up down below but let's
go ahead and move forward with this
video and take a closer look at what's
included the first thing you'll notice
on the side of the box is you'll see
some specs and what's included inside
there's a 32 gigabyte console this is
the deluxe set you're also going to get
Nintendo's new controller with the
screen on it a bunch of cables they've
included an HDMI cable which is cool so
let's go ahead and stop talking about
the box and start talking about what's
inside so I'm going to just flip this
down in order to be safe oh boy
alright so the first area here you're
going to notice Nintendo land the game
you can see what's included on the back
of the game case you've got a much
larger power adapter than I had
originally imagined would be in here so
you've got a fairly large power brick
kind of reminiscent of the power brick
you get with the Xbox 360 actually I
guess that's to make the console smaller
you've got a smaller power brick here I
believe one of these two is used to
charge the actual game controller you
will be able to charge the controller on
a wall outlet but it won't charge from
the console that's my understanding
you've got some paperwork here from
Nintendo basic stuff some rewards
information a bunch of different
languages and your operations manual
Nintendo always includes very
substantial manuals underneath there
you're going to see a number of other
accessories here's a little stand
followed by what looks like another
stand yes I believe this is what is your
censor bar and then we've got what I
mentioned earlier which is an HDMI cable
which is an awesome addition and
inclusion because so many manufacturers
are not including an HDMI cable with
next-generation consoles they're only
including analog cables for example the
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 which I've
unboxed a number of different models and
none have included the HDMI cable so
lastly we've got the important
components and this is what really
matters in this unboxing here we've got
what I think is probably the coolest
component I had a chance to play this
console at e3 when I was there but
nothing since and so here is the actual
gamepad the actual controller as you can
see fairly large you've got this big
touchscreen in the center your home
button is here the Wii U logo is a
battery indicator TV control button is a
power button what looks like a
microphone start select Y B X a there's
one thumb stick on this side followed by
another thumb stick over on the other
side a traditional d-pad forward facing
camera actually let me go ahead and hold
it you know what it actually feels
reasonably comfortable for such a large
device and very unique this is really
what makes this console unique is this
particular game controller so next we
have the actual console this is a little
bit heavier a little bit more
substantial hopefully we've got enough
room over here this is a live style
unboxing I know you guys have been
asking for more of this style of
unboxing so I hope hope you appreciate
the added pressure involved in doing
this live but it is fun to get the
actual initial impressions as they
happen
wow they really got this thing packed up
in here
sealed in nicely so here's the console
and it's actually pretty small so they
didn't build the power adapter into it
but it is tiny and it's protected here
by a bunch of protective covering so it
doesn't get scratched when you're
shipping it and it looks already like
it's a bit of a fingerprint magnet
in a black color go ahead and get most
of that pulled off get everything I
believe so
so we'll start by looking at the front
of the device your disc tray you have a
disc eject button your power button is
down here there's a sync button assume
for the controller and this little area
here folds down and to reveal two USBs
and one SD card slot and the Wii U logo
on the other side as we move around it
looks like there's a couple of ports for
fans to expel heat from the device and
then on the back we've got our usual
ports here you can see two USBs on the
far side over here an HDMI out here's
another little fan there's an AV
multi-out presumably for analog output a
sensor bar output and of course the
output for your AC adapter so anyway
guys that's been a very quick live
unboxing of the Nintendo Wii U as you
can see I've made a big mess on the
table here I'm going to be bringing down
my flat pad on my 55 inch flat panel
that you guys may have seen in my
previous room tour video that's going to
live in the office down here now so I'll
be hooking this console up to that
particular TV and getting a better idea
of what it's capable of and having some
fun with a couple of different games so
definitely stick around for that and as
I said before make sure to leave a
thumbs up down below if you want to know
more about this system subscribe if you
haven't yet and thanks as always for
watching and one more thing if you guys
haven't checked out my new project yet
i've got a new website it's called
trigger pulled calm and it's a place
where i'm listing a lot of different
products that interest me it's a good
place to check out prior to Christmas
actually you can see some of my
favorites in a number of different
categories if you're looking for a link
it's going to be down in the description
but once again it's trigger pulled calm
all right guys that's everything for
right now and I'll catch you on the next
video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
