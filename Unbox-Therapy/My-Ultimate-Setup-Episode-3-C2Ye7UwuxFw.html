fresh video and this would this is
actually a long time coming some of you
have seen this before
it's a lot of stuff space and stars this
video is not about space and stars it's
about my setup I did two videos a little
while ago I covered these monitors from
LG ultra wide monitors the TV the audio
but I didn't really tell you about all
the knickknacks all the little things
that make up this setup audio interface
keyboard mouse my chair back here I've
got some headphones some hard drives a
computer everything else that you might
want to know about so this is episode 3
we're gonna conclude everything there is
to know about this setup before we get
into a big shout out to LG without them
this setup would not be possible and in
fact this setup was the inspiration for
a giant giveaway that recently happened
was called ultra wide festival somebody
won their dream $10,000 set up if you
want to check out more about that a link
will be in the description but let's
finish
let's culminate my ultimate setup tour
episode 3 starts now so as I said the
core of this set up is the displays but
I've already talked about them go back
and watch episode 1 and episode 2 if you
want to know more about them this video
is about all the other things all the
knickknacks let's let's talk about my
chair a little bit this is a Herman
Miller embody chair I've had this for a
while I'm gonna put a link to this and
everything else down in the description
they're super comfy they move around a
lot like they're kind of they're kind of
flexible and stuff like that so a pretty
decent range of motion tons of
adjustability and and overall just a
comfy spot to sit in keyboard let's talk
about keyboard I've been backing forward
on so many keyboards you guys have no
idea I keep coming back to this one it's
by a company called Phoenix and I don't
know man he's just got a smooth vibe to
it
yes wired I was hoping to find something
Wireless but what's the difference
you don't need to charge it you have one
tiny wire the mouse this is the MX
master I switched from the performance
MX to this I love the texture of it the
ergonomics if you will the way it fits
into a hand into my hand specifically
you could have it connect it to a laptop
as well as a desktop just by flipping a
switch on the bottom audio interface I'm
a really big fan of Apogee stuff I've
been using this stuff for a long time of
course you can do audio recording on
here as well if you want to send an
instrument or microphone into it you
have a quarter-inch headphone jack here
makes me sound beautiful which is a hard
thing to do don't nod your head Jack a
couple of remotes over here there's
actually an Apple TV hooked up to that
TV up top Apple TV to the TV and then
the remote for the 50 inch 4k spin
around to the corner these are some new
headphones that I've been experimenting
with Wireless from Sennheiser made a
video about these hgr 185 an open back
style controls right on there with this
little dot you can be sure that they're
always going to be charged also a little
card reader which is velcroed to this
lysse external I think this is like 6
terabytes we have other storage standard
Thunderbolt little mini raid situation
these things are kind of cool this dock
is for our SSDs that come out of our
show guns this is strictly used for
editing purposes the Mac Pro 12 for Mac
Pro you know I've been through a couple
now this is actually the second first
one got fried maybe has something to do
with what I asked of it spitting pixels
out like I Spit rhymes right jack
now this little cabinet over here this
is really important because it keeps
everything tidy we got a bunch of
different cables and stuff in there
that's my favorite power strip in a
world that little Belkin I will link it
down in the description and it's my
favorite cuz each outlet swivels this
battery backup unit here with a couple
of USB chargers on the front everything
that super important goes into the back
it is so if you do have a power failure
you're okay these are like look you can
see the names on front week everything
is labeled after Ninja Turtles because
they're Turtles in a half shell turtle
power
so these guys are super fast right super
fast SSD
and it's one of the few places in
history where shredder and splinter
actually worked together now this table
a lot of people ask me about this table
it's actually a dining room table for
eight theoretically you're supposed to
be able to get eight people around this
table from a dimensional standpoint just
know that this is about nine feet long I
believe I almost missed the webcam you
can see this is much wider than your
average webcam see I'm not that far away
from it and you can see the whole the
whole space here Logitech for business
the C 930 eat look at watch bye bye NSA
there it is episode three my ultimate
setup who knows for how long this is
going to stay this way but I'm super
happy with it right now
quick preview gonna be doing something
insane on the other side of the room
super insane you're not gonna want to
miss it subscribe if you want to check
