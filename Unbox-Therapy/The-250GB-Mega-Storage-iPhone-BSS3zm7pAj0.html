another video and today I've got
something new it just came out I saw
this floating around the web and I was
like man I can see the utility in that I
can see a lot of people being interested
in this thing right here it's called I
expand and it is a memory case for your
iPhone this is about expanding the
storage of your iPhone without needing
any kind of external device the storage
is built into the case comes in a couple
of different sizes this is the biggest
one 128 gigabytes so I'm thinking you
get the highest capacity iPhone stick
this baby on there and then I mean I
don't know I don't know what you're
storing but I think it's a pretty cool
concept let's check out the back of the
box what do we got play videos from the
case it supports all the file formats
and it provides durable drop protection
now there's an app that goes with it as
well but what does it look like it also
comes in a few different colors this one
as you can see is red and like this kind
of grey crosshatch color thing going on
you charge up the case by connecting it
to the wall via USB there's also an
adapter here this is going to plug into
the bottom so that you can then use
whichever 3.5 millimeter headphone
so you slide this guy in then this guy
goes back on let's see here there you go
so it's kind of an interesting look
there ports here for your speakers this
kind of maneuvers the sound which
normally fires out the bottom of the
iPhone towards you when you're holding
it buttons and this port here that's the
the magical port simple stuff booyah
I was wondering what this is for you see
this here so that's for an add-on
battery pack there's like a tea this
little clip here and those contacts you
can get a battery pack that clips in
here you've now added extra storage but
then on top of that you can add extra
battery to okay so I've got the app
installed now it's called I expand case
so you can set up camera backup and this
will allow you to back up your entire
photo library off of your device's
internal storage to the actual store
case it separates your data into
documents music video and pictures very
cool the dashboard here shows the
battery life of the phone 39 percent
battery pack not connected available
storage on the phone
72 percent versus the case 99 percent
and what percentage is taken up by
certain style or certain type of file
but what if I click let's say on the
images I can swipe through this is
natively on the case these files are on
the case and from there I can save it so
I can save it directly to the phone
storage if I want to or I can send it
out to social media message it printed
on the video side it's got a native
video player right in it for popular
file formats now this is actually really
interesting because if you've got a
bunch of file formats that aren't native
to the iPhone since this is coming off
the case and it's in its own app now
just a basic mp4 and a number of other
popular formats will play right here
look I'm just I'm playing natively and
music same deal it's got a player
built-in what happens if I connect the
case to like a laptop says it is
charging but does it boot up do I get
does it mount it's right here music
photos video it's way better than those
like little dedicated devices because
then you've got something else to
remember in your pocket in this case
it's just it becomes more native Apple's
charging you a lot of money to go with
the bigger capacity phones then you've
got the formatting then you've got the
pre-installed stuff you really end up
with not that much storage left over now
you can use the same phone but
essentially end up with way more storage
let's say you were using iCloud or drive
or whatever to offload some of the stuff
that wouldn't fit on the phone well what
about when you're in the airplane
without Wi-Fi</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
