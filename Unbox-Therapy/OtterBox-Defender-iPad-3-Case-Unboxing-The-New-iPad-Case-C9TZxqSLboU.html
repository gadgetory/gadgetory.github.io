therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Defender Series case from OtterBox
this is for both the new latest
generation iPad and the iPad 2 so it'll
work with either somehow they managed to
manufacture a design that will work for
both if you don't know who OtterBox is
they make super robust cases for all
kinds of devices and just like with
their other products the instructions
for installation are printed on the
inside of the box now I'm not gonna lie
to you guys these are not the easiest
things in the world to install I'll show
you guys how to do it in this video here
but the idea is that you're going to
leave it installed you're not gonna want
to be taking it in and out too often and
you're gonna get a ton of protection
from this Defender Series maybe the most
protection available on the market or
close to it so let's get a closer look
at how it all works and fits together so
there's four major components the first
being the backing with a little bit of
padding on the inside to protect your
iPad and it also has a round area to
show off your Apple logo the front of
that portion also has a screen protector
built in so even your screen is going to
be protected and then this silicon or
rubberized portion is it fits around the
outside of the interior portion to
complete the case and then there's even
one more element on the far right here
which is sort of a hard clip on back
which also works as a stand with two
different operating positions I'll show
you that in a quick second so here's the
latest iPad the iPad 3 as I've been
calling it so the first thing you're
gonna want to do is drop it into the
internal backing with that little bit of
padding on it then next you take the
front portion here with the built-in
screen protector as I said earlier and
you clip that down you'll hear a couple
of snaps around the outside of the
enclosure and here's a closer look at
how to identify those snapping regions
they've got little arrows here so these
are around the outside of the backing
make sure they're all clipped together
and then you'll know that you're good to
go so next you're going to take this
soft portion of the case and you're
going to want to fit that around
the exterior of the backing now this is
gonna take you a little while you sort
of got to finesse it massage it around
the outside but once you get that all
completed you get a nice package here
that protects really everything
everything's still accessible I mean the
touchscreen still works etc even with
that cover over top and it does add a
little bit of weight as you might
imagine it's a fairly robust case but
it's got a really nice grip on it so
you're definitely not gonna drop this or
I hope you're not gonna drop it although
if you were gonna drop it you got the
right case on to do so you've got your
Apple logo still exposed on the back and
you've still got a cutout for your
camera but that is covered there's a
little piece of plastic over top now on
the side you've got a little flap before
covering your headphone jack or at the
top sorry I should have sat the top your
microphone has a small cutout and then
of course your power switch is protected
the speaker is exposed it's one of the
few things on the case that's exposed
kind of has to be so you can hear what
the hell's going on and then you've got
another flap on the bottom for your
30-pin dock connector along the side
here you can get a better idea of how
the silicone portion stays on there it
Clips around some hard plastic portions
and then you've got a nice textured grip
area as I mentioned before here you can
get an idea for the volume rocker and
then the hold switch or orientation lock
or however you use this switch here this
is a little bit buried a little bit hard
to get a hold of but I think the idea
here is you're not gonna be using this
all that often and if you want to get
inside there you got to use your right
hand to log it in your left hand to
unlock it can you kind of gotta use both
hands so here's a better look at the
backside of the case and that cutout for
the Apple logo there is a piece of clear
plastic over top of the Apple logo so it
is not completely exposed and of course
you've got the OtterBox logo along
bottom on the front side you have your
home button which is protected some of
the soft silicone is sitting over top of
that portion and as I slide the iPad up
here you'll see there's also a cutout
for the forward facing camera and of
course ambient light sensor so the last
thing to talk about is this hardshell
backing and as I'm
before it also functions as a two-stage
stand which is obviously convenient for
various functionality so once it's on
this thing becomes a tank it becomes
fairly heavy but solid at the same time
ton of a ton of protection and if you
pull it off it flips into a stand fairly
easily and it's it's very sturdy as well
so you go ahead and put it in this first
position here this is sort of the
multimedia position for viewing movies
Netflix YouTube this will give you a
better idea here from this angle so you
can understand which two positions are
available and how each one might be used
so first and foremost you've got this
sort of production sort of orientation
where you can type get a nice typing
angle on there and then the next one is
more of the consumption orientation
where you're gonna have video playing
back or your notification scrolling
through but I'm really impressed with
how sturdy this stand is how robust it
is this thing ain't gonna fall off so
anyway guys if you enjoyed this unboxing
quick look overview etc then please do
like and favorite this video as it does
help me out a bunch
I want to thank OtterBox for sending
this out to me for review I'm really
impressed with this case right now and I
can't wait to put it through her asset a
little put it through some hell and see
how it holds up anyway guys onto thank

video alright later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
