three so it's more than a pairing that's
three devices on the table you might be
wondering what's the connection other
than the fact that they all have kind of
a similar color hue to them these are
three phones that I've used recently or
am currently using so in the middle of
course my SIM card is in that device as
of right now that is the p30 Pro it's
flashy it's fancy it's got the crazy
periscope lens setup for that wild zoom
that you've seen demonstrated plus it's
a quad camera array on the back that's a
similar situation over here on the
galaxy s 10 that's the device I was
using before this one the camera unit is
flipped horizontal it's similar in the
sense that you've got a bunch of cameras
so triple camera setup on the back of
here that leaves this device on the
right this one in front of me is
actually Kirk's unit it's got a single
lens setup that's the pixel 3 obviously
one camera in 2019 what's happening how
is that a thing and why is this device
placed up against these other two well
I'll tell you one because even though
I've used these two devices most
recently I still at moment's miss having
this one in my pocket that's right the
pixel 3 a device released now a while
ago in a smartphone universe
there are moments in which I rip out
peel out one of these guys that go snap
a quick photo and I still wish it was a
pixel in my hand now that's not to say
that these devices over here don't
create incredible images because they do
but typically mostly in any given
scenario where it's just let's take out
a phone and let's snap a photo this guy
right here the pixel 3 still in this day
and age gives me the most confidence to
just pop it out snap a photo worry about
it later if you have limited time if you
don't want to think about it if you
don't want to engage any of the settings
if you don't want to tap your screen at
all other than the shutter button this
guy right here is going to more often
than not give you a workable image
something that you're happy with and the
funny thing here is it has less to do
with this camera
than it does to do with the software
that Google's working with on their most
recent release of the camera software
for the pixel unit in fact so much so
the oneplus 60 I actually was able to
install Google's camera software the
pixel camera software onto the oneplus
60 and get results that were way better
than the built-in camera software on
that device Google is doing magical
things in the camera software with the
computational photography and in my
opinion as of right now that software
can't be touched from a performance
perspective it creates very pleasing
images why are we talking about this
right now well I'll tell you why because
I came upon a listing on Amazon for this
exact pixel the one that's in front of
me in this pink color now granted it's
not super pink it's mostly white and the
reason about this particular model right
now is because there is this Amazon
listing with an incredibly discounted
refurbished version of this device
although they're calling it renewed it's
a it's a new thing on Amazon or at least
something I haven't seen before in which
Amazon is certifying renewed devices
with their own warranty and their own
refund policy but I found a listing for
this exact device for $449 now granted I
just said that on this video so who
knows if there's any left in stock at
the point at which you're watching this
it might be the best deal in smartphones
right now as far as I can tell now
granted this is not the perfect phone
you got the big antiquated looking
bezels on the top and the bottom you've
got the fingerprint scanner in a more
traditional location at this point
you're lacking a headphone jack
but at 449 just keep in mind it's not a
brand brand new device factory fresh but
stale now if you're against this not
pink color the black version also
renewed Amazon renewed is for 69 I
believe is that correct well for 67 so
two black one for 67 you can pay a
little bit more for that but at the
point of filming this video this one
right here is the best deal in
smartphones probably right now for 49
for a Google pixel 3 at the time for
filming this video and the other benefit
of going in the pixel direction is
something I've talked about in the past
which is the stock Android experience so
using these other two devices most
recently I go on their net and I and I
load up a launcher right you know in
order in order to override the skin
that's pre-installed on each of those
devices I don't do that on pixel devices
because I'm happy
with the skin the way it is out of the
box the stock Android experience also on
the Google side you're going to get
updates to the operating system the
fastest over the air so many benefits to
being in the pixel universe and today's
the day if you're moving for a lower
price point and you're cool with the
recertification you can read the terms
for Amazon's
renewed program and see if you're
comfortable with it but nonetheless I
thought it was noteworthy a good
opportunity to kind of reflect back on
my experience with the pixel phone in
relationship to these other flagships
that given this comparison are like
almost twice the price now so there it
is it's not pinks don't call it pink
it's just a great teal right now if
you're cool with the Amazon renewed
program 449 bucks you are going to snap
some photos you're happy with I
guarantee it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
