therapy and today I've got a really
exciting video for you what you're
looking at is a 4k television from Sony
if you're unfamiliar with this business
that means you're looking at 3840 by
2160 pixels way beyond the resolution of
1080p this is the future you're looking
at folks the exact model is the XP are 6
5 X 900 a of course the 6 v stands for
65 inches this is a 65 inch display so a
fairly nice size to go with that awesome
resolution but this is a little bit
wider the box is huge and the reason for
that is because there are also speakers
on each side of the display and these
speakers are actually pretty good you're
looking at 65 watts each and there's
even a little subwoofer building to give
you a little bit more low-end then you'd
expect to get out of a flat panels
built-in audio so you can have that
minimal look get this thing mounted up
on your wall and not have such a need to
go out and get an aftermarket audio
solution because this one has some
decent speakers built into it so as you
guys can tell this is a huge box and
that means I've got to do a slightly
different style of unboxing video this
is not going to fit on your usual table
so instead here I'm going to go ahead
and remove the loose components first
including some 3d glasses yes this
display supports 3d passive 3d and the
glasses are really light and really
comfortable to wear of course you can
have I glasses underneath them if you
need to wear eyeglasses there's a couple
of remotes included I think the reason
for that is one is just a little bit
more minimal a little bit more
simplistic and smaller whereas the other
one is more full-featured and something
I like on this remote is the dedicated
Netflix button I think that's a cool
addition both remotes look really nice
and I can't really complain having an
extra one because you know these things
get misplaced from time to time and
nobody likes that getting back to the
display as I try to get it out of the
box here I do want to say a little bit
about it it is an LED display in terms
of technology and it does have local
dimming so you are getting you know
high-end specs everywhere else besides
the fact that it happens to be a 4k
display getting it set up is actually
pretty easy to do just like any other
flat
even if this one happens to be a little
bit bigger a little bit wider you just
have to line it up on the base and then
go ahead and screw the base in and then
you're ready to install it wherever it
is that you want to put it you will need
a fairly large space for a 65 inch this
thing is fairly imposing so you can
watch me here struggle with some of the
packaging these these are never really
that elegant to unbox but I think it's
interesting nonetheless to take a look
at what you do when you get something
like this at your house this is a little
cover piece for the back after you get
the base installed you can use that
piece to cover up some of the hardware
here's a closer look at the base and it
is circular and it has like a
chrome-plated finish so it should fit
into any high-end environment if you
choose not to mount the thing on the
wall you're going to need to install
these four screws into the back of the
television that's what secures it to the
base you're going to want to make sure
it's secure this is not a cheap
television this is actually a good time
to mention if you guys are interested in
checking out this TV for yourself if you
want to see more specs if you want to
see pricing and availability I will have
links down in the description including
a link to future shop I want to give
them a big shout out especially the
young and Dundas location for allowing
me to play around with this thing even
though it is such an expensive and new
technology the back of the display
features all of the ports and inputs
that you would expect to have on a
high-end television including a bunch of
HDMI s a cable / antenna input
you've got component input composite so
all your analog stuff that you may or
may not want to use you have an internet
port even though you don't need to use
that land you can use Wi-Fi since the TV
does have it if you prefer to go that
route you've got optical in you have a
special HDMI that supports the MHL
protocol what that means you can connect
mobile devices like your phone or tablet
or anything that supports that and then
you can put your display from that
mobile device up onto the larger screen
so anyways here you can see a
nerve-racking experience of us lining it
up onto this little stand I want to give
big props to Kirk for helping me out on
doing that give him a thumbs up down
below for jumping into the video but as
you can see this is a beautiful looking
display you know there's going to be
sort of mixed feelings on the speakers
on the side for people whether or not
that
something they want to add on their own
or if they like the integrated look I'm
personally a fan of it I think having
them there is a positive thing it means
you can mount this up on the wall in a
minimal fashion and not really feel the
need to have some third party solution
to go with it it can just look really
elegant and really simple and a lot of
people end up with these flat panels in
their houses and they don't put external
audio on there anyways so this is
definitely a step in the right direction
in terms of improving the vast majority
of people's audio anyways let's talk
about the image that's the main thing
here I had a limited amount of 4k
content that I could actually look at
there's really only the in TV demo which
was some still images and it's very hard
to portray to you in this video exactly
what 4k looks like if you haven't seen
it in person and of course you're not
watching this video in 4k but this was
making us just giddy as hell we were
laughing our heads off we were just so
happy seeing it's in person because the
detail is un-freakin'-believable I was
trying to get my lens to pick it up as
you can see in that shot of the
strawberries there but a lot of what
people are going to be doing with these
TVs at least in the short term is using
them for 1080p content you know for
blu-rays and whatnot because there's
just not a lot of 4k content available
including the fact that game consoles
don't output 4k so here you can see the
1080p trailer for spider-man the latest
spider-man and the absque ailing is
actually pretty impressive
Sony's using something called the
x-reality pro picture engine and that's
what's going to upscale your 1080p
coverage footage whatever you wanna call
it up into 4k now we had different
results depending on what we were doing
the the spider-man trailer for example
looked really good games not so much I
had a limited selection of games to try
out but they didn't look that great in
fact they kind of looked maybe even a
little bit worse than just on a 1080p
display probably because of all that
conversion that's happening granted we
are sitting only a couple of feet from
it so maybe I was being you know a
little bit more critical than I would
normally be but the whole intent here is
to get stuff that's going to eventually
support 4k resolution and then you can
really start to take advantage of these
4k TV
anyways very impressive nonetheless I
can't wait until these things become the
standard and I get one in my own house
very very cool to get a chance to look
at if you guys are interested in pricing
and availability once again the links
are down below if you enjoyed this video
make sure to leave a thumbs up it does
help out a bunch and other than that I
will catch guys on the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
