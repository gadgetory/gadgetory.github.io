going to take a closer look at the shirt
SRH for 40 professional studio
headphones you probably recognize them
from the back-to-school guide for 2013
I'm a huge fan of these so let's go
ahead and do the unboxing so why am i
such a big fan of the SRH 440 there's
actually a couple of different reasons
first and foremost they are a
professional style headphone and that's
what I'm interested in I consider myself
a bit of a professional you know
considering the fact that I'm recording
audio and wearing headphones for a
significant portion of the day I've
tried all kinds of different consumer
stuff as well as professional stuff and
usually that designation means that
you're getting a more durable product
that can stand up to the rigors of a
professional environment that being said
I know a lot of end-users regular
consumers that should really be looking
at professional equipment cuz they don't
realize hey I've got these headphones on
my head for you know 10 hours a day and
most consumer products simply aren't
engineered for that use case scenario
inside the box you've got a little bit
of paperwork from sure followed by the
main attraction of course the headphones
I'll give you guys a quick glance at
these as you can tell understated design
nothing too flashy nothing too fancy
this is pro gear so it has to look the
part and it definitely does in this
particular case you've also got a coiled
audio cable and on one end it'll lock
into place so it's removable but it'll
lock in there so it doesn't come out
accidentally and then on this end you
have a screw on type quarter inch
adapter so if you want to take audio
from a more professional audio interface
a mixer or even an amplifier you're good
to go so it really won't matter which
kind of device you want to use from an
iPhone all the way up to completely
professional gear they've also included
a little drawstring carry bag this will
help keep your headphones dust free when
you happen to travel with them they
actually do fold up into a pretty small
package so surprisingly portable for a
professional set of headphones the SRH
440 feature 40 millimeter drivers in
each of the two ear cups they should
have no problem representing any kind of
music or audio that you want to listen
to the ear cups are also well identified
my big fan of that at a quick glance you
can tell which is the left channel and
which is the right channel it might seem
like a minor thing to some of you but if
you're constantly putting headphones on
and off all day long
anything to make your life a little bit
easier is a positive addition there you
can get a better look at where your
audio cable connects and where it locks
into place and hopefully these shots
here give you a better idea of the
materials in use they are all top
quality these things feel very durable
they also sport user replaceable ear
pads so if you wear them down you don't
need a whole new set of headphones you
just replace them and you're back to new
so before we close out today's video I
want to give another big shout out to
Squarespace for helping make this
content possible what you're looking at
right now is the official unbox therapy
dot-com website which is built using
Squarespace that's right I'm not talking
about a service that I don't personally
use I put together a website I'm really
happy with using the tools over on
squarespace.com and you can do it too
it's probably the easiest way online to
get a website up and running incredibly
fast you can do all kinds of stuff like
put a photo gallery you can put a store
in there if you want to sell merchandise
like we do we have a couple of t-shirts
up on there and there are plenty of
different templates to choose from so no
matter what look you're going for in one
night you can pretty much set something
up maybe even faster than a night I mean
it took me a night or two but if you're
really quick with this kind of stuff you
could probably do it even faster and
I've got even better news for you if you
want to try out the service it's
completely free no obligation head over
to squarespace.com slash unbox and if
you like the service and you want to
catch a better deal just use offer code
unbox eight these details are down in
the description of the video as well as
I said before guys this is a service
that I use this is what my website is
built on so I'm obviously a big huge fan
and you probably will be too so that
wraps up this unboxing and overview of
the SRH 440 from sure if you're
interested in pricing and availability I
will put the relevant links down in the
description at first I thought these
were just gonna be our podcast
headphones but now there's some of my
favorites in the whole office I'm using
them on my laptop listening the music
they're sort of my daily drivers right
now so as you can tell I'm a big fan if
you need to set up over the ear
headphones I'm pretty sure you will not
be disappointed with these Studio cans
from sure if you guys enjoyed this video
please remember to leave a thumbs up
down below thank you as always for
watching and I'll catch you on the next
episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
