to you by carbonite what's up guys it's
Lou from unbox therapy and today we're
taking a look at the latest generation
full-size iPad you guys know I recently
unboxed the iPad Mini this is the
full-size model packing the Retina
display some are calling it the iPad 4
others are calling it the iPad 4th
generation you can call it whatever you
like basically it's the latest gen
full-size iPad with the nine point seven
inch display rather than the seven point
nine inch display if you guys want me to
compare this to the iPad Mini in a
future video to a full-on comparison
then make sure to hit the thumbs up down
below if that's something you want to
see maybe I can help you figure out
which one is the right eye pad for you
whether it's the full size or the iPad
Mini or maybe something else maybe a
different tablet in general anyways if
you haven't subscribed yet do that now
because there probably will be a
comparison video coming up shortly so
here is the latest fourth-generation
iPad and as you can tell it looks
exactly the same as the last generation
there are some minor modifications I'll
get to in a moment here's the power
brick which is slightly larger than the
power brick that ships with the iPad
Mini of course bigger I've had bigger
power brick that's to be expected you've
got a little bit of paperwork from Apple
once again incredibly similar to every
other Apple product and you've also got
the Apple stickers which I think you get
with every Apple product if you've ever
purchased an Apple product without the
Apple stickers let me know down in the
comments because it's never happened to
me and I can't remember any at the
moment you've also got the lightning
cable which has replaced the older
generation 30 pin connector so that's a
little bit more convenient and it is the
first physical change of this fourth
generation iPad or the iPad 4 whichever
you prefer to call it so as you can tell
it's just as sleek as the last
generation you have the aluminum finish
on the back unlike on the many where
you've got you know the new sort of
anodized look the black look on the
darker model or they're calling it slate
I should be proper here anyways I'll go
ahead and set it up off camera you of
course got your forward facing camera
for 720p video conferencing you also
have your home button which is on every
single iPad regardless of model here you
can see I finally gone ahead and got it
set up you can take a little look at
that Retina display and of course the
performance is now
improve this new iPad is packing an a6 X
processor which is supposed to be twice
as fast as on the previous generation
which seems to be a major improvement
when you consider the fact that this
just came out you know shortly after the
release of the last generation on top
you have your headphone jack a
microphone and lastly you have your
power switch of course that's also going
to be used to turn your screen on and
off unless you're using a smart cover of
course I've got one of those too for the
mini that I'll be reviewing or at least
unboxing and showing you giving you a
demonstration of soon you have the
single speaker on the bottom of the unit
and as well that's also where your
lightning port is going to live once
again that's the new connector that
Apple's using on all of their devices
you have your hold lock switch or mute
switch as well as your volume up and
down rocker on the right hand side on
the back of the unit is where you'll
find your rear facing camera which is
going to shoot five megapixels the same
camera I believe that the iPad Mini is
packin maybe I'll do a comparison in
that actual video you've also got the
Apple logo as well as the iPad logo on
the back once again the back is done in
a nice aluminum finish which seems to be
fairly durable at least it has been for
my past generation models really the big
story here is the screen though you've
still got the very beautiful Retina
display with tight pixel density and
that's the main thing people are
concerned with when comparing the mini
to the full-size a lot of people were
expecting or at least hoping to have
retina quality or retina pixel density
on the smaller iPad Mini but how does it
really pan out what does it really mean
for you if you're interested in either
product how bad does the mini look or
how good does the retina look I'll be
tackling all that stuff in the future
full comparison video so definitely
stick around for that
and as I said earlier hit the thumbs up
button if that's something you're
totally interested in seeing anyway guys
