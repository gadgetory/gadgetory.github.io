phone probably the most popular new
phone that's out there many people have
them one of the things that creeps up
with phones in general is running out of
storage running out of battery running
out of storage these are two things you
do not want to have happen to you now
when it comes to battery life you can
add an accessory you can charge more
often beyond that you're pretty much
stuck on the storage side yes
you've got cloud storage you can move
files around and so on some people don't
want to do that some people want to keep
stuff local today I've got a product
which is similar to a product I showed
you guys a while back at the time that
was just a Kickstarter or it wasn't a
complete product yet this is a case
which goes onto your iPhone 7 they make
it for the 7 plus as well it's about 50
bucks and what it's gonna do is give you
battery 2400 milliamp hours but then on
top of that it's got a micro SD card
slot in it which will allow you to
interface with extra storage as well
kind of covering the two problems that
many people have with their devices with
their iPhone specifically now Apple will
charge you a lot for extra storage and
you might not need it immediately when
you buy your new phone now these guys
right here this 200 gigabyte card is
around 70 bucks on Amazon I'll link it
down below now they also make a larger
one which is 256 gigabytes that one's
not quite as good of a value because
it's around 150 bucks for only another
56 gigs so I think this one is the sweet
spot but combined with the storage on
your iPhone the biggest iPhone 256 gigs
you combine it with a card like this and
you get a half terabyte of storage or
very close to it depending on whether or
not you go with this card or the 256
gigabyte card expandable storage gives
you those options it's like a soft touch
kind of plastic now I've tried many
battery cases and generally battery
cases on their own 50 60 70 all the way
up to a hundred bucks
so getting the battery case with the
expandable storage in one it's kind of a
nice little combo for 50 you can see the
top portion bends so you can slide it in
a lot of battery cases just have a micro
USB well you can kiss your wired
headphone connection goodbye on the
iPhone 7 if that's the case this will
give you pass-through so now the phone
itself is charging via the case but
you've still got access to audio with
your lightning headphones if you're just
using the stock headphone
it's also got a battery indicator I'm
not sure if jack can pick that up there
three bars of battery life for for a
fully charged case when it comes to the
expandable storage you're going to need
a way of accessing that actual SD card
now you can see the location of it here
just slides in right there you'll never
notice it it'll just be underneath your
phone and so there is an app that goes
with this case you can drag and drop
files onto that microSD and then access
them later you don't have to go through
iTunes or some other method they look at
that little guy right there and then it
locks into place put the phone on okay
sweet
you have the cutouts for your speakers
as well so hopefully it'll just redirect
that sound out from there the buttons
and whatnot I'll map accordingly so when
you turn on the case it immediately
begins charging up your phone it will
also prompt you to install an app which
is called smart case here it'll tell me
the capacity of the case itself as well
as the capacity of the phone and the
fact that it's charging
it'll also prompt you to format
whichever SD card it is that you have
installed now from within the smart case
you can actually launch a picture app
and send pictures right on to that SD
card or you can move them at a later
date same goes for music videos and so
on there's a dedicated video player here
where you can import and export video
clips directly to the card and that's
important because then you can get away
with playing different video formats you
can see you have some different folders
set up for photos videos music documents
and so on and you can also connect this
directly to a PC in order to transfer
files as if this was some sort of
external storage and this shows you the
case storage itself you can see 0
gigabytes being used right now and this
is cool they've built in a little
battery app as well which will tell you
the iPhones battery not just the case
and how you used your battery life if
that's interesting to you anyway that's
all built into the app but essentially
what you end up with here is expandable
storage and external battery for 50
bucks and a case as well which is going
to give you better grip I mean that's
what I have here this right here gives
you the potential to be carrying around
a half terabyte iPhone assuming you
purchased the big
to begin with but that's something
that's kind of unprecedented the fact
that you can add it for 50 bucks is
pretty sweet so I think the 200 gig card
the big iPhone get yourself a half
terabyte iPhone stop complaining about
photos where to put them
oh my goodness battery life too little
battery life bonus that's what I do here
solve problems like a dr. unbox therapy
get it session closed what is it goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
