quick update for you regarding this
device the Nexus 4 which I've been using
and loving recently now one of the major
criticisms of this particular device is
the fact that it doesn't feature LTE
wireless connectivity but certain
individuals have figured out that you
can actually enable LT very easily on
certain carriers if you happen to be in
Canada like I am and you're on either
Telus bell or Rogers you can actually
enable the hidden LTE radio that's
inside of this device and it's actually
surprisingly simple to do so we'll get
started with Telus tell us being the
easiest one to jump into all you need to
do is go into your dialer here and from
there you want to type in a star pound
let me just read a hit star pound four
six three six I hope you guys can see
that there I'll probably put an
annotation with the full code and let it
stick there one more pound another star
one last pound and another star and that
will kick you right into the testing
menu the developer menu whatever it is
that you want to call it now what you
need to do from here is tap on phone
information at the top like I've just
done you see a bunch of information
bunch of data that doesn't really matter
to you if you scroll down though you'll
see something here that says WCDMA
preferred this little area right here
you want to click there and another
drop-down menu will now become available
and this is where things get interesting
from an LTE perspective you want to
scroll down until you find LTE / GSM
Auto that's what it says right here and
then you want to select that now my
phone is not on one of those major
carriers that I mentioned earlier in
this video it's not on Telus it's not
unbell it's not on Rogers so in this
case LTE is not going to start working
but if you happen to be on one of those
three carriers LTE would start working
if you went through the same steps once
again this is assuming you've got an LTE
provisioned SIM card if you don't have
a phone that supports LTE currently then
your SIM card is likely not provisioned
for LTE meaning you won't have success
doing this but if you've got LTE on a
different device and the SIM card is LTE
capable and you stick it inside of the
nexus 4 and you're on Telus that's
literally all you need to do now if
you're on Rogers or Fido which uses the
Rogers Network or Bell I believe you can
overcome certain issues by adding a
specific APN and that's actually pretty
easy to do as well I'll show you real
quick how to do that you can go into
your settings let me just quickly go
into the settings here you can go into
your settings and then from there you
want to go to more where's more right
there of course guys I'm trying to look
at the computer as well as the monitor
on the camera then from there you want
to go into mobile mobile networks that
what they want mobile networks and then
lastly we want to go into access point
names for Rogers only you can add the
APN LTE Internet dot a PN so we can do
it down here we can add a new APN and
from here we can put in that criteria
LTE internet dot APN once again I'll put
an annotation so you guys can see that
clearly so if you're on Rogers that's
all you need to do the same should be
true for Fido of course running on the
same network as Rogers is so anyways a
very interesting piece of information
that really surprised me and I wanted to
share it with you guys so there is a
little bit of hidden LT functionality in
the Nexus 4 some people have mentioned
that since it's not an amplified signal
or something along those lines you're
not going to get full on LT performance
you're obviously going to see an
improvement though over the regular
performance and there are a couple of
drawbacks right now like the fact that
you've got to re-enable it every time
you boot up the system that's obviously
no fun to do I'm sure somebody in the
XDA forums is going to figure that out
how to you know boot up your system with
a custom ROM so it automatically enables
LTE the other thing to worth talking
about is getting a little bit
long-winded now is the fact that
t-mobile uses similar technology to the
Canadian carriers for their LTE coverage
so if you are if you're to use this
device on team
in the future once they've got full LTE
rollout then chances are you're also
going to get LTE LTE coverage as well on
t-mobile in the u.s. at least it's a
possibility at this point so anyway guys
that's been a quick little update video
about the Nexus 4 and the fact that
people are have been able to get LTE
running on the device on certain
Canadian carriers which is a good sign
for other people elsewhere in the world
Bell Telus and Rogers tell us being the
easiest one to set up hopefully this
video has been helpful if you guys
enjoyed my content please remember to
leave a like and favorite down below as
it does help out a bunch and I've got a
lot more planned just wanted to share
that quick little update with you guys
all right thanks as always for watching
I'll catch you on the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
