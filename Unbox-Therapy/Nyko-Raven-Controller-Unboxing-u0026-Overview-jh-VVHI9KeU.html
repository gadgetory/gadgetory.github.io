we got another product for you and
before you go all crazy and say holy
 your hands have completely morphed
this is not me these are the hands of a
guest dumb boxer a mystery man who's
gonna remain nameless for the time being
but that's not what you came here to
hear about no you came here to hear
about the Raven from Nyko which is a
third party controller for your
PlayStation 3 and at first glance it's
obvious that this controller has taken
some of its design cues from the Xbox
360 controller so I'd imagine it's going
to appeal to gamers who have migrated
from the Xbox 360 over to the
PlayStation 3 or on both consoles or
just prefer the profile of the Xbox 360
controller here's our gigantic user
manual slash single sheet folded a
million ways and it's going to tell you
how you can configure this controller
etc etc next we have a little mirrored
box which I'd assume holds the
accessories yes it does and it says do
not discard on it so I'm assuming that
at some point somebody chucked this out
and complained but that seems hard to
believe whenever you buy something you
think you check inside before you start
throwing things out who knows just crazy
people out there I'm telling you anyway
here's a USB cable so that you can do
everything you normally do with a USB
cable most importantly charge this
controller but I'm not gonna stop you
from doing anything else with it you
could charge anything that uses mini USB
to USB that's the beauty of that
platform there it's ubiquitous as hell
next we've got the USB dongle
and you're probably saying why the hell
do I need that well you need that
because this controller is not bluetooth
meaning it's RF and RF controllers or
remotes or anything like that require
their own dongle their own interface and
that's what this is for so that's a big
issue for you this might not be the
controller for you it's gonna be hanging
off the frontier PlayStation for as long
as you want to use it next we've got the
controller itself and see if I can shake
it out of here the first thing that's
noticed is the weight of it it's not
super heavy in fact I think it's lighter
than the regular Sony controller the
right thumbstick does stick a little bit
it's not 100% smooth and I guess it's
obvious that the fit and finish here is
not you know top notch then again it's a
$30.00 controller but from a comfort
standpoint it is totally comfortable in
the hands you've got your triggers that
are similar to the Xbox 360 triggers as
well and you got an a/b switch on the
back so that you can swap those buttons
in the event that that's more
comfortable for you it's always nice to
have options the material is a smooth
rubbery finish and like I said the feel
in the hand is almost identical to that
of the Xbox 360 controller anyway here's
a closer look you can get an idea for
the finish you've got some different
icons on the buttons and as you can see
the triggers are made out of a slightly
different material than the rest of the
controller here's a close-up on that a B
switch and the only other thing left to
do is compare it to the original so
size-wise it's a little bit bigger as
you'd expect anyway check out our
