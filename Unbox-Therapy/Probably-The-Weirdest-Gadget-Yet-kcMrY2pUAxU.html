it suck
today I am nearly positive that the
thing in this box probably does suck so
that's one way to kick off a video but
who knows maybe I'll be pleasantly
surprised and this thing years is
amazing and I end up using it daily I
saw these on Amazon they're called lazy
readers they allow you to read at a 90
degree angle look like that's that's
what they look like it's a they're
glasses with Mir now I'm not out here
reading a bunch of novels right now but
if you're like me then you're probably
doing this at some point on the couch
your or embed your cranked up the neck
it's all you got the pillows and you
have this thing here and eventually
there's tension it's uncomfortable at a
certain point if this can offer up any
kind of relief maybe it doesn't suck I
don't know
my main skepticism was it's gonna be
kind of disorienting like you're lying
down but your vision is going this way
to wherever whatever it is that you're
holding we're gonna try it out we're
gonna find out the lazy persons ultimate
accessory read in bed while lying flat
the glasses specially mirrored lenses
protect what oh the glasses is the
glasses is oh man you know glasses is
like an apostrophe at the end of the
last s holy I'm thinking with the smart
phone or the tablet you're lying flat
you're in ultimate vegetable mode you're
like Tom with the potato chips all over
them over there
well maybe the solution is right in
front of you get this cool person
reading over here inside the box a super
basic one there it is just the glasses I
haven't done that in a while almost
gotcha Jack I don't remember how much
these are they're not expensive whoa
they kind of look like those anti UV
glasses you see on some people on the
golf course of a certain age they're
pretty heavy the mirror magic is right
here well that is odd that is bizarre
now can you use them with other glasses
oh you can okay Oh
ah whoa that is bizarre
I should be seeing the camera but I'm
not I'm seeing right here right on the
table so if I had a phone all right
oh my instinct is to hold it over there
hold up hold up I'm actually looking at
it here whoa to see the camera and the
monitor to see where you are over there
I have to look completely back I'm all
the way it's like a telescope on your
face not a telescope periscope you know
what a periscope is Tom I'm looking
right at you right now
hey you don't believe me I'm looking
right at you
wow this is weird anyhow uh it works
it's crystal clear right now I need to
lie down this is uh this is the type of
use you're supposed to be doing here
hold on a second oh man okay hold up
Jack you're getting the money shot there
brother whoa
but yeah I'm looking at my phone right
now whoa you know if you're just viewing
it listen it works I'm having a weird
thing though like I'm on a roller
coaster or something you know it's kind
of hard to explain when you have your
hands not where you expect them to be
visually but instead placed somewhere
else through a reflection it's kind of a
that myth I don't know man
I may need to do a lottery uh see I
don't feel great now after that I
thought it was okay and now ivory I've
stabilized you know when I was younger I
could to go on the roller coaster no
problem good time yay something happens
you get up there in age and all of a
sudden it's your equilibrium and that's
the feeling I'm having right now I'm
having an equilibrium thing I think just
based on the way it made me feel there
alone I'm just I don't think I'm down
with it if you pick these up and you lie
down flat because you think all of a
sudden you have the opportunity you
might have the experience I just had
it's a little little weight yeah digging
on a kind of
did I eat too much at lunch don't buy
these don't buy them if you land on the
Amazon page I say skip them they will
let you read flat they're really really
clear you don't want to feel like this
afterwards they suck yeah there it is
does it suck yes don't get these what
are they go lazy readers don't get the
lazy readers you'll probably regret it
you might vomit blame me for it so I got
it tell you the truth skip them</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
