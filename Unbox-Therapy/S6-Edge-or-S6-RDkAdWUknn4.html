different
what's up guys Lew here back with
another video and today we're gonna take
a closer look at the Galaxy s6 edge in
my previous video I unboxed the standard
s6 so I'll also be doing a comparison in
this video here you can check out the
differences in form factor otherwise
you're looking at a fairly similar
device yes the edge does have some extra
functionality but it's not too much
we'll go ahead and get inside the box
and I'll give you guys a closer look and
let you know exactly what I'm talking
about so the first thing you'll notice
as you crack open the lid is the device
itself and its striking appearance as it
curves around each edge one of the few
hardware differences between the s6 edge
and the s6 besides the edge is the
battery it's a little bit bigger in the
edge version but that's not gonna make
much of a difference in battery life
performance wise you're dealing with the
same octa-core processor as the standard
s6 you're essentially paying a little
bit more money here for the design if
you are a big fan of this very slim side
here and possibly the notification
improvements that come through having
this edge lit portion but the weird
thing about that improvement if you want
to call it that is that you need to have
your display facing down on the table to
take advantage of the notification bar
that illuminates the edge of the device
and therefore the table but who places
their phone face down on a table moving
around the device you can see you have
your power lock switch in this location
right here on the other side you have
your volume buttons up and down on the
bottom you have your headphone jack
micro USB speaker and microphone and on
the top in this case is where you're
gonna have your SIM card tray
unlike the s6 which puts that on the
side as well as that IR blaster so once
again this can work as a remote control
if you want to use it that way now I'm
gonna go ahead and grab the standard s6
here and put them beside each other so
you can see just how much slimmer the
edge version looks now it's actually not
that
much thinner this is more of a visual
trick as this thing sort of Slim's out
towards the edge edge how many times I'm
gonna say edge in this video I think I
just took a picture by the way I took
two pictures I'm taking pictures on the
s6 right now with any Samsung flagship
phone you should expect to see
performance that's on the high end of
the spectrum these octa-core processors
are no joke these have fantastic cameras
as well low-light performance for the
cameras has been improved significantly
you have a much bigger aperture on this
lens which is also going to provide a
shallow depth of field that you may or
may not be looking for other items in
the box fairly predictable here you have
your USB cable your power brick capable
of that quick charging which I will be
testing in an upcoming video you've also
got your nice little headset there and
that pretty much wraps it up one thing I
want to mention right now I'm gonna go
on a little bit of a mini rant my
version of the s6 edge as well as the s6
are unbranded on the back as well as the
front how nice is that
no yucky logo from the telco this device
is gonna cost you more money and it'll
essentially perform exactly the same way
as the standard galaxy s6 but if you
find this appearance to be compelling
then who knows maybe you'll gravitate
towards the edge the fingerprint sensor
is much improved I showed that off in my
s6 unboxing video now this edge portion
here allows you to put your favorite
contacts in this location so you can
have easy access to the people you
communicate with most other than that
you've just got some extra notification
capabilities as I talked about earlier
in the video and I think a big
conversation with both of these devices
is gonna is gonna be around battery life
they don't look like fantastic battery
performers so far as v battery numbers
are showing significantly better
performance than the battery numbers on
these I'll be testing that over the next
little period and I'll get back to you
guys on Twitter and let you know what my
findings are my twitter handle as you'd
expect is at unbox therapy
now since the s6 edge is completely
covered in glass just like the standard
s6 you might want to think about
throwing a skin on your device
in the previous s6 video I showed you a
leather-like skin from D brand but they
do other options as well check out this
carbon fiber one which is actually one
of my favorites on the s6 edge right
here if you want to check it out for
yourself I'll drop a link down in the
description there's one more thing I
want to mention about both of these
devices Samsung has actually pulled back
and toned down TouchWiz quite a bit
which I'm a fan of those of you who've
been following me for a while you know
my preference is stock Android so when a
manufacturer goes crazy on the skin kind
of gets under my goes crazy on the skin
it gets under my skin it gets under my
skin when they get crazy with their
skins that's what gets under my skin
before I take off from this video I want
to mention real quick I've been doing
live broadcasts on a new app called
periscope if you haven't seen those or
heard about them you should definitely
check out the app and check out my
broadcasts add me I'll put all the
details down in the description if you
are an Android user you're probably
upset because there is no app for
Android yet but if you follow me on
Twitter you won't miss a live broadcast
because you can actually watch them via
the web browser so even if you're on
Android you should be ok just follow me
on Twitter and you'll see a tweet go out
whenever it is that I go live but let me
know in the comments which do you prefer
which would it be for you would it be
the standard s6 or the s6 edge and quick
teaser which one bends easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
