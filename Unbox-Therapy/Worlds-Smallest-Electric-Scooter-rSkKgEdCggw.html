doesn't need to be a whole thing you
know that's how it starts out in the
beginning that's the whole game plan you
know you make videos you want to make
videos this is one of those times Jackie
no I'm holding a detour right now I feel
great man Thom I feel alive man
so recently on unbox therapy you've seen
a video in which I am spinning around
this space moving around gliding around
the evolve carbon fibre electric
skateboard as fast it got me motivating
you know in a whole new way just fun
actually having fun if it's got wheels
if it's got a motor we should be flying
around this place this is called the
what is it the Irby you are B - E E for
electric tell Tom in the comments how
beautiful he is okay
please far from professional today we're
working with a plastic knife will it get
the job done maybe
will we be writing that electric vehicle
at all costs 100% today is about the
Irby oh my goodness this is far more
serious than the other stuff we've
looked at oh wow there we go Oh spring
loaded it's got some kind of shocks on
it sort of confused right now made in
the USA drink holder so there it is when
it's folded up eventually you get to
here and that's what it looks like when
it's ready to ride handlebars a brake
leaver ignition switch brakes obviously
and there is a shock absorber I feel
like maybe we can figure this out
without getting too crazy Tom there's
like warnings everywhere and you know
what I'm just yanking this right up
morning you will die you might die
you're probably dead already you're dead
right now
these rails here look like carbon fiber
I'm pretty sure they are there we go
there we go now we're doing something
here this pin up here
kind of locks in see that's what's going
on with that part there yeah this is
pretty much all the construction you
have to do I mean the thing completely
folds out
you have to just basically bolt on the
handlebars it's way smaller in person
than you expect it to be it's like wow
that thing is compact that was it it was
it was basically four screws got brakes
here's your throttle there's even a
little kickstand on it a hardcore phone
mount spring-loaded to kind of fold it
down I think you just lift this up
schools like that and then when you're
ready to ride you pull this out pull
that up lock it in there we go
whoo whoo oh man
Oh baby oh let me tell you you need to
play like still Dre right now
bling bling bling bling bling bling
bling bling bling bling still got a love
for the streets it's the d-r-e this is
the last time I checked we're here whit
Oh Mike G Mary right on my tail Oh Jack
Attack is flying hey Tom go get some
groceries or something maybe something
for the grill a little bit later on even
when you feel like you're gonna bail out
you don't bail that's the thing I like
it this thing is fun man this thing is
fun it's fast its nimble I mean I'm
cutting in and out I mean work it it's
tiny so you're getting in and out look
at this let's see how nimble I can be
real quick look at this basic look at
that oh oh oh oh I'm hitting that gap I
don't hate the gap whoo
check me check me with the letter O
humans people the world it's the future
right here electricity is gonna move you
around
who's pedaling in today's I got the Irby
I'm all over the place how fast I'm I
got a little fat look at me I'm gone
we have a light on the back as well I
thought was a reflector but if you press
it look how bright that thing is
security purposes safe
purposes and you can make it flash -
this thing can go how far Tom 20 miles
20 mile range at 15 miles an hour and
then it takes about four hours to charge
it up from there
all right Tom's your turn oh man that's
what I look like
Wow it's probably easier to ride this
for super long periods of time like my
legs are not sore right now at all it's
really just like sitting down you're
just like on a chair that happens to
move so I don't know you're probably
gonna have to wait for our showdown
video because I'm thinking now that we
got all this space we should be doing an
electric vehicle showdown it could be
the vehicle that Jack's riding it could
be the hoverboard
it could be the electric skateboard the
Irby and God knows what other electric
vehicle that's out there if you and your
company has an electric vehicle send it
out here and I will ride into oblivion
