goddamnit Jack we're not putting that in
what's up guys Lew here back with
another video and today I've got
something unusual to show you yes
they're headphones and I've unboxed many
many headphones here on the channel but
these ones are the first modular
headphones I've ever looked at from a
company called i i i i i i i i i the
puppeteer they're based in denmark you
get to pick and choose your headband
your ear cups your cables so i have the
actual all-around preset pair of
headphones on the left and then I have
some modular components that I'm unaware
of on the right so first let's take a
closer look at box number one on the
side here you can see it features a
cable lock adjustable ear cups an angled
stereo plug and a one button remote this
preset has been configured with the
all-round s01 speaker unit which
delivers a balanced sound representation
suitable for all music genre essentially
this setup is a basic configuration for
most listening scenarios so inside what
is this envelope congratulations in here
we have these really cool packages this
is the cable ooh smells fresh in there
smell that jack give that a smell
factory fresh or what alright so here is
the cable one button remote and
microphone the ear pad your pads so
that's a soft microfiber very nice and
you can see on the back here they simply
clip in here are the speaker units this
is like DIY headphones to dream come
true so we've actually got the s01
speaker unit here got a soft touch
plastic and the last thing in this kit
is the headband this one is the
polycarbonate as I mentioned before it's
gonna be really lightweight why don't we
just do this right now let's just build
this thing right now
feel like I want to take this sticker
off though first hang on knife time
next time so I'm going to go ahead and
fit this on here and since these are
modular you could have like multiple ear
cups that you own depending on what your
going to be listening to you could
simply take these off really easily and
add the other ones right let's get this
other one on okay
we certainly need some ear cushions now
go ahead and fit on the ear cushions
which just secured into place with a
press down very easy very lightweight I
hardly feel any pressure from the
headband it's super lightweight I didn't
even think about this when you travel
with these things you could just break
them down let me see how quickly I can
break them down so twist this I suppose
if I if I was a little bit more to lock
or to unlock let me try that again there
we go okay pull that pull that booyah
headphones that's pretty cool okay so
now that we've unboxed the all-around
preset I also have this box from III
which doesn't actually tell me what's
inside but I'm pretty sure this is some
other components that you can outfit the
kit with so here we have oh wow
so we have a completely different set we
have different speaker units different
ear pads a different headband and a
different cable so this is the c04 cable
coiled woven cable a lot thicker and
coil cool it also is braided and then on
this end we have a screw on locking
adapter for quarter-inch audio equipment
of course you can break it down to your
standard mini jack these are the leather
over ear ear pads yes ooh
you ever heard someone gets so excited
about ear cuffs
probably not now look look in this
particular case you have two options
right so you got the smaller one maybe
for travel you got the bigger one that
you use at your desk forget about having
to own two pairs of headphones this is
the solution s03 speaker units so these
have a warm sound what did the other
package say the all-round is listed as a
balanced
suitable for all genres now the so3 is
listed as warm engineered with titanium
coated driver to reduce distortion and
design with a fully sealed driver
providing a full rich sound interesting
oh there's a little note in here the
speaker units perform best
after a short burning period that allows
the drivers voice coil and diaphragm to
reach their optimal performance level we
therefore recommend that you give them
up to 24 hours of low to moderate volume
play before subjecting them to critical
use many different headphones benefit
through a burning period as suggested
now which headband did we get on this
second unit rugged very nice mm I like
this headband it's a little heavier for
sure but the material here really nice
okay so here's the best part now we have
all these various components but we can
use them all together or apart we can do
anything so many options so much room
for activities god damn it jack
that joke was completely irrelevant I
want to use the slim headband but with
the big ear cups done I want to use the
rugged hand headband with the smaller on
ear ear cups no problem I want to use
the braided cable with the the slim head
but no problem I suppose the next thing
to do now is to listen to these babies
so right now we're using the over ear
style 40 millimeter driver Wow so far
very surprised by the low end lots of
punch here in the low end
these are crispy as a mother crispy as a
mother okay so now I have the initial
drivers installed in the second
configuration so these are the all-round
drivers Wow I think I like these ones
better actually
okay so just for fun we've gone ahead
and installed one of each of the two
drivers so I can compare them in
real-time but I don't know which is
which Jack did the installation just for
this purpose so let's do the same thing
with one of each and find out which one
I prefer I can certainly tell the
difference I'm going to go ahead and say
the one on this year is the warm
sounding one the first driver that I
heard and this is going to be the
all-around more balanced one this one
gives you more thump in the low end
which might be what you're looking for I
think this one's a little bit more
accurate completely up to you it's all
about taste that's the beauty of this
kind of setup s01 this is the first time
you really get to tailor your experience
to your style if you're interested in
checking this stuff out I'll drop links
down in the description go try and
configure your own set this is really
really cool I'm really really pumped I
think you guys can tell that if you
enjoyed this content make sure to leave
a thumbs up down below thanks as always
for watching and we'll catch you on the
next episode later guys
