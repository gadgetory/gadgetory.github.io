fold still I mean I haven't been this
interested in a smartphone for a very
long time as I'm sure you can tell
there's so many changes to the day to
day adjustments that you make as a user
and of course the questions they're all
flowing in I covered a couple of those
things in the previous video in which I
compared this galaxy fold to the other
flagship devices comparing you tube
multi-window multi-application Instagram
Facebook and whatnot so if you're
interested in that go check out that
video but this video exists to address a
very specific question gaming what about
gaming on this phone you have this
gigantic display now you would think it
would work really well for gaming where
my skepticism came in in the early
stages was around the types of games
that exist for mobile they're designed
with a smartphone form factor in mind
something like this and then so
typically the controller layouts the
experience pretty much the whole thing
is developed around that form factor so
I was like let's see what's happening in
games let's play a few games
what's better what's worse and so forth
maybe we should kick it off with Mario
run look at that okay so Mario run is an
interesting one because it's a portrait
game and then the other thing is like is
the screen really being taken advantage
of does the game get any better having
more displayed in some games yes other
games maybe less sold in this game for
example you kind of just end up with
more sky like a lot of it now some
people love this game some people hate
this game it's an homage to the original
but it's definitely not a replacement
for the original and it's just the kind
of game that requires very little input
from you so many games are developed for
foreplay on tiny little screens so the
interaction is limited by the hardware
I'd say this is an example of a game
that doesn't really benefit that much
from the bigger display and maybe you
could argue that ru is worse on the big
display beyond the fact that it looks
great the overall experience of that
game is tuned for a smartphone slender
portrait display more so than this
unusual form factor in my opinion now
this next game I'm gonna say is the
opposite Altos adventure
kind of snowboarding down this hill and
you jump over some rocks and you chase
these these creatures these llamas I
just hit a rock there because it's so
bright in here these things here you can
grind there you go see
this game I feel like benefits a lot of
games that work in landscape mode
I think benefit because it sets your
hands further apart but it frees up all
this extra space here so if you sign
this game for example to Hill it's kind
of coming from here you just would see a
lot less of where you're coming from and
where you're going
now there's other games you can say for
example you know a tower defense game
for example like this you just have more
room to maneuver and to look at what
you're doing I'd say it improves the
experience quite a bit it's like playing
it on a tablet so tower defense games I
think are bonus you could still play on
the exterior display maybe I should do
that real quick I don't know if anyone
would actually do this you could play
this game here with one hand so far
having used this device I just hate
using this like I don't want to use this
screen this screen is just strictly a
backup for like picking up a phone call
that's it so far using this exterior
display it's just a bit depressing like
it works and as you can see this game is
totally developed for a smartphone
experience it's a bit depressing you
know that you have this enormous screen
on the inside you could do other things
on it but I don't recommend it just pop
it open it takes two seconds yes there's
the option with portrait style games to
go onto the outside display and play
them in a more typical smartphone
fashion but I do not recommend it
another example of that is this game
down well which I find to be kind of
terrible on the the full display mean it
works it's developed more for a narrow a
narrow display and you don't really
benefit from the extended display now I
should get into the couple of examples
where this thing's amazing table G is a
game where I feel like it's beginning to
take advantage of the extra real estate
this is a game which is a shooting game
you have on-screen controls which take
up space now on a typical smartphone the
whole experience is pretty cramped this
is the opposite experience this is like
a tablet experience but the benefit is
it doesn't have the weight of a tablet
this thing is so much lighter than a
typical tablet you feel like you have a
real advantage over someone who's
playing just on a regular smartphone and
the same thing actually goes for the
left thumbstick you just have more room
to roam around without interfering with
what you see
like I said that's the perfect example
the extra real estate and what that
means for you within the game whether
you're launching the map and trying to
look at precise stuff or you when I
targeted that guy earlier and I had the
crosshairs I was looking down the
crosshairs and he's a tiny little speck
so having it scaled up does there's it
there's an actual value in that so when
you're thinking about picking this up as
a gaming device I think it's important
to think about which game you like to
play and then you'll know whether
there's gonna be an improvement
this one looks amazing so this is CSR
and this one is really showcasing the
hardware better it presents interesting
opportunities as well for game
developers to think about these formats
differently like what mobile gaming has
to be if you're not confined to the
typical smartphone form-factor dudes
he's gaining
it's another one that I feel like
benefits from the bigger display because
it just looks good it's just more to
look at I'll do Samba ville here so this
is a side-scrolling type of game I mean
you move up and down a little bit but
it's very arkady what's the benefit me
are you really gonna be that much better
at it it's just more room to roll them
around it just looks a bit better it
looks good
very colorful so this is like a forward
moving swipe kind of situation jump
swipe oh that's a duck by the way now
these type of games I do feel like are
better on a bigger display as well
because you can have more deliberate
swipe movements ma just looks cooler as
well and you can see Yumi you just see
more obviously so what have we learned
here well yeah I mean this thing is a
powerhouse it's not gonna have a problem
with any mobile gaming graphics that are
out there whatever it is that you want
to play but some games I think you're
actually gonna have an advantage on here
games like pop G whereas others actually
don't work as well like down well for
example or possibly Mario run so it does
depend what type of games you're into
you do have the external display if you
want to play a one-handed kind of casual
game the type of games I would want to
play they're all better when utilizing
the extended the bigger display that the
fold gives you it doesn't get too hot
not overwhelmingly and it gives you kind
of a tablet like gaming experience
without the bezels you would typically
have on a tablet or the weight that you
would typically have with the tablet so
you get the bigger display without those
downsides and then at the end of it you
can of course just pop it in the pocket
so gaming as expected it's good on the
fold I think you'll be happy with it but
single handed vertical games might not
work so well so keep that in mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
