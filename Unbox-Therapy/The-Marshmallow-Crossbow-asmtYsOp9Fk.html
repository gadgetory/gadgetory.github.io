today's a good one at least I'm excited
you know it's not like I don't like the
latest electronic gadget that shows up
every single - I do but this is this is
something different there's a different
level of insanity just a tiny pinch more
at first glance you're like what what's
going on is this is this a cooking show
no yes these are marshmallows which by
the way are harder than they were at one
time in their life they're a little
stiff this my friends is a marshmallow
shooting crossbow why does that exist I
don't know because it's fun because jack
is about to find out if his skull can
take the impact of a hardened
marshmallow better than silica gel this
came from a company called MMX Vancouver
com
handcrafted with pride in Vancouver
adjust the mollow holder to lightly hold
your marshmallow by pulling it up or
pushing it down alright I get that
tons of caution here don't do this at
home I got to construct it a little bit
so this is how it showed up I'm gonna
have to put it together it seems like
it's high-quality materials here this is
all carved out a wood look at this it
seems like some sort of torture device
imagine a death by marshmallow so
there's a little release latch up here
I'm sure that's gonna that's how it's
gonna fire right like that is a little
screw on the front that comes off and
then this guy over here now just a
little cut out so you want to have that
along the top so there's room for the
marshmallow to skim right through there
on its way to destruction and that's
what gives you the Oh that's what gives
you to pull you pull back on here it
just goes around this latch by the looks
of it yeah you see that right there and
then when you pull this release assuming
the marshmallow fits into this location
here then let's see what happened you
got a good look at that jack ready set
Oh
awooga what's your origin of that noise
Haga you got
let's get this baby loaded and let's
give Jack a black eye oh man those are
kind of hard
those are dangerous projectiles to kick
it off we pull this back Oh
now let's get a marshmallow you slide it
underneath the holder here you're ready
for this jack ready for this impact this
is exactly what Jack deserves right now
oh just missed Oh direct it direct it
it's pretty powerful watch this okay you
ready guys I'm gonna put it I'm gonna
ricochet off the table oh oh
hit the leg of the tripod safety
number-one priority
no less is that Russian huh here we go
oh that's like a bullet okay folks a
little bit of target practice now to
show you what kind of force we're
working with here ready set
I'm not loaded with a marshmallow three
two one
oh wow you're dead water bottle
oh you saw me knock over some water
bottles
you saw me almost kill Jack so how
powerful is this thing should I send
this stale marshmallow into my hand and
see oh okay I don't think I have a
choice in three two ah ah I hit the
pinky the poor little pinky okay it's
not gonna kill anybody but it's fun man
I don't know a little bit of target
practice maybe you and your friends have
have a war you step the nerf game up a
notch plus you can eat the ammunition
give us up a little roasted marshmallow
