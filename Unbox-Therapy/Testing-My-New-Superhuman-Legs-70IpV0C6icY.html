wonderful waiting for you
Jubilee who he said bright as the sky is
blue welcome to super listen you see in
this town we unboxing it's been a little
while it's been a few days in fact so
it's time for us to pick it up a notch
take things to a completely new level
maybe even act like a kangaroo some
would say well hell I got the answer for
you what I just did to the floor man
might officially be the weirdest intro
and unbox therapy history look at that
thing show them Jack jump higher run
faster it's called air trekkers and you
strap these things onto your legs and
all of a sudden you can jump six feet in
the air is this dangerous yes is it a
possibility that I will get terribly
injured possibly disfigured yes but
that's why you're tuned in I don't know
I saw this thing on Amazon I was like
man if I can figure this out that might
be a lot of fun and if I can't figure it
out it'll probably be fun too these
things are kind of like Springs on there
and there's a little pad on the bottom
you can look on YouTube you got a bunch
of people doing flips and acrobatics I'm
not doing that but I just kind of want
to see what this is all about all right
oh you know what may give you what those
elbow pad oh man you know that's a
problem to give you that nothing says
you're in danger like elbow pad
those look like elbow pads there's a
stick if you need
it that's like post ACL surgery so I've
got a step a step ahead the ability to
jump two meters in the air with
incredible speed
so here's the unit cool oh my goodness
this is a serious piece of machinery
that's all metal there there's different
versions depending on the weight class
that you fit into holy smokes I guess it
you know I've never really been on
stilts or anything before and this is
obviously a far more extreme
spring-loaded version of that I'm sorry
you're nervous we kind of stuck with
this stock height here
I just tighten those up but I think by
default they're loose so that you can
run this peg down to the right height
for you but we'll see you imagine
inventing something like this this is
real quick oh there you go oh okay that
tight enough next I see these things
online and I'm like Oh that'd be that'd
be a good idea that's exactly what unbox
therapy people need to see next thing
you know it's here in the studio there's
too late to bail out holy smokes
Oh
yo man yo I'm gonna need I need help man
dude how many somebody just what are you
even talking about man
yo don't let me laugh it I need
something to hold on to that least get
the bearings
did you see the videos with you guys man
they're jumping all over the place
yeah six feet in the air
you kidding me right now oh dude dude
does not statement you know I need to
watch a video real quick so we just
learned something here I have these
straps
way too low they're meant to be
positioned below your knee you can tell
it's not nearly as hard as it was I'm
not ready for flips yet I feel like some
sort of mech warrior through the pot ha
ha dum dum dum dum dum yeah but I got a
whole new appreciation regardless for
those guys doing flips on these things
holy whoa easy boy so standing stills a
little bit tough to do but as long as
you're moving and you really start
getting the hang of it
like this venture future soldier walking
a nice thing you get used to it you get
more and more used to it as you do it oh
just smoothly walking
I just I'm on my way to grocery store
like this think anybody's gonna notice
oh this is probably not a good idea
I do not advise anybody hey oh oh whoa
take it easy there Lou then to
comfortable now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
