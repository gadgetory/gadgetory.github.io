therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Marshall major headphones now these
ones are done up in white but the same
model is also available in black if you
prefer they are in on the ear style
headphone and they're also fairly
portable because they are collapsible
making them perfect for travel of course
now Marshall is a company that's been
well known for a long time for their
guitar amplifiers and they've brought
some of that amplifier styling into
their headphone design I happen to be a
big fan and I've been looking at these
headphones for a long long time finally
got a chance to unbox them and get a
better look
you'll notice the eco-friendly packaging
on the outside as well as the interior
and you see some other things that are
included in the box that we're going to
go over in a quick second now Marshall
does have a couple of different lines of
headphones currently available they've
also got something called the minor
which is an in the ear style even more
portable headphone I've got those here
as well and I'll be unboxing them next
so definitely stay tuned for that back
to this unboxing here the first thing
we'll go through is a bit of the
paperwork which gives you a little bit
of the history on Marshall as a company
as well as warranty information and on
the interior you're going to see an
outline of both the majors and the
minors these pictures here have outlined
the black version I've got the white
version in front of me and but from a
technical standpoint they're identical
it's just a aesthetic choice you've also
got this little adapter and I didn't
know it first before I read the little
tab but it's a neutral stereo adapter
meaning it'll I suppose it'll bypass the
microphone within the headset making
this perfect for use with higher-end
audio equipment where you might want to
avoid interference etc in fact I'm using
that adapter while monitoring this audio
right now you've also got a 6.3
millimeter adapter plug this is
obviously for certain types of audio
equipment that interface with the larger
standard things like mixing boards
high-end audio equipment etc might use
that bigger connector but as you guys
are noticing here everything is done in
a gold plated finish really high quality
fit and finish all around at least at
first glance and as I mentioned before a
lot of the styling from their amplifiers
has been brought forward in these
headphones here a lot of the vinyl
finishes you've got the gold
Marshall played on the inside of both
the right and left earphone so a pretty
impressive stuff pretty unique look as
well you've got a really supple ear pad
on the inside and the signature along
top from Jim Marshall himself which is
always a good sign he's willing to put
his name on these headphones here you
got a real thick cable and here's the
better look at that in-line microphone
for answering phone calls hanging them
up and probably to play in pause music
as well and you've got the bungee style
cord which I always appreciate as
opposed to carrying around a bunch of
extra length this gives you some of the
freedom to move away from your audio
source without worrying about having the
plug come disconnected you get a little
bit of extra slack so this is unbox
therapy of course we want to get you as
close as humanly possible to the product
so I'll show you here the Marshall logo
which is actually extruded a little bit
from the actual headphone a real nice
design and you've also got the pivoting
feature there on the inside of the ear
cup you've got that padding that I
mentioned earlier in a cool sort of
tweed covering over the driver which I
haven't actually seen before usually
this is just a normal mesh here's a
better look at that inline microphone
along with that switch that I was
mentioning earlier and that gold-plated
connector that I am really impressed
with it's thick it's heavy you know it's
probably decent quality so here's a
better look around the outside of the
phones I'm pretty impressed at this
point as I told you earlier I can't wait
to try them out I'm going to be using
these headphones during my CES trip for
the next week which will definitely
allow me to figure out the ins and outs
and if I like the sound and whatnot and
here's how they collapse as well I did
mention before they are collapsible
which makes them perfect for travel
perfect for my CES trip as you guys know
most high quality on the ear or over the
ear headphones don't collapse this small
so it'll be perfect for the bag that I
carry into the convention as well as
around the hotel on the airplane etc
these would be real cool to test out
that's for sure anyway guys if you
enjoyed this unboxing hopefully you can
like and favorite this video as it does
help me out a bunch and as I mentioned
earlier I've got another unboxing on the
way of the minor style head
phones they are even more portable in
the ear style Marshall headphones and
they are also very cool from a styling
standpoint can't wait to get those
unboxed and show those to you guys if
