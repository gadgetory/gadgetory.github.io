future 25 years after its original
release here we are and this time would
get a lot more than we originally did
because when it originally came out we
didn't have blu-ray and we didn't have
DVDs rejoice the world is a better place
anyway back to the product at hand
what's important about this blu-ray is
that it's not just a blu-ray it's also a
digital copy and on top of that you're
going to get special features that
didn't exist before some get some first
looks into some behind the scenes and
for all you superfans I can see that
being important now let's check out the
layout inside of here you can see
straight away we've got a list of some
of the special features we've got a
little piece of paper here talking about
Despicable Me and Michael J Fox anyway
stay tuned we got some close-ups for all
you freaks
