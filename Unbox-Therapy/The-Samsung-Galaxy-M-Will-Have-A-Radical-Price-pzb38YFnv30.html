it's making cheaper phones for India
that is a smart move a big move and a
smart move they've got a new brand
coming out called IBM which apparently
stands for Millennials it's a term that
has mixed reactions but it's definitely
a group of individuals who love their
smartphones every girl in the picture is
locked into her phone at least it's very
modern yes and thank goodness it's just
an M instead of Millennials the whole
imagined the galaxy millennial the
m-series are set according to Samsung to
redefine the affordable and mid-level
price smart phones specifically in India
but eventually potentially globally
worldwide
the crazy thing that's been happening
the good thing that's been happening is
that a lot of innovation has been going
on in the mid-range and even the low end
of the smartphone market because somehow
that became the competitive space
because of markets like China and India
in this particular case so they're gonna
put out two devices the m10 and m20
which are going to be around like 150 to
200 dollars USD equivalent so with those
price points it appears that Samsung is
squarely targeting the Xiaomi type
companies they're going after the red
meat brands and they're going after the
price to performance ratio concept
they're bringing their a-game their most
aggressive game to the mid-range imagine
this they're saying this device here is
going to have an infinity V display
that's a teardrop style bezel as'
display and this device the m20 will
supposedly have a five thousand milliamp
hour battery which is the biggest
Samsung has ever put in a device now
imagine the biggest battery they've ever
used going into a device that's gonna be
around $200 what does that tell you
about what's happening in the industry
it's it's changing rapidly mm-hmm and if
you can get decent specs for you know
200 bucks
can't go wrong there no what if they run
Android one well no you know that's what
I'd be looking for
yeah Android one would be great I don't
know if Samsung is going to be
particularly interested in that
obviously Xiaomi does it but they don't
do it in the read me brand as far as I
know so because of the branding the
Millennial aspect that will likely go
along with that package I'm guessing
they're gonna try to have something with
the software that encompasses that
branding like that that speaks to
Millennials so I'm not too optimistic
about the software I think there's
probably gonna be some maybe some stuff
in there a little bloat possibly can
this little millennial bloat nonetheless
the spec lists the target the motivation
to go into this space for a player like
Samsung is a really big deal like you
said it's an indication of a shift in
the market it's delivering more for less
this is increasingly happening in this
space as the number of players in the
space has increased scroll down a little
bit more and the reason that it's
important coming from Samsung is because
they are such an integrated company they
are responsible for manufacturing
screens various connectivity inside of
these devices and components from the
ground up processors and so on in many
cases other smartphone makers rely on
Samsung to deliver certain components
for their eventual products or those
other makers are relying on other brands
besides Samsung to deliver those
components since Samsung can manufacture
pretty much an entire smartphone
presumably they can be really
competitive in this market and maybe
they can play in this $200 space without
losing too much money because there has
been speculation that some of the major
players with with this crazy cost of
performance ratio are actually going out
of their own pockets a little bit in
order to deliver that so it makes
Samsung a really scary competitor in the
space I'm excited for this potential M
20 M 10 as well it's really amazing to
see what will be possible in the coming
year at these price points yeah and you
brought up a good point like Samsung has
an infrastructure already built for
phones so they can essentially
make the logistics for a cheaper phone
like that you know no problem now as of
right now the story is is indicating
that this device will be targeting India
but I think because Samsung is such a
global player there's a chance possibly
even a likelihood that this will branch
out from that market into others and I
think that would be a major win for
customers elsewhere in the world also so
if you're not in the Indian market this
is still interesting and I think it's
only a matter of time before people in
Western Europe North America start to
see better specs being delivered at a
lower price point one thing it does do
though is it possibly cannibalizes the
high end of the market if you have this
infinity V display a five thousand
milliamp hour battery
I think this device will have three gigs
of RAM 32 gigs of storage is that gonna
be good enough for most people if you
can have that type of experience with a
brand like Samsung ad 150 or 200 yeah
would you get the note 10
I mean it's it's a much it's a month a
ton for an argument so it looks like
Samsung's willing to make that sacrifice
because they understand to a degree the
increasing competition and the fact that
they have to have some kind of play now
what the other brands have done Xiaomi
with red knee with polka phone they
created things that look like completely
different brands Samsung can do that
Samsung's just gonna call it the
m-series
Galaxy em there's a disadvantage of
potentially cannibalizing their
higher-end products but in a weird way
there's an advantage on the low end of
having a recognizable brand like Samsung
and Galaxy without the price tag to
match so you get a little cachet mm-hmm
something that's reliable exactly depend
of you're getting a brand name for a low
ticket price this will be interesting to
see how it shakes out all good for tech
buyers in the audience all good for them
they continue to get more for less well
that competition and everyone wins
that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
