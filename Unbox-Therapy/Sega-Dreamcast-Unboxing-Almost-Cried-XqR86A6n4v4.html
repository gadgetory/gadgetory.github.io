another video and today I am incredibly
exciting that is no joke this is the
Sega Dreamcast now some of you
youngsters might not know exactly what
this thing is but it was one of the most
important things in my life for a period
of time back in 1999 I was about 14
years old and it was just incredibly
important to us obviously now you look
back at the games that were on this
system and if you're a modern gamer
you're not all that impressed but that's
not really what it's always about
sometimes it's about spending time
together and any time I look at these
retro consoles I don't just see the
technology in the progression I also see
the hours spent with people you care
about because back then there was no
online multiplayer at least this was the
very beginning of it but most of the
gameplay you did most of the games that
you played he did so locally you did so
with friends there was still a physical
connection between you and the other
individuals you were gaming against when
you beat somebody they were right there
and they had to they had to look at you
as you bloated but this thing still
occupies a spot in my heart possibly my
favorite console ever for the reasons
that I just mentioned so I have one here
which as you can tell is still in the
box like I said you youngsters are about
to find something out and for anybody
who's familiar with this thing you're
just gonna sit back relax and enjoy this
trip down memory lane here is the
classic controller first and foremost oh
my goodness look I'm home and this is in
really good condition as well check that
out still made in Japan you got the
analog stick the d-pad start button and
of course this empty spot here for your
memory card otherwise known as the V mu
one of the coolest innovations that came
along with this system Wow we have the
power cables that's your power cable
right there and you have your standard
definition AV cables here no HDMI that's
okay
we have our software still intact web
browser 2.0 with sega net get out of
town that is still sealed my friends
almost 20 year old plastic wrap
optimized for sega net get exclusive
access to vm you files movies and more
explore the world wide web when's the
last time you heard that World Wide Web
that's what we're on right now nobody
says it anymore chat with people around
the world I'd like to take this moment
to remind you guys that once upon a time
you couldn't do that once upon a time
you had to pay $600 for a long-distance
phone call now your instant messaging
people in Russia Saudi Arabia check this
out
Dreamcast generator volume 2 my goodness
we got to Maury derp that looks like
Tony Hawk interesting fact if you
subscribed to Sega net it would actually
rebate the entire cost of the Dreamcast
reissue of the official Sega Dreamcast
magazine you think it's too late for me
to redeem this you've got yourself the
hottest videogames machine on the planet
you've got graphics to rival reality a
mind-blowing modem and the Internet a
huge phone cable so you could use that
very high-tech modem and then of course
the actual Sega Dreamcast this thing is
in beautiful condition wow this is
taking me back right now guys this is
the closest thing to a time machine I
could imagine at least mentally taking
me back to that place so of course on
the front for controller connections
impassable with Microsoft Windows CD you
could hook up a keyboard to this thing
and actually browse the web on your
television I thought that was bonkers at
the time on the back here you have your
line in for your modem AV out regular
video connection as the left/right
channel audio serial port which I don't
remember using AC in Open button here
got that spring loaded action doesn't
get any better
this motion right here these mechanics
Time Machine once again I'm 14
power switch oh the power switch is even
better for me Reina damn I remember
playing NFL 2k 1 and calling plays on
the actual vmu screen so the person
you're playing with couldn't see what
you were doing that was just amazing at
the time so as you can tell this was an
emotional unboxing for me I hope you
guys appreciate it maybe it was
emotional for you especially if you were
a Dreamcast owner at one point in your
life and if you weren't hopefully I
taught you something about the Dreamcast
and its importance in the progression of
console gaming web browsing so on and so
forth if you enjoyed this content make
sure to leave a thumbs up down below if
you'd like to see more retro unboxing
let me know down in the comments what
you'd like to see also let me know what
was your favorite Dreamcast title I am
genuinely interested alright that wraps
up this video thanks again and I'll
catch you on the next episode later guys
world wide web that's what we're on
