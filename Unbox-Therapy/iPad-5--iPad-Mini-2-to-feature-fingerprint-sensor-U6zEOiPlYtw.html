compile a long list of components for
what might be the next generation of
iPad or the iPad 5 the latest being this
space gray back panel that you've seen
earlier but I actually noticed something
examining these further specifically
with the front panels and the home
button opening when placed on top of the
previous generation of iPad there is not
enough space for the old home button to
fit flush now that might sound a little
bit strange but basically what this
means is that the old home button is a
little bit too large for the opening on
the front panel from the next version
now that might not seem very exciting
but it might point in the direction of a
fingerprint sensor so in order to find
out I decided to dissect my iPhone 5s in
gold and remove the fingerprint sensor
from it to test this theory a little bit
so here it is as you can see in all of
its glory and don't worry no iPhones
were harmed in this particular
production I put it back together after
the fact I then removed an old home
button from a previous generation of
iPhone this one is identical to the home
button on the last generation of iPad
the one that's sitting underneath here
and as I suspected the old button will
not fit through even when you have
removed it and you're trying to fit it
in independently of the iPad here you
can see it does not fit flush there is a
ridge that is accessible with my
fingernail there so it definitely is not
designed for that but when I go ahead
and grab the fingerprint sensor that
I've removed from the iPhone 5s it fits
in there perfectly perfectly flush and
it almost looks like it was designed to
go in there now as you guys know until
we have official word from Apple we
can't say with 100% certainty that the
next generation of iPad will indeed ship
with a fingerprint sensor that being
said these findings right here in
conjunction with some rumors and
speculation that's going on around the
web what appear to point in the
direction of the fingerprint sensor
being included in the next generation of
eye
and of course only time will tell and we
will wait patiently for Apple to pick
it's time to tell us anyway guys that
