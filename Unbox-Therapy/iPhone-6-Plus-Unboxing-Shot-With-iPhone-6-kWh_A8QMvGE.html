now you're wondering why I'm not in the
frame why is this like some old school
unboxing video with the hands and no
visual representation of the person
actually doing the unboxing that's
because I'm not shooting on my usual
professional 4k equipment this unboxing
video is happening on an iPhone the
iPhone 6 to be exact so I have the space
gray version mounted up right here so
that you can get an idea of the video
quality of the new iPhone during the
unboxing of the bigger brother the
iPhone 6 plus now you might have a
question regarding all of these iPhones
stacked up over here yes I'm doing a
giveaway subscribe for that but let's go
ahead and do what is maybe the first
unboxing of an iPhone 6 actually shot on
an iPhone 6
so obviously the box is a little bit
larger for the 6 plus as you might
imagine and other than that you're
looking at a very similar design not a
huge fan of this box that Apple went
with on this particular device no
graphics on the front just this little
design here which is I don't know not
too impressive to me but who knows what
their reasoning was so there you have it
the iPhone 6 plus which is obviously
much larger than the regular six not too
bad for my hands but again you have that
issue with really trying to reach up and
get your thumb to the upper part of the
screen
not the easiest thing in the world to
achieve but they have that built-in
feature by double tapping the home
button to bring down the different
interactive buttons so that maybe you
don't need to shift your hand I'll go
ahead and remove
this plastic covering here it's always
the best part of any unboxing video
still very thin not too heavy and I'll
just go ahead and put this standard
iPhone 6 in my other hand to give you
guys a better representation of what to
expect with either of these a visual and
physical representation so the thing I'm
talking about size-wise is one-handed
usability without the need to use that
built-in function where you double tap
to reduce the overall screen size which
will work but it's not a very elegant
solution in my opinion so you can see
here that my thumb is capable of
reaching the top corner without shifting
my grip at all the bottom corner of the
phone stays seated right in the palm of
my hand whereas with the larger brother
bigger brother older brother ever way
you want to refer to it you don't have
that luxury there's absolutely no way
you're going to reach that entire screen
now Galaxy Note users have become used
to this they have known this for a very
long time and it's obviously a trade-off
if you're a heavy-duty multimedia user
then potentially the screen size for
that multimedia would outweigh the
drawbacks of maybe some functionality
drawbacks for example of not being able
to reach those sections of the screen
also heavy one-handed users people who
are constantly traveling taking public
transit etc that's where you're also
going to start to see the benefit of the
smaller device as opposed to the larger
one but then people who are sort of more
stationary users at home etc you will
start to see the benefits of a bigger
screen just for immersion when you're
watching video etc so anyways there you
have it the unboxing inside the box
it's the exact same as what you're going
to get with the standard iPhone 6 that I
already unboxed you have your earpods
followed by your power brick and of
course the lightning cable and you've
also got a sim removal tool which is in
the paperwork that was just removed over
here so you can go ahead and insert a
new SIM card I'm going to run some tests
on these devices
maybe some speed tests some
more tests that's another big question
with these two phones which camera is
better well we know that the six plus
has some features on the camera that the
six simply doesn't have like optical
image stabilization but how big of a
deal is that maybe some tests will help
to illustrate those differences so make
sure to subscribe to see that I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and remember
this video quality you're looking at is
the video quality of the new iPhone 6
that's because it is shooting this video
right here so if you want to do some
kind of evaluation on how the image
looks well there you go you have your
very first look at the kind of video
that you can create using just an iPhone
6 alright guys that wraps up this video
expect more iPhone 6 content coming very
shortly thanks as always for watching
and I will catch you on the next episode
later
