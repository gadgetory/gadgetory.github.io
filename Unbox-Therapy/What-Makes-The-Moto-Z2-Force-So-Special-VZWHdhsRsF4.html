moto z2 force in front of me this in
fact is my first look at any moto mod
capable Motorola device so I'm kind of
excited about that but on top of that
this guy here packs the latest from
Snapdragon 835 one of the unknown
features or at least something that
isn't commonly discussed is the gigabit
LTE capabilities of that processor so
for this video I partnered up with
Snapdragon to go a little bit more in
depth about what gigabit LTE might mean
for you in either the Moto z2 force or
another smartphone that features it we
are looking at the 64 gigabyte super
black version but this unit does feature
expandable storage so theoretically up
to 2 terabytes in the microSD slot so
there it is motorola is stating that
this display right here is shatterproof
not resistant proof and they've done a
number of displays and presentations
where they're dropping the thing
slamming the thing and they can't smash
the screen so that's pretty cool so
there's the device very thin in fact
Jack can pick that up for you there
fingerprint sensor on the front as you
could sell USB type-c with quick charge
also over on the side here we have
volume up/down and a power switch now
this is something that also goes
overlooked this textured power switch is
something that I appreciate when you
reach down in your pocket you can
immediately differentiate between the
power and lock switch and the volume
rockers you don't even need to look at
the device you can just tell by touch
I'm a big fan of that the SIM card tray
is up on the top here there's a dual
lens system capable of a monochrome mode
or a portrait mode so you can blur the
background and get the effect of a large
aperture from traditional photography or
an interchangeable lens system now this
is the fancy part right here it's these
pins this connector at the bottom that
allows you to just slap moto mods on to
the back so whether that's the battery
expansion or the 360 camera that I
mentioned earlier as far as I know
they're one of the only manufacturers
with a system like it USBC to
traditional USB
whoa hello there it's super light
especially for something that's mostly
metallic I think part of that has to do
with the fact that the display this
shatterproof display is actually made
out of a special plastic rather than
glass you have the 1440p display I
believe this is their first device with
a dual land system built in the thing
that still sets this apart from the
other phones that are on the market is
the expansion through moto mods it's
that childhood dream of the modular
smartphone there's everything from
camera attachments to projectors and
I've even got a couple of them over here
it's a battery expansion it just clips
on right like this oh look at that
you've just added extra battery it's
magnetic and it speaks to the device
through this pin system on the bottom
now power is cool but not as cool as
sound this is a lot more sound for your
device fits on just like that now you
can pop out the kickstand and turn up
the volume so there is a kickstand on
the back you can basically stand it like
that now first I'd like to test the
audio without the sound pack on
I didn't even realize this the speaker
for this device is up where the earpiece
is same song let's slap this guy on and
see what happens
okay
now the cool thing here is that previous
generation mods even work with new
equipment so presumably the next version
of this device would still be functional
with these mods with newer mods and so
on you just shake your hand like this to
switch between the forward and
rear-facing camera that's kind of cool
kaboom and now one of the things with
this dual lens system is it features a
monochrome sensor so if I flip over to
black and white it's gonna give me a
more true black and white look with more
contrast it's a much cleaner looking
black and white as well is that slick or
what that's artistic that's borderline
artistic so these two cameras can be
used independently like that for the
monochrome aspect or together these two
lenses can work in conjunction to give
you this portrait effect they're calling
it depth enabled and I grab my focus
where I want it the background is far
more blurry than on this frame here like
look at these chairs over here and the
background all the way down to there is
still in focus if I flip over to the
portrait style you can see how much
softer the elements in the back are and
of course it wouldn't be a phone
unboxing video without a wonderful
selfie of yours truly here we go three
two one so there you go that's my moment
right there doo doo doo doo doo doo yeah
and obviously you're dealing with the
latest from snapdragon here and i told
you at the beginning of this video that
was gonna talk a little bit about
gigabit LTE this of course is the
fastest connection type that you can
currently have to your smartphone from
your cell tower you got extra antennas
in here so even if you're in a busy spot
or a spot where you don't get the best
service or place where you can take
advantage of all that extra bandwidth
it's gonna happen right in here so that
means multimedia I mean streaming it
means VR potentially 360 video anything
that's bandwidth intensive that you are
now doing on your smartphone you want
the best connectivity you can get and
currently this is where it's at so there
you have it the Moto Z 2 with the Moto
mod
and the latest from Snapdragon packed
inside if you want to learn anything

to Qualcomm for partnering up on this
