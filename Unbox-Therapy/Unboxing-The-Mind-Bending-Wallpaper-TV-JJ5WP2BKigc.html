fancy juice over there looks tasty
though man it looks good we need you
down here we got a big TV apparently
otherwise known as wallpaper it is that
time that we will change the landscape
of TVs forever because today Willy do
this is the signature the W TV OLED from
algae wallpaper you never heard about
wallpaper before the a plaster it on the
wall you stuck it there instead of
painting we see that kind of wallpaper
just wouldn't be suitable for an
environment like this for a bunch of
tech savages like us so what do you say
Willie do do we crack into this box or
what do we take this thing out or what
do we hang it on the wall or what let's
go
and then pulldown then they come off
like this oh that's the TV right there
oh man that slim it has been done
the wallpaper TV lives look at this
beautiful setup over here as it blends
in with the picture frames and in fact
this far thinner than any of those
images we have on the wall and of course
far more vibrant as well this thing is
thin it is crazy thin let me show you
the side of it here that pen is what
twice as thick as the TV it's honestly
kind of bizarre at first when you look
at this thing and certainly when you
pick it up as well it's like it's
actually flexible to a certain degree
and because of that the important
components are housing this unit right
here this speaker unit so not only do
you end up with better sound than what
you would traditionally have on a flat
panel TV but all your HDMI USBs and so
on are housed in here and then a single
cable connects the two of them video
signal and power will travel through
this flat cable right here
so it is a 4k panel of course it's OLED
from LG that's kind of their thing now
I've been using their products for a
while you've probably heard me speak
about OLED it has attributes unlike any
other TV tech I mean the dark blacks
right the bright whites the contrast the
saturated colors basically kind of
attached itself magnetically me and and
will do we just kind of like lined it up
it was like both and of course it's a
smart TV as well so you've got
everything built in YouTube that's what
we're watching this on right now these
are firing upwards that's why those
speaker grilles look the way they do
it's bouncing off the surface there it's
got a real virtual surround sound effect
this thing here is more optimized for
that virtual surround kind of scenario
now wait that's some NASA footage tell
you what Oh Lee look at that oh my what
is that the Sun solar flares can you
Jack the vibrance look at the difference
between the black and the bright spot
that's completely pitch black
comparatively pixel for pixel that's
Canon image does an image get better
than that
I mean where do we go from here are we
just transplanted there that would be
too much work
I think this TV costs around $27 a year
to run and I'm in Austria right now
where are you
Jax obviously not in Austria even know
where that is all right guys so what can
I say it's a TV that's thinner than a
pen it's about as thin as I can imagine
a TV being if you haven't looked at an
OLED panel before your eyes will be
impressed
I guarantee it just do it if you don't
believe me there's no stand for it at
all
it's got to be slapped on the wall but
then again with a name like wallpaper
and I designed this thin what would you
be doing putting on a stand anyway huge
shout out to LG for hooking this up
because take a look at the space now
it's finally coming together this place
a bit of disaster then we got this and
it was like hey let's let's wrap it up
so now this entire space look at it
place to hang out get a massage travel
to some other planet or Austria it's all
happening here now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
