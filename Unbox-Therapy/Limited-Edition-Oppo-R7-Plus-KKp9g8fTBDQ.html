this guy is a real deal he's a real deal
this Fisher and I can listen I can go
either way he can't pitch all day though
can't pitch again
what's up guys Lew here back with
another video and today I'm gonna be
checking out what I'm told is a very
special device from a company called
Oppo you're unfamiliar with them they
are a smart phone maker
they've got some fairly sleek stuff that
you may not have seen yet and I'm told
that this is a fine example of such
devices as you can see on the side here
it is the r7 + F the color is golden but
let's get inside the box and let the
product explain itself oh my goodness it
is a box in a box it is the r7 + FC
barcelona edition which i am told is
fairly rare on the back we have a couple
of specs it's got a 6 inch screen 13
megapixel rear camera 8 megapixel front
how about this 4,000 plus milliamp hours
what I love battery
what is this leather looks like leather
so here is the device my goodness oh wow
options ok so you could do two Sims or a
sim and a micro SD look at that FC
Barcelona official partner got the logo
there speakers in this location here the
fingerprint sensor is on the back as you
can see this sort of where your index
finger lines up cameras up here looks
like a dual tone flash as well on the
front of the device
this giant 6 inch display speaker at the
top forward facing camera around the
sides SIM card tray slash microSD tray
also got the power switch in this
location and then on the other side
volume rocker top is where you'll find
your headphone jack as well as what
looks like a microphone and on the
bottom microUSB for charging up the
device now it does appear to have a
screen protector installed I'm told that
this is a glass screen protector I'd
assume this is
movable as well if for whatever reason
you choose not to use it
whoa that's an experience right there
look at that
and each of these little boxes has this
leather like texture to it haven't
really felt cardboard like that before
trust me I've felt a lot of cardboard
and in ear style it looks like fairly
basic headset has a microphone as well
the charger now this is a European
device so you've got a European charger
looks like it's quick charge to a J has
just hit me with the data real quick
five minutes of charging can provide you
with two hours of phone calls now in
this other box whoa
more accessories micro USB cable
substantial cable if I do say so a sim
tool the nano SIM tray as well as a
secondary SIM tray or expansion for
micro SD that right there should be
implemented in all phones why not you
don't have to have a secondary slot
you're going to have to put a sim card
in anyways so why not include storage
expansion in that location as well why
not so I told you about the 13 megapixel
camera on the back you've also got an 8
megapixel camera on the front that's
pretty substantial for a forward facing
camera
lastly they've got a case here so like
we've seen from some other manufacturers
they're giving you some protection if
you choose to use it here's our first
look at the display as well as the OS
this one looks pretty good pretty sharp
so for 1080p you can see the lock screen
here it's like FC Barcelona specific
with the colors as well as the logo down
here the device is very responsive you
guys tell me apparently there's a little
bit of a curve to the device
obviously a huge consideration is the
camera woo so image stabilization on
those photos as well as faster focusing
the laser autofocus you've got Ultra HD
beautify make yourself more beautiful I
should definitely try that one bunch of
filters panorama HDR gif
that's cool audio to go with a photo
double exposure super macro raw get out
of here let's try beautify here's 0%
Beauty this is the way you're used to
seeing me and then a hundred percent
Beauty what am i do it what okay it kind
of makes it look like I'm wearing a
little bit of makeup to be honest with
you
front facing camera video as well as
audio hello you're in the studio now
you're on the rear facing camera
watching me watch you watch me alright
so if you have it
the cameras pretty cool I don't know I
haven't seen what it looks like on a
bigger display yet but I think so far
pretty impressive especially in the
stills Department front-facing camera
was surprising a beauty mode did its
best to make me look pretty
I'd like I'd like you to let me know in
the comments whether you think that
worked or not I should try out the
fingerprint sensor real quick lock it
whew the idea here is like you're not
hitting this switch at all you're just
simply going right on the finger woo
it's fast
here is a 6s plus definitely heavier
footprint wise basically identical as a
trial song
Jack put those tears away all right you
guys get the point yeah I mean it's a
decent speaker it's on the back of the
device is not the perfect location it's
loud enough that's the job
and hey if you buy this device you get
that slick track included and it'll
bring a tear to Jack's eye every single
time just keep that in mind
all right guys that wraps up this video
thank you very much for watching if you
want more information on this device
I'll have all the links down in the
description that's it that wraps it up
thanks very much for watching and I'll
catch you on the next episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
