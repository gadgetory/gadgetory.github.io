therapy and today we're taking a look at
the JBL on beat ven ult the LT stands
for lightning because this is one of the
first wireless speakers it supports the
lightning connector that of course is
the connector that now ships on the iPad
Mini iPad fourth generation iPhone five
the latest iPod touch so anything that
has the lightning connector will not
only function with this speaker but
it'll also get charged up now this
speaker also features bluetooth which
means you can connect with other devices
non I Oh s devices like Android phones
like my Nexus 4 over here so there are
many ways of interfacing with this
speaker in terms of the unboxing fairly
simple fairly straightforward you've got
a little bit of paperwork from JBL
there's a little box which houses is the
power adapter and then of course the
speaker itself and a power cable taking
a closer look at the venue LT you'll
notice it has a streamlined design which
I'm a big fan of and if you're not using
the Lightning connector so if you're not
using an iOS device you can hide this
little tray and actually end up with a
very sleek design and still be able to
interface with the device using
bluetooth as I said earlier as we move
around to the top you'll notice that's
where all the buttons and all the
indicators are you have buttons to
control the amount of base as well as
the input selector volume is up there as
well on the back you have two bass ports
that's always a good sign that always
shows you that you're going to have some
decent bass response coming out of a
speaker and this as I mentioned before
is the power brick fairly portable not a
huge power brick and there's a hook up
to the power cable so you get a decent
amount of extension from the wall on the
top that's where you're going to see all
the buttons so there's a button that
controls bass output as I said earlier
you can go for more bass less bass
whichever is your taste and then there's
a movie button to enhance you know
watching movies on your iPad or
otherwise there's an LED indicator here
which lets you know which mode you have
selected whether it's the 3.5 millimeter
auxiliary jack on the back Bluetooth or
the lightning connector the power button
is to the right of the device and this
is also where you'll find the always
important volume rocker so you can
increase and decrease the volume in that
location what I do like here is that the
lightning
vector is spring-mounted so you know you
can be a little bit more rough with it
not worry about it snapping off the back
is where you'll find the auxilary input
that i mentioned earlier and here's a
closer look at one of those bass ports
so let's go ahead and put in iphone 5
into the venue LT and get an idea of
just how it sounds after all this is a
speaker and I I try to do my best to
give you guys an idea of how the music
is represented it is difficult to
portray through a youtube video but
nonetheless I will attempt to do so so
this is a zoom h2n which is one of my
favorite audio recording devices very
high fidelity so I'm going to hit the
record button here and then I'm going to
hit play on one of my favorite tracks in
my SoundCloud and you guys can get an
idea of how this thing sounds
so hopefully you guys can tell through
that little demo what this speaker is
capable of it's definitely got room
filling sound in a surprising amount of
low-end and bass for portable unit so
guys are interested in getting a
portable speaker a wireless speaker
either use with Bluetooth or with your
brand new generation iPhone iPad or
otherwise this is definitely worth
looking at if guys are interested in
pricing and availability check out the
link down in the description I'll give
you all the details you need to know on
the JBL on beat venue LT hey guys thanks
as always for watching and i'll catch
you on the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
