therapy I hope you enjoyed that dramatic
introduction if you did leave a thumbs
up down below as you can tell this video
is dedicated to the gerber apocalypse
kit which is a set of blades designed
and engineered to protect you in a time
of crisis or zombie apocalypse for that
matter so let's go ahead and take a look
at each blade and I'll give you guys
some more details on what each one does
so first you've got the Gator machete
which is probably my favorite of the
bunch this thing is practically a sword
you have a sharp edge on one side and
then a serrated edge on the other which
could be used for sawing things there is
a nice rubberized handle for a great
grip so you can get some powerful swings
in with this particular one next you
have the camp axe 2 and when this thing
isn't doing damage to a zombie
it actually works quite good for
chopping wood or on a campsite hence the
name camp axe to actually all of the
items in this kit can be purchased
independently or as the complete
apocalypse kit I'll do my best to link
everything down in the description so
you can check out pricing and
availability whether you're buying an
independent tool in this particular set
or the whole set so as you guys can tell
this is a pretty standard fair camping
axe but it is pretty light too because
it has a hollow handle but very strong
feeling still it doesn't feel like it's
flimsy or anything like that next we
have the most gruesome looking weapon
this is the Gator machete Pro so first
you saw the Gator machete this one is
the pro and it has a number of edges on
it or a couple of edges one of them
looks particularly gruesome as I said
earlier that curved edge on the top but
the larger one is actually on the front
side like a traditional machete you have
the same rubberized handle coming
through on this one it's a little bit
shorter though than the Gator machete so
I'm thinking here listen if I'm battling
zombies I want the most range that I can
get that's why I'm personally a big fan
of the Gator machete as a
to the gaiter machete Pro this one here
is called the parang and it has a bit of
a curve to the blade this is a more
traditional jungle tool for clearing
brush and things like that but it also
is weighted really nicely the balance is
great on this thing a very comfortable
handle this one has some orange accents
on it because it was pulled from the
bear grylls lineup for Gerber I really
wish that it matched the rest of the set
in terms of design and appearance that
being said this is my second favorite
weapon in the lineup because I'm looking
for those long-range devices as I said
before so you could stay away from all
that nasty zombie Ness next we have
probably the most practical knife or
second most practical knife in the setup
this is the LMF to infantry which is a
combat blade it's really weighted quite
nicely and it's solid this thing feels
incredibly strong you could also wrap it
to a stick and turn it into a spear or
something like that that's why you have
those two little holes in there so that
you could tie this to a stick if need be
but a very nice knife it also comes with
a pretty cool case but it isn't foldable
or anything the next one actually is
which is the DMF folder it also has a
clip on one side of it this in terms of
practicality is probably the most
practical knife in the setup it seems
small after handling all the other
blades in this kit but it's actually
still fairly large it's got a manual
opening mechanism so there are no
Springs meaning is probably going to be
more durable it's also deployable with
one hand so you don't have to reach you
know and use your other hand to open it
up it's ambidextrous meaning it can be
opened with your left or right hand and
it's also got a modified clip point or
tanto blade as the website states this
is a pretty cool looking knife for
day-to-day use anything you might want
to use a knife for take with you
outdoors camping etc the next blade is
called the epic this one's kind of
interesting it's got a unique shape to
it a very nice balance you've also got a
bottle opener on this one so that's kind
of unique and the blade is coated in a
type of titanium meaning that it should
be very resilient against things like
water and grime and things that would
normally rust out or damage a blade so
anyway guys that wraps up the entire set
the apocalypse kit from Gerber
guys are interested in pricing and
availability check out all the links
down in the description also if you
would like to see a damage test you know
you want me to go all fruit ninja on
some watermelon let me know by hitting
that thumbs up button and maybe we'll
get around to making a damage video I
think that would be pretty cool anyway
guys thanks as always for watching and
I'll catch you on the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
