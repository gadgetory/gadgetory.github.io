another heavily requested video this is
a follow up to the top 5 amazon WTF
items I had you guys send in to me the
craziest things that you could find on
Amazon and a few of the items didn't
make the initial video because they were
a little bit too crazy that's what this
video right here is for these are the
top 5 super what the items on Amazon so
let's get started with item number 5
this is the passion natural water based
lubricant 55 gallon size and it is the
ultimate Lube keg what you're looking at
here is a $1200 container of lubricant
and it's also the best value according
to this listing here I have no idea why
you would need this much Lube but the
comments are hilarious on this thing so
you have to go and read them next is
item number 4 this is the disaster bag /
body bag and it's available to you by
the company all mortuary Funeral and
Cremation supplies I don't know why I'm
laughing
I shouldn't be laughing about it should
I
I guess is for people who are buying
their mortuary
supplies on Amazon and I just got a kick
out of the fact that I guess Amazon is
so huge that yeah like those people are
buying their stuff there too you know so
you get an Amazon box with a body bag
this is number three number three
I'm just gonna read it word for word how
to goodbye
depression if you constrict anus 100
times every day malarkey or effective
way it's written by hero you coud Nishi
gaki it looks like one of those funny
translation type books and I'm actually
considering tree research if you go
ahead over there and read the comments
or the review story you're gonna get a
laugh for sure because people have
quoted some of the most hilarious lines
from the book or translations or
whatever you want to call it and yeah
that's a blast check that out this is
item number two we're on number two now
large vinyl gender-neutral Asian ships
and sold by wizard of math this is a
gender-neutral Asian baby doll not sure
why it needs to be identified as
gender-neutral and anyways 4495 gets you
this incredibly realistic vinyl doll I
personally wouldn't trust anyone who
purchases this or the reviews are funny
again more funny reviews here we go with
item number five four three two one
this is the most super what the item on
all of Amazon remember all these things
are sent in by you guys so you guys are
the real creeps not me
natural harvest a collection of semen
based recipes the paperback
I don't know if this is real or if
the whole intent here is to like troll
people or sell this to people that are
trying to have a joke but anyways this
is a real book that you can buy a
paperback book a collection of semen
based recipes if you don't know what
that is Google is your friend but you're
probably gonna regret it and once again
an absolute blast can be had oh all
right
