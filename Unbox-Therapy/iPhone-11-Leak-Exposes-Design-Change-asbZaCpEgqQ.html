regarding what might be the next iPhone
as you can see in the back here these
leaks have existed for a little while
now of this strange camera array on the
back of what looks like an iPhone so at
first you know usually happens with your
typical leaks you get renders from
people that are based on rumors and
possibly schematics if available in
order to insinuate what the next version
of a particular device might look like
or some kind of unreleased device well
today we have a new schematic which
points in the direction of this
particular design being a possible
reality a potential reality this is the
schematic right here and what you can
see is that it has a very particular
cutout in the metal component that would
make up the back piece of the device and
that cutout indicates a design like this
it indicates multiple cameras on the
back beyond what we've currently seen on
iPhones as they exist today now as you
know you've been following the
smartphone game the mega camera setups
on the back of flagship smartphones have
become the thing I'm using this guy
right here this is the galaxy s 10
that's a triple camera setup on the back
recently took a look at the p30 Pro from
Huawei
that's a quad camera setup on the back
so there is definitely a contest going
on in the flagship smartphone space for
packin cameras into smartphones actual
lenses that can do different things it's
an area where Apple has been a bit slow
to evolve that said that looks to change
potentially with the next version of
iPhone so what might you ask for what
might you get with these extra cameras
well the obvious one would be another
aspect and another viewpoint another
perspective which could be delivered
potentially through a wide-angle lens
it's a feature that exists on this
Samsung it exists on other devices
include
that Huawei p30 that I recently
mentioned although this cutout that
Apple's doing looks more like the mate
series from Huawei than the new p30 but
nonetheless a feature like that a wide
angle allowing you to capture a more of
a frame it could be useful for
architecture it can be useful for
capturing a group especially in a small
space where you can't back up any
further to put more into the frame at
least I hope that's what one of these
cameras will represent for the next
generation iPhone now as you know
smartphone sales have kind of slowed
down a bit especially at the flagship
level the Samsung Galaxy S 10 appears to
be a bit of an unusual case where it was
recently released at a high price point
and according to Samsung it's seen some
degree of success which is kind of
unusual or at least unexpected from
certain analysts given the fact that the
marketplace has softened up a bit now
what can you equate that to is it the
camera setup on the back is it possibly
this whole punch in the OLED display is
it a whole package deal where people on
a Samsung side waiting for something to
happen
we don't really know but this arms race
happening in the smartphone space at the
flagship level doesn't appear to be
slowing down and if Apple wants to
remain competitive against brands like
Samsung and like Huawei which by the way
that rounds out the top three smartphone
manufacturers then they're gonna have to
do some things that are obvious and as
much as this type of innovation here
with adding more cameras into the phone
as much as that gives you a functional
outcome where you can do more and take
different types of photos what's
important with these smartphones as
they've become an extension and
representation of us and our tastes is
that you want to pull it out you want to
hold it up and say I got the fresh one
you want the device itself to say hey
I'm the fresh one at least for a certain
segment a certain group of clientele and
that's what this thing will do whether
you like it hate it think it looks good
or ugly it will immediately tell people
that you have
the brand-new factory fresh and likely
very expensive iPhone next generation so
this is looking more feasible now based
on this particularly Kisan this
schematic along side with the other
rumors coming from reliable leakers and
the various sources reporting on this
now I think we can safely say that the
next generation of iPhone is going to
have a different camera layout than the
current version and likely an extra
camera built into it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
