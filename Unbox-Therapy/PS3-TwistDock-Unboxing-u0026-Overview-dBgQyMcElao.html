today we're taking a look at the twist
dock for your ps3 this is a docking
solution which allows you to stand your
ps3 upright and make it a much cleaner
looking console overall here's a power
adapter which has the european-style
power leads on it and we've also got a
United Kingdom adapter since we imported
it from the United Kingdom we're
obviously gonna have to get our own
North American plug to make this thing
usable here's the adapter plates those
fit into your controllers here is the
ps3 original stand and the ps3 slim
version this will accommodate both
models next we're going to get to the
docking station itself and the only
thing that surprised me here is that
it's a little bit lighter than what I
expected that's not such a big deal
because once the ps3 is on here I'm sure
that's going to make it more sturdy
because of the weight so as we spin it
around we see a couple of USB ports
those are powered of course they can be
used to charge any USB device including
two more controllers that's how the
system pivots you can also use that hole
on the bottom to feed your cables
through to make the entire installation
a lot cleaner here is how the adapter
plate fits onto your controller the
intention here is that you leave it
connected so you're not constantly
fiddling with USB cables you simply clip
the controller into the back of the dock
and it can live there while you're not
using it overall this is a much cleaner
solution here's what the ps3 looks like
when it's mounted in the dock anyway
check out
channel we got a lot more to look at</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
