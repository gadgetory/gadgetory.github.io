Falls New York
as you can see yep got the wonderful
neighborhood here but the reason I'm
here is because of a cool company called
CBI
CBI USA and who they are they basically
receive packages for you on your behalf
for products that can't get shipped to
Canada as you guys know I'm based out of
the Toronto area and so with the Kindle
Fire which I just picked up it wasn't
gonna get shipped up there it's not even
available in Canada yet so what you can
do is get it shipped to this guy's
address yeah I'll give you a better look
get it shipped to his address right over
here zoom it in and what he'll do is
hold the package for you charge you a
nominal fee it's about five bucks per
package and great value as far as I'm
concerned and you can you can get
products that aren't available in Canada
so if you're in Canada definitely check
this guy out there's there's the Kindle
Fire right there
look at that Kindle Fire anyways I'll
get that baby home get it unboxed yes
that's probably gonna take me a couple
hours so I'll see you guys soon
later so we just got back from Buffalo
it's a little bit late and here's here's
the treasure here's the prizes how we
picked up on our journey of course as
you guys know the Kindle Fire that's the
main item we went down there for we also
got the moto active that's that Motorola
watch that runs a little bit of Android
pretty cool stuff it it can show your
caller ID your text messages it also
does some fitness tracking and stuff
like that and on top of that we got the
the sports wrist strap believe or not
doesn't come with it so we picked that
up to go along with the actual moto
active they're not cheap I mean the Moto
active the watch is worth two hundred
and fifty bucks plus another twenty-nine
for the strap so you got to be serious
about that stuff we've also got the the
mobi charger it's a charger for your
Magic Mouse
so that you don't got to keep replacing
batteries you just stick it on top of
that cradle you're talking about that
soon and then of course we've got some
Assassin's Creed stuff as well as the
official game guide we have this this
particular Ultimate Edition which is a
little bit different than the other
Ultimate Edition that includes the
action figures this one instead includes
an art book and some other items so
definitely you're going to want to stay
tuned for that video check out this
special collector's or Ultimate Edition
whatever the hell you want to call it
and then lastly get this cool thing as
well which is called the seal sleep
manager which is like a an alarm clock
but it does some really cool stuff it
tracks the the quality of your sleep you
know the type of sleep that you get
that's called REM sleep you know so that
in that basically it can I don't know if
it looks at your brain activity or your
movement while sleeping but really cool
nonetheless I got problems sleep I don't
sleep enough it also tells you the
quality based on how much you move
around based on how much coffee you
drank all kinds of cool shit a very cool
thing to stick beside your bed take
control of your sleep so another cool
product that we're gonna we're gonna
stick on a channel so you guys let me
know what should I unbox first probably
a Kindle Fire right Kindle Fire or maybe
assassin's creed I don't know you guys
tell me lots of cool stuff here stay
tuned to the channel it's all coming up
