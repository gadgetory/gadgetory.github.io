it walks like a duck and it quacks like
a duck it's probably a duck
this ain't a lamp though it just looks
like one so your wife doesn't yell at
you
inside this lamp is something called
beam which is a projector that looks
like a light bulb I know I'm gonna break
it down for you that's what you've got
me for see that right there send out an
image project a really large image but
when it's not in use kind of just fold
it down and it's no big deal but that's
not the whole story this beam projector
could go into any light fixture so maybe
you have a kitchen table scenario with
the light hanging over you stick one of
these bad boys in there all of a sudden
what are you doing you're watching
YouTube with breakfast rotate to more
than 180 degrees to project on floors
walls or ceilings you ever seen me lying
in bed I'd be watching basketball on the
ceilings let's crack this open does it
say anything else here that's about it
whoa
cool this is the actual beam fits into
any light socket see that's the scenario
I'm talking about leave a note for your
friend place it on its side project the
weather or use it as a regular light
unbelievable screw it in and have fun
you hear that Jack screw it in I like
the packaging as well kind of tight whoa
look at that whoa projector in the
middle light on the outside speaker unit
in here I assume this is how you're
gonna focus the image depending on where
you have it set up oh you're gonna have
a lot of people fooled they'll be
sitting at your table you'll be having a
few drinks or something and they'll be
like oh yeah bring up that video oh I'll
just throw it on there
I'll throw it on the light bulb it's a
tent oh wow they give you your very own
wall power to light socket scenarios so
it has one flat side so it can sit like
that look it's just a little movie
theater you can move it around beam has
a button to switch between the different
modes or tree pressing a button will
switch between the standby mode the
light mode the projection mode and then
back to the standby mode you're gonna
have an experience watching something on
the ceiling like no TV taking up any
room everybody just thought that it was
a lamp and then she goes James Bond
style and throws it up there that's
straight down boom up on the wall you're
projecting what do you think Jack pretty
cool or what very nice okay look at this
whoa just like a full Android scenario
here on your phone or tablet download
the beam remote once it whoa we got it
and now this turns into a touchpad oh I
got a mouse whoa okay I can rotate the
display from here I can have a touchpad
I can have a keyboard and I can have a
keypad I can turn it on to the light
look at this I can't
the light on switch back to the
projector and then I did the projector
back wow this is bizarre oh the speakers
terrible yeah that's a full-on Android
device
so whatever Bluetooth speaker you have
in your house you just connected here
it's like remotely controlling another
Android device which happens to have a
projection display as you just had that
projecting on the wall in the morning or
something kind of nice hey raining every
day is raining every day there we go
or do we PTP is it me or is it kind of
slow woohoo
did you ever think you'd be playing
Angry Birds on a lamp this life-changing
moment brought to you by Allah whose
intent hey he's not the most powerful
Android device in the planet the
distance that you are from the surface
you're projecting onto well of course
determine the size of your image and the
quality of it so being close up close to
the surface means the pixels from the
projector will be more tightly knit and
you'll probably have a little bit more
brightness but you end up with a smaller
image point it up
so there you have it a beam light socket
projector slash light slash Android
device maybe you have a light fixture
there and you have a boring light bulb
in it why not mix it up go with this guy
right here
it'll be your little secret</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
