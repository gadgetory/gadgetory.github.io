slightly different video than usual for
you guys I'm gonna be taking a fresh
iPad right here and throwing it out the
window behind me and right about now
you're saying wait Lou don't do it I
don't want to have to watch unnecessary
iPad destruction well here's the key I
don't think it's going to be destroyed
it's wearing the latest OtterBox
Defender Series case which works for the
new iPad as well as the iPad 2 and I
really want to put it through its paces
you know I want to show you guys what
this thing can do now I haven't done
this before
so I don't know for sure if it's going
to survive but this is a 100% honest
test and study for the purpose of
insight for you guys so I'm going to do
two different throws the first one onto
the grass area of my backyard from two
stories up the next one onto the patio
stones which is likely going to be a
little bit more gruesome but that's the
true test if this thing can drop onto
concrete from 2 stories up then you're
probably never going to have any issues
with breaking it in regular everyday
life so without wasting any more your
time let's get to it hopefully we don't
have death of an iPad here the death of
an iPad as you can see it's fully
functioning at the moment I'll give you
a closer look at that in a second I'm
also going to turn on the rear facing
camera so that you can get a sense for
what it would feel like to drop from 2
stories up if you were an iPad getting
thrown around alright guys let's get to
it alright before we get started I just
want to show you guys it's a fully
functioning iPad you can see that the
touch screen is working the camera is
functioning here I'm going to leave the
camera on so you can catch a free fall
from the iPads perspective so here we go
let's start the record we're good to go
now we got to put the front hard portion
of the OtterBox case on to protect the
screen
this of course ships with the Defender
Series as you guys know if you checked
out my Defender Series video just clips
on like that and we're good to go let's
go ahead and toss it out there see if I
could pitch a strike are you ready okay
so here we go three two one
one
looks like it'll be okay take a quick
look here see if it's still record Oh
check it out it's still recording video
can you guys see that yeah so there you
go still working but that's just the
first test because now it's time to go
on the patio stones and see what this
thing can really do give me a second
okay so now we're going to take it up a
notch I'm going to take the same iPad
that I just retrieved and toss it onto
the patio stones in the backyard
once again fully functioning fully
working I got the camera back on again
we're going to record this this could be
the death who knows but I'm hoping it
survives if it does this is one hell of
a case all right guys I can put that
front cover back on now ready to go
ready just make sure it's still
recording yeah okay here we go three two
one
all right
well that was a big bag man so you can
see the front cover came right off and I
package - recording check that out
what's up guys look at that what's up
guys look at that amazing so it's a
legit case I guess it's worth a little
bit of money it's gonna protect your
investment big time alright guys catch
on the next one subscribe later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
