goodness you guys have been shouting at
me on Twitter Lou you got to get your
hands on this guy right here everyone's
talking about it the oneplus killer
it's from Xiaomi it's called the Polka
phone a budget phone but the crazy part
about this phone the specs are not
budget at all this is the global version
that I have right here and this is where
things get spicy snapdragon 845 liquid
cooling system dual camera setup with a
20 megapixel front-facing camera four
thousand milliamp hour battery dual SIM
built-in what would you be willing to
pay for something like that well let me
blow your mind this thing is supposed to
start at 299 299 dollars maybe that does
have a shot maybe that is the oneplus
killer because of course as you know the
oneplus device around 500 bucks that's a
bit of a gap if it can deliver on the
expectations it might be just the go to
phone in general I don't know let's go
ahead and crack this open I just I just
noticed mind says f1 armored edition see
that Jack right there we'll find out in
a moment here so first things first we
have the device they've included a case
as well kaboom and a nice texture I'm a
big fan of that texture it's got some
grip to it no fingerprints unlike the
glossy finishes that we're seeing on so
many devices circular fingerprint
scanner if I'm being honest here you
might confuse the lens unit for the
fingerprint scanner let's see here all
right USB type-c on the bottom here
along with your speaker unit a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on the top in
the Box we have a quick charge power
brick once again that quick charge 3.0 a
Type C cable to charge it up SIM card
tool right there okay my first
impressions on the build quality the
thing feels solid really do just
clarified the back panel here is made
out of aramid Kevlar fiber and it's cool
that someone's putting it straight onto
a phone and not just in a case okay so
we're gonna set up the fingerprint
scanner here here we go
I'm gonna scan my finger in here so the
display is six point one eight inches
its LCD IPS so it should have pretty
good color reproduction
quick comparison here P 20 pro on this
side which is an AMOLED display and then
we have the LCD in the left hand on the
f1 and you know I mean you see how the
OLED stays more vibrant at different
viewing angles but dead on it's a
toss-up right let's launch the cameras
here let's get a couple prophets on the
desk here Jack's favorite action figure
big fight coming up just in the standard
mode we have three different items feels
pretty quick off the bat what do you say
Jack your boy Connors not looking too
shabby okay so the dual lens setup is 12
megapixels and 5 megapixels and then the
front camera is 20 megapixels try out
this portrait mode focus in on him he's
actually it's a little blurry behind him
it kind of grabbed the edge pretty
decently right around the hairline and
it looks pretty decent even with this
this fake little dude here 20 megapixel
selfie camera is what they are saying
and we're looking for detail we're
looking for beard hairs ooh
Jack Attack what do you say about that
Ryan can you count some beard hairs come
over here Ryan
come on in and say hello Ryan is in
Toronto
oh I didn't think you're gonna have me
on I didn't think I was either I don't
know you got me fired up there
that's a front-facing camera hey I have
to compare it looks good though not that
yeah I mean it's sharp dude yeah that's
pretty good it looks better than I look
in real life it's pretty good it's a lot
of detail it's good right that's good
you don't expect this for $2.99 starting
price
I haven't had nowhere near the number of
tweets about a particular device the bad
boys it's kind of like the phone I have
with the case right now right but you
don't need a case if you drop this it's
still gonna be okay I mean don't go
dropping it right but if you do drop it
$2.99 I would use it the build feel
solid yeah just my times down here folks
oh there he goes and he goes back to
Calgary and who knows if we'll see when
when and if we'll see him again by the
way this is a good time to test the
fingerprint now that it's law three two
one three two one Oh
three two one ah tell you something
I don't think they skimped on that now
you guys know I care about the speaker
if i cover up this unit right here you
still hear a little treble out of the
earpiece section okay hold up P 20 Pro
let's go real quick remember P 20 Pro
much higher price point the P 20 Pro
sounds better okay fine
right there's more depth I think it kind
of lands actually right where I expected
I'm even iPhone sounds better than that
do we have an iPhone okay under this
bunch I'm gonna say the iPhone 10 sounds
the best but not only is it on fair
price why is this also just like it's
not a huge it's not a massive gap you
would have thought they would have skimp
even further he would have thought
there's a possibility that it could have
sounded even worse at this particular
price point he's my first exposure to
this brand to this device I have to say
it's impressive right now at this price
point I hear you I know why you guys
were yelling at me to look at this thing
now stuff is happening this phone
matters we got a rearrange our thought
process on this stuff and these other
devices are coming out of the thousand
plus it's like are they really that much
better better enough snapdragon a four
five six gigs of ram and various storage
options starting at 300 bucks
four thousand milliamp hour battery with
quick charge 3.0 starting at 300 bucks
six inch plus display not OLED but not
ugly
starting at 300 bucks fingerprint
scanner which is quick and a camera
which I have to say I'm a bit surprised
by I'm kind of buying into the hype a
little bit right now and I don't do that
very often if you want me to use this
thing more extensively I could do a
challenge I can throw a sim in and we
can figure out where this industry's
going like how good is this at this
price point does it change the game
enough to make you think twice about
buying a premium phone at a premium
price
