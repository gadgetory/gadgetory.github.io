unbox therapy first names Cassio last
name g-shock the model is called the G
7900 a - four and as you'll see in a
minute it's in a very special color is
the ten that it comes in so you can see
it's water-resistant to 200 meters like
most each ox first things first we see
our documentation warranty card users
guide you know the drill some more
precautionary details it's just a watch
what you need to read about it for this
is what we came for we didn't come here
to see some paper so as you can see it's
in a reddish orange color more red than
orange with some black accents and some
might consider it a little too flashy
but me I just think it stands out you
know buttons feel good here they're
oversized and I guess the whole watch
might be considered oversized but it's
definitely not the biggest g-shock out
there here you can see it mounted on my
wrist and I consider myself to have an
average sized wrist in hand maybe maybe
a little bit larger than average but
this should fit most people I don't
think you should shy away from it and
here it is a size comparison against my
vessel this model is called the observer
and obviously it's a different style of
watch but the face size is actually
pretty similar and here are some macro
close-up shots of the g-shock getting up
close you can get a sense for the
contrast of the LCD and we'll just take
you around the construction on the
underside of the wrist
you can see that there are some
extension pieces that help distribute
the weight around your wrists making a
watch even more comfortable than
previous G shocks I mean that's really
what these watches are about comfort and
ruggedness straightforward utilitarian
coolness check out the channel</div></body></html>
