be like at what point did somebody say
see that little thing over there now
you're kissing just get to it and
everyone was like you know what he's got
a point let's go with that anyways it's
been a while and I missed you guys
seriously so I went on Twitter and I
said hey how about three cool tech deals
the holidays are over maybe you got some
new gadgets some new cool stuff and you
need some more cool stuff to go with
that cool stuff for example some storage
everything from transcend is on sale
right now but only for this day December
30th
so that means SD cards 64 gig SD cards
for 15 bucks you got micro SD s as well
starting at 14 bucks for 64 gigs or 128
gig micro SD for 42 bucks basically all
the transcend stuff is on sale even the
SSDs so you can get a one terabyte SSD
for 240 $4.99 everything's on sale I
told you all of it there's even a one
terabyte Thunderbolt solid-state drive I
didn't even know transcend made that
Thunderbolt SSD for 431 very nice hmm
this one this is a little bit different
it's for a certain type of person the
real gadget enthusiast the ability to
charge all of your gadgets I mean all of
them in one place and there you can see
four of them plugged in so it could be a
tablet could be a bunch of smartphones I
use something similar to this I've
posted pictures on Instagram and
everyone went crazy
crazy - from Griffin and it's far more
expensive so when I saw this I was like
hmm kind of interesting this one's 99
bucks used to be 200 now there is
another version as well
now what this one does is it puts a
giant lock and door on the front so if
there are pause in your presence I might
like to get their hands on some tech
this thing here is a way to I guess stop
that from happening why is it 599
dollars now this is the one that's on
sale with the a/c out
let's as opposed to the USB ports this
is kind of crazy if you go with the USB
ports it's 600 bucks right now you go
with the AC outlet switch I see light
because then you could charge other
things like laptops and whatnot in here
it's 150 original price four hundred
there's like a power strip built right
into the thing along with the different
trays for putting your various gadgets
in there this seems like a weird thing
to get excited about but like I'm saying
if you're one of these people then
you're one of these people headphones
I'm always talking about headphones but
there's a reason it's because I love
them these are some of my favorites in
the world right now I've talked about
them before and they are cheap right now
they are 88 dollars of 41 percent
savings sixty two dollars off these
things are 150 bucks and they're
relatively new so it's surprising to see
them this cheap Bluetooth NFC fantastic
sound they're lightweight portable I
travel with these all the time the MDR Z
X 770 BT man Sony's got some they got
some wild product names there's an extra
base version which are kind of popular
they're 200 bucks for me these ones at
88 that's the value point last this
thing is kind of wacky I'll be honest
with you
it's kind of an honorable mention I
don't even know how to pronounce this
product name that doubts doubts doubts
this is for the person that is is
dedicated to smartphone photography in a
way that is possibly unhealthy a person
who refuses to get themselves a
standalone camera but wants to be like
all the cool kids and have some pretty
serious interchangeable lenses what is
this it's a four to twelve times zoom
lens it's on sale right now it's about
50 bucks zoom and focus ring it'll work
with the iPhone 6 success 6 plus or 6s
plus those cases are included in the
case actually holds up the lens but look
at that I mean that's just I mean out of
that it looks funny funny in all the
right ways this will be good for an
episode of does it suck you got it you
didn't even ask for it but you got it
coming up on does it suck in say no
lens adapter for the iPhone stay tuned

tech deals plus a WTF moment as you've
