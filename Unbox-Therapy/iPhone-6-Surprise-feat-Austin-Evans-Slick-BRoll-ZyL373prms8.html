widest Media Group and III doing some
awesome biz dev stuff Wow sounds
important man who's up next
I'm Austin I make cool videos who said
they're cool
I said yeah good enough for me
my name is Luke - yay also known as
slick PC I'm taking part of a sleep
deprivation project and last but not
least Brandon Lee I work for Linus tech
tips as a shooter in there today
cool all right so the reason that we're
sitting in the lobby right now is
because I want to get you guys reaction
to something very special oh no it's not
that good it's not that good you
probably seen them already before but I
got these here and they were shipped to
me a while back and you can probably
tell what they are you probably seen
these around the internet but those are
dummies of what the next iPhone might
look like and so what work no respect
here's the brand new president
this is not official in any way these
are fabricated usually by case companies
that are looking to get so the some of
them do some of them are a little bit
weird but anyways the idea here is that
this will be the form factor for the 4.7
inch iPhone 6
okay let me take that out yeah well
that's that's a big that's a big thing
though right when we're trying to figure
out the ideal size for a phone is it's
not the same for everyone yeah you know
you have to take that into consideration
now there's another rumor that there's
gonna be an even bigger version a 5.5
inch version which a lot of people will
think it's too large but then there's so
many people rockin the note which is
been 5.7 like on the side that pretty
much is perfectly like where your where
your thumb would be where like like a
lot of phones like the HTC One it's huge
and it's not the power button up top
which is silly that is now that makes
sense that's just been a lot my personal
squeeze sore my main squeeze that like
say though it's that first thing power
is gonna make me go oh yeah that's right
with my hand at least I don't know if
that's proper lab pro base but if I'm
holding the phone like I'm only a home
phone pressing power is that squeezed
gonna go so that's something that annoys
me a lot that's one of the reasons why I
liked the LG G
as the volume button thrown the back
everything was on backside and I
something pressing said you know that's
a problem well I said big herb besides a
business yeah so one thing I've always
hated about I phones is that they're so
sad and like all the sides of just like
they're like there we go square corners
that you're grabbing something that
doesn't really the your head is not
meant to be yeah like hitting it just a
sharp corner and the iPhones already
small so it's it's like grabbing
something that just feels like lots well
so many phones now there they have these
like curved lot like they went with the
nice flat back with in the sides are
curved so that your hand can actually
wrap around it you haven't been a better
grip the amount of times I've seen
someone drop an iPhone out of there yeah
because of the fact that it's just okay
now so I think something that's been a
bit of a sticking point if you flip that
one over are these lines you see the
white lines there's some there's a
thinking right now that those are gonna
be the antennas and that they look a
little bit strange that some some people
don't think that they're the most
beautiful design
yeah I don't necessary think the most
beautiful but they can do something with
the color in terms of that this this
yeah it I'm assuming this is mostly just
for case design so like it might might
not be that that white no definitely but
even some of the leaks that are coming
out now of what look like actual back
casings they include the line yeah so
does that bother you very much because
I'm not rocking in case right now about
Austin rocker case if you're getting
like a bumper or something is powerful
very possibly good-looking on camera a
camera even for truth oh just of just a
tiny bit and also are you guys getting
any kind of sense of the HTC One in this
device it's thinner though it's much
that it's definitely thinner for this
guy the same kind of curved edges and
kind of I kind of feel like a man which
is nice however you just want to this
that is possible that's true boy is the
foam just any paper okay so here's a big
question now that you guys have looked
at them well first of all what phones
are you using right now we'll start over
here use a normal black pretty basic
case on it Nexus 5 well we know this
although I preferred my g2 is just an
unfortunate story Moto X 5s right now 5s
X Nexus 5 now will a bigger iPhone tempt
you guys to move in that direction yes
or no starting yeah that's a big
surprise there you have it you heard it
here first
big iphone not changing anybody's minds
out here in LA yeah and just just some
of that the box you put yourself in but
you do feel that the current generation
iPhone is too small right yeah so
they're gonna sell a lot of these like
something we talked about earlier later
was the Instagram issue is a huge
problem and I've heard a lot of people
talking about like zombies right it's an
app that I use all the time and I've
heard that the iPhone experience is a
lot better
instagrams having issues I find it's
gonna freak out me but I find the Google
now support is honestly not holding me
that's actually not a good thing it's
not as good as it probably should be
trying to wake it up right now
okay Google now what's up
hopefully nothing super person it's
going in the video it didn't even it
failed so he decided to Google what's up
instead of actually you know what's up
surgery which is the perfect example
yeah cool that's what it looks like
you've probably seen this on the
interwebs in other places previously but
yeah thanks for the feedback and like I
said before you heard it here not
changing anybody's minds apples got to
do more than just make a bigger screen
or put a bigger screen into a device to
convince these people thank you very
much guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
