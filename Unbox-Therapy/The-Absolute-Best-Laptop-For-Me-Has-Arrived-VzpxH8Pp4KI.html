searching for the perfect laptop I've
been having a lot of fun trying to zero
in on the ultimate laptop for me
personally based on what I do most of
the time figuring out what's important
to me I've talked a lot about this model
right here the x1 carbon from Lenovo and
what I like about it
mostly starting with the keyboard for me
that's all the laptop is it's like a
keyboard and a screen that's where it
all starts
yeah it's 9c if it's a little bit more
powerful it's nice if it some nice form
factor if it's light and all the rest of
it but the reason I'm reaching for a
laptop these days over some other device
like a tablet or a smartphone is because
I want to type something a lot of the
times and I want a tactile kind of
control I couldn't find another keyboard
anywhere close to this one at that form
factor right there you get a look at it
look at this thing holds all the way up
it's a big improvement over a lot of the
chiclet style keyboards that exist in
the world in my personal opinion me
personally I came from MacBooks many
different eras of MacBooks I own every
single version up until the latest one I
guess I kind of just accepted those
keyboards then when they started to fail
that's what motivated this change to go
looking for the ultimate keyboard which
then led me to my picture of what the
ultimate laptop would be but this thing
pad this x1 carbon on the top once I
determined that I really liked this
laptop that it was going to be my choice
my selection for the daily laptop I was
like I want to customize one to my exact
specification instead of this one and
that's where this box comes in right
here so this model in front of me is an
x1 carbon but customized to be the
ultimate perfect laptop and you can see
that identified here in this long list
of customization so 1.9 gigahertz i7
it's got 16 gigs of RAM which is the
maximum for this particular laptop that
well that model over there was 8 this
one also has mobile antenna so you can
put a SIM card in here and remain
connected at all times
oh also this is a bit of an experiment
this could be risky but the model inside
of here is a silver model it's grey in
color which is kind of
t think pad but one of the things that I
didn't like so much about the
matte-black model is it does get smudgy
it gets finger prints on so I wanted to
try out this silver version which is
kind of crazy because they are putting
out a 7th generation of this laptop very
shortly and it's gonna have a carbon
fiber weave and I think they're getting
rid of this color so if I end up liking
this color it might not be for long
the wqhd display whereas the model
that's sitting over there was just 1080p
now of course my main curiousness at
this point is relating to the color
since the standard matte black is like
the legendary ThinkPad thing and I don't
know maybe I'll end up hating the silver
it's a bit of a risk especially on a
custom config also I will say I got a
coupon for this when I ordered this so I
actually got a fair amount of money off
so if you do order a pink pad directly
even a custom one there's typically some
decent coupons floating around I think I
say like 500 bucks on this custom one so
keep that in mind
unboxing experience I've done this
before with the last one this is so cool
see how it lifts up like that big fan of
that is such a cool presentation baked
into the box it's like they knew they
were gonna be on unbox therapy with this
they didn't know that but it you know
it's striking to have something with an
industrial design like this that feels
as solid as this that's still this light
like to put it in perspective this is a
14 inch display and it's half a pound
lighter than the MacBook Air oh I like
that color okay it's darker than I
expected it to be almost Space Gray
territory it's definitely not glossy but
it's also not matte it's somewhere
between the two so this is what happens
on the matte finish is it gets a little
smudgy you see the smudge enos right
there this inevitably happens it's just
part of the finish and I get it it's
meant to be industrial like who cares
but it's just something that happens
with this particular texture and even
more so when you open it up see that
right there the trackpad the the palm
rests it's not a big deal I would
happily keep using this laptop because I
otherwise liked it so much but when I
saw this finish I was like man I really
got to try that out so anyway that's
what I've gone for here now if you open
it up does it and this is what it looks
like on the inside
so you still have the exact same black
keyboard same key travel same kind of
u-shaped design to each key I just I
love the travel of these keys it's a
happy place to be because I opted for
the wqhd
display it's still a matte finish which
is a big deal to me I really like that
type of display I work in front of a
window fairly frequently so but also
because that you get the infrared sensor
up top so this is gonna have windows
hello face unlock whereas the non-custom
config sort of base model x1 carbon
didn't have that so if you pick this
configuration you can unlock with your
face so keep that in mind and as you can
tell one of the trademarks of the
ThinkPad series the hinge goes all the
way flat this is a fairly portable power
brick 65 watts now I did a video on a
third-party power brick a tiny little
power brick that I've been using with my
other x1 carbon you can go check out
that video you if you want if you're
looking for something even more portable
than this the available ports on this
model so you have the type-c connector
which is a thunderbolt port but it also
works to charge the device there's this
proprietary connector here which you can
connect in Ethernet adapter to kind of a
weird connector I mean it will give you
gigabit ethernet but you do need that
adapter cable the one beside there is
actually another another Thunderbolt
connector you got your traditional USB
and HDMI port and can I just say having
come from a MacBook Pro having a
diversity of ports has been such a
breath a deep breath of fresh air
because every so often I have to
interface with for example a card reader
or something like this which uses the
traditional USB or some other peripheral
a mouse and I don't need to use an
adapter for that because the traditional
USB is on there also having a full size
HDMI comes in handy as well and I just
got used to not having those options or
needing to use a hub with the MacBook
Pro but to have it on a package is
portable
it's nice diversity of ports useful you
get another USB on the other side as
well
and a headphone jack too so lots of
ports to choose from almost forgot on
the back here like I said since I opted
for the wireless antenna I can just pop
a SIM card in here and connect that to
my data account and just be running
wireless no matter where I am without
the need for Wi-Fi so that's a cool
feature that you can spec out on this as
well all right now one of the things I
didn't like that much about this laptop
was the speakers so low to speed this is
the latest one what was probably your
email you know granted I'm not assuming
I'm going to see any kind of improving
here cuz it's the same model as the
previous one that said the next version
of this laptop the seventh generation x1
carbon apparently not only did that one
get a little bit lighter and it's
showcasing the carbon fiber exterior
like you'll actually see the carbon
fiber pattern but apparently also they
improve the audio it's something I
learned to live with to be honest I
guess I just I don't know it turns out
that as much as like on the MacBook I
appreciated the speakers that it had
it's not a deal-breaker for me it's
nowhere near as important as say the
keyboard for example which is top
priority for me it turns out after
having tried a bunch of them I've got
the new one booted up and first things
first I'm I'm very happy with the
display upgrade going to the higher
resolution model I think is worth it not
just because of the resolution but also
to have the face unlock which I find to
be convenient even more convenient on a
laptop than a phone to be honest because
you're always staring at it pixels are
much tougher to pick up on the higher
res display than the 1080p version here
at about this range I can see pixels in
text I would say the newer model trends
is a little bit warmer out of the box as
you can see right there
brightness wise they're pretty close if
not identical so what can I say I mean
you can go back and watch the original
video if you want more detail on how the
speaker sound ultimately this is me
doubling down on what is my favorite
laptop at the moment I'll be really
upset if Lenovo gets rid of this finish
because to me it's still got the
industrial look to it it's a little bit
cleaner doesn't smudge up the overall
aesthetic of this device here it's a bit
more in line with a modern lab
the screen is nice the overall form
factor 14-inch display at two-and-a-half
pounds and a solid build you know it's
just it's a solid package I think for
right now based on what's available in
the marketplace this right here
represents my perfect laptop I'm gonna
throw a sim card in it I'm always
connected it goes under the arm it's
very cool Lenovo don't get rid of this
finish all right go ahead put out the
carbon version for Generation seven with
the carbon weave on it but like do this
one too it's fine I promise I'll buy one
that's probably not enough to convince
you but the world's perfect laptop maybe
possibly at least for me I'll put
actually the specs in the description if
you want to spec one out similarly but
there you have it x1 carbon improved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
