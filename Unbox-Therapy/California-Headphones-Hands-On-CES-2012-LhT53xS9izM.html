California headphones booth right here
and we're taking a look at their new
offerings we've got two different sets
that are going to be available these are
prototypes at the moment on the Left we
have the higher end model with 50
millimeter drivers called the Silverado
Silverado that's right you can see
titanium construction leather material
along the top high end all the way
around you've even got detachable
headphone cables here and then over to
the right here we've got the Laredo
there you go the Laredo and this is a
slightly smaller driver 40 millimeter
steel high quality materials all the way
around I'm really impressed at the
moment we got 199 MSRP on the left and a
$99 MSRP on the right and what you guys
are going to care about as well as it's
packaged real nice you got this
authentic looking case that they ship in
saddlebag that's what they're calling it
and can't wait to get my hands on a pair
of these and give you guys more detail
proper review hopefully real soon on a
channel alright see you guys
oh one more thing one more thing the
Silverado has also got an inline
splitter if you want to share your music
with somebody else so that's the last
thing there anyway see you guys on the
next one</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
