interesting accessories here that all
have something in common
they look like one thing but actually do
something else as well they're versatile
a wireless charging mouse pad I don't
even know what does that name gate pad
Gayle Pat what is it what is the name of
this gaze pad this I think is a smart
idea I mean if it works how it says or
what it looks like then I think it's a
good idea it's a wireless smartphone
charger over on here on the side of your
mousepad which you might already have
one maybe it's good maybe it's not I
gotta check it out anyhow this is a
notebook it looks like a standard
notebook but then it's also got built
into it a wireless charger power bank
and planner there's a wireless charger
in the notebook I've never seen this
before
maybe it's cool maybe it's not we are
also going to find out it also supports
fast charging and the chesse standard
this last one possibly the strangest of
all it's from 12 South and this is the
power picked wireless charger so this
will charge your smartphone in something
that looks like a standard picture frame
in fact it is a standard 5 by 7 picture
frame made of New Zealand pine so
important that they put it on the front
of the box I don't know how it compares
to other pine nonetheless
so it's covert it just looks like a
regular picture frame until you drop the
phone in and boom you're charging
without a dot that only serves one
purpose is it a gimmick a bit I suppose
they've all got that in common
alright let's start with this gaze pad
fro that's a that's a nice little
surface ok that's not real leather but
it's decent fake leather how about that
wireless charging pad as far as
mousepads go I don't know it's actually
type C that's a nice little bonus so you
know what this is pretty nice it's a
nice little accessory you got the
mousepad your mousing around you
probably have this lined up over here
keyboard here your mouse in around no
where would you put your phone it makes
a lot of sense you will put it right
there we're gonna pick up a wireless
charge or not
bingo drop it on bingo this is smart
guys it's kind of simple in concept but
why not
why shouldn't something like this exist
mousing charging message comes through
that's where it should be you guys know
I love wireless charging called wireless
chargers all over the place I just feel
like wherever they are increases
convenience and the likelihood that
you'll do it so far so good product
number one I'm into it we're one for one
okay next up test moe to three-in-one
versatile gadget they've really gone out
of their way to let you know where your
wireless charging holy smokes what do
you do you go to class what do you do
you study is that you good for you quite
the future you got there not making any
promises here anyway maybe you need one
of these to go to class this is me and
my planner in reality you're charging
your Inspector Gadget what is this
you could put whatever pages you want it
could be blank it could be a standard
notebook but look at the back area here
this is pretty wild so they have these
little cutouts for all your cables USB
cable I presume this is going to charge
up the internal power bank on here you
have micro USB lightning micro USB
type-c adapter now there's also a
battery indicator I this looks like it's
dead right now we're going battery bank
to battery bank let's give it a shot
anyway yeah right away that's a really
quick engagement right away you're
eating lunch you're conversing you drop
it on people are impressed
what is your notebook doing to your
phone right now it's charging that guy
he's pretty quick I've never seen
something like that it's definitely a
conversation starter oh hey you need
some juice as well oh yeah no problem
you just take it from you install big
deal any time here's my phone number
what when I say conversation starter you
need to listen to your uncle Lou on this
one who doesn't need a little juice
you're the notebook guy like let me go
find the notebook guy or they're just
like that guy's such a loser with the
weird notebook I mean it could go either
way
but I doubt it cuz when someone needs
juice they need it they don't care where
it's coming from
eight thousand milliamp hours ok not bad
what do you think Willy do hailey
come on over here for a minute we're
gonna talk about this well you're a guy
on campus you were the big man on campus
uh I won't say that but could you would
you have don't lie to me would you have
carried this thing around yeah I think
it's pretty cool I mean I would use this
as a sketchbook you're sketching you're
charging
you're sharing some juice yeah I think
it's a portable size it's great
lightweight okay especially with the
battery pack inside yeah it's not bad
Oh maybe you do need to be precise
though oh oh no cuz we're not plugged in
another dog hair
fold it's unbelievable it's gonna it's
gonna be a hard-hitting question here
this is just 2020 Carly Rose you'd have
this or that I would probably take this
yeah yeah yeah the way they did it I
don't know it's really simple yeah okay
I agree with you on that all right well
you can get out of your neck you did
your part Brown applause for the college
student college student last up we have
when the box showed up I was just like
that's pretty weird this is a picture
frame it's also a wireless charger not a
combination that I ever would have
imagined there's probably like a
wireless charging toilet at this point
place the phone against the picture to
begin charging there we go get it got it
good this is the picture frame remember
New Zealand pine that's a 5x7 picture
remove these clips you pop this out you
put whatever picture it is that you want
in there ah I kind of like what they've
done with the cable management here a
little cutout there so you run the cable
down you don't have to see it very much
cool so we're gonna plug this in so here
goes nothing we drop it on charging you
know what I have picture frames kind of
like this around my house so what do
they do for me right now a couple of
memories what a guy when a guy needs
some juice
unis you know what you have to do in
that case jack is you have to print off
one of your own photos I mean this could
even be a family photo
you could even match the photo to the
background on your phone so it all
blends together if you're being real
stylish you're
not gonna know it's gonna look like a
regular picture friend and it truly
could fool people until they drop the
phone on and see how it functions so I
don't know where I would stack it
against the other two gadgets that we've
demoed here which one I would use the
most I probably would still use the
mouse pad most because if you're at a
desk you're always looking for some
juice or a place to drop your phone the
notebook is for a specific type of
person's on the go and already carrying
a notebook to begin with and then this
one here is the maximum the most covert
you just would never expect to see a
picture frame do anything other than
show you a picture three unusual gadgets
that all do something more than you
might think that they would do let me
know in the comments which one is your
favorite I will link all of them down in
the description thank you very much for
joining us and go share some juice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
