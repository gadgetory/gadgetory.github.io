here in front of me I've got the latest
smartphone the oneplus six just
announced now I do need to say this is
an unboxing video the software that's on
here is the review version it's not the
final version so I can't really evaluate
it right now but I can show you what it
looks like and some of the changes from
the 5t so in front of me here I have the
mirror black version with a hundred and
twenty eight gigabytes of storage I've
also got the midnight black over there
so I'll be showing you both of those and
there will be a third color as well but
for now it's these two ok ladies and
gentlemen if the one plus six what do
you say Jack kablammo mirror black and
it's got this polished look to it it's
made out of glass you can see the layout
changed here in the back from the 5 T
you still have a dual camera setup with
the fingerprint sensor now underneath it
portrait orientation here if I compare
that to the 5 T everything lines up now
comparative to the last one you still
have the famous oneplus textured hold
switch this will switch between the
various sound modes on the device
quickly and when you reach into your
pocket you don't even need to see the
device to know that you're touching the
right switch you have a USB type-c port
for the - charge thankfully a headphone
jack still exists in this location
alright as you can see it's got some
juice right now and there you have it
this of course the first one plus device
adopting the knotch there's something
I'm happy to report here if you are not
a notch fan you can actually get rid of
it as you'll see right here you can hide
the notch area or show the notch area so
there's something for everyone you want
to get rid of it there you go
even if you don't like the look of the
notch you're still using that space if
you see what I'm saying so it looks like
it's part of the bezel but it's
displaying information for you I think
all manufacturers should do this if you
are gonna have the knotch make it so
that within the software you can disable
it if you choose to there is the ability
to go into each app and configure how it
deals with the notch situation now the
display is 20 to 80 by 1080 six point
two eight inches OLED very vibrant
display as you've come to expect
you're gonna have the - charger one of
the fastest chargers in the game they're
also going to include a case with a
smoked clear look to it they're also
gonna have first party accessories
including one of my favorites the
oneplus carbon fiber some wood grain
threaded kind of nylon look let me check
that out real quick ooh texture kind of
nice what is that little Alcantara
little softness for your baby
the classic sandstone soft touch red
material okay cool as you can see super
reflective this is kind of the luxury
look for my taste buds I'm more of a
midnight black guy it's a more matte
finish for me slightly more still a
little bit less reflective so it's a two
camera setup 120 megapixel one 16
megapixel all right now I know you're
interested in specs this unit here it's
running the new Snapdragon 845 it still
has a 3300 milliamp hour battery it'll
be available in two different Ram
layouts you could either get six
gigabytes entry point or eight gigabytes
of RAM there's also gonna be three
different storage options entry-level 64
gigabytes then 128 like the mirror black
version I have there and you can even go
up to 256 gigabytes of storage and you
will notice it is a dual sim setup as
you probably hoped for the oneplus 6
also has faster LTE than the previous
version it's now gigabit and I was told
that the design decision to go with the
glass back that's right even on this
midnight version the matte finish that
still glass was in order to facilitate
this faster LTE camera sensors have
gotten bigger which is something I'm
sure many of you wanted to hear this
should mean better low-light performance
and I hate to say it I can't show you a
full demonstration right now optical
image stabilization and in video 4k up
to 60fps it's also gonna feature super
slow-mo you can get 1080p footage at 240
FPS or 720p footage at 480 fps
now I know you're probably curious about
this screen to body ratios it's the hot
topic
we now have 84% screen to body ratio
keeping the same form factor though as
the five-team so you can see from a form
factor perspective
almost identical so it's not just the
knotch at the top where they gained more
screen in relationship to the body you
can see the chin shrunk down a little
bit also from the five-team now the
device is also gonna feature gaming mode
as you might have expected there's some
improvements there as well not only is
it capable of blocking notifications but
it also has a network boost feature
which will limit other apps network
usage when gaming prioritize bandwidth
for the game in an effort to lower
latency for online gaming and as you can
see here you can turn on gaming mode
automatically for certain apps so you
could put your favorite games in here so
you could have it on or off depending on
the game alright so I realized in this
video I couldn't really evaluate the
camera the speaker and various other
aspects this is not final retail
software that you will receive I will
make that video so stay tuned for that
this thing is gonna retail for 529
dollars super competitive it's gonna
make you think so there it is mirror
black finish midnight black finish this
one's probably my preference right now
though I really do like the white one
hopefully I'll get my hands on that one
as well for the more comprehensive video
for the oneplus 6 it exists let me know
what you guys think leave a comment down
below and stay tuned for the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
