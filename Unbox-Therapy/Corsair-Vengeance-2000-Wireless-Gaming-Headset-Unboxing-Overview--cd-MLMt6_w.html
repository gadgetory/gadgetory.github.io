therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Corsair Vengeance mm wireless 7.1
surround sound gaming headset now
something that stands out to me in that
description is the word Wireless and
that's because we haven't seen a ton of
high-end wireless gaming headsets up
until this point this is definitely one
of them now the wireless functionality
is achieved through this transmitter
it's a little USB dongle and that's
generally better than using something
like bluetooth which has to compress
your audio in most cases as you can see
on the side you can pause this if you
want to look at the exact specs
something that stands out to me here is
the 50 millimeter drivers in each of the
ear cups that's because the larger the
driver generally speaking the better
reproduction in the low-end or the bass
response that you're going to get so
these things should be no slouch on the
low-end you're also going to get up to
10 hours of wireless performance without
needing to recharge the headset so
that's pretty nice and up to 40 feet is
the distance you can be from the
transmitter that of course is the little
dongle that I mentioned earlier
now there's something included in the
box which is like a little stand or a
little dock for the USB dongle and
that's a good thing because what it
means is if you're using a desktop you
know you can use the little extension
cable and dock to bring that transmitter
into a more convenient location where
you're gonna get better transmission
taking a closer look at the headset you
can start to appreciate the build
quality as well as the attention to
detail that Corsair has put into the
Vengeance mm these things are solid
they're built like a tank which a gaming
set needs to be because they get a lot
of use all the hinges feel very solid as
well as the swivel on the boom mic I do
like the fact that you can swivel the
boom mic it means you can get it up out
of the way when you're just using these
as standard headphones now you've also
got the dongle the little USB device
that I mentioned earlier for
transmitting your audio this thing is
definitely portable no big deal there at
all and then you've got a USB cable if
you want to use them wired as well as to
recharge the headphones as I said before
you can get 10 hours of wireless usage
on a single charge if you guys are
interested in checking out pricing and
availability on the Vengeance mm headset
after you're finished watching the video
of course I will drop relevant links
down in
description so that you do not miss that
information so here's a closer look at
how the dongle interfaces with the
docking station and as I said earlier
this is going to be nice to use with
gaming desktops or otherwise so you can
get the transmitter in a convenient
location instead of back behind the
system so here's an even closer look at
the headset and something you're gonna
notice at least something that I noticed
right away is how wide the headband is
that's a good thing it means it's gonna
distribute the weight of the headset
over your head in a better fashion
therefore you're gonna have less of a
pressure point you know that sort of
point on the top of your head where the
majority of the weight is being held you
have a perforated leather which is
really nice it sort of looks like you
know the leather wrapped steering wheel
in a sports car something like that you
have a very nice volume adjust wheel
here is the port for connecting the USB
cable to recharge the headset you've
also got the boom mic as I said before
which swivels all the way up and out of
the way over all guys this is a very
very nice looking headset and I gotta
say having handled it that the quality
will not disappoint you these things are
incredibly solid and they're one of the
few high-end gaming headsets that
supports Wireless which is definitely a
cool thing it means you're not gonna be
tethered to your machine you can be a
little bit more free you can have a
little bit more distance from where your
gaming and also you can just you know
walk around and listen to music
maybe you're cleaning up your room or
doing some chores I don't know what
you're up to but hey you can have these
on be up to 40 feet away from the source
and still be listening to your audio
that's a really cool feature and
function anyway guys and that wraps up
this quick look at the Vengeance 2000 as
I said earlier in this video the
relevant links are down below if you
want to check these out for yourself
possibly purchase them thanks as always
