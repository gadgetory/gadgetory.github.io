the bullet train booth here at CES 2012
we're taking a look at their Express
product this is called the bullet train
express available in a number of
different colors if you can't tell yet
it is a special tray adapter for both
your magic trackpad and your apple
wireless map wireless keyboard i should
say we've got the founder here his name
is Jake he knows more than I do so let's
let him speak hi everybody i'm jake from
bullet train i'm the designer and today
we're going to be taking a look at the
all-new bullet train express keyboard
platform now this one it looks like the
line that you may be familiar with we
have them in a whole bunch of different
colors and some really interesting
options but first let me give you an
overview of how it works i take apart
take off the bullet the apple keyboard
which is bluetooth turn it upside down
and i pressed down here just simply pop
out the trackpad now the only time
you're going to do this is to change the
batteries because all the new album
computer support bluetooth
orrow the batteries last a really long
time so let's take a look at how I put
them back in I just simply take it put
it in press down like this pick up my
keyboard put it in snap it down like
that and voila I have the best keyboard
in the world that was so great about
this keyboard why is this the end-all
be-all keyboard number one is the most
ergonomic keyboard and a lot of people
would say you know know know when it's
flat like this it can't be economic it
has to have you know soft stuff here and
like this if you look at the shape of
your hands they're flat so that only
sets the ultimate desktop keyboard but
it's the ultimate home theater keyboard
so behind me here I have a 70 inch sharp
television which is paired through this
bluetooth
Mac Mini and I can actually this is the
only keyboard that I know of that I
could actually give a keynote
presentation with butthole
it's also the ultimate home theater key
bright so typically when you have a home
theater I'll put this back down on the
table you have to show sure if you have
a home theater you want to be able to do
everything on it so if you have an Apple
TV or Google TV right and I say to you
let's check have you heard about that
video of the bearer drinking a beer sure
and I hand it to you try to type know
that up down things are comparable half
an hour later eat it yeah it's the worst
right so with this if you know how to
use a bag or you know how to use those
exactly now something I noticed on here
is that the trackpad is recessed yes
which is probably important so you don't
you know click it by accident when
typing right exactly yeah exactly that's
exactly i know their products actually
just around here that are more sort of
traditional layout but don't have that
recess trackpad exactly and we have it
on purpose and then we also we counter
sank it and then we also countersink the
keyboard so when you type on it it's
just like a regular laptop that you be
used to so it's extremely real
comfortable on the lap alright well
thanks a lot Jake you've been really
informative oh okay what did you also
have it in 10 different colors as you
see here oh that's right so it's
available in red you get this nice blue
as well oh and what's this one ok so we
also is CES and this is all new to see
yes we've never shown this before right
right we're introducing the bullet train
custom shot
and in the bullet train custom shop you
can skin your keyboard and we've
developed a strategic partnership with
music skins calm to provide us with
these so it over on the wall here we
have the Beatles Abbey Road skin we have
Johnny Cash Elvis Muhammad Ali and also
you'll have the ability to send in your
own artwork which you upload and we'll
send you a skin for it so for corporate
ID could put your corporate logo on it
and you can do just the trackpad for 15
or the whole thing for thirty dollars a
huge library of stuff and it's basically
people are done with black keyboard
keyboard this allows you to express
yourself
something a little bit more interesting
on your coffee table yeah and the skins
are reusable too so you can take them
off and reuse them whenever you want
right right now now the skin won't go
over top the trackpad though it do it
does hey and it works through it yeah
amazing yeah it is this is the complete
reinvention of the keyboard for sure all
right what a product looks real cool
hopefully we can get a better look at it
on the channel once you guys actually
start shipping it yeah all right thanks
again bullet train com that's right
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
