you've got them you need them you love
them you might run off of them I hope
not they might run out this is a big one
this is the biggest battery that's ever
been on the desk here probably ever been
in the studio for that matter it's
called the power house and when Ankur
reached out to me and said hey Lou can
we send you a giant battery I said of
course I want to see this giant thing it
can do a laptop it can recharge a laptop
15 times it can run a TV for 4 plus
hours that's an appliance post
apocalyptic scenario or maybe you're a
camper what if you put your networking
equipment into here and you have a
little power outage you got battery in
your phone still in your laptop and then
your router and now you're still
connected checking the news watching
unbox therapy the power's out we still
got unbox therapy I don't even feel I
don't even feel concerned anymore
camping stuff it can do a mini-fridge
laptops lamps TVs even got a display on
it it recharges via a household outlet
you can add a solar panel to it if you
want to go even more zombie apocalypse
style take it to a phone 40 times a
laptop 15 times the camping light a
hundred times TV for four hours a
mini-fridge for seven hours the
mini-fridge is cool you know keep the
food from from spoiling right seems
important it's gonna be a big battery
this is for the boss players for the
battery champions of the world oh wait a
second
silica gel for Jack it's what he likes
to eat silica gel for Chad it's his face
this baby here wall that is the quality
there that's metal that's a serious
handle as well you've got plenty of ways
to interface with the battery here
you've got a full size oh hello there
seventeen hours AC power outlet for DC 5
volt IQ USBs
12 volt DC output a DC sixteen point
eight volt input that's for charging it
up the detail provided by the display
itself now it looks like you can turn on
and off specific outputs so if you just
want to have the AC on or the usb on
just with the press of a button you can
turn one or the other off now it is
heavy I will say how big is the battery
actually four hundred and thirty-four
watt hours so we're like beyond the
scope of milliamp hours somebody due to
conversion for me down below 434 watt
hours oh you know what it it what else
it is um tailgating got you could have a
stereo running off here a little
mini-fridge comes off of it your phone
is charging and you've got a stereo
connected to it who's better than you
now you're the party animal at that
point USB micro USB power cable power
brick now it's gonna take a while to
charge is four hundred and thirty-four
watt hours
I'll put it into one of these IQ port
and then press this button and we're
juicing you see that the zombies are
banging down your door you're like let
me just board that up I got 40 more
charges on my phone I'm just gonna play
a little bit more fruit ninja or tower
defense games until they make it through
keep it anywhere you want power in the
event that you need some serious juice
434 what out
