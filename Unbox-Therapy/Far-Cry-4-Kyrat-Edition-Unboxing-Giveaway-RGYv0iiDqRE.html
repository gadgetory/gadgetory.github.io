what's up guys Lew here back with
another unboxing video and today I have
an exciting one because I have two not

that would be a little bit strange to
unbox two identical things so I'm gonna
need one of you guys to help me out and
do your very own unboxing video after
you win the giveaway because obviously
I'm going to be giving away one of these
two it's gonna be really simple just

yourself a limited-edition Far Cry 4 to
be more specific the key rap Edition ki
raat karate you choose alright let's go
ahead jump inside the box and take a
closer look at what you can expect to
find inside this very special edition
these are both both for the ps4 as you
can tell on the back of the box you
actually get a little bit of a preview
of what you will find inside this is a
cool box to begin with though Wow check
this out look it's like this texture on
here very nice so I'm going to begin by
pulling this up on the back this looks
like the first portion here inside we
have the limited edition of the game
we've also got this really cool little
journal wow that's cool you got this
clasp a place for you to take notes
either notes about the game or notes in
general that's pretty cool pretty cool
little journal there you've also got a
map you can use this to help navigate
during the game or you can just put it
up for decoration frame it'd be a super
fun this is the propaganda poster
as you'll see very colorful very happy
you're also going to get this rather
large figurine let me just open this
baby up here so you have this layout on
the inside this picture age is over 14
you can't trust those 10 year olds
eating their toys stuff wow this is a
heavy one you guys know I have unboxed
an enormous number of collector's
editions so I'm very familiar with these
figures you got an RPG on the side what
looks like an ak-47 it's giant elephant
statue of course look on the back a
secret compartment I'm not going to tell
you what to put or not put in there
that's up to you with secret
compartments are for okay you here to
here first pretty cool pretty high
quality comparative to some of the other
ones on the bottom here far cry for you
be collectibles this one since it's flat
on the end you could actually use it to
stack your game there put it on your TV
console if you want or just put on your
shelf facing forward with the rest of
your collection from collector's edition
games I actually haven't set that up yet
