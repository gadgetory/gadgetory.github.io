not good
woke up this morning to this particular
news story blue light from phones
tablets could accelerate blindness study
finds blindness guys all I do here is
talk about technology mostly smartphones
you see the picture on here the guys
lying in bed that's probably you
probably me browsing scrolling watching
videos you're watching this video on
your smartphone is it really making you
blind
according to this particular study yes
blue light beaming from smartphones and
tablets is changing cells in our eyes
that could accelerate blindness
researchers from the University of
Toledo studied the impact of blue light
which also comes from the Sun triggers
toxic reactions in retinal molecules
that sense light and signal the brain
results showed blue light helps generate
poisonous chemical reactions killing
photoreceptors which cannot be restored
once they die off
even without photoreceptors we were
observing cytotoxicity main cells that
were dying so only when exposed to light
we tested multiple colors of light but
this toxicity of the cell death only
occurs when you have blue lights this
leads to macular degeneration and
incurable eye disease that causes
blindness starting in your 50s or 60s
researchers said this is no joke this
stuff here now we've known for a little
while that this blue light coming from
our smartphones might be a problem in
fact many manufacturers have put some
sort of eye comfort mode true tone some
kind of late night reading mode changes
the color temperature or representation
of color from your device so it goes to
a sort of more yellow tinge but it turns
out the situation might be more severe
it's not a new concept TVs have been
outputting similar type of light for a
while but of course the difference here
is the amount of exposure people they're
addicted to their smartphones sitting
there glaring at them usually in dark
rooms which is supposedly even worse
especially the such a condition can
occur
if you look at your iPhone screen in the
dark see this blue light is not just bad
for the health of your eyes it could
also be bad for your sleep in general
you might actually limit your melatonin
production during sleep that's the stuff
that makes you feel well-rested feel
good and you're messing with it checking
your Instagram feed late at night Jack
tuck in the jacket so here is the actual
study conducted by the University of
Toledo we are being exposed to blue
light continuously in the eyes cornea
and lens cannot block or reflect it it's
no secret that blue light harms our
vision by damaging the eyes retina
now macular degeneration is an incurable
eye disease it sets in somewhere in your
50s or 60s it's toxic if you shine blue
light on retinol the retinol kills
photoreceptor cells as the signaling
molecule on the membrane dissolves this
is the key part right here photoreceptor
cells do not regenerate in the eye when
they're dead they're dead for good
that's the scary kind of dead they're
not coming back now it's important to
note that no activity is sparked with
green yellow or red light the retinal
generated toxicity by blue light is
universal it can kill any cell type
these studies are important right I see
people on the street their faces are
buried in their smartphones now is it a
real solution are people gonna go around
and wear the special eyewear the UV
reduction eyewear could this be the
first generation of individuals
everybody ends up blind at 50 or 60 no
probably not
okay of course but it looks like via
this study the likelihood is increasing
what can you do well it scared me enough
to go in and just turn on the comfort
mode on my device permanently I've been
using the p20 Pro here you can select
natural tone color mode and temperature
and iComfort which I have turned on here
and on this device they actually let you
toggle it from cooler to warmer I got it
the warmest all right I'm afraid I
really don't want to be looking at a
yellow display or yellowish display
either but I'm just like I'm weighing
the options here you know the funny
thing is generally with video and
displays like I prefer cooler tones of
course the blindness tones are the ones
that I prefer so the other thing you can
do is limb
the amount of time you're in like a
pitch-black room with the screen on
blast your eyes they adjust for the room
first
your pupils they open way up then you
hit it with the screen it's like that's
one thing you can do next up you can
look at your app list and see if there's
a night mode of course with night modes
the displays are outputting less light
in general of course the before the beg
thing is like step 1 and right now
you're like glue you sound like my dad
here I'm just giving you some tips here
to hold on to that vision I want you to
see clearly basically anywhere on your
device where you have a chance to limit
the intensity of light coming from it
that's being received by those
photoreceptors in your eyes you could
potentially increase the health of your
eyeballs based on this study toggle it
back yellow it out save your eyeballs
it's a public service announcement ok
it's unfortunate there's no free lunch
in this game alright you get something
good you give something up limit it peel
it back a bit quit everything else
except unbox therapy videos will be
alright right check</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
