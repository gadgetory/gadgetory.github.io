laptop from Razer the blade stealth a
laptop that anybody would be happy to
own today that might not be the case
today I'm going to show you a laptop
that's 39 dollars on Amazon $39 now
they're not really calling it a laptop
they're calling it a netbook you might
not even remember the term netbook
netbooks were all the rage once upon a
time I don't even know how many years
ago they weren't very powerful most of
them had Intel Atom processors what a
bizarre era intact here's the thing this
is like some next-level netbook in the
sense that it's only $39 and it runs
Android this is on Amazon you can buy
this right now so the question is what
do you get for $40 and most importantly
does it suck it's got Wi-Fi a browser a
camera email ebook reader map music apps
I'm guessing that front-facing cameras
well it's probably not pixel dense we'll
find out flip it open it is kind of
impressive for $39 I guess it has
YouTube that'll be interesting hdmi port
an rj45 jack and a DC end wow I'm
excited
Android 4.0 0.3 megapixel front-facing
camera alright four gigs of built-in
flash memory one gig of ram the HDMI out
jack is capable of 1080p okay a couple
of USB ports and a mini USB port for
charging oh oh jack charger ring buttom
stereo speakers SD card slot it's got a
headphone jack the Ice Cream Sandwich
Android up there you see that that
always man I haven't had an Ice Cream
Sandwich in a while maybe I'll pick one
up today bedtime reading there it is
okay feels pretty sturdy tiny little
power brick so the power brick just has
a female USB port and then goes into
here a mini USB to charge this up what
can you get for 35 bucks the
days Jack not much but you get this ooh
smooth here on the back HDMI Ethernet 2
USBS on this side of the unit and then
the other side packs in your SD card
slot headphone jack and a microphone
port as well look at all the
connectivity on this thing for 39 bucks
look at the manufacturer date July of
2012 the moment of truth it's kind of
cute I don't know maybe for a kid or
something the trackpad is tiny an
anti-reflective screen might I add now
this is a tiny little keyboard could you
get used to that maybe if you have tiny
little hands alright so I've got it boot
it up now I'm at a familiar android
screen here from from back in the day as
you could tell it's like if an Android
phone was a laptop I have it hooked up
to a display here it is kind of odd
though oh here okay here we go
there we go now since the screen is not
touched navigating without the mouse you
use the directional buttons here now
they're a little are they lagging or is
that just me what's going on here up and
down works and left works right is not
working I believe the right directional
arrow is not working hmm and tight test
yes the right okay I can't say I'm
surprised
listen I'm not gonna let that hold me
back all right if you're going for the
39 dollar laptop chances are you're
ready to deal with some issues you're
gonna be mad let's be on you may had 39
bucks you're gonna be mad anyhow it's
not gonna hold us back from our
evaluation here because well or it will
because I can't get over to the apps
beyond this area can obviously use my
mouse widgets apps that's a
disappointment let's try the camera
slightly overexposed holy Point 3
megapixels here we come 2012 back
yeah that's special you see that Jack
don't you just want to put a picture
like that on Twitter you just can't wait
who even knows where that's safe to is
it it's not much storage on here let's
go ahead and open a browser it looks
like we can open a browser least look at
that we're browsing the web since we
can't navigate to the YouTube app we're
gonna go to the website first you gotta
spell YouTube correctly oh the B the B
is not working either Jack good B oh man
I can't even sight YouTube I feel like
if I just Google YouTube spelt
incorrectly I'm in survival mode here
look at that see there it is loads up
the mobile YouTube very very slowly
unbox oh man what's going on yet on no
end no and who needs a min okay hang on
a second
you therapy yes okay we got a fresh
video here let's see if it plays can we
explain it's gonna play in HQ Year man I
really feel like I'm in some other error
right now this is not playing either
yeah what oh I just took a screenshot
that's good I can't recommend this to
anyone the date on the pictures folder
is 1999 I mean I just got to say it how
did it I just got to tell the people
what's happening another option is we
could have requested the desktop website
you might get a $40 heart attack here
getting all fired up imagine you thought
this was gonna be useful imagine this
was just another day in the office oh it
did it launched the mobile version
anyway okay we have a thumbnail that's
us
no we're back here now it's killing me I
mean what am i what am I trying to do
right now like I just gotta tell the
people what's happening I don't even
think I need to tell you much of a story
here because it should be fairly obvious
at this point that this is this is
probably just gonna drive you crazy you
may become very frustrated
got you might regret at a later date
this is one of the rare occasions where
I really thought it might actually be
decent for what it is but I can safely
say avoid this thing avoid it at all
costs
steer clear treat it like the plague oh
and yeah of course it sucks if you
needed to hear it in those terms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
