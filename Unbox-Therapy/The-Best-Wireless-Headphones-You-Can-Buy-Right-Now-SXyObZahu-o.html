I'm a little bit of an enthusiast when
it comes to headphones over the years I
must have tried hundreds of headphones
and I'm always on the lookout what is
that next perfect best headphone now
there's so many different headphones on
the market everything from audiophile at
home listening open-back headphones
noise-cancelling headphones earbuds
fully wireless earbuds air pods in front
of me right now is what I think is the
new chin every day carry put it in the
bag take it on the airplane headphone
this is the PXE 550 wireless I mean you
can use it wired as well adaptive noise
cancelling headphone and that's an
important part of the title right here
on the front of the box just regular
noise cancelling headphones are a little
bit annoying to me reason for that is
because a lot of them are locked into
one form of noise cancellation either on
or off these ones they can adapt on
their own up to 30 hours of battery life
collapsible yes I wanted over the ear
headphone but it's got to be portable
you're wondering wait how does he know
so much why does he have such a strong
opinion about this headphone it's in the
box though no it's not alright I told
you it's over here I've been using it
okay I had a strong intuition that this
was gonna be the go-to so I was like let
me pull it out lose it for a little
while and let me confirm that it's the
go-to touch panels on the side very
intuitive you can even double tap for a
talk through function and that's a cool
little feature so you can hear people
around you without taking the headphones
off very intuitive for skipping tracks
swipe forward swipe back volume up and
down now coming back to the versatility
thing you're talking about Wireless
you're talking about using it with a
cable you're talking about an airline
adapter 1/4 inch adapter and a travel
case many different ways to listen and
the remaining features over here
Bluetooth 4 2 NFC pairing tap it to your
phone and just forget about it aptX HiFi
sound noise guard is actually using four
different microphones on this headset of
course also a microphone for you to
speak into if you're using this to
answer phone calls and so on
alright so it's out of the box and this
is the little travel pouch as you can
tell that is a slim little
form-factor right there look at that
little thing tiny and then there's a
pouch with all your adapters in it I
tested out the cable as well
unfortunately had to use an adapter with
the pixel 2 XL inline microphone right
here a little control button there as
well in case you don't want to reach up
and touch any side panel honestly
there's something small here that just
really it really turned me right on okay
because it's how the headphones turn on
nevermind a switch you just fold them
out and flip them like this like you're
gonna wear them and then a little voice
comes on power on
I mean how genius is that simple you
never forget to turn them off we have a
hardware control for the amount of noise
cancellation from zero all the way to
one and then 50 percent in the middle
also in effects button depending on what
you're listening to you can press this
guy here and switch the way that the
headphones perform and then lastly this
is probably my favorite switch inside of
the ear cuff a dedicated Bluetooth
switch so you know if bluetooth is on or
off no interpretation of that look
bluetooth is on great ok now I feel like
I need to put this on to explain why
this might be the ultimate right here I
put this on it's a nice seal around the
ear look at the shape of this ear cup ok
it's a shape of a human ear you get the
most streamlined form factor less
material lighter weight these are crazy
light weight no purpose is to be able to
enjoy either music or movies or saw for
extended periods of time if this thing
starts to dig into your head what does
it matter how good it sounds came in the
other day will had his pair on I said
well what do you say me yeah I don't
even notice it that's what he says ok so
it's not just me nice cushioning on the
headband nice cushioning on the side
good isolation here you can immediately
tell the difference from talk through
verses noise cancellation so I double
tap over here talk through activate I
can hear my own voice and I can hear
what will singing I could go up I could
order the Frappuccino I got the
headphones on they still assume I'm
relatively anti-social so we don't have
to get it to attend any conversation
about you know it is sure cold out there
you know I mean we could do that to the
niceties you got to do it every so often
alright then you just tap back turns it
off starts playing the music and so on
alright now of course you still need to
listen to them they've got an app now
cap tune so you can tweak these things
to your liking you have your noise guard
selection right here which is set to
50 at the moment but I can toggle that
back to go down to 13 I can go all the
way up to 100 right I can do it with
this switch or I could do it with the
hardware switch I could turn it off
completely that's one of the things that
always killed me with noise cancellation
headphones is what if I'm at home and
it's quiet first of all why am i using
all this extra battery and then second
of all why am I in the fishbowl right
now and this is important to just being
able to see the battery life remaining
but it doesn't end there you can use
this as your music player as well select
from a number of different sources
there's also an EQ built-in with a bunch
of different settings hip-hop to rock to
flat we do a custom EQ for these things
as well so the FX are on top of the EQ
that's what that FX button is for on
here you can go from club to movie to
speech to director so this is really
important you want to get the best out
of a movie you want to get the best out
of your music right you probably want
some more low-end
a little more thump on the music side
but then you go to the movie you want a
little bit more speech you want it to be
intelligible you got the options
built-in alright it's time to listen to
some music here I'm gonna throw a couple
of different genres at these babies
right now we'll start with some hip-hop
and the club FX setting now you have the
volume settings on the phone but don't
forget you can control from here hi
there I'd like to order a Frappuccino
macchiato by if you listen to hip-hop
you're not gonna be disappointed here
alright sealed back low end especially
with the hip-hop EQ settings and the
club setting on the FX is what you want
let me go for another genre I mean
that's it what are you gonna do you're
gonna sit here you're gonna watch me
listen you're gonna be happy you got
these you'll be like finally I knew what
to get because Lou tried all the
headphones and then he landed on those
ones I mean you talk about you think
about the different features that I
showed you here you add the Sennheiser
sound to that package that's that well
thought out
I don't you notice it on my head you
could catch me like Rip Van Winkle on
the
with the Greybeard it could be years
later don't even look around it's simple
just get these</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
