therapy comm and today we're taking a
look at the blackberry playbook I'm
really excited to take a look at this as
you guys know if you follow the channel
I've got the iPad 2 and the Motorola
Xoom which I unboxed over there it's
going to be nice to put this PlayBook up
against them just to see how it stacks
up BlackBerry has gone with an
understated box here it's also real
small if you guys are fans of the
channel you recognize the fact that I
don't have my usual blade today I got a
I got a sub in I couldn't find the other
one so anyway it's going to be nice to
get a tablet that's a little bit smaller
a little bit more portable but I don't
know how it's going to play out from a
practical standpoint I mean seven inches
is somewhere between your smartphone and
what's already available with tablets so
anyway we'll get a chance to play with
it and we'll have the full review coming
up and we'll stack it up against those
other ones anyway look at this
blackberry gave us a neoprene case and
this thing is super light I like it when
the manufacturers give you something you
weren't expecting even if it's small
like a case it's nice we've got a little
bit of documentation here telling you to
make sure you're in Wi-Fi coverage when
you first start it I guess is probably
going to be an update or something
anyway next we've got the rest of our
stuff this is probably the main
documentation I'm assuming our manual
and whatnot and look at that a cleaning
cloth rejoice anyway these devices do
need cleaning cloths they're attracting
fingerprints like crazy I'm sure you
know that and here is our literature we
have safety and product information in
about three languages and we've also got
our warranty which looks like it's in
two languages anyway I'm never going to
read those it's the last time I'll see
them and it's the last time you'll see
them next we've got our cables and
adapters this is going to be power
let's see if my new blade can get us
into here just as I expected not as good
as my other one so we got to be a little
bit more careful methodical there we go
anyway so I think we've got a power
cable that's a USB cable and there's our
power cable so you get a regular USB and
then you've got a micro USB that
terminates to the regular power prongs
so here's our USB cable now the weird
thing about this is this can't really
communicate very well to my Mac so
that's going to be funny to see what
what I can really do with that but
anyway this is going to charge it up for
me and as you'll notice it's got the
micro USB on one end and the fold down
prongs which I like
enough of these accessories let's move
on to the unit itself so here we have it
and like I said the first thing I notice
is just how much smaller it is then the
iPad 2 or the Motorola Xoom and that
could be a good thing or bad thing
depending on what you're looking for
it's obviously going to be a little bit
more portable but you're going to lose a
little bit of screen size although it
does have a decent resolution so the
real estate is not down that much so
we've got a velocity front side like we
do on every single tablet that's hitting
the market our ambient light sensor and
our three megapixel front-facing camera
which is a really decent spec for a
front facing camera and our five
megapixel camera on the back we got our
multimedia buttons on the top along with
power and our headphone jack there too
and on the bottom side we've got our
charging port micro USB port and sixteen
gigabyte designation that magnetic port
I'm not sure how it's going to be used
because it didn't come with a cable I
assume it's to charge it it's also got
forward-facing speakers which is a nice
addition anyway subscribe for the full
review I have a lot more to say about it</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
