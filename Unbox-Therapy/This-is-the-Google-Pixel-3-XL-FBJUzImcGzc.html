excel was probably my favorite device of
the previous generation I've got it in
front of me here I even used more than
one version of it this is the black one
I also used the Panda version a lot of
it came down to this camera on the back
the stock Android experience that exists
on you no skin no mod all the way into
the settings menu I wish this thing was
a bit cheaper I wish it had a headphone
jack but nonetheless I loved this phone
so that brings me to today I happen upon
this article latest pixel 3 leaks
showing off the knotch
Oh No and of course this matters to me
tremendously because of how much of a
fan of the pixel choo XL I was based on
that headline you can tell this new
device is going to have a notch maybe
there'll be a way to turn it off it's a
pretty big notch too it comes down a
little further it's a little taller of a
notch it's not gonna be for everyone at
first glance you look at it you're kind
of like man it's not the best looking
thing and why would Google have to adopt
the notch in the first place and if they
chose to why does it have to be so big
so tall well I'm speculating that the
reason for it is to protect the stereo
speaker some of the best clearest
speakers of the previous gen flagship
smartphones firing directly at your left
and right ear canal
so maybe that top part of the notch
there exists to deliver audio we can
create a justification for having it I
still don't think I'm ever going to be a
fan of the notch if I can turn them off
I turn them off if you can turn it off
that's going to be a fat bezel on the
top this will be interesting to see how
this lines up but there's some other
cool stuff about this particularly from
this Russian guy what's his name Cora
chef he's claiming to have used the new
camera for some sample shots on his
Instagram maybe get a sense for the
eventual performance of this pixel 3 I
think many of you myself included are
gonna be watching that camera closely
take you with a grain of salt because it
could be pre-release software which
certainly is subject to change the next
thing which I'm really excited for is a
short little video clip he shows the
purported pixel 3 wirelessly charging
thank goodness people get mad at me for
this for constantly talking about
wireless charging as if it's this big
deal because yes it is slower but men
once you're in the ecosystem once you're
in the wireless universe you start to
notice you start to slap it down beside
your bed and get used to it so since I
use so many different smartphones I get
really used to having that feature then
when I give it up switching over to
another one as I do so frequently I kind
of miss it with the pixel 2xl I still
missed it pixel 3 looks like it's gonna
have it so another image posted shows
the back of the device the camera layout
looks similar you still have a single
and system so it looks like Google is
going to be leaning on software once
again and then the last image here is
about the accessories that are also in
the box I mean I'm not sure what I
really hoped for here maybe a resurgence
of the headphone jack but based on the
adapter that looks like it will come in
the box that's likely not gonna happen
though the type-c earbuds do look like a
potential upgrade but if the fit is
similar to what it was on the pixel buds
the wireless upgraded version of Google
headphones and then I'm not too excited
because I actually didn't like those
headphones very much at all anyhow there
you have it we have a very clear image
now of this pixel 3 I think this stuff
is legit it
really legit at this point and now the
question goes to you guys is this device
worth waiting for are you gonna sit
around hold off on your next smartphone
purchase in anticipation of the pixel 3
or has this leaked have these images of
the device and these findings pushed you
in the other direction are you like man
that notch it's just too big is too ugly
I can't look at it maybe your confidence
is shattered I don't know where I stand
yet I'm definitely gonna use it I wish
it didn't have the notch but I said that
before I know it's probably getting old
at this point hopefully the camera can
make up for it the displays gonna be
another big thing and maybe if the sound
coming out of it is amazing because of
the notch because there's a speaker
hidden in there with some great volume
and maybe I can make the justification
time will tell this thing's coming out
soon and I'm gonna have an unboxing
video and I'm also gonna use it for an
extensive period of time so make sure to
stick around for that
anyhow pixel 3 we now know more than we
knew before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
