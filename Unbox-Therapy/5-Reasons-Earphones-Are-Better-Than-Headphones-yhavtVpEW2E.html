another video and this is a follow-up to
the previous video the top 5 reasons to
choose over your headphones when
compared to in-ear this one is dedicated
to the top 5 reasons that you might
choose in-ear headphones instead of over
ear in front of me I have some
exclusives once again from mash drop
also from high five man these are
re-release they're called the re zero
zero essentially what we're looking at
just like the over ear model is a
heavily reduced price to go along with
the influx of demand and orders that
will come in from you guys so this is an
all-metal construction
nine millimeter driver you've got a
braided style cable couple of different
ear tips if you want to check that out
link in the description you can go ahead
and participate five reasons you want to
choose in-ear headphones when compared
to over ear number one travel these are
tiny alright this might seem obvious to
you but this is gonna go in anything a
pocket a bag it's gonna go with you and
you're not even gonna notice it but the
other reason travel wise I've been on
certain airlines where when you're about
to take off they like hey dude with the
big over ear headphones you're obnoxious
this is dangerous god knows what their
reasoning is but often they force me to
switch to in-ear style headphones so if
you're on the move and you want to want
something that can fit in your pocket
purse or bag in here is the way to go
number two smaller drivers smaller
speaker units that fit closer to your
eardrum don't require as much power to
be amplified so in general in ear
headphones are going to be easier to
drive you won't necessarily need an
outboard amplifier or any kind of fancy
gear just plug these babies into your
smartphone and experience what they were
designed to do reproduce sound from a
tiny little headphone jack and amplifier
number three exercise activity jogging
lifting weights Jack doing the body pump
obviously these are gonna be more
convenient for most people you don't
have to be as worried about them falling
off of your head
and over your headphone you get heated
up you're sweating
it's covering I hate being hot I keep
the AC in here on freeze mode Jack hates
it number for price these guys here as I
said are about 35 bucks just over $30
and in exchange for quite surprising
sound quality at least in the case of
this particular model usually when you
step into the realm of over ears you're
gonna pay a little bit more so if you're
looking to get in and low price point
generally speaking in ears will deliver
more for less point number five this
one's a little bit interesting so word
is it even a word in conspicuousness
yeah sure why not this is like stealth
mode you're walking around you're at the
grocery store maybe you're in class I
didn't tell you to do it kind of you
know have your little secret agent
lifestyle while you listen to your tunes
some people just don't like the style of
having giant headphones on and I can
understand that these just blend in
better so there you have it the top 5
reasons to choose in-ear headphones but
I will say in conclusion there's no
perfect headphone obviously and if your
guy like me or a guy like you if you're
an enthusiast chances are you probably
want to have a pair of each this happens
to be an awesome opportunity to get two
cool pairs of headphones some in ears
and some over ears from high five man
the quantities are limited as I said
before special collaboration between
mass drop hi-fi man and unbox therapy if
you want to learn more the links are in
the description I think you guys are
going to get great value out of these
two headphone options for an open back
over here and an in-ear there you have
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
