another video and as you can tell I'm in
an unusual space but there's a reason
for that I'm part of a special event
where five creators in one day are going
to look at various products in front of
me I've got the Philips Sonicare
electric toothbrush I am very excited to
check this out
test it out see what it's all about so
let's go ahead and jump inside the box
actually before we do let's take a look
around the package here the power reach
tip replacement bristles densely-packed
believe it or not I don't own one of
these things I'm still using the old
school toothbrush which is actually kind
of depressing considering I'm a tech
enthusiast you'd think I would upgrade
my toothbrush maybe that's exactly what
this is look it's the special edition
black as well
angled neck and improves the reach for
better cleaning at the back of the mouth
good recharge indicator so a charge last
two weeks good
all right I'm happy okay this is the
important part
some paperwork buy more stuff from us
the usual what else a little charge base
so as I said they claim that the battery
lasts for two weeks so theoretically you
wouldn't have to have it on here but
this seems pretty convenient anyways
look at this you just leave that on a
countertop you just upgrade it your oral
health theoretically you've upgraded
your life because of that
all right I think I should test it out I
probably need some toothpaste we got any
toothpaste around here jack reuler the
toothbrush do the work so point
mm-hmm mm-hmm well go wash our
car no
what wire loom um where yep okay will
stimulates a little bit you know it's
the gums breathing what not gums don't
breathe um it just yeah I don't know I
think it did the job did the trick from
this moment forward I think I'm gonna
have to swap out my old-school version
for one of these guys yeah Philips
