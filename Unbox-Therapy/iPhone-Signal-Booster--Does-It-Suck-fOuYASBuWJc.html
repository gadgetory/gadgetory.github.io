clapping wrong my whole life I'm always
trying to do a symmetrical clap like
this like uh but in reality the much
better clap is to angle it so that your
hand hits the palm it's a thicker so
that's the real flat in case you were
interested jack so today I'm going to
try to solve your problems and you got a
lot of them I'm gonna start with this
one no cell phone signal who is not
hurting for more signal better signal
better reception quick disclaimer I have
no idea if this thing is going to work
but it claims to so we're going to find
out if the link case clear is the
solution to your problems or maybe it
sucks
I've got an iPhone here I've got the
case we're gonna see about the reception
of the phone without the case and then
with the case we're gonna find out if
it's the real deal or not no fancy
contraption you don't need power for it
or anything it's just it's got a weird
kind of design going on I mean they say
it's patented technology but one thing I
want to mention before we crack this
open I sort of switch the way that the
iPhone displays its signal strength so
normally you have those those little
dots at the top you can change those
dots to an actual numerical readout
here's how you do it on a keypad dial
star three zero zero one hash one two
three four five hash star then you hit
the call button you can get all kinds of
data in here regarding your cellular
connection on the iPhone just hold down
the power and then once you get to the
power screen like this you want to hit
the home button for about five seconds
and then you'll see what happens when I
release boom so in this case I've got
minus one one for the smaller the minus
bigger the better so like minus 50 for
example would be good minus 100 not so
good minus 114 not ideal at all this
would be similar to either one or two
dots lit up so not great signal strength
where I'm sitting right now which makes
this the perfect location for this test
we are going to check if that minus 114
number goes up after I put the link case
clear onto this device
is there English anywhere in here I mean
what am i doing what what's going on
right now to optimize your battery life
use EMW when accessing data or during
calls the signal enhancement is
instantaneous however iOS may need some
time to display the change I'm still
seeing minus 114 what happens is when
you lift it up and slide it you'll
notice it lines up with the antenna on
the iPhone it's almost an extension of
the phone's built-in antenna Oh Oh baby
we are now at minus one zero two Jack do
you see that almost a 10% improvement
now obviously there are a number of
parameters at play here it's not just
signal strength it's also the signal
tech like are you on LTE and so on and
so on
but nonetheless for the most part you
see a better number up here a lower
number up here you're in better shape
what does it mean for data what does it
mean for voice I'm gonna launch a speed
test right now to find out so we'll do
the speed test with the antenna extended
and the case on first eight point seven
three megabits per second download and
six point six one megabits per second
upload now keep in mind this is strictly
the LTE network from in this case Rogers
minus one zero two is the signal
strength I'm going to remove the case
now and do the same speed test so the
case is off and I just discovered
something kind of cool once you've
enabled this you can just tap in the top
corner and switch back to the little
dots and then back and forth back to the
speed test now and let's see how we
compare 8.33 megabit per second down
five point four six megabit per second
up it's slightly worse eight point seven
three to eight point three three and six
point six one two five point four six is
it incredibly substantial no like this
isn't gonna solve your problem if you
have no signal at all and if this is any
kind of indication you improve me you
could expect to see in an environment
with a somewhat weak signal might be in
the neighborhood of 10% maybe a little
bit more a little bit less it looks here
from a preliminary perspective like it
does do something I thought maybe it was
all smoke and mirrors but it did do
something so the first step is do my
little trick at the front of this video
check what kind of signal you have
enough
first place get rid of little dots and
if you're constantly in a situation with
a weak signal this could give you a
little bump so no I can't say that it
sucks
maybe you hold on to that one phone call
just a little bit longer with the one
you love who knows what this might do
