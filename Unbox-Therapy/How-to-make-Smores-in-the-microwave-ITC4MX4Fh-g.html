therapy and today we're taking a look at
another piece of high technology this my
friends is this more Express and in this
video I'll be showing you how to make a
s'more in the microwave I was actually
out filming the last video at Canadian
Tire during the sound trooper shoot and
I saw this thing sitting on a rack
somewhere and I was like you know what
this is going to be a badass video I've
never seen anything quite like this so
in 10 seconds or less apparently you can
make s'mores I picked up this box you
still do need to bring your own
ingredients to the table so I will be
heading out in a moment here to pick up
the graham crackers the marshmallows as
well as the chocolate for those of you
that don't know what the hell is s'more
is other than that let's jump inside the
box and take a look at this particular
contraption and surprisingly it's pretty
damn simple it's piece of plastic more
or less this thing is only about ten
bucks I think was eight bucks eight to
ten bucks actually put a link down in
the description I think you can get this
on Amazon so it's not a huge investment
and it sets up pretty simple all you do
is take this little platform build your
s'more on top and then put this lid on
which has a couple of vent holes and a
flat portion that drops down and
squishes the marshmallow giving you
apparently the perfect s'more so let's
head out get the ingredients and then
I'll come back and show you how it all
works
then wait pigeon alright so we're back
with the official Hershey s'mores kit
didn't expect to find this at the
supermarket I thought I was gonna have
to get all of the ingredients separately
but as I rounded the bend rounded the
corner was like they read my mind I saw
this thing sitting at the end of an
aisle so it's going to make sixteen
total s'mores you get the graham
crackers that you need you have the
marshmallows and of course you have the
Hershey bars these are milk chocolate
four full-size units I'm going to do a
quick taste test and then after that
we're going to build the world's most
perfect s'more place it onto this tray
and see if the s'more Express can do
what it promises and create a campfire
quality s'more in only 10 seconds that's
pretty tough to do construction is
simple start with a graham cracker
follow it up with some chocolate in this
case it's one quarter of a full sized
Hershey bar then you got your
marshmallow up right followed by the
final graham cracker to top it all off
now if you're using a s'more Express or
something like it
you need to slowly drop the lid on top
so you don't destroy the little s'more
construction on the inside the next part
is probably the most fun this is where
your s'more becomes a s'more not just
some crackers and a marshmallow and
chocolate now I have to admit 10 seconds
wasn't actually cutting it on this
particular microwave so instead I went
with 17:17 happen to be that sweet spot
and what you notice when it's cooking is
the marshmallow just extends like crazy
it actually almost fills up the entire
compartment but then that little plunger
portion on the top slowly presses it
down to create this perfect looking
s'more and it tastes just as perfect as
it looks so anyways you guys are
interested in this s'more Express or the
she's kid I'll drop links down in the
description but I'm pretty impressed
with the results it's a simple
contraption for a simple project for a
simple process and it comes out as
expected that's how you make us more
later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
