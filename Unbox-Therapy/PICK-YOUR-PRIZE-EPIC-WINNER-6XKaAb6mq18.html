here finally got a chance to sit down an
ounce the winner of the pick your prize
epic edition giveaway I know the whole
thing got mangled got moved from YouTube
over to Twitter blah blah blah I'm sorry
it had to be that way I still didn't get
any kind of detailed explanation as to
why my video got pulled as you guys know
there's all kinds of giveaways on
YouTube but unfortunately YouTube is not
very clear about what's acceptable and
what isn't what kind of terms etc so I
did what I could to hold up my end of
the bargain to do what I said I was
going to do and to give away the epic
edition giveaway right to give away
whatever product was picked in this
beautiful series pick your prize because
I want to see the products that I
unboxing a channel find a way back to
your hands because you guys are the fans
you guys make this possible when you
watch my videos etc that's that's what
keeps me coming back that's what makes
this content a possibility so anyway
guys without further ado and what what
wait one thing but I want to say before
I announce the winner don't get your
itchy trigger fingers happy or ready for
that thumbs down dislike button because
if you guys want to see this happen
again then I'm going to want to see a
positive response right you're going to
you're gonna have to show me that you at
least like this concept and I'll
possibly even leave a comment down below
telling me how much it means to you etc
because you know after all I'm doing it
for you guys and if you guys don't like
it and you guys can't handle some person
winning one person winning and you and
you can't you know keep a positive
attitude for the sake of the community
can't be a grown-up attend I'm gonna
have to end the whole thing and and get
rid of the concept all together but I
don't want to do then I don't think
that's going to happen because I think
everyone's going to play nice so without
further ado oh wait one more thing damn
it I did not mean to do this I don't
want to drink you guys along but a lot
of people ask me you know how do I make
sure that anybody who entered got only
one entry because a lot of people were
tweeting more than once being a Twitter
give away what I did before I went even
close to random.org and their list
randomizers I stripped out duplicates
anybody who put more than one tweet in I
stripped it right out got rid of it and
made sure that every eligible entry from
every
eligible user was entered only once
that's right you can you can trust me on
that I guarantee it completely random
you know I'm in this for the long haul
you know I put a lot of time and effort
into this YouTube and I'm not going to
mess around on some on some giveaway and
mess you guys up this was random
completely fair guaranteed so without
further ado here it is finally the
winner twitter user sucking toes yes
that's the real user name and the only
reason I knew how to pronounce it
because it's felt s ck n toes I'll put
the name up here is because I went
through his youtube channel by the same
name the link was posted on his twitter
account and his very first video
commentary video he explains how you got
that name so anyway if you want to check
that out go for it but he picked an xbox
360 so maybe i'll spend send him a
special edition or something he didn't
specify he just said xbox 360 I'll send
him something real cool because that's
that's what we do here on unbox therapy
you know I got to get back to the
community so anyway guys uh you know as
always I want to thank you for entering
I want to thank you for watching I love
doing what I'm doing I hope you love
what I'm doing and until next time and
as always thank you for watching later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
