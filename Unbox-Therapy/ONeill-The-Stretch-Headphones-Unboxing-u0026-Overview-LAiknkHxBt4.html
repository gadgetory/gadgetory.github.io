today we're taking a look at the stretch
headphones from O'Neil these are put
together in conjunction with Phillips
and the purpose of these is to be the
toughest headphones on the planet I'm
not sure if they accomplished that but
one thing's for certain anybody who's
into extreme sports or just treats this
stuff like crap in general is going to
be interested in these these are the
toughest in a new range of headphones
put together from O'Neil and they're
made of heavy-duty materials similar to
the stuff that they use in wetsuits the
headphones are both impact and crack
resistant they are made of TR 55 LX
which is a surface with hardness six
times greater than the polycarbonate
commonly used in many other headphones
now back to the unboxing the first thing
we're going to take a look at is the
cable which is braided nylon style cable
with a beautiful gold connector this
stuff feels high-quality I can tell you
that straightaway now Phillips Antonio
put together a number of different
headphones in this series this one just
happens to be the top of the range
they've also got some in-ear models that
are also supposed to be tough and sound
great too if you guys have followed the
channel you know we've unboxed a number
of different headphones most of those
from the beat series beats by dre that
is and one thing that's not great about
those headphones is that they're not the
most durable and they're they're heavy
for the most part these ones are light I
can notice that straightaway which for
physical activity is going to be
important so here you can see me trying
to twist them a little bit first I'm
going to go ahead and peel off these
protective coverings
gonna try and see see if I can break
them although I don't really want to but
as you can see there's a huge range of
motion there and even though the
material feels the same as any other
plastic you've experienced it's
obviously more durable you can you can
feel that straight away so here's where
you connect the short mini jack to the
remainder of the cable the inside of the
ear cups is probably an artificial
leather here's a closer look at that
braided cable in the gold connector and
here's what the ear cups look like with
that artificial surface anyway check out
the channel we got lots more to look at</div></body></html>
