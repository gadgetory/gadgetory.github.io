I think you enjoy
it's called does it suck but you know
what doesn't suck today's sponsor of
this episode
it's called LastPass look at this check

it's not cutting it nobody's getting
into your stuff LastPass check them out
link down in the description you could
try it right now for free the concept is
that I take an item a product something
that piques my interest usually on
Amazon and I take the risk I buy it so
you don't have to but then again the
thing might be good in which case I've
just uncovered some treasure of the
Internet the one on the left
aki wireless arks secure fit earbuds
wireless Bluetooth earbuds that are 13
dollars but then I got this other set on
the right from a company called LAN buy
land
these have even better reviews than the
wireless arks and these are $9.99 for
only $9.99 alright so first unboxing
experience here very important they look
pretty nice actually around the ear sort
of so that the wire goes behind your
head it has an inline remote also volume
up/down microphone some extra ear tips
so you get the right side a little one
of those guys the old
all right pretty nice how does the land
by land compare so micro-usb as well
flat microUSB cable a little more
colorful these do come in a couple
different colors it has play/pause right
on the earbud and volume right on the
earbud as well no need for this extra
piece here also the ear tips on these
ones have this little hook on the inside
also extra sizes included let's try the
Aki ones around the back of the head
around the ear this it's actually quite
a secure fit you're jogging you're at
your your lifting weights your missus
yeah it's pretty secure let's boot these
things up okay so I just got a cone in
my ear boom let us go to some music now
okay what a time to be alive that's the
way I feel right now what a time to be
alive $12.99 I got no cords I got
bluetooth
I got stereo okay let me try the neck
let me I gotta try these ones now the
microphone on this one is right in this
location I don't Jack and picked up yeah
there it is
oh it goes straight into pairing mode
connected we got a voice on this one not
just beeps go straight into your ears
they don't hook around the outside as
you can see but they do have that
internal the little rubber piece so it
has a secondary grip on the inside
oh it's helpful it's a nice fit though
too maybe a little less isolating I'd
say what about the sound Wow okay these
ones are way louder I might just wear
them under the chin no I guess you're
not supposed to this is look at that
look no one wants who wants that look
right there on the outside here play
pause you know exactly where it is right
like with this one it might take you a
second to hit to find the pause button
on this one
so for sound for sure I'm giving it to
these ones I mean they're louder there's
bass maybe they're like a little less
balanced bit more dynamically tuned
then those ones do I think the vast
majority of people are gonna say hey man
those sound better than those which is
kind of surprising it's not what I
expect is a $10 they're both amazing
though I think you get either one of
these you're gonna be like over the moon
at that $12 or $10 purchase that's the
truth if fit and security is number one
I'd probably go this way if sound
quality and volume is number one I'd
probably go this way or just get them
both I mean you can afford to lose one
of them at this price it's insane
$10 $12.99 we are living in the future
my friends technology is a beautiful
thing they do not suck all right I've
tested earbuds are more than $1,000 on
this channel now that you do not sound
that good but my goodness for 10 or 12
dollars let me tell you something what a
time to be alive</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
