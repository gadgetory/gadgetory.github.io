to you by ting what's up guys Lew here
and today we're taking a look at the
Samsung Galaxy s3 yes I know this device
has been out for a while so save me from
the comments down below telling me I'm
late but I finally got my hands on one
and so I said hey let's share the
unboxing let's put together an unbox
therapy style unboxing of the galaxy s3
so as you can see here this is the
pebble blue coloring it is also
available in white it is a fairly large
device you get that sense straightaway
not as big as the note 2 obviously but
you do have a 4.8 inch screen here so
bigger than the Galaxy Nexus that I am
very very used to you've got a bunch of
paperwork included in this unboxing just
like any unboxing this is the most
boring aspect but we do have to get
through it real quick next you have a
little baggie that was included by the
telco trying to encourage recycling of
old devices I think they're just trying
to grab your sweet devices and recycle
them for some extra cash so I'm going to
hold onto my Galaxy Nexus in this case
anyways you've also got a USB cable
micro USB on one end for charging the
device you've got a set of earbuds
that's included and these are an in the
ear style earbud with removable tips
you've also got a microphone and volume
up and down rocker on your little remote
control there that comes with the
earbuds since the earbuds are in in the
ear style as I said before with
removable tips you've got a number to
choose from so you can pick the one that
fits best for you there are three
different options including a
pre-installed option or plus a
pre-installed option you've got a rather
large battery as well to power up the
device and keep it running you have your
USB to power prong connector for
charging the device from the wall so
let's go ahead and take a closer look at
the actual smartphone you can see the
front features your speaker as well as
your ambient light sensors your forward
facing camera down on the bottom of the
front portion you have your home button
which is a physical home button followed
by a couple of capacitive keys that
reside down there as well
the back of the device is where you'll
find your rear-facing 8 megapixel camera
LED flash and rear-facing microphone on
the top you'll see
your headphone jack as well as a noise
cancellation mic there's another
microphone on the bottom of course as
well as your micro USB port for charging
the device the left-hand side has your
volume rocker the right-hand side has
your power switch that pretty much
covers the physical characteristics of
the device I'm going to go ahead and
boot it up as well as do the little
installation process but I'm not going
to make you guys sit through that I'll
go ahead and jump right to the interface
as you can tell you've got samsung's
trademark UI here you've got their
TouchWiz experience though I must say it
is faster than the last TouchWiz device
I used obviously that's because this is
a much faster device from a hardware
perspective I'll go ahead and you know
jump into the Beast feed comm that's my
blog if you guys haven't checked it out
yet once again the beast feed comm and
as you can see it loads it up real quick
it's not a very heavy site my site but
as you can tell scrolling is super slick
super fast very impressive actually at
first glance I'm going to go ahead and
compare this device physically to the
Galaxy Nexus but first a message from
today's sponsor ting is a new mobile
phone service provider offering up major
savings over the other guys if you're
currently operating a smartphone on one
of the traditional carriers I'm sorry to
break it to you but you're paying too
much ting is straight up and straight
forward you only pay for what you use
whether we're talking minutes megabytes
or messages you're not going to be
surprised by crazy overage fees at the
end of the month they're not going to
try and hit you there these guys are
honest if you use more than you expected
you just get bumped up to the next tier
to the next plan instead of getting
those nasty surprises and if you happen
to use less well that's even better
because then you're going to get
credited back for what you didn't use
you're never going to miss out you're
never going to overpay their online
interface for viewing your cell phone
bill is has got to be the easiest to
understand that I've ever seen there are
no surprises with ping anyways if you
guys head over right now to unbox
therapy ting comm you're going to get
$50 off your device purchase so
definitely head over there and check out
their devices they've got some beauties
like the galaxy s3 to check out so don't
miss out and I'll see you guys over on
ting unbox therapy
komm alright so here's a closer look at
the capacitive touch buttons on the s3
they pop up only when necessary and then
fade away when not in use and they're on
either side of the physical home button
so this is going to take a little
getting used to coming from a Galaxy
Nexus in which all of the buttons are
software based and they actually pop up
right on the screen so here is my Galaxy
Nexus up against the s3 as you can see
they're both fairly large devices with
the s3 being a little bit larger with
that bigger 4.8 inch screen and from a
side perspective the s3 is also slightly
thinner if you guys would like to see a
greater in depth comparison of these two
devices definitely leave a thumbs up
down below and I'll get around to it
thanks as always for watching and I'll
catch you guys on the next video
all right later</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
