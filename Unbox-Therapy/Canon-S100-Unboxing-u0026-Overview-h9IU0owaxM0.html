therapy and today we're taking a look at
the canon powershot s 100 and this is a
point-and-shoot camera with some very
professional features especially for
something so slim so small it shoots in
RAW now that's the format that most
digital SLR shooting and they're much
bigger and much bulkier as you guys
probably know this camera also has the
ability to shoot @f 2.0 which is a
gigantic aperture for a point-and-shoot
camera it also does 1080p video and it
has image stabilization as well so lots
of cool features for a point-and-shoot
as you guys know my casual camera
point-and-shoot camera at the moment is
the sony hx5v do of me unboxing that
camera I'll put a link in the
annotations as well as in the
description we're gonna see if the s100
can be thrown that camera but let's talk
about the unboxing first first and
foremost we have a little bit of
paperwork from Canon the warranty you've
got you've got a little manual as well
as a disc for installing Canon software
in terms of hardware items we have a USB
cable that's mini USB to USB as well as
a battery charger a nice slim portable
battery charger which has the flip n
slash flip out prongs making it perfect
for travel of course and here it is up
against my 6 TB charger as you can see
the 60d charger is much much chubbier
but it ain't really the the chargers
fault I mean you got a bigger battery a
bigger camera why not have a bigger
charger that just makes sense doesn't it
so lastly we've got two more accessories
here we have a wrist strap after all
this is a portable camera very slim very
light and you want to make sure not to
drop it so you're gonna want to install
your wrist strap on there and lastly
you've got a tiny little battery this
looks like it's about a quarter the size
know I guess half the size of the 60d
battery but as I mentioned earlier
smaller camera smaller battery that's
the way it goes basic logic you know
this I'm here to educate you guys I'm
just kidding anyways here is the camera
this is the main attraction the first
thing you see me playing with you is
this jog wheel on the front now you can
program that wheel to do a number of
different things by D
fault it's for zooming as you can see
here there here's some of the features
that f/2 lens image stabilisation
high-speed burst
raw GPS and 24 millimeter wide angle
lens really awesome specs there's that
jog wheel I mentioned earlier you can
set it for shutter speed f-stop or like
I said the default is set to zoom you've
also got a nice little grip on the right
hand side but it is a small camera guys
like you know you have to get used to it
especially if you're coming from a
digital SLR like I am this thing feels
really puny in my hands I suppose that's
a positive thing for most people but in
my case I'm gonna have to get used to it
you get your on and off button on the
top side as well as a zoom a dedicated
zoom button your shutter button of
course you've got your what is it your
jog wheel that controls the different
camera modes and then on the back you've
got a dedicated record button for movie
mode you can see the microphone is in a
strange spot as well for video good if
you're you're the one talking facing out
but maybe a little bit tough as far as
picking up audio out in front where the
action is you've also got HDMI on the
side and you've got an AV connector
there as well and digital out on the
bottom you can see this baby is still
made in Japan believe it or not you've
also got your tripod mount close to the
centre which is good and then underneath
your battery door that's also where
you're going to insert your SD card I'll
go ahead and throw in the little
miniature battery here and see if it has
any charge on it usually they ship with
3/4 charge at least in my experience and
sure enough after I hit the power button
here you'll see that there is a little
bit of power but I'm not going to make
you watch me put in the time and date
and all that stuff that's a tad bit
boring so let's get past that here's a
better look at what the lens looks like
once it's extended and you can obviously
see it's got the 5 x oom with image
stabilisation you can also see the lens
specifications on the front there the
entire body has a matte finished black
which I'm a big fan of here there's no
fingerprints here that's for sure now as
I mentioned earlier the jogwheel on the
front a default to zoom controlling zoom
and as you can see here you can go all
the way from 24 millimeters up to what
was it 1
20 anyway five times do the math I don't
want to do it so here you can see just
how that lens reacts to this method of
input kind of like a pro camera so a
really cool camera all around we'll have
to see how it stacks up against the hx9
V which is as you can see here is quite
a bit fatter they both got GPS as well
the Ajax 9 V is bigger because it has a
much greater zoom it can do 16 times
zoom instead of 5 but it does not have
an f2 lens so you know that s100 is
going to be much better in low-light
just because the lens is going to give
you a lot more versatility so anyways
I'll stack these two cameras up against
each other at CES for both photos and
video and then you guys can decide for
yourself which is better either
all-around or for you anyway guys if you
