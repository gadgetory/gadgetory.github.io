the game vise kind of like a vise for
your gadget in this case the iPad Mini
tactile controls it kind of turns your
iPad into a more traditional gaming
device what is this this is like some
high-tech next-level portable gaming
it's like if the game boy grew up you
got all your favorite games on iOS and
now you have tactile buttons so you can
really catch a field catch a vibe do a
little racing place a little wager okay
so the cool thing here as well is that
there are lots of games available that
use this control scheme by default all
right so it's not like you're in there
mapping things out hello jack is so mad
that you just called because we're in
the middle of filming a video can we
Ryan can we keep the light like we're
still rolling yet with the language
sorry alright it's okay I'll call you
guys back maybe right I just anyway it's
fine it's fine
I don't a fucked-up taxi I feel terrible
still with the language still with the
language we're trying to use this in the
video sorry sorry ok let's jump inside
this box whoo so there's the actual unit
I'm gonna place that to the side for a
moment a micro USB cable to charge it up
I think that's it that's all you need
you know you've got your lightning
connector right there so your iPad minis
gonna slide in there our micro USB port
to charge this thing up as well as a
headphone jack trigger triggers and
shoulders just gonna slide that baby in
there like that stretch that out a bit
tight right in there giving me some
suggestions for this accessory so I
would assume these are games that the
app store itself has vetted to be used
with the game fights there are a lot of
different controllers out there wireless
controllers and so on but you still
gotta figure out hey what which games
work best for it you can see they've
suggested some of their favorites here
are new games that support this now the
cool thing about sound here is it gets
ported out the front now through these
grills here all right here we go Golden
State Cleveland Fremont can carry the
ball a little bit there Steph let it go
the experience here is super close to
what you would get on a console if you
played a game on a console this is like
your own little portable console I am
bill my own car
okay here we go oh yeah look who's out
in front
second it's a banger rate dick jack you
can freestyle on top of that a bomb
atomically sake these philosophies and
hypotheses find how I be dropping these
mockeries lyrically performed armed
robbery
oh I'm on the inside oh no I'm not oh
every so often something shows up here
that I really think solves a problem
make something better an accessory that
makes some sense this one does for me I
know a lot of people a lot of kids who
have iPads you know they're not really
getting that classic gaming experience I
mean you get a little grip on it you get
invested
you got your xbox grade thumb sticks on
here I'm not saying it replaces a
console I'm not saying it replaces a PC
gaming rig this is for people who have
an iPad you want to take it on the go
but they want to take a better
experience on the go I don't know
something nice about having a handheld
with a screen that big felt special for
a minute all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
