into a story sometimes about a product
something that's affecting the tech
universe and I kind of I want to talk
about it even though it might not be a
physical product that's in my hands
right now
I have some thoughts I want to bring it
to your attention I bumped into this
story about an upcoming phone with an
incredible name is called Black Shark
the black shark and it sort of started
out as this ambitious smartphone startup
but then it got real because it got some
backing from a major player called Jami
and it represents what will be Yami's
first gaming phone a phone with an
emphasis on mobile gaming now at this
point when I say gaming phone it
probably brings into your mind memories
of the razor phone I did a video on that
course it had the amazing speakers it
had 120 Hertz display and Razer is
already a brand synonymous with gaming
so it made sense that they would have a
gaming focused phone but this black
shark it takes things a step further
take a look at this image here you'll
see that it has an attachment a joystick
attachment to give you a more tactile
almost console like interaction with
your favorite game other specs are
predicted to be fairly heavy-duty
including a four thousand milliamp hour
battery Qualcomm quick charge the latest
Android Snapdragon 845 chipset a six
inch display eight gigs of ram and up to
128 gigs of storage but beyond that is
the fact that it's gonna be liquid
cooled a form of liquid cooling inside
of your smartphone to keep things chilly
when you get serious with the hardcore
gaming it's obviously early in the
development of these hyper focused
smartphone for the most part people are
completely fine running
mobile games on a smartphone that they
already have but here's the thing you
might be looking at this strictly from a
North American perspective there are
parts of the world where the mobile
device is the first screen the only
screen the important screen we've seen
an expansion of sort of hardcore games
that are now available on mobile table
g4 tonight and you're like you know what
a joystick might not be so bad a device
that stays cool might not be so bad
a hundred and twenty Hertz on the
display might not be so bad better sound
quality bigger speakers that might not
be so bad
so you got to look at this development
from a global perspective and that's
where I personally think that gets
interesting and the speculation at this
point is that it's gonna sell for
somewhere around 500 bucks it may never
launch in North America unless who knows
maybe we can make some noise about it I
know myself I would personally like to
evaluate the detachable controller
module is gonna pack some extra battery
in it so it's not gonna suck from the
internal battery on the device and will
also feature a dedicated key that
they're calling the shark key which will
immediately give you maximum performance
for your gaming need kind of like a
boost button with dedicated hardware so
you feel real special when you hit it
you're like I'm about to go into game
mode alright you make your friends
jealous it's stuck in regular mode you
hit the overdrive straight to the top
top of the leaderboards victory royale
what's it called in pub to you in your
head
chicken dinner Kirk bringing the
bringing to eat with the data alright
cool so there it is the black char
coolest name ever for a phone I want you
guys to let me know down in the comments
is this interesting to you are you gonna
go shout at Johnny so I can give you
guys a closer look do you want a gaming
phone do you care what are you looking
for in a device I want to see your
ultimate specs for a gaming phone down
in the comments below okay thank you
very much for joining new cool stuff at
a later date
shortly tomorrow in five minutes I'm not
sure okay cool thanks ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
