demonstration of the new touch ID system
on the iPhone 5s it's very simple to
access you simply go into the general
settings followed by passcode and
fingerprint in my case I've already got
a passcode set up as a backup of course
if the fingerprint sensing fails you
still want to be able to get into your
device and keep it secure adding a
fingerprint is really easy you select at
the bottom there I've got two
fingerprints already in the system one
of them is my thumb but I'm going to go
ahead and reconfigure it here you simply
repeatedly tap down on the sensor you
don't need to click the button you just
hold your thumb overtop or any finger
for that matter and then the phone will
give you feedback haptic feedback it
will buzz when it wants you to lift your
finger and then place it back down and
the reason that this occurs is so that
it can get you know a bunch of different
angles from your fingerprint because we
unlock our device from a number of
different angles and it wants to make
sure that it's not going to have missed
presses that are going to delay your
ability to get into your device the next
thing you will do after you get past
that first portion is it'll ask you to
rearrange your grip and the reason for
this is because people use their device
in a number of different grips and
actually more often than not you end up
unlocking your device or hitting your
home button with the side of your thumb
and so it also wants to have an accurate
representation as far as what the side
of your thumb looks like so here you can
see I've adjusted my grip I've repeated
the same sequence as I did on the
earlier stage and just like that it is
ready to function and it unlocks
seamlessly and quickly there's really no
analysis at least you can't seem to see
whatever analysis is going on you simply
hit the button and the phone unlocks and
as you'll see here in a moment when I
try to unlock it with my index finger or
any other finger for that matter it will
tell me to try again because these
fingers are not in the system I haven't
set them up and this of course would be
the same case for any other individual
that came along and tried to use their
finger to unlock the device so it works
exactly as advertised quicker than I
expected it to be and we'll have to wait
and see how it works over time in
different conditions you know maybe if
my hands aren't as clean as they are
right now or if it's raining outside
you know I'll obviously have to spend
some time to figure out how it's going
to function under those circumstances
anyway guys that wraps up this little
demonstration of the new touch ID system
on the iPhone 5s if you enjoyed this
video make sure to leave a thumbs up and
also remember to subscribe for more
content like this alright guys thanks
for watching I'll catch you on the next
episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
