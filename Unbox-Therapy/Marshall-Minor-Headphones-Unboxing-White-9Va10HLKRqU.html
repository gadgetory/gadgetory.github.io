therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Marshall Minor headphones I recently
unboxed the Marshall majors obviously
the difference between the two is one
one is much more major than the other
the measures of the larger style of the
two whereas the minors our Marshalls
in-ear offering but a lot of the other
features are actually the same you've
got the same inline microphone and
remote one of the differences though is
that since these are in in-ear style
you're going to get a number of
different tips to suit your individual
ear canal because everybody's ears are a
little bit different I suppose I
shouldn't say canal because these don't
actually go all the way inside of your
ear canal instead they sort of sit on
the outside of a very different design
at first you're kind of like what am I
going to do with that how where do I put
that but after you insert them you
actually realize they're surprisingly
comfortable for something that appears
to be so unorthodox the actual sizable
portion the part where you change the
size actually sits on the actual
exterior of your ear and you got to pick
one that works you might even have to
pick one independent of the other
depending on if your ears are identical
so that's that's very exciting now
you've also got this adapter here to
bypass the microphone this is actually
going to give you a slightly better
audio or I should say less
susceptibility to interference
especially on older audio equipment I'll
tell you more about that in a second but
first let's talk about the headphones so
here's a better look a nice up-close and
personal look and as you notice it's all
about the gold it's all about the bling
on these babies gold and white a real
nice look as far as I'm concerned here
is that inline microphone / play/pause
button etc music stop you know grab a
phone call all those beautiful things
that one of those little buttons can do
you've also got a little clip here to
clip it onto your shirt and manage some
of that cable that you've got and a
really nice gold-plated mini-jack
connector on the very end fairly robust
very similar to the one on the Marshall
major headphones now they're using a
nylon wrapped I believe it's nylon
wrapped it's a wrapped weave style cable
so it's got a nice texture to it
probably pretty durable probably pretty
tough as well and here's how you remove
that portion that I mentioned earlier
and in order to get the right fit to fit
that you're looking for they're really
easy to take in and out the
pre-installed size is medium I believe
there is also a small a large and an
extra-large
so there you have it the medium works
best for me by the way here is that
cable that I mentioned earlier I should
say adapter and you've got a little
preamble here telling you why why they
include this this is pretty cool
basically like I said earlier it's you
this kind of cable with a microphone and
is an unprotected cable and what that
means is that the signal is prone to
interference or any cable with a
microphone in line and that little cable
adapter is going to bypass that so you
get higher quality audio potentially
especially out of older audio sources
unbalanced sources
it's getting pretty technical there so
here's some paperwork from Marshalls
similar to the stuff you've got with the
major if you recently watch that video
it outlines both of Marshalls offerings
if you haven't seen my unboxing of the
Marshall majors in white as well I'll
put a link down in the description to
that video after all these are very
similar headphones from a styling
standpoint but very different headphones
from a design standpoint so you want to
check out both videos if you haven't yet
