device just showed up pixels late
because as many of you know I've been
running this experiment with the iPad
pro I am going to go laptop lists
computer less with the exception of this
right here if you want to call it a
computer I don't know if it is yet if
that's what's going on with the iPad
this is Google's Play and a similar
scenario a futuristic computing device a
chrome and Android based device a
combination a hybrid along with a cool
looking keyboard case and pen input
Google's bet on the future computing
actually kind of looks a lot like apples
just with a slight difference on the
software side 8th gen Core i5 processor
8 gigs of ram 128 gigs of storage now I
have been using this guy this has been
the experiment what I'm gonna do two
weeks just this no computer at all I
have some thoughts I have some feelings
as you would expect that's the 11 inch
version super portable twelve point
three inches so this one lines up more
competitively against the bigger iPad
pro so just keep that in mind
anyhow there is the device whoo I notice
it has these big front facing speaker
grilles as you can see right there it's
so simple look at the back of it just a
tiny little G up there that's it we have
some metallic connectors down on the
bottom for the various accessories to
type-c connectors your power switch
slash fingerprint scanner recessed very
nice type c2 mini jack connector
included no headphone jack on here
unfortunately
Oh 3,000 by 2,000 pixels it's a full
Chrome browser of course that's the
advantage here full powered Chrome which
is kind of one of the things that people
complain about not having living the
iPad lifestyle this is chrome like you
would have it on a legitimate laptop now
it's not just Chrome you can also
install Android apps on here
multitasking button here which will show
you the various things that you have
open at any given time the keyboard the
circular keys that's a very unusual
choice this is a throwback alright so
what is this made out of I don't know I
don't know this soft interior it can go
in a couple of different standing
Styles just for a comparison the iPad
one has this sort of fabric style cover
on on top of the keys over here this is
plastic like hard plastic ooh there's no
flex it feels more similar to an actual
laptop keyboard that is encouraging I'll
give you a little sneak preview on my
experience with the iPad this keyboard
is gonna have a tough time replacing a
really nice laptop keyboard you just
that is a pretty strong magnet there
this goes here what is this origami
thing going on oh my goodness wow that's
pretty cool the way that this magnet
system works in the back allows you to
put any angle on the display it kind of
clicks in at this maximum degree as you
pull it up it will also stop at the very
bottom at the minimum angle like
surprisingly sturdy maybe even laughable
you might be able to put this on your
actual lab and anywhere in between as
you can see here this implementation
here very attractive I must say and
that's right there's a trackpad let's
see here oh wow okay oh this is
laughable you can lap this it's not a
laptop per se but you can lap it I'm
lapping it definitely on a desk surface
you are going to forget you're on a
tablet because of how they decided to
design this keyboard case and if you
want to take it a step further you can
use the pixel book pen all right oh just
like that no pairing no nothing I'm
tapping precision here I launch a
browser I go to YouTube and so on
scrolling so this gives you this
interesting kind of input it's a type of
input that I've actually been enjoying
on my iPad experiment kind of nice at
the kitchen table to have these
alternative options for how you would
interact with your display this of
course is not something you would
typically do on a laptop I don't know
there's something about this particular
angle that makes you want to reach out
and touch it big disadvantage between
this and the iPad is like where do you
put the pen there's no will there's no
magnet right is there anywhere to put
the pen
oh I found a magnet there are you gonna
do that is that how they show it off
well it would stay there you know I mean
I don't know if it's intentional or if
I'm just picking up the magnets
underneath it's better than nowhere I
would say this is magical dare I say
here we go
like there's something about that which
is just so convenient and you know where
it is it's a strong magnet and it
charges the pen this one on the other
hand takes a triple-a battery so
quadruple a battery let's do a little
typing test on this circular keyboard
the quick brown fox you know I could get
used to this I like the look I like the
circular Keys the trackpad is actually
really nice like better than I expected
me I don't know maybe it's not macbook
level but i think it's better than the
pixel book let's test the speakers
11 inch iPad pro course firing out of
the sides both sides
maybe a little more clarity here it kind
of firing at you but I think a little
more bass what they've done with the
speaker setup on here is actually really
impressive considering the form factor
actually another quick test while we're
here thinness wise there's the iPad pro
11 inch versus the pixel slate you can
see they're both impossibly thin all
right so listen it's a full fledged
Chrome OS Chromebook capable of Android
apps a little bit mobile a little bit
desktop with iOS you get opened up to
the various apps that are touch-centric
that exist in that app store over here
though you get a full on Chrome browser
with all the things that you can do in a
desktop or laptop browser you get two
USB type-c ports you get the
front-facing speakers of course there's
a fingerprint unlock on the iOS side on
the iPad pro side you have the face on
lock face ID just like the new iPhones
here you have this pen compared to the
Apple pencil that one has a really
convenient place to go where it stays
all the time
this one less so it'll stick to the back
but it's kind of like it doesn't even
feel like it really should go there
definitely can't live there when you
have the thing propped up in laptop form
from a form-factor perspective it just
feels like a laptop when you're on it at
a desk the fact that you can pick any
angle with the keyboard case also
simulates a laptop experience a lot more
closely than the keyboard case on the
iPad that said for strictly touch based
input I think that's kind of where the
iPad shines I'm intrigued enough here to
consider possibly flipping to this one
after the iPad pro experience
I've already been laptop less almost 10
days I'm still living I'm still
breathing
maybe after that one I go pixel slate
here and this can be my main and only
computing device I think that might be
the best way to evaluate it's exciting
times though finally we're seeing some
real developments in the mobile
computing space and not just smartphones
so far laptops are still mostly better
at most
but we're starting to see some some
cracks in the foundation of the laptop
rain including devices like this one the
pixel slave its Chrome I think I should
compare and contrast the two you let me
know if you're interested that's been an
unboxing of the brand new pixel slate I
think it's pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
