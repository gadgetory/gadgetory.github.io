right here these are the air pods of
course from Apple but they recently came
out with a version too and a lot of
people they had different expectations
they wanted more they wanted something
new fresh different
alright I've concluded though there's no
difference and it didn't happen not from
Apple at least but that doesn't mean it
couldn't happen elsewhere so I've
actually had my eye on these this
company color where they take
pre-existing air pods they put
automotive grade paint onto here custom
paint jobs I've actually got two pairs
one of them apparently is matte black
and the other one is glossy black this
is the color that a lot of people wanted
to see from Apple they thought hey if
you're gonna do another version give us
some color options Apple didn't do it
but color where did hey Siri what's the
fastest way to Steve Jobs theater how
much would you pay well if you wanted to
get some of these custom ear pods done
up for yourself 389 bucks so what is
that you're paying like pretty much
double so $1.99 and then cut these
custom ones 389 us that's uh that's a
spicy price point right there so not for
the sensitive wallets out there in the
world this is if you love air pods but
you just can't deal with the toothbrush
you know the toothbrush look Jack you've
seen it before let's check out which one
is better it's kind of funny that you
know people say the pod itself looks
like a toothbrush and then obviously the
case that they're in
looks like dental floss so there's a lot
of dental reference because they know
their dentist
is a specialist oh they did the case as
well a card here about protecting your
paint body sweat and oils can range from
neutral to moderately acidic an alcohol
pad so this is the glossy one oh it
looks really nice actually woah look at
that that looks so much better than the
dental floss
can we all agree how much better does
that look than the dental floss
it's automotive grade paint so it's it's
cured is baked on there like it would be
on your car you open it up the inside is
still white which kind of makes sense
because that's where your contact points
are how about this how about that
that's a different look Jack what do you
say man I mean it's still a weird design
in air pod it's still me mobile but it's
less mean territory you don't just look
over in the distance and see the the
toothbrush hanging out of people's ear
so that's the glossy one this over here
is the matte finish that's interesting
okay so obviously sort of a more dull
appearance to it some people really like
matte black I'm a fan of matte black but
there are downsides to it feel like it
can pick up fingerprints smudges and
this is the matte finish over here on
the actual air pod so it's a different
look I think people are gonna you know
people might like this one I think is
not the best buy though out of the two
just because of the durability aspect
and how long it's gonna look good for I
feel like this particular model is not
gonna look as good for as long let's
make sure they function and sound
properly because we got to trust color
we're here with the hard-earned cash we
got to go there we go okay connect
you got any requests Jack I knew you're
gonna say that Jack and Led Zeppelin and
Jack and Stanley Kubrick that's all you
need to know which song though
I mean their air pots they sound just as
you'd expect them to sound they don't
mess with the functionality at all it's
a slick job that they do and this is
hard work man
this is gonna be some of you in the
audience that like I'm gonna pay what
for what like get out of my face if you
just were to imagine if you were to take
on the task yourself of taking a pair of
air pods and trying to give them a
commercial-grade ready for customer type
of appearance you would realize how
difficult this type of an outcome would
be but you get this exclusive look will
they do let's get your opinion real
quick matte black glossy black I think
it's like a preference that extends
beyond that I really like the matte I
think mainly because it's so slick and
clean I mean the glossy ones great too
but it's just I've always been geared
towards that one matte black okay yeah
there's no coat here it's not wearing a
coat no it's not but yeah I would still
go for that you still go for a matte
black I'm curious about the wireless
charging should we try that oh yeah
definitely that's a good call hey Jack I
feel like the overhead is darker than
usual to you hey I'm just talking hey
I'm just talking okay
wireless charger Willie does request
very important obviously we need this
function to still keep working so boom
cool Matt works glossy works lovely the
mythical black ear plugs not from Apple
but hey they live they're alive and well
