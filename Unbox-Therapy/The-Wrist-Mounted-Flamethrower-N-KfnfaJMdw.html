through a box I'm like pretty aware of
what I'm looking at little power brick
slash micro USB toys it's always a good
sign this thing is a lot more
complicated than I expected lives like

careful with this stuff to be quite
honest especially after I signed away my

stuff cotton is what creates the
fireball so you pull off a little piece
