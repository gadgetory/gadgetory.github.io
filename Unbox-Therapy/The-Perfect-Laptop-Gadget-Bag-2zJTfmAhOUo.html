packs a Z 400 and I'm really pumped
about it which seems kind of strange Lou
why would you be so excited about a bag
this is not your average everyday laptop
carrying case bag etc this one has some
crazy anti-theft features that have me
excited as I've said it's slash proof it
has this internal kind of mesh that
means a blade can't get into it it kind
of looks like a webbed bike lock type
scenario it's also got anti-theft
zippers this one can slide under this
portion here to make this compartment
hard to get at it's pretty crazy
there's a lot of Technology inside of
this bag and that's important because of
the technology you put inside it and by
that I'm not necessarily talking about
your special headphones I mean your
laptop your phone things that store
personal information because ultimately
that information is what is valuable I
can feel a little bit more secure having
it inside of here versus your standard
bag the zippers as I mentioned are not
only lockable but they're pretty
high-end to begin with you can hear how
well that locks so a pen for example
won't be capable of puncturing that
zipper like it can on other cheaper bags
you can see clips of this on youtube if
you don't believe me and then the zipper
is locking together using this little
magnet on here which is pretty cool
gives you this really solid connection
point for use with the lock now has some
other sort of travel features that I
look for in a bag regardless of the
security like this zipper portion here
which allows for a pass through so that
you can put this on your luggage you can
see have these like spring-loaded
regions here on the key
and this will allow you to put a water
bottle in the side if you choose to but
it also allows for you to get a little
extra space to bring the zipper down
even further than you would on a normal
bag this gives you significantly more
access to the inside security is the
main feature here but of course it's got
to fit all of your stuff or else what is
the point so in this case I have all of
the usual things that I travel with I've
got my 15-inch MacBook Pro there's also
a separate tablet sleev so unlike a lot
of laptop bags that only accommodate
your laptop this one will accommodate a
tablet as well there's an iPad in there
there's enough space inside in the main
pouch for some sunglasses these are my
go to travel headphones right now
Bluetooth lightweight from Sony NFC
pairing very long battery life around 17
hours just a super convenient headphone
to travel with actually if you want to
check out any of these products that are
inside my travel case I'll link them
down in the description a standard power
brick that's in there the MX master
Mouse of course a couple of phones with
a specific pocket for them there's an
iPhone as well as the s6 active which
you saw in my recent video battery
backup another one of my favorites with
the built-in cables some cleaning
solution a cleaning cloth and a pen
now there's also zipper pockets in here
so you can use those for things that I
don't know you don't want to bounce
around I have a power brick in there but
that's completely up to you now here's
the other cool tech feature the RFID
safe and this has a special blocking
material so this is where you should put
your wallet with your rfid enabled
credit cards the special blocking
material prevents high-tech identity
thieves from downloading and stealing
personal information stored on
microchips in your passport as well as
your credit card so your passports going
to go in that slot as well the material
of this pouch blocks frequencies from 10
megahertz to 3 gigahertz
very cool they've also got a big pocket
in here for anything else I have a
couple of snacks in there look at all
this stuff and then of course
here your pouch where I keep some advil
cold and sinus these are a must
side note these are so that you never
have blocked ears you know that feeling
a terrible feeling when you get off an
airplane it allows your ears to
pressurize in a more stable fashion
instead of all at once when the descent
occurs or when the takeoff occurs ascent
descent takeoff landing whatever you
want to call it everybody has
experienced that terrible feeling of
plugged ears ear planes that's what
they're called these are cool anyhow
it's made out of this canvas type
material which is going to be
water-resistant but it's also according
to pacsafe going to have a kind of
vintage effect over time of fabric that
gets better with age as you can see so
after you've got the bag completely
filled up then it's time to lock all of
your things in place using this very
cool pacsafe contraption so you can see
I can slide it up and down very easily
then I can take my zippers put them on
this little rail lift back up and lock
them in place then you can use a
standard TSA lock on the bottom of this
if you choose to or you can just leave
it like this so the last thing to show
you is the strap and I love the way it
tucks away in this compartment so it
stores in this really convenient
location over here which zippers up as
well so it's not gonna slide out
accidentally it's also slash proof and
can be used to tether the bag to a solid
object
you're probably wondering now what this
thing cost it's not cheap I think I paid
around $200 it probably fluctuates a
little bit on Amazon and I'll link that
in the description but usually you're
gonna have to pay a premium to get
something this advanced and I'm gonna
have this bag for a long time I'm gonna
be experiencing this bag living with
this bag have a very intimate
relationship with my bags and this might
be my new wife my new bag wife pacsafe
z400 check it out thank you as always
for watching and I'll catch on the next
episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
