think are pretty cool and a little bit
unusual at least a couple of them so
that's a quick intro they're all around
or under 50 bucks let's start out with
what should we start out with let's
start out with this one crystal wireless
speaker Alley giant tele giant it's a
Bluetooth speaker it's actually see
through this isn't the first time I've
looked at a translucent speaker and it's
one of the coolest things I've ever
looked at on this desk I don't care
ooh it has a texture to it the glass you
would have on a shower stall or
something like that
auxiliary in as well also a base port on
it so hopefully the sound is pretty good
high-quality auxiliary cable hello there
that's me all right yeah that's red now
green blue remember it's only 50 bucks
bass port is actually working quite
nicely it's not just visual it's
actually functional that CV just went
off fifty bucks I think it's a bit of a
deal for 50 the powerup darked convert
your paper airplane into a jet Konnect
your powerup dart control it with your
smartphone crash through carbon-fiber
body we're gonna have to obviously test
that 25 km/h this is it right here whoa
this piece is the magical part you see
the antenna right here and the propeller
oh there's multiple models invader model
oh wow you can actually fold these up is
that landing gear some sort of balancing
piece a different cover for the front
end Willy do here he's gonna do the
construction while we move on to the
next product the Browse Buster this
thing is wild one of my favorite videos
I've ever seen in my entire life this
thing claims to keep you awake when
you're starting to drowse off when
you're driving you get the lean going
you put the window down you slap
yourself whatever you need to do you
have a coffee this thing claims to
somehow stimulate you combined with
modern technology its uses impulses on
the acupoints on your earlobe to
maintain your brain's proper fader
frequencies in weight through your
earlobes so that that can't happen okay
this is it this is where the magic
happens a carrying pouch this is
completely in Chinese so I'm gonna just
have oh there we go
English the first smart device with CTM
acupuncture and moxibustion ever comes
to the market it's good for drowsy
driver but may not be good for those
suffer from narcolepsy
all right so if one of these that'll
clip on your seatbelt like that that's a
bit of a look
oh it's a little tingly oh wow I am
definitely not sleeping Wow Oh baby I
did not expect that
oh yeah
wow that's probably better than a shot
of coffee it's tiny little electrical
shocks but consistent like what is this
shock therapy uh get over your will
you're trying this one the shock King
himself
Oh oh yes painful dude you couldn't fall
asleep with that going on
no no no that's busting your drowsiness
oh look at the people I might eat that
in my car I like this Hannah cool it
works it would definitely wake you up
yeah
button for impulsive volume adjustment I
don't know if you're getting how much
you choose to get oh oh oh that actually
hurt well there's that's the maximum I
want Jack to try and sell Jacky
all right thanks well thanks and the
last thing I've got here the adventure
tape adventure tape was invented so that
you're always prepared for the
unexpected
it is a tape isn't sticky to the
it isn't sticky to the touch at all but
it is sticky to it self-repairing
bicycle parts with it washing it it's
completely reusable the thing exploded
and the strength of this tape was
responsible for it Jack brought me a 25
pound weight that is very heavy
wow that's stretchy though this looks
like less weight than it is that's 25
pounds folks it doesn't feel like it's
gonna be able to lift it up the tables
gonna be destroyed I think I'm gonna go
back here getting very thin oh can you
see that whoa I thought for sure it was
gonna smash that's 25 pounds even though
it seemed out it goes back exactly how
it was boom I didn't overlap it nothing
I don't know man it seems like these
guys are for real this ain't no
electrical tape is some serious stuff so
go check out their Kickstarter video I
think this is cool Wow look at this
little guy the landing gear Willie do
with the beautiful construction click
that on there's an app that goes with it
here we go whoa Oh jack check it out
the steering see that all right here we
go
that's an outdoor toy
Hey
it's not like a quadcopter drone
situation where it can hover it needs a
runway it needs some speed and even if
you mess up your plane you fold up
another one you get yourself a Willie
new and you fold up another one
as a little project I I think it's just
kind of cool it's kind of fun and you
could make an unlimited number of these
paper airplanes so that's the powerup
dart that's 45 bucks I think it's kind
of a cool little experiment a cool gift
so there you have it four unique gadgets
I thought there was some pretty cool
stuff in there if you want to check out
