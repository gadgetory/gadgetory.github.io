one of my friends myself along with an
amazing group of other youtubers decided
to do something about it
yo you got to stuff man we're going to
visit Austin Evans in the middle of the
country to surprise him because he
recently had a shitty thing a terrible
thing happened and his home essentially
the idea here's the community came
together to to subsidize the rebirth
surprise Austin
if we stayed here so I wanted to come
out of that house and spoil the whole
damn thing I know but it's just like we
get one chance at this
110 all right so we have we have
Austin's dad involved now so he knows
what's going on and he's gonna help us
surprise him so we're gonna place the
Mac Pro at the front of the house he's
gonna go and get Austin tell them
there's something for him on the front
step and we're gonna wait around the
corner on this side of the house over
here right on the side of the house and
try to capture his reaction being
complete secret so we got lucky his dad
came outside without being prompted so
how we're all set up so here's the Mac
Pro 6-4 there you go perfect this is
intense so that's the Mac Pro at the
edge Austin's dad is gonna go get him
and we're gonna hide right around this
corner over here ready when you are
Hey all right guys just going out right
now
we came from California
so this macros from a lot of different
people actually you know there's more
stuff to yeah it's like from 14
different people every single person who
makes tech videos basically
oh yeah series like Billy series like
this is happening this is happening oh
and I know also fullscreen has a 500
bucks for Best Buy as well why I'm dude
I'm just like I like shaking right now I
just like the cup making this super
awkward I guess the only thing I really
have to say is I really admire your
attitude I am pretty sure almost any
other one of us wouldn't have been able
to have the the positivity to joke about
our clothes being definitely dry when
walking among the wreckage of all of our
stuff so I'm just happy to have been
able to help in any way and I hope you
really enjoy your
I mean you know there could be a little
bit inside to contribute to Apple's
coffers but totally worth it
and we're a fat man and keep on keepin
on
once I've Austin started here's the bad
news I'm from another day I hated seeing
that on Twitter but hopefully by today
you're feeling a little bit better in a
better mood I just remember to keep your
head up and all that stuff that you lost
can be replaced I were just glad that
you made it out safely as well as
everyone else and also make sure you
enjoyed that new Mac Pro I don't have
one myself I'm excited to see what
videos you're gonna make on it so have
fun with it and yeah just be positive
and things will get better it was to
Boston its marques just once send
positive vibes away and say props for
being and staying so positive through it
all and it's unreal how amazing that is
honestly I thought I had a hard time
with a hurricane which was like a couple
hours then a little while with no power
and then it's over then it's all back to
normal and so you know to lose as much
as you did and be right back on your
feet making videos again already is
amazing so hopefully gift helps and I
and I'm sure many hundreds of thousands
of people are excited to see more Austin
Evans videos so hopefully we get more of
that

hey what's up Austin this is DOM and I
am so sorry to hear about what happened
to you that is a horrible way to start
up the year but I know for a fact that
you will be back on your feet in no time
and that is just because I know you're a
driven person I can see it in your
youtube work ethic and I'm sure it
reflects tenfold in your personal life
so keep those positive attitudes flowing
