another video and today we're taking a
look at another mechanical keyboard but
this one is a little bit unusual that's
because most mechanical keyboards are
wired now I went on a search hunt
looking for something that was wireless
you know me I try to eliminate wires
referee can if you've seen pictures of
my set up on Instagram you should go
check it out if you haven't but if
you've seen those pictures and you know
I'm trying to eliminate all wires from
the visual field but I still want a
quality mechanical key switch because
those membrane keyboards are not quite
as satisfying so I did a little search
this is one of the keyboards that I
found and what I liked about it is not
only is it Wireless it's also backlit
and it's small it doesn't take up too
much space on your desk and in my case I
don't use the numerical keypad either so
maybe this one will be suitable I know
that the key switches are not the
highest quality they're not cherry MX
blues or reds or browns hopefully this
one is satisfying enough and after all
it's wireless which is very appealing to
me it uses Bluetooth technology here on
the back of the box you can see those in
the canticle key switches that I talked
about it's also a very slim keyboard
which is appealing to the eyes as
multimedia Keys adjustable backlight so
let's go ahead jump inside the box and
see what this rap hoo KX mechanical
keyboard is all about I'll put it on
this side here oh you may have seen my
new multi-tool in that shot as well the
Leatherman charge I'll link it in the
description part off you guys know what
that's about
inside fairly simplistic we have the
Quick Start Guide it's a keyboard get
with the times and here it is very slim
for a mechanical keyboard damn I got to
say that's it inside the box Oh charge
cable - I got to say that's a pretty
good look you can see it has like this
brushed aluminum on the sides you have
touch sensitive multimedia Keys up on
the top and as I mentioned before it's
backlit now the question is how
these key switches feel let me go ahead
whoa those are way different not sure
I'm going to be able to get used to that
so it's obviously very compact and
because of that that key spacing seems
to reflect that which is the reason it's
kind of a strange adjustment they're
very tight together they are satisfying
though this keyboard does come in a
couple of different colors as well this
one has the black keys with this
aluminum or brushed metallic look you
can also scale with white keys and then
there's some colorful options as well
there's a red version and I think
there's a teal version also I think
there's a yellow version so if you want
to get funky with it on the bottom you
have some feet here the receiver lives
in the back of the unit I guess that's
where you store it yeah a little storage
area and then you have an on/off switch
followed by a microUSB port for charging
it now obviously I'm not the most
skilled piper in the world I'm more of a
an editor as most of you know I was a
little plastic on the top here and so
what I look for in a keyboard is a
little bit different I suppose than
somebody who's typing a lot of words you
know I'm doing a lot of shortcuts and
things like that but I'm not typing
letters to the president at least not
yet as of right now I'm gonna go ahead
and say that I feel like these keys are
placed too tightly together for my meaty
paws
all right guys so that wraps up this
unboxing and overview of the rapoo KX
wireless mechanical keyboard a rare
breed mechanical keyboard but one of
your few options in this space if that's
what you're looking for thanks as always
