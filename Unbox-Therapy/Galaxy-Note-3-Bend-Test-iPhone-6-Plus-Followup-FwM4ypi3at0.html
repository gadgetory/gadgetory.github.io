back you probably have already watched
the iPhone 6 plus bend test but I got a
huge number of requests to do another
device so I have a note 3 here which is
a similar form factor and people just
want to know I guess is is this bending
something to be expected on any device
this size we're about to find out but
one more thing I want to mention about
the 6 plus as I attempted to bend it
back to its original form it cracked in
that location and it also cracked the
glass on the screen as I hope you can
see there in that image so we ended up
with a crack after all so a little bit
less usable than just a bend so I don't
know what my recommendation is if yours
ends up bent probably just leave it that
way because when you attempt to bend it
back you might very well end up cracking
the display along with it but enough
about the 6 plus is this unusual for a
large device let's find out now using
the note 3 let's go
so this no.3 was actually dead so I just
got a battery backup here to charge it
up should have checked that before I
started recording but this is amazing
with the same or maybe more force this
thing hasn't bent at all or it bent it I
mean it bent as I was doing it it was
creaking and making all kinds of crazy
noises but ultimately no damage let's go
ahead one more time here and try this
again with it plugged in this time just
plugged into a battery backup so here we
go that is as hard as I can push and
nothing oh it's a little warped it's a
little bit warped you can probably see
that it's a tiny bit warped but wow that
device is completely functioning that's
crazy so the Galaxy Note 3 survives the
exact same Ben test that the iPhone 6
plus failed that I did not expect with a
plastic build but there you have it
materials like plastic in many ways
offer I don't know the best solution for
durability in some cases I guess this is
a good example of that obviously not the
most beautiful material to hold in your
hand but if you're looking for something
that can withstand a torture test like
this then I guess the note technically
wins this particular battle we'll have
to wait and see what happens with the
note 4 when it comes out it's launching
very shortly but at this moment we have
a completely functional note 3 with very
little battery power because
didn't have it charged in advance
anyways that wraps up this video these
were some painful tests to do although
in this particular case the note 3
survived but let me know what you think
down in the comments is that what you
expect it to see probably not alright
that wraps up this video leave a thumbs
