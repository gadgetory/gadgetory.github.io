special unboxing for you
it's the Killzone 3 Helghast Edition and
if you're familiar with special editions
and collector's editions of games then
you know this particular edition has
gone over and above what we're used to
as far as what kind of extras are
included in any of those style editions
the most prevalent of all inclusions in
this particular unboxing is the Helghast
replica head it's not quite full-size
but impressive nonetheless and
incredibly detailed we're not going to
get there right away let's start with
the game as we open up the box we can
see we've got some nice artwork on the
disc and as you would expect we have
that mature rating as well which is
probably well deserved in the case of
Killzone 3 next we have our SOCOM for
beta voucher which is also going to use
the PlayStation Move system and lastly
we have the Killzone 3 instruction
manual again with some beautiful artwork
on the cover and on the back we can see
the official PlayStation Move
sharpshooter I'm going to have an
unboxing of that later in the week next
is the hardcover art of Killzone and
this has some beautiful artwork it's
really nice to get a book like this so
you can get an idea of where these
imaginative ideas start and the artwork
behind the game is really the
inspiration that's where it all begins
next we've got the action figure and
I've seen action figures in a number of
different collectors and limited edition
games and I can tell right away that
this one is heavier than what I'm used
to which is a good
thing it means it's probably better
quality having opened the DC Universe
collector's edition I can say straight
away that this particular action figure
is of better quality than the Batman
that's included there you've got movable
joints and a much better feel overall
here's the Killzone 3 Helghast Edition
voucher for your downloadable content
and lastly we've got the showstopper the
replica Helghast head which also acts as
a game holder if you want to use it that
way the details in person are very
impressive it's going to look cool
wherever you put it as you can see we've
got a number of different materials in
use on this replica there are a number
of different plastics as well as a 9
line head strap where the goggles are
attached you can also use it as a games
holder as I told you before just by
lifting the head up slowly anyway check
out our channel lots more to look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
