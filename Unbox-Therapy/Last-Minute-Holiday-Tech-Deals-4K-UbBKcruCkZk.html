make a last-minute holiday deals type
video for you I realize Christmas is
fast approaching and you probably have
done a lot of your shopping but if
you're like myself sometimes you wait
till the very last second for certain
individuals and their gifts but I have
good news for you if you order on Amazon
today or in the next couple of days you
can still get your items in time for the
holidays
so whether it be a gift for someone else
or you're just looking for a great deal
for yourself on a cool piece of tech or
consumer electronics I've got some
really awesome options here that are
definitely worth looking at so without
any more hesitation let's jump straight
into them and see how quickly we can get
through this alright so the very first
deal is on a camera it's a Canon t3i now
I started out using a t2i so I'm
obviously a big fan of the series even
till this day I shoot on a Canon 60d on
a regular basis which is sort of the
bigger brother of this camera so if you
want to get into video and you still
want to have some awesome stills and you
want have interchangeable lenses and all
the flexibility that comes with a
digital SLR a t3i is a great way to get
started and the good news is it's
available right now on Amazon for four
hundred and thirty seven dollars you
won't see this price until you put the
item into your cart but four hundred and
thirty seven bucks is crazy because back
when I got my first t3 or t2 I sorry I
remember it being a lot closer to a
thousand bucks so for four hundred and
thirty seven bucks you can get a digital
SLR that shoots awesome HD video at 24
frames per second now to go with that
camera you're gonna want some memory so
I selected some SanDisk
class 10 memory the 32 gigabyte chip is
only $29 today you guys know Amazon
always has awesome deals on SanDisk
memory especially when you're looking
for speedy memory when you want to do a
lot of HD recording you will need class
10 or above or at least I recommend it
so that you're not going to have any
issues down the road with those clips
that you record it or think that you've
recorded all the deals we're talking
about today are gonna be down in the
description of this video as usual and I
have tried my best to link a couple of
extra ones for international people so
there's some UK links as well as some
Canadian
down below as well the next item staying
in the camera sort of realm but don't
worry it's not all about cameras today
the next item is the Sony rx100 mark 2 I
recently picked up this camera myself I
paid full price it's got to be the best
point-and-shoot camera on the planet
right now at least in my opinion has
some amazing features in awesome F 1.8
lens it's on sale right now not a huge
reduction in price it's still 698 which
is a lot of money for a point-and-shoot
camera but that is a $50 reduction on
the retail price and as I said before
it's hands down the best point-and-shoot
you're gonna buy that money can buy has
a huge sensor a huge lens you can't go
wrong shoots awesome video as well next
up we have an SSD so we are moving in a
different direction now we're talking
about PC components computer components
a Samsung 840 Evo 250 GB obviously you
can get larger or smaller sizes I picked
the 250 gigabyte size because it's sort
of an average I think that would be
reasonable for a lot of people and of
course the price is very reasonable so
this is $90 off right now for a hundred
and sixty bucks on Amazon anybody who
knows anything about SSD knows that
these 840 s are amazing all you have to
do is read the reviews or do a little
bit more research but anyways an awesome
SSD for an amazing price 160 bucks for
250 gigabytes of some of the best
solid-state storage available so if
you've been holding off on upgrading
your laptop or desktop now is the time
to jump in next up I've got a very high
quality webcam the Logitech c920 shoots
full 1080p it rarely goes on sale it's
$30 off right now for 69 so if you need
a better webcam or you don't have one
you can't go wrong with this c920 from
logitech next up i've got one for all of
you gamers out there this is an
outstanding gaming monitor if you're a
competitive gamer or maybe you're just
looking for very high performance
monitor to put on your desk for gaming
either on the pc or on the console this
is the BenQ official MLG monitor for
console gaming it has one millisecond of
response time unbelievable monitor and
an unbelievable deal today
100
ninety-two bucks which is 107 off of
retail check out the link down below if
you're wondering which one I don't have
the official model name in front of me
right here but it will be down in the
description all you need to know is it's
the official console monitor for major
league gaming and you can be sure they
wouldn't be using it if it weren't
incredibly high performance next up
we're gonna get into some audio
equipment as you guys know I am a big
fan of headphones I get the opportunity
to play with a number of different
brands and models here on the channel
first things first you may remember my
video on the Sennheiser momentum on-ear
headphones they also come in a
around-the-ear style they are all on
sale right now on Amazon you know about
50 bucks off as the maximum not a huge
discount but very high quality
headphones and then of course the
legendary ath - M 50s from Audio
Technica these are very famous here on
youtube a number of different youtubers
endorse them and they are also heavily
discounted right now a hundred and two
dollars from the retail price of $1.99
and if you are looking for a budget
version of the M 50s maybe a hundred
bucks is out of your price range for
headphones then you could look at the
ath M 30s which are 43 bucks from a
hundred and nineteen they're the little
brother of the M 50s and still great
headphone next up we've got a 4k display
as many of you know I have recently
started shooting my videos in 4k if you
want to watch this video in full
resolution make sure to select the
original button down below my face but
if you don't have a 4k monitor yet they
have been dropping significantly in
price and one of the brands that is
helping to bring the prices down is a
company called seiki which is sold on
amazon and has some incredible reviews
for an upstart in the television
business now their TVs are stripped down
they are basic there aren't a lot of
bells and whistles they're not Smart TVs
but if you don't need that and you just
want the maximum resolution available
you can get one of these things for not
that much money at all
in fact the 50 inch model that I have
here in this deals video is seven
hundred and sixty nine dollars down from
fifteen hundred on Amazon right now so
if you want to jump into 4k start
watching my videos in full 4k this might
be a great way to do so
especially at are really easy to handle
introductory price or more easy than
some of the other 4k competitors next up
is probably my favorite gift idea in
this entire roundup and that is the
google chromecast it's only $29 on
Amazon right now which is five dollars
off retail they are finally back in
stock because they were so popular I've
got one on my television over there I
use it almost every day I am a big fan
of it it's an incredible value for $30
you really can't go wrong and anyone in
your life could make use of it pretty
much everyone I know wants to stream
their content to their big flat panel
and this gives you the ability to do it
for an incredibly low price point Plus
on top of that you can travel with it
anybody that I've given one of these
things to has loved it so a great
suggestion in my opinion for a holiday
gift idea or if you don't have one pick
one up already they're back in stock
okay let's keep it rolling I have a few
more items to get to next up is another
set of headphones but these ones are
different they are Wireless the
Sennheiser RS 180 headphones these have
an incredible reputation they have a
nice little base station for charging
you can use them on the couch away from
your television if everyone in your
house is sleeping also you can just
untether yourself from your computer if
you're sick of having a little cord
dangling an incredibly high quality
headphone they're also on sale two
hundred and forty-two dollars which is a
savings of a hundred and forty seven on
amazon right now that's the lowest price
i've personally seen on the RS 180 next
we have a speaker system that i've got
sitting right over there and i think it
is an incredible value for money I've
been using it for a while in a number of
different scenarios both on my computer
along with mobile devices sitting over
here with a little Sony dash that we use
slacker radio on they are the Logitech Z
six to three speakers and they're a
great value they're also on sale right
now check out the description for the
pricing so before we close out today's
video I want to give another big shout
out to Squarespace for helping make this
content possible what you're looking at
right now is the official unbox therapy
dot-com website which is built using
Squarespace that's right I'm not talking
about a service that I don't personally
use I put together a website I'm really
happy with using the tools over on
square
space.com and you can do it too it's
probably the easiest way online to get a
website up and running incredibly fast
you can do all kinds of stuff like put a
photo gallery you can put a store in
there if you want to sell merchandise
like we do we have a couple of t-shirts
up on there and there are plenty of
different templates to choose from so no
matter what look you're going for in one
night you can pretty much set something
up maybe even faster than a night I mean
it took me a night or two but if you're
really quick with this kind of stuff you
could probably do it even faster and
I've got even better news for you if you
want to try out the service it's
completely free no obligation head over
to squarespace.com slash unbox and if
you decide to end up using the service
long term make sure to use offer code
unbox 12 to receive a special deal
