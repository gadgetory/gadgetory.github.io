New York shooting a series of videos for
Android pay in the last episode I did a
challenge this time around I decided I
wanted to take a fan shopping I know
it's crazy we went to be in each photo
using nothing but Android pay and we had
a great time
check it out you made it I made it guys
I put out a tweet anybody available
Midtown NYC big challenge and all of a
sudden Jack shows up maybe not the jack
but a jack we are doing an Android pay
shopping challenge here at B&amp;amp;H in New
York we're each going to have 300 bucks
to put together the best the ultimate
travel tech package
maybe there's headphones in there maybe
there's a battery it's up to you that's
the beauty of it you do yours I do mine
300 bucks 30 minutes at the end of it
the fans they get to pick who put
together the better package are you
ready for this I'm ready let's do it
good do so listen I'm upstairs you've
never been to this place before it's
insane in here millions and millions of
dollars of gadgets in here oh yeah and
I'm wasting time talking to you I need a
bag to put all these gadgets in I only
have 300 bucks though so do I really
want to spend 1/3 of it on the bag
laptop area let's go this way for a sec
follow me here
can I put VR in my kit like am I gonna
have a GoPro I mean everybody wants to
have a GoPro but what do I need I need a
PlayStation controller why do I need a
Playstation I don't this is useful to
have in your travel bag broadcast on any
display you bump into
I got that hot new camera 1939 to 1966
I should get some headphones hey we're
traveling we're gonna need headphones no
doubt about it I need to find like 80
bucks as much as it's a contest about
the best stuff it's a contest about the
most stuff because if this is your
travel bag you're kind of limited with
what you take so maybe I should leave
the room leave the space by going with
the 60 pair of $60 pair of headphones
instead of 100 or more monstrosity I
don't know I'm thinking these are kind
of like the lauded m50x is the water
speakers
this one is 66 bucks I could save a
bunch of money go with a $32 with the
nice soft well that's hard to say no to
let's think though if I do a hundred on
this sixty on headphones one sixty
chromecast gets me to 200 I still got a
hundred bucks for a few other things and
they have a three hundred dollar budget
can't blow too much on the bag I'm going
to need a battery checking out any
portable chargers somewhere there where
the bigger boys end it's just over ten
bucks it's not a big batteries only five
thousand but it has the prongs built-in
means I don't need to bring a separate
charger for you what the hell else do I
need we can do a terabyte over here for
50 bucks how much money do I have left
maybe I could get two terabytes two
terabytes I gotta have two terabyte I
got a lot of stuff to carry around man
bugs therapy therapy is something action
cam GoPro II it's pretty good
doesn't totally blow our budget out
figure out grab this one it's us to
Europe figure I'm going to Europe
I feel pretty good I'm pretty common to
what we got
what AC da da da
okay you know what listen if I went over
I went over do I lose immediately if I
went over
oh I was very quick it's the moment of
truth and you're gonna vote in the
comments section below
and determine who's the winner of this
challenge the $300 bnh shopping
challenge a th m4 TX's oh I got that
dirty exes well look at this Beemer
already on the same page here guy he
didn't know going into it
Oh document what you got GoPros were a
little out of the budget but uh we found
this slow-mo
it's got y5 1080p it's small it looks
like you can take a beating so you went
with uh you went with an action cam
you're gonna need storage on top of that
we even got storage
okay 64 gigs from in case it's a laptop
bag I like the color of it I like the
brand I like the multiple compartments
here look how soft that is but the
problem is I spend $99 on this SWAT it
might it affected my other choices where
you save the 30 bucks on the headphones
I save the 30 bucks on the backpack it's
fuzzy
it also fuzzy it's also not as fuzzy but
its fuzziness but it's not a huge
battery it's only five thousand milliamp
hours but what's cool about it is it's
got the power prongs built right in so
it actually becomes your charger as well
so you could leave your charger at home
then your battery backup it's always
charged up and ready to go on that same
note it's got two USB ports six thousand
milliamp hours a little more yeah a
little more painful prongs out you the
prongs don't do you any good up if
you're outside yelling skeleton country
your cat you came I was gonna get one a
gravel power adapter here's a weird one
and what let let me explain this listen
I don't want to watch what's on TV I
want to watch what's on my mobile device
I want to watch the kind of stuff I'm
into chromecast can do it and this is
only 35 bucks fits into a bag you hardly
can notice it in case you're not
traveling alone taking a train somewhere
you're taking a bus somewhere and you
want to split your audio with your
friends this is only like eight bucks a
splitter let's play five way I got an
external drive a two terabyte a lot of
times I'm traveling for work too so an
external drive is with me most of time
so I got a two terabyte then when I'm
over there looking at hard drives I get
this Megan
demonstration of this thing called grip
it it sticks on to any device and allows
that device to not move around to not
float around I mean I don't know how
travel-worthy this is this is genius
it's going in the kit but they dude sold
it to another it's also nice it works on
any fabric glass wood plastic anything
perfect so there you go
I'll here in New York City with a table
full of tech I mean you guys got to let
us know now down in the comments who's
KITT would you rather have 302 67 300
bucks
and ten cents and ten cents okay time
let us know who did the best let us know
whose tech you want for your 300</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
