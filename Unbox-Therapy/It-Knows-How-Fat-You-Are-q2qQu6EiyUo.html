miss Ryan he's back he's been growing
his beard
all work is what
yeah we have a thing called welt that
name it kind of there's a strange
connotation there because I feel like if
I have a welt it's like it's a some sort
of ha it's a smart belt made in Korea
and the welt smart belt assists in your
healthy lifestyle the belt will tell you
if you're fat and that's it folks this
sounds like my worst nightmare
maybe the welt well keep an eye on my
waistline it's an activity tracker as
well so it somehow is calculating your
movement your activity and so on and it
connects to an app via bluetooth it is a
smart belt it'll work with Android and
iOS and it's using low power consumption
Bluetooth 4.1 that's a good thing the
battery lasts 30 plus days that's a big
deal right
plus the package is circular I'm a fan
of circular things now the question is
how does it work how does it function
and how fat am I let's find out you've
seen all the fitness products right
wrist worn the little ones you clip on
the pocket and so on but why not a belt
you wear a belt every day anyways unless
you're Ryan well he's a pervert so Oh
God
oh my god it's a family show ride it's a
family show we have here no but here's
the things a family show yes it's bad
it's bad man oh my all right what do we
have inside here's how you use it
so on and so forth Oh whoo very stylish
look at that obviously the electronics
are housed in this section here it
doesn't look like anything fancy going
on you would never tell and the belt is
here look at that it's labeled should I
be cutting this will he do with the
scissors welt belt yes got it cut in a
school bag on stage what are you doing a
skill bag on stage
you can't even leave
jack is yellow
yes he's angry welcome to welt ooh you
see Jack there's no opportunity for
gender neutral there where does Jack fit
you know what I mean like we can't where
do we put Jack all right Ryan we need a
model there is okay Ryan here we go
thank you very much for joining us it's
been far too long the people they've
missed you it's every comment all I read
Ryan this Ryan that get Rita Lou it's
got to be just Ryan this is the smart
belt all right we'll tell you when
you're overeating it will remind you of
how fat you are
you put a fish you put a few on a couple
of beers yeah a couple beers a couple of
beers you're not a big belt guy I
suppose I wants to just forget it is it
heavy though I mean I just looks a
little clunky actually it's not bad
you'll be selecting your gender here
however you identify yourself yeah this
is the male right am i right
the bigger one the circle with the arrow
I don't know I actually don't only need
to see what happens here I don't know if
it actually connected the sex there all
right sorry the gender Ryan's trying to
connect this oh my goodness here what is
going on just take it as far as you want
I've been like the same lead for
probably I don't know 20 years like
great wow that's why I'd put on a couple
cut the guide line to where you would
fit when you wear the belt on the third
hole oh my goodness look at this
it's like a Victoria's Secret over here
so you want to strap it perfect
watch your shirt watch yeah that's okay
yeah it's a really nice scissors
actually
what was the number that you cut on 15
you just got yourself a new belt the
high tech belt oh you messed it up bad
well yeah you messed it up I knew
something was wrong with this 15 it
wasn't whoa whoa whoa whoa you're gonna
take two off hold my goodness one two
perfect Hey what okay that was oh yeah
yeah you nailed it yes Ryan
the man succeeded affect that the
battery and wealth is near is uh is a is
it powered off check your battery well
tis near okay all right it took us a
moment to figure out exactly what to do
right Ryan all right so where were we
so the thing is you can't pair the belt
with the app unless you're wearing it
the functionality is enabled it's turned
on when you put the belt on and this is
probably why the battery can last for 30
days show the people I've been sitting
for half an hour's yeah that's terrible
okay here he goes that's a hell look at
this model right here you can't tell
that there's anything special going on
it's not too heavy it's it's just like
my belt I haven't we have the waist size
we have the steps taken now I mean we
just got it paired up moments ago so
that's why it's only 62 36 it also
tracks how long you've been sitting so
this is like you know you're sitting at
work maybe yours you're in the cubicle
you're at the desk it's like man have I
really been sitting that long I haven't
gotten up I'm not you got a march around
the office every so often baby you're
jogging mix it up a little bit the app
has these key factors that it tracks it
also tracks the distance you've traveled
and the calories that you've burned a
lot like any other fitness tracker that
just happens to live on your waist like
a lot of people they wear a belt every
day versus this other kind of gear which
might be an extra component extra thing
to carry around from day to week last
seven weeks it's a fitness tracker at a
different
spot with the added effect of the
measurement that's it if you had a big
enough meal where you had to adjust the
whole the loop it's gonna know and it's
gonna yell at you and this is really
what you need in your life it's good for
anybody really yeah what would you pay
for that 60 bucks hey man I can't afford
$100 bail it's 149 Jackman's pay 149 or
Oh Jack pays 149
this one is Ryan's cuz he already sized
it for himself
and who knows next time we see you you
might be cut you hang around with Tom
you'll be eaten uh arugula Tom don't you
dare look at me like that
there he is there he is Dancing with the
Stars right Tom started Thunderball now
