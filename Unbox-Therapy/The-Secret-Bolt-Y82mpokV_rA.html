another video and today I've got
something unusual to show you but very
cool this is a bolt and I'm sure you've
seen one of these before this one is
obviously a little larger than usual
there's actually a reason for that it's
a secret bolt not your average everyday
thing you'd find in a toolbox the top
screws off as you can tell here and it
exposes an internal cavity where you
could store various things that's
completely up to you this will fit
documents as well as a micro SD cards
like this one maybe you want to protect
some files that are on there could be
photos or even video you could store a
little piece of paper that has your
passwords on this could simply roll up
and fit inside so if you're one of those
people it's constantly forgetting your
passwords you could even put a Bitcoin
wallet inside of the bolt and these can
be worth thousands of dollars if you're
concerned at all about getting hacked or
keeping your Bitcoin wallet on your
system on your computer you can have a
paper wallet like this one and hide it
inside something like this
lastly you can put some cash in there
here's a very cool twenty dollar
Canadian bill but it'll work just as
well with US dollars or British pounds
even the euro in fact so if you want to
stash some cash it will very easily fit
inside of this spy book just like that
now a cool feature you might not have
noticed on the spy bolt is the way that
the lid screws on or the top portion it
actually goes in the opposite direction
you're used to so it screws on to the
left and off to the right so if somebody
was to pick this up think it looked a
little bit unusual for any reason and
they would probably instinctually
try to loosen it up by twisting to the
left so in this case it's threaded in
the opposite direction also the
intention here is to store this in a
toolbox or at the bottom of a drawer
possibly amongst other bolts nails so on
and so forth so that it really blends in
when you receive it in its original
package it's actually covered in grease
as well
so when you pick it up you get stuff all
over your hands and you immediately want
to put it down so there are a few
baked-in security measures built into
the secret bolt but the fun doesn't stop
there there's an unlimited number of
things that you could store inside this
bowl let me show you a few batteries
toothpicks one inch wire nails drywall
anchors younger sibling after your
KitKat hide it in the bowl stays fresh
longer you could probably fit at least
six peanut M&amp;amp;Ms one two three four five
Oh
disappointed at the lack of space for
peanut M&amp;amp;Ms try the originals one two
three four five 28 42 43 44 fifty nine
seventy 84 87 115 uh-oh
natural brown rice great for your call
in the secret bolt works just as well
for your pets let's see if these jerky
nubs fit
don't forget about Sparky salted cashews
almonds pecans even Brazil nuts even
mixed nuts what about lemon juice fake
lemon juice banana
alright okay enough enough but in all
seriousness guys this little bolt is
actually a pretty cool way to keep
things confidential just like I
mentioned earlier in this video if you
have a Bitcoin paper wallet some microSD
cards with confidential information they
can fit inside here and you can keep it
completely secret inside the secret Bowl
I'll drop a link to this thing down in
the description thanks as always for
watching happy April Fool's and I'll
catch you on the next episode later
can't forget Sparky</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
