another video and today we're going to
have some fun this is the brand new mini
Pro by Segway this my friends is a more
professional take on those little
navigator vehicles that I'm sure you've
seen this is the all grown-up version
from the legends in personal
transportation they said hey we're
coming out with the killer to all those
other devices with a bunch of extra
features more durability more safety and
so on and I said I send it out so what
is this thing the mini pro it has a top
speed of 10 miles per hour a 14 mile
range an anti-theft alarm aircraft-grade
magnesium alloy frame and safety
controls built in it's also able to
connect to your smartphone and you can
like remote control it as I understand
it that's pretty insane like you know
you're driving it around I mean that's
fun on its own this thing also can
handle individuals up to 220 pounds no
problem for old man Lou now this one has
it's like little part here for some
level of safety and comfort silica gel
here's some lunch for you jack here is
the unit alright so there's a couple
different pieces
oh that's smell of like what is that
fresh rubber unbelievable look at the
tires on this so it looks like we've got
our LED lights in the front here which
will show you the power level speed
limit Bluetooth whether it's locked or
not and there's a power switch there you
see that jack a little door for your
charging port this guy here I'm guessing
and that's that and it's height
adjustable too by the looks look at that

baby for a ride super solid a totally
different animal outdoors as expected
though you steer it around with this of
course the controls on the app it's cool
