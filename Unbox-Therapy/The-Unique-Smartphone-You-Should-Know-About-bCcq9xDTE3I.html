continues to grow today I have one of
the most unique ones I think that I've
ever seen I was like I need to look at
that I need to handle it it's a Chinese
smartphone maker
one of the biggest there is meizu and
the phone is called the pro 7 plus it
features two displays that display on
the front and a display on the back
personally I haven't seen anything like
that before
it's LTE 64 gigabytes of storage and 6
gigabytes of RAM for jacks purposes
that's right jack is back these are the
bands that are supported and they see
that they can very serious seal breaking
here there you go just open void all
right so did they just know you you know
maybe if you buy one of these if it's
ever been open but then again how would
you know because it's not like you don't
see that on there that's a very
confusing sticker the two-tone whoo bit
of an experience that slides out of
there
you can put that on your desk and put
pens in it get your pens in there
brother
so the phone comes out from the side
like so little sim tool Oh they've given
you a case with a cutout for where that
extra display will be
hello because you are a valued customer
my staff and I would personally like to
thank you for visiting our store and for
your business that's why we hope you'll
accept a beautiful two-piece stainless
steel carving set as our gift to you
just for attending our VIP event this
Saturday September night a USB table
type C on this end
old-school usb on that end the European
power brick this is something that has
been the case for many
meizu phones this home button also acts
as your back button you tap it to go
back instead of having the three button
system you hold this as well for other
functions it is clickable and it's also
your fingerprint sensors so it's one
button it does everything front-facing
camera as well as a speaker the whole
thing actually feels nice and well made
well built
the luminol around the outside here cold
to the touch that's what I'm looking for
I can't feel my fingers anymore I know
this is where your displays gonna be
right underneath the dual lens system we
have USB type-c a headphone jack and a
speaker you have two slots now both of
these slots are for SIM cards neither
one is for expandable storage
unfortunately okay so the unit is booted
up now as you can see AMOLED display on
here
it sort of slips in somewhere around the
galaxy s price you can fight on Amazon I
think for around 500 550 I'll link it
down in the description just so you're
aware what you'll ask my camera icon has
an odd one I have a fairly lightweight
skin on it compared to some of what I've
seen online but of course this is
Android you can configure it however you
want
once you pull down this tray here you
notice it's a little bit different with
the quick settings and so on so you tap
it it gives you haptic feedback when
it's being used as a back button what if
I want to go all the way back to the
home page like a home button I just
click it do you swipe up over there
multitaskers see that there you end up
with a little bit less clutter down here
because it's a single button scenario
I'm going to kill you you want to see
this secondary display this real
differentiating factor it's also AMOLED
look at that very bright very vibrant
and when you flip the device over it
triggers this display to turn on cuz it
assumes you're looking at this side now
you can program this secondary display
on the back to also show incoming calls
notifications and phone status whether
it's playing music charging and so on oh
there you go some new text messages I
don't think I can open them though jack
has sent me a little
what is that Jack and I just turned on
double tap to wake it comes back on
alright so having this little bit of
information I guess is kind of nice you
have the steps the time the weather and
so on but like the real killer function
here the thing people are excited about
is the ability to use your rear camera
while still be able to frame up a shot
because inevitably you see people out
there they want to use the better camera
that's on the back of their phone so
they're out there kind of like this but
they don't nail it
so with this secondary display you just
pull down from the top and it launches
no rear camera that kind of behaves like
a back camera can you see that look I'm
gonna come in there see my face in there
you guys can see yourself in there and
there's a few different modes as well so
there's a blur mode which uses the two
lenses to kind of attempt to blur the
background and then if I swipe one more
time as a beauty mode to keep you
looking pretty as you know I'm gonna use
the original mode and I can just kind of
line myself up here reach up tap it
three two one and boom I have a super
high quality selfie there that's from
the rear camera the selfie enthusiasts
out there are gonna be amped up at this
particular development right here two
lenses three different shooting modes
going further jet look at the beard
hairs Lee moly look at the detail on
that
that's a selfie man it's a selfie jet
it's unbelievable I don't know that you
want that much detail I don't know that
I want that much detail but you got the
detail considering the fact that you're
probably offended by the
level of detail I can go back here and
toggle on that beauty mode beautiful Lu
in three two oh my oh yes have I been
softened to touch is the skin just a
little more attractive you can go down
here and hit this button and get even
more beautiful after the fact like
that's did you see what just happened
there oh no the dual lens blur effect
that I mentioned before
first of all dual lens off big will now
we turn on the blur effect I mean it's
like it's a very severe type of blurring
to the background there I'm personally
not a huge fan of this feature in the
first place because I prefer the natural
big aperture when available if you want
to dabble a little bit with depth of
field you're playing with it now
now Wi-Fi is about as good if not a
little better than a lot of devices
tested here so almost 34 down and almost
50 up let's go ahead and get straight
into it
alright the video looks good so for a
basic type of installation you can have
all the ambience of a colorful light
without the expenditure of a Wi-Fi
connected one let's try it against an SI
real quick we're back to gadgets under
$10 let's go ahead and get straight into
it I did a video on the lot very
interesting you can charge you can lamp
you can do it all a little bit more
clear and full than the s 8 speakers so
it's worth noting so as you can see here
this device comes in a couple of
different colors I have the black
version here but you can see a kind of
reddish one that's also available there
now you should be aware there's two
sizes of this device this is the plus
model with the 5.7 inch display there's
a smaller unit with a 5.2 inch display
that isn't called plus so if you're
looking for something smaller with this
rear screen that's the one you're
looking for this unit has a 3500
milliamp hour battery 64 gigabytes of
internal storage in the unit that I've
got here but you can spec this up to 128
there's another model you can buy the
cameras on the back are made by Sony and
they're both 12 megapixel F 2.0 lenses
no Bluetooth 500 instead 4.2
I don't know all right so there you have
it a unique phone that's what I aim to
do here this is something I haven't seen
before so I absolutely had to check it
out of course you are going with a brand
that at least North American customers
are a lot less familiar with I think for
most people at this particular price
point you're still gonna end up with an
essay or some other product from a more
recognizable brand but if you want to be
a little bit avant-garde if you want to
be a a trendsetter blazed a trail
one thing I can say if you pull this out
of your pocket people will be surprised
you're probably gonna get a selfie
together question time how much will
could we'll do do if will do could we'll
do that sounds like a question for will
dude what's the answer well well do does
a lot is it true that you originally
created this channel to have an excuse
for your wife to buy all these gadgets
no comment
it does help not gonna lie imagine
without this channel what kind of gadget
habit I might have it could be
destructive why don't you bring up
random celebs at your place to unbox
things with you and make vids about it
who would you like to see on unbox
therapy let me know in the comments or
tag those people on Twitter harass them
tell them they need to get on to unbox
therapy those celebrities like I want a
list alright maybe B C is fine hey Lou
do you things the move by Google to also
ditch the headphone jack will be enough
to push everyone into USB C headphones
some days I have days where I'm like I
don't miss the headphone jack at all
it's no big deal
adapt there's Wireless blah blah blah
and then other days I'm like I go to
plugs up and I'm just like oh it can be
a nuisance it can be a headache you
might not have the right adapter and you
might not have Bluetooth headphones it
still does happen for the space that it
takes up maybe just throw a headphone
jack in there just like they did on the
SI so Google will ya probably do it but
I think there will still be some
manufacturers that understand we want
that versatility and they'll keep the
headphone jack around a little bit
longer I think possibly even the next
generation of Samsung devices
might hold on to it and I think it would
be a good move if they did why not</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
