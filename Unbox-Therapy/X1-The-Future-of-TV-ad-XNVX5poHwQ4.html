another video and today I'm gonna be
checking out x1 from Xfinity Comcast
asked me to come take a look and more
importantly share it with you guys one
of the cool things is this remote which
now features voice control pretty cool
function so let's check it out alright
so now I've got the system alright so
now we've got the system booted up I've
got the remote in my hand which is
obviously very important a lot of the
magic happens with this button here the
Xfinity button when I press it you'll
see a little menu come up along the
bottom of the screen now the first
option is a guide allows you to see
what's on right now you get the
on-demand section this is gonna be the
home of everything that's available on
demand whether that's TV movies and so
on
featured movies new and most popular
select something that's of interest to
you or you like me you can sort of just
browse around and spend a bunch of time
watching a bunch of trailers and never
deciding on anything the ratings for
Rotten Tomatoes listed right on there
and you can actually sort by those
critics ratings one of the key features
here is the ability to search things
using your voice as a microphone at the
top Drake
look at this look at this right here
what the old man dance moves he knew
people were gonna be talking I love it
though well done we've also got an apps
selection this might be the coolest spot
in my opinion you can have access to
your personal photos via various social
media and then you've got some apps
specifically for sports weather
horoscopes if that's the kind of thing
you see I'm watching a game on the left
but maybe I'm a heavy-duty sports fan
over here on the right hand side I've
got all the sports from NFL to NBA once
I click on some let me say scroll down
here bills vs. Jets let's say I can see
all these stats look average for average
time of possession I can see who's
injured right now so as a sports fan
this means you don't really need to
choose you don't need to land on only
one event you'll be following some other
sporting event essentially over here in
the sports app on the side so you can
also have a little bit more fun with
voice search I'll be back the Terminator
this has a hundred percent on Rotten
Tomatoes
that's surprising to me I mean I get it
now one of my favorite features is the
opportunity to binge watch if I show you
get started next thing you know it's the
next day Breaking Bad I can watch I can
pick whatever episode I'm looking for
season 4 episode 2 so on I can resume if
I've started one I can then go in and
look at the cast and crew from the show
select somebody and then continue to
navigate see all of the other movies
that this particular actor is appearing
in now I can also favorite in actor so
that he lives in my favorites section so
that if anything gets added I can go
check back this is good too
you can see more like this of course
better call Saul comes up it's sort of
like a smart section that understands
what show it is that you were interested
in and then finds ones that are kind of
similar that you might like as well but
maybe you don't know what you want maybe
you want to sit back lean back in the
couch and let the system do the work you
can with this little phrase right here
what should I watch the universe of
things that I should be looking at has
just shown up here and look it's pretty
smart too because it brought up true
detective they know that I probably want
to go back and do that again I wouldn't
be totally against especially the first
season second season true detective is
exactly the type of show that binge
watching was created for each episode
just moves into the other so beautifully
messes with your dreams a little bit but
trust me worth it finding the way that
you like to interact with your content
and it's different for everybody there's
also a trending section I'm gonna click
on this real quick this is gonna bring
up the popular stuff that's on right now
that a lot of people are watching so
maybe you want to get into that
conversation on Twitter as it's
happening down here you can also select
movies so all you're seeing in your
guide is movies if you happen to be a
movie buff I can see events that are on
now programs that are on now and then I
can also move forward in the timeline
see stuff that starts at 5:30 6:00 and
so on and at the very top there's
another
so I can then go in from here and only
select HD stuff or select stuff in a
specific language so there you have it
x1 from Xfinity and as I said before
this is all about navigating the wide
world of content movies television
sports the whole picture as I showed you
in this demo here you can do it with
voice you can do it with buttons if your
old school is completely up to you but
that's the idea so hopefully you guys
enjoyed this content if you did make
sure to leave a thumbs up down below and
I'll catch you very shortly on the next
episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
