and today we're taking a look at the
Xbox 360 Kinect special edition this is
the model with 250 gigabyte drive as
opposed to the tiny little 4 gigabyte
model it's also got a game and of course
the Kinect sensor and the pretty new
Xbox which is a big improvement over the
last style
let's get inside here and see what we
got first things first we have our start
here quick set-up guide just going to
make it super simple to get your system
hooked up and get that Kinect sensor
where it needs to be next we've got the
system itself I think I'm going to go
ahead and put that to the side for a
moment we'll see what else is in the box
so we've got our game called Kinect
Adventures and this is kind of just like
a throw in you know I don't think it's
going to be a top title for you know
Xbox games or Kinect games in general
but nice to have something to at least
try out the Kinect sensor here is a
super cheap headset but I don't want to
hate on it too much at least they
include one other manufacturers don't
you'll know what I'm saying and next
we'll pull out the Kinect sensor here if
it'll come this is quite the packaging
here no let's get that later first we'll
look at the gigantic power brick which
hasn't gone anywhere I think it might be
a little smaller than the older ones but
that's still a major turnoff for me the
last thing I need is another gigantic
power brick laying around anyways I
digress we have the wireless controller
and these are nice they are all black
now like they always should have been
and this is a great feeling controller
I'm sure you all know that
most people on a planet have held an
Xbox 360 controller at some point or
another there's something else in here
yeah it's a couple Duracell batteries
that's going to power up your controller
of course I always like when they
include Duracell Zoar Energizer's
bias that way you could easily cheap out
and give you some off-brand
I remember even getting fake branded
ones before like fake Panasonic ones
with some devices anyway here's your
power cable not much to say about that
and this is kind of cheesy so the device
has HDMI but they're going to give you a
composite cable instead that's kind of
weak sauce if you ask me here is the
Kinect sensor or camera or whatever
we're going to call it and it's got its
own manual let's get this box out of the
way so we can get some more room to
breathe over here there we go now I can
breathe let's go ahead and take a closer
look at this marvel of engineering at
least that's what Microsoft wants us to
believe
I gotta admit it's pretty nice-looking
especially since it matches the new
system design but it's definitely large
- I mean if you're comparing it to the
PlayStation Move system with the camera
it's going to be a bigger device sitting
there on your TV stand or wherever you
hope to put it but then again it uses a
completely different technology so you
can understand why it would be so much
bigger now let's take a look at this
newly designed system haven't actually
had one of these yet I mean I've seen
them around but I've never really
examined one up close
so the first thing you're going to
notice is the super glossy finish now it
looks slick right now but as everybody
knows with these kinds of finishes they
attract fingerprints but I suppose
you're not really touching the top of
your system too much it just kind of
sits there but dust thus for sure you're
going to see that being said it
definitely looks a shitload cooler than
the first model here's a closer look at
the connect device those dual lenses
they're sturdy little stand and a
strange connector with a like looks like
a stopper on it here's that new
controller well it's not really new in
any way other than color even so it's
much cooler in all black like I think
all consumer electronics should be all
black there's no need to mess with
something so good if it ain't broke
don't fix it you know what I mean here
is that super cheap headset which is
gonna I guess help you get online
straight away get yourself signed up to
that membership before having to invest
in any more hardware here's a closer
look at the front of the system you have
your drive there your power button and
of course your USB connectors there's
that strange power plug spit if HDMI a
bunch of USBs anyway check out our
channel if you get a chance we got a lot
more to look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
