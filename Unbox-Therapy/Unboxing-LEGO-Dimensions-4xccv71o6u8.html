another video and today this is
something that I am actually quite
excited for it is lego dimensions
something a lot of you guys might not
know about me is that I am a huge Lego
fan and lego video game fan dimensions
like it brings everything together Multi
universe expansion packs you got this
portal now for minifigures as well as
vehicles which can then be customized
and as you can tell I am legitimately
excited for this dimensions starter kit
also comes with some legit Lego actual
LEGO pieces because as you can tell the
portal here is something you will build
now in the back of the box kind of get a
description of exactly what's happening
here you can see that you build the
portal which you will then put the
characters on to each character of
course will then show up in the video
game or vehicle for that matter the
vehicle is customizable as I mentioned
before you can see here that each one is
three-in-one and as you change the build
in the real world it will then be
represented in the video game there are
so many different brands included in
this ecosystem from ghostbusters to Lord
of the Rings these expansion packs will
be purchased separately but you don't
need to buy them to play the game this
starter pack already includes
minifigures as well as some vehicles to
get you moving
you can venture through any of the
worlds in the game with any characters
chances are you'll never completely 100%
complete the game but that's a good
thing because it means that you're going
to get hours and hours out of this thing
and as you purchase more expansion packs
you're going to continue to have
different experiences on the top of the
box here you'll see the entire
minifigure inventory available for lego
dimensions these aren't included in the
starter pack but as you can see there
are different waves of releases for
characters and with each wave you're
going to get the availability of more
minifigures from these various brands
that are available within Lego
dimensions I'm a bit of an official
when it comes to Lego games big fan
hungry for those gold bricks you know
gold bricks stud collecting if you're
unfamiliar with Lego games you don't
know what that stuff is when you crack
this open you're going to find out real
quick so let's jump inside the box
inside here you're going to have Batman
wyldstyle
and I believe Gandalf very nice game
here this is for the ps4 but this games
obviously also available for Xbox one or
Nintendo Wii U Oh what do we have here
look at this it's a poster so that you
can keep track of the various expansions
and the ones that you have and the ones
that you want old school stuff that even
dudes like me can get excited about like
Ghostbusters Jack you remember
Ghostbusters what about the green guy I
think his name was Slimer something like
that slimy this is our portal this
connects to your console super long
cable so you could keep it like near the
couch or wherever it is you're gaming
from and swap out characters while
you're playing now in here this is the
actual Lego for completing the
construction of the portal as well as
your minifigures let's jump in here real
quick check it out a couple different
packs
you've got step-by-step guides here for
how to complete the construction alright
so I'm going to go ahead and build the
minifigures here we have Batman
wyldstyle and Gandalf
I believe there's wild style with that
angry face that's Gandalf and Batman has
two looks wouldn't give him that kind of
like somewhat aggressive look oh I
missed her hood goes on first is she
also have two expressions she does so
she can just go on this base right here
and now just like that she's capable of
being put on the portal coming to life
right in the game now Gandalf uh the
beard of course the beard in the hand
I can only aspire to a beard like that
one day I'm not there yet working on it
though now Batman time Cape wait a sec
Gandalf also wears a cape Jack there's
two capes and this one's black this is
definitely Batman's cape of course he
has a cape I mean what he's a wizard
Wizards always have capes right look at
these guys
Batman wyldstyle Gandalf pretty cool how
about expansion though we have Marty
McFly as well as the hoverboard the
legendary hoverboard and the legendary
DeLorean I still to this day I kind of
wanted DeLorean now there are a few
different types of expansion packs this
Back to the Future pack is something
called a level pack means it comes with
one character one vehicle and one gadget
but there are also team packs and fun
packs available each of which comes with
its own combination of these characters
vehicles and gadgets
where's McFly McFly's enhance there's a
shirt guitar of course pants head nice
little red guitar here onto your base

people of all ages even even old dudes
