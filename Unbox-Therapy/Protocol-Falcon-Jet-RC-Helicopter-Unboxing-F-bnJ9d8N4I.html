therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Falcon jet pro from protocol which
is a brand that Best Buy carries for
these RC choppers and there's a number
of different ones available this one's
not too big because I had plans of
flying it indoors we'll see if that
works out after I get her opened up and
take a look at how to operate the whole
deal now I'm a little bit intimidated by
RC choppers or anything that flies and
I'm controlling it so we'll have to wait
and see just how it goes after I get it
all up and running here you can see it
comes with an almost game-like
controller so that's a good sign I know
how to operate you know an xbox or ps3
controller maybe it'll translate over to
this kind of device probably not but I
can be hopeful so we've got some
paperwork here once again pretty
intimidating stuff including a little
sheet that's uh slipped in here that
tells you how to turn on your helicopter
that's a bad sign when you got a sheet
slipped in to tell you how to turn it on
that's a problem
I hope it's easy to turn it on so here
is the controller and it feels pretty
good I mean it feels pretty obvious I
guess you get your throttle on the left
up and down and you've got your
direction knob on the right-hand side on
the right-hand joystick there's a little
selector in the center a BC selector as
well as what looks like some lights
along top you have an on and off switch
and then this big huge chamber on the
back for batteries that's because this
thing takes six double-a batteries which
is kind of nuts but there's a cool
reason why which I'll get to in a second
now the chopper itself needs to be
charged they've also included a number
of extra blades are these called blades
what are these called somebody let me
know in the comment section but you've
got some extra ones I suppose in case
you damaged the ones that are already
currently installed and then you get
this little charging cable which is USB
to basically a regular power style
adapter that's how you interface with
the chopper and the little USB portion
glows it glows red so you know if you've
got power or not and this slides in the
bottom here it's kind of weird where it
fits in because you can't really stand
the helicopter up when it's in there at
least not very easily so anyways here's
a better look at the actual helicopter
there are
metallic components and then there are
some plastic components it's not super
high-end I got it on sale there are
larger size protocol choppers this is I
think the second smallest at least that
my best buy and all the controls are on
the bottom for turning it on and off
I'll give you an even closer look in a
quick second here after all
this is unbox therapy where we don't
mess around we get you real up close and
personal with the products you can see
there are some little lights in there
that's because this thing lights up like
a like a disco ball once you've got it
powered up I'll show you that in a
minute as well here's the back portion
is this called a rotor man I'm new to
all this RC chopper stuff but again this
portion here is metallic and here's a
look at the underside as well as that
on/off switch and also where it charges
the on/off switch is kind of tiny it's
like a little dip switch so you're not
going to do it by accident at least
that's the upside I suppose so anyways
let's go ahead and insert the six double
A's which at first I was like damn that
can't be just to power this controller
that's crazy talk but no there's a cool
little secret a cool little reason why
this thing takes six double A's and when
you power it on you'll notice this these
flashing red buttons or not buttons
flashing red LEDs and then there's this
little hidden compartment which houses
another little power adapter that's
because the controller can power up can
charge your actual chopper so that's why
I take so many batteries so I believe in
the manual it says that half an hour of
charging gives you about between five
and ten minutes of flight time and
you'll notice the LEDs on the top of the
controller indicate that you're charging
so that's pretty cool I actually wasn't
expecting that I actually didn't even
know that that's the way it operated so
there you can see all it all lit up
ready to fly but I am I was terrible I
couldn't get this thing up up in the air
for any amount of time I'm just crashing
into the walls now I don't know if it
was the fact that I had too many beers
or that it's incredibly late at night or
what but if you guys have any tips on
how I can fly this thing let me know
down in the comments I need u RC experts
to come out and let me know what the
hell I'm doing wrong maybe this will get
better once I learn how to use
maybe I'll give you guys an update
anyways if you enjoyed this content
hopefully you can like and favorite this
video as it does help me out a bunch and
if you haven't checked out the new
website yet please do so there are user
accounts forums all the cool super fans
are already over there if you haven't
checked it out yet please come and do so

description and until the next video
I've got a lot more planned by the way
but until then I'll see you around
