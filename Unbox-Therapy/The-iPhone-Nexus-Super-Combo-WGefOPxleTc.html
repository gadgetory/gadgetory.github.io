going to make something or at least
modify something I've been looking for a
power solution for my travel needs for a
long time and I've tried out so many
different products on the market but I
really haven't been satisfied with
what's out there at least not yet
then I found out about this thing the
tilt Energy 5k battery backup which has
a built-in lightning cable as well as a
built-in microUSB now that's important
to me because I like to carry around two
devices anyone who knows me knows I
usually have a nexus 5 as well as an
iPhone 5s at least for right now I like
the camera and the Instagram
functionality of the iPhone after all
the Instagram app on iOS does a much
better job with the compression of
photos and then of course I like the
stock Android experience on the Nexus 5
for most of my interaction Twitter Email
the Gmail client obviously on Android is
stellar so anyways I carry two devices
it's not ideal but that's the way I do
it neither of these two devices have
great battery life and I'm sure if
you're an owner of one of the two you
have probably experienced moments where
you were without battery but one of the
problems with battery backups is that
you're stuck carrying around extra
cables and then an another cable to
charge the battery backup and then a
lightning cable for iOS devices and a
microUSB and maybe I'm just bitching and
moaning but it honestly is so much of a
barrier that often times I forget to
bring it with me and then I'm just stuck
there without battery now there are tiny
little battery backup solutions as well
but like I said since I'm carrying two
devices they're both running down I
wanted one single package that could do
it all and this energy 5k looks to be
that solution but here's where things
get a little bit more interesting I
didn't just want to plug them into this
and have it sitting in my bag I wanted
to try and create one single package one
single case that could do all the work
for both phones
so that sounds weird but it isn't I
picked up two really cheap cases like
phone cases iPhone case and a nexus 5
case you can grab these off Amazon in
fact everything that I'm going to use in
this a little modification video is
going to be down in the description and
you can pick it up all on Amazon the
reason for these two cases is because I
am going to put some industrial-strength
velcro on them and I didn't really want
to put that directly on to the phones I
guess you could if you're super
utilitarian and you don't give a
but anyway so I picked up these two
cheap cases I'm going to put
industrial-strength velcro on the back
of each of these and then insert the
phones and slap them right on to the
energy 5k because it's actually pretty
slim so you're gonna have a double sided
phone Android on one side iOS on the
other now obviously I'm not intending to
use it attached although you could but
the goal here is to have one thing that
I can slide in my bag that is charging
both devices and there's no cables to
get tangled just a nice compact thing so
rather than make you watch me build it
in real time
we're gonna speed through this right now
and then I will jump back with the
finished product let's see if this works
out okay so that was easier than I
expected this stuff industrial-strength
velcro is possibly the greatest
invention ever so pick some of this up
and have it on hand because you can do
just about anything with it
cluding throw it so here is what the
final contraption looks like and
obviously you can tell it's a little bit
of a beast it kind of looks like a bomb
we'll have to wait and see how TSA
handles this contraption but essentially
it's usable in this form factor as
you'll see I can actually hold that up
to my head it's a little heavy but
ultimately we have a ton of milliamp
hours here and check this out
I can flip it over and all of a sudden
I'm on the iPhone that's ghetto but at
the same time it's kind of cool so this
little cable here goes into the iPhone
and the other cable the microUSB goes
into the Nexus 5 one of the cool things
about
tilt is that it's also got another USB
output so you can even add a third
device here and micro USB input for
charging it up so I could put one micro
USB cable out to a power brick and
essentially be charging all three of
these and maybe even another device
without the need to have separate bricks
for each product now when these cables
aren't in use they tuck away very easily
just like that so since we're simply
dealing with velcro here removing the
devices is very easy to do you just peel
it off you can go ahead and answer your
messages emails or even phone calls
without having to hold the whole
contraption up to your face that's
honestly the way that I see myself using
it more often and since the velcro
itself is only on top of a cheap case in
the future it'll be very easy for me to
take the phone out completely when I'm
at home for example and I'm not using
this contraption at all then I can just
use the phone naked without disrupting
this whole concoction when I'm ready to
travel again so that's the idea behind
using the cases ultimately this little
kit right here
is going to allow for me to leave a
couple of extra cables a couple of extra
power bricks I generally have two
separate SIM cards so I'll have a SIM
card with my number from back home and
then I'll have another SIM card for
cheaper mobile data wherever it is that
I happen to be and that's another reason
why I like to carry two devices so this
means I could have one operating it's a
hotspot with a giant amount of battery
power it also means that if I get a call
on one of the two numbers I've always
got power for both so you can see why
this is appealing to me 5200 milliamp
hours built in cables big fan of this
thing so far gonna test it out on an
upcoming trip next week hope you guys
found this interesting I did time will
tell how useful this actually is for now
we have the ultimate super-psycho double
phone if you know god if you found this
to be entertaining or you enjoyed it in
any way please make sure to leave a
thumbs up down below if you have any
questions about this setup leave a
comment if you're not a subscriber yet
now is a great time to become one to see
more crazy stuff like this and
why I will catch the rest of you on the
next episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
