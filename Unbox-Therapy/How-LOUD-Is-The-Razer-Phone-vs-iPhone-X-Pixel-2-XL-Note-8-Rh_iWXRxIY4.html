been raving about the speakers on the
razor phone it's the best speaker I've
ever heard of smartphone but
unfortunately a reaction it doesn't give
you the experience that I had so I got
an idea let's try somewhat
scientifically to figure out how much
better
how much louder the speakers on the
razor phone are compared to some other
flagships I've got the razor phone the
no dates the pixel to Excel and the new
iPhone 10 I'll be testing all four of
these devices using this little guy over
here a checkmate SPL meter and it can
measure the sound pressure produced by
these various devices so this will give
us a numerical readout for each of these
smartphones scientific perspective on
the performance of these various
speakers so what do you say Jack should
we boot this guy up and get her going of
course we should I mean you're not gonna
stop me at this point I have a little
stand here because with a smart phone
you sit in front of it you hold it right
here so the measurement should come from
your location
okay so let's kick it off the pixel to
excel so I'm gonna use a tone generator
to keep it as static as possible so that
the reading will be accurate across all
of them this guarantees that we'll be
able to track back the GB readout on
this device across various spectrum it's
gonna go from 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz
which is the human audio spectrum now I
do want to give you a warning this thing
here it can get pretty loud turn down
your headphones if you need to don't go
blowing your eardrums out all right I
don't want to be held responsible so
fair warning if you need to turn the
headphones down do it all right so
here's test number one this is the pixel
2 XL
[Laughter]
pixal to excel it peaked around 93 DBA
okay next up I have the note eight and
the exact same position here we go
[Laughter]
around 90 91 on this so something to
keep in mind with the note obviously the
speaker fires to the side it's not as
loud either way I also noticed a greater
fluctuation in volume across the
frequency range on this particular
device if you're listening to music the
drums and so on it's all down in the
lower register and then other things
like voice are up in the higher register
so what you're really looking for is
volume available across the human
frequency range I have the iPhone the
iPhone 10 so this has a similar speaker
layout to the note but you also get a
little bit of audio coming out of the
earpiece here we go
the iPhone made it as high as 96 which
kind of surprises me it also spent more
time above 80 DBA then the note series
did it was registering louder across a
much wider range of frequency but what I
think is happening here is that the
earpiece section is contributing to some
of the higher frequency stuff and adding
volume back there impressive figures
here from the iPhone 10
all right last up is the razor phone
each of these speakers has its own app
and I'm speculating that this should
beat those devices based on my ears but
let's go ahead and see what the science
says
here's the cool thing about this
particular phone not only do you see it
crack 100db
a few times but you also see it live in
the 90 Plus range and the high 90s
across a wider spectrum so when it comes
to our perception of quality audio what
our ears are really looking for is
volume and punch in all those places so
the fact that it could have performance
registering in frequency ranges that the
other ones couldn't implies the quality
of speaker and the quality of amplifier
the surprising finding here is how good
the iPhone 10 is as well gets pretty
loud and sounds pretty good of course
none of the other flagships are in the
same neighborhood as the razer phone not
like i expected them to be if you want
the ultimate audio experience in a smart
phone you're probably looking at the
razer phone so there you have it for
high-profile flagship smartphones tested
using my handy little SPL meter if you
guys enjoyed this type of test let me
