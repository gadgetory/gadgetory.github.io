another video and today it is an epic
product an epic unboxing it might be I
don't really know but uh this is a
levitating speaker and I've seen these
things heard about them never actually
had one in front of me that I'm going to
test for you a Bluetooth speaker that
sort of floats there in space it floats
over top of this bass there is air space
between it like there's no connection
point I believe it uses magnets and as
much as it's about sound it's also about
just this really cool thing to look at a
levitating speaker called the air to it
uses Bluetooth 4.0 as you can see over
here it's also got a microphone built-in
for hands-free functionality you can
actually answer phone calls on it it is
portable you can take the speaker
portion off of the levitation stand and
take it wherever you want to go without
having to move the entire base-wide
audio spectrum rechargeable battery 3.5
millimeter audio connector if you don't
want to use the bluetooth and the
portable speaker mounts to magnetic
surfaces that's cool you can stick it to
the fridge I guess make a lot of sense
to you Jack yeah okay why are we looking
at the box let's get inside and levitate
some stuff that's what you're here for
here is the speaker got some weight to
it I will say that much some buttons
power phone call pick up and volume up
and down and then on the back a microUSB
port for charging and the 3.5 millimeter
jack but this is the fun part the
levitation base whoa check out that
mirrored finish look at this look at
yourself whoa there's a USB port here I
assume that's going to be to charge up
the speaker itself and then a power
outlet
Oh like your name whoa
major whoa holy powerful magnet then I
just crack it we need to get this baby
powered on what it is here's the USB you
charge this I hope this has power
plugged in hold the power button of
course err - it's all happening so this
is to get it set up levitating oh oh
damn that's really cool I mean it's
totally unnecessary obviously but when
you see it here like this I don't know
something to it I don't know man there's
something so cool
I know it's just magnet okay let's play
some music real quick
okay
that's probably not cool to do that all
right
try something out I mean I kind of like
just watching it okay listen
it is not the best Bluetooth speaker
I've ever heard but for some I mean this
is fun
there's something fun about it you're
just on the couch in the little
levitation beside you like you're on
some next level you're on something they
don't even know about teaching your
friends about magnets all right so I'm
charging it up right now but in the
meantime like you can still play it
right is it completely works while it's
charging it's not levitating it's not
gonna levitate with the cord attached
but this is standalone the base is just
sort of like a dock for the actual
speaker meaning it's like a home for it
I don't know if you're looking for
something cool that not everybody else
has this might be worth looking at it's
not my top choice for a Bluetooth
speaker by any means but it does a cool
trick and I could just see myself using
it because of that it's two things it's
not just the sound it's like the
ambience the environment that it creates
when it's sitting here floating it's
like a little bit of a conversation
starter you know from here on out
levitate or die that's extreme anyway
okay so let's unplug it and let's just
let's roll out on a little bit of music
and a little bit of levitation it's gone
subway
never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to
see what's good
fancy clothes
has its own ringtone are we rolling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
