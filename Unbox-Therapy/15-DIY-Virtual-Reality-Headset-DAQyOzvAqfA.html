us know what you see all right oh whoa
oh okay this will make you people on the
wall what am i Paris oh hello there yeah
here we zoom into hurt
serious dude I don't what stop this is
awesome go and try it now I'm trying yes
and no it's weird because you're like in
a moving car basically it's like a
time-lapse driving around San Francisco
but you can actually move around and
look at different areas time oh crap
you can just stop stop the street you
think I can stop it wherever I want
yeah no it's crazy though holy Wow
I never expected it to be this good oh
man this is so deep it's so deep for so
many reasons
one of the guys start selling this you
miss it the best idea ever you think
about the technology that I'm ingesting
right now and we take you to god this
looks like the dumbest most nerdy thing
ever but it is really impressive
legitimate and these are real reactions
because there's like this decked but
even this like I feel like I'm in a
movie theater this 5 inch screen feels
like it's a even the way you look like
you see the you have the projected image
I mean I feel like I'm in the middle of
a movie theater right now that's 3d
models this is bizarre that is so cool
it really does feel like this right in
front of you oh yeah yeah I get lost
crazy whoa okay I really like this one
feels like you're out like it's daytime
right now I don't know what this one Hey
holy close to your face
you can look left and right and then on
your left hand you should have a little
button
really Matt super impressed I mean I
don't know if I we're getting to virtual
reality in the first place yeah this
looks just like oculus you look exactly
the same
just crazy audience uses a five inch
1080p screen survive in changing
screening with commercial attach√©s it
just a little blurry it's not quite it
is about but that's like really
impressive would you pause for a second
and it looks incredibly detailed like
looking at 1080p nice and kicks up so
it's a little like pixely but it's like
incredibly fantastic strangely is it
fixed it looks loo impressive it's
really addictive er I could see BR being
a huge huge deal if the price comes down
or you can use your phone for it my
goodness is it better than you were
expecting it to be when you heard about
it uh yeah way better this is like
really present you can pull this off
yeah this is really impressive we
believe ridiculous ion being technical
and it's still awesome like that's the
same in theory if I'm a developer and I
want to make a VR experience and all of
a sudden these kinds of headsets start
to come on the market you know more
comfortable versions iterations of this
etc and it plugs into Android and your
phone just straps onto it
I do see a problem potentially for the
big companies oculus rift and cetera
because they're working on their own
independent solutions the fact that
Google put this out even though it's a
piece of cardboard shows that they have
some skin in the game and that's a
danger away or the oculus Nexus you
could use this you can take this if
again a consumer version of this which
is comfortable with an inelastic banner
on the back your head I mean you could
you could envision people sitting on the
bus in the future kids or whatever this
is their gaming platform is there any
Table absolutely is how they're watching
video this is way more immersive than
staring down at a tiny little phone
