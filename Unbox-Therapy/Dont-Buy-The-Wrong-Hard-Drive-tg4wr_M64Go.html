is to know about hard drives well at
least I did I thought I did
turns out there's been a ton of
expansion in the hard drive world
specifically in the types of
applications that individual drives were
made for in front of me I got some candy
hard drive candy I got black blue red
and purple they said hey Lou we want you
to make a video explaining the different
attributes of each of these drives and
why they are perfect for specific
applications on the far side I have the
highest performance drive this is a six
terabyte black WD black and the intended
application here is inside of your
system inside of your workstation PC
gaming PC anywhere where you need
high-performance storage they use the
word creative professionals I consider
myself a creative professional
essentially anyone who is beating the
hell out of their drive not physically
but in a Productivity kind of way
offloading a bunch of video let's say
and then editing it fast and speedy
behavior next up we've got blue this is
one that I found kind of interesting I
remember WD blue sort of being like the
de facto standard internal hard drive
for a very long time there's actually
one over here that is exactly that
there's a one terabyte right here which
is a standard desktop hard drive there's
a new WD blue as well with a built-in
SSD it's kind of a hybrid and that's
going to give you enhanced speed on
regularly access stuff but it kind of
fits a similar use case scenario to the
WD black this again is intended for
users that are a little bit less intense
but it'll do the same tasks so blue just
like the others comes in a variety of
different sizes as well as form factors
this is a four terabyte with that built
in SSD functionality but you can also
get it up to six terabytes I've got a
one terabyte over there everyday
computing that's what this one is all
about now things get more interesting as
we move on to read/write
is designed for network-attached storage
this is a WD my cloud ex4 it attaches to
your network and allows for you to
access data locally that's on the
network share it with other people
that's what we'll be using it for then
through the cloud features you can also
access that data when you're not local
just via the web you want to drive
that's sort of configured for 24/7
operation and when you get an enclosure
like this the idea is to put multiple
drives into these bays so that you can
have a raid let's say for example you
just want to have a simple raid one the
way that works you'll have to drive just
like these here so two Reds that match
in capacity you'll have a constant
backup of all of the data that you write
to that raid a hardware backup so
essentially that file lives in both
places with each copy
so these install really easily into a
system like this simply slide it in
click it down and that's about it
okay so that's black blue red and now
it's time for purple or as I like to
refer to it
the donatello drive it is intended for
use in 24/7 surveillance systems that
are constantly writing video files 24
hours a day that is a fairly hefty
request for a drive to be operating like
that and right on the front here you'll
see it says 24/7 reliability intended
for everything up to HD video now much
like the Reds which also put an emphasis
on reliability you're going to see an
advantage in doubling up the purple so
I've got another purple over here as
well you still have that opportunity to
create other styles grade like raid zero
or pair up a ton of drives and do
something like raid five which is going
to enhance speed and redundancy together
the world of raid so let's do it one
more time real quick black performance
gaining creative professionals in your
system blue everyday tasks inside your
system available SSD inside for a hybrid
Drive and enhance performance
read inside your knives Multimedia
constant access to your files locally
sharing or via the web and then purple
it's all about surveillance if you want
to stream video record video to a drive
24/7 its purple you're looking for
anyway that wraps it up hopefully you
guys found this information useful if
you're looking for some more I will drop
the relevant links down in the
description so you can check out pricing
and availability on all of these various
models we actually don't have any
network attached storage right now we're
using like Google Drive to drop files
and whatnot and obviously that's limited
and not the fastest thing in the world
so this is going to allow for us to you
know send pictures back and forth video
files music etc anyway I could go on and
on as you can probably tell thank you
very much for watching guys appreciate
your viewership if you enjoyed this
