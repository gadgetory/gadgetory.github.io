therapy and today we're taking a look at
this MacBook Pro it might look like any
other MacBook Pro but it isn't because
it's going to be the basis for the super
MacBook Pro project which I talked about
in a previous video so what I have is
the unibody non-retina model MacBook Pro
which is still my favorite because
there's a little bit of user
configurability in there but I did
upgrade the processor to the top one
that's available 2.7 gigahertz quad-core
intel core i7 this also has the top
graphics available the NVIDIA GeForce GT
650 M with one gigabyte of gddr5 memory
so it's very very similar spec wise to
the retina model of course you have a
lower resolution display and the old
body style that will allow for some
upgrades I did also opt for the upgraded
display for this model though which will
give you slightly higher resolution and
most importantly the option for the anti
glare which I am a huge huge fan of more
about that as the video moves forward
otherwise the specification is pretty
stock it's only got four gigs of RAM
right now and a 500 gig hard drive
that's because all that stuff is going
to be replaced as part of the super
macbook pro project in terms of the
unboxing it's pretty much exactly as
you'd expect like any MacBook you have
the unit a little bit of paperwork and
the Apple stickers this one has a
cleaning cloth for your display although
you won't need it as much as if this had
a glossy display this is a special order
you will need to special order that
anti-glare display if you are interested
in it you've also got your power brick
power adapter as well as an extension
cable this stuff is pretty
self-explanatory it is MagSafe one so
it's a little bit fatter than what we
see on the newest MacBook Air actually
comparing this to the newest MacBook Air
you start to realize just how slim and
light the MacBook Air is comparatively
it's two and a half pounds lighter but
this thing is going to be a powerhouse
when I'm finished with it you're going
to have almost a terabyte of SSD storage
as well as 16 gigabytes of RAM and I use
it mostly like a desktop replacement it
simply goes from work to home with me
and I can carry everything I need with
me and have you know lots of performance
in something that I can fit in
a bag I've currently been using a 2011
model which is very very similar except
it doesn't have this anti-glare display
and I'm really a big fan of it I've
already replaced the SSD inside of there
or the hard drive I should say with an
SSD this is going to go 10 steps further
because we're going to have two SSDs
inside of here
more on that once again as the video
moves forward but first let's take a
look around this actual laptop on the
left hand side you have power as well as
Ethernet there's a firewire 800 a
Thunderbolt port 2 USB 3 ports an SD
card slot you have your audio input as
well as your headphone output on the
other side there is a slot for your
optical discs as well as a lock but of
course I'm going to remove the optical
drive in this particular laptop replace
it with a bracket in order to hold in
that secondary SSD so I get a ton bunch
more a ton bunch more SSD storage I'm
really excited to get started on the
transplant here and really turn the
volume up on this particular MacBook Pro
the only other thing really to look at I
mean everything is sort of the same as
what you've seen in other MacBook Pros
that are non retina style you have your
camera on the front as well as your
microphone for video conferencing that's
an HD camera and of course there's a
backlit keyboard the nice large trackpad
as well it's not quite as slender as the
retina model MacBook Pro but that's not
really a huge deal to me I much prefer
to have that extra expand ability that
comes with a modular design you can just
pop the bottom off and install your own
components and that really means a lot
to me so this screen is actually kind of
interesting because it's not as low res
as the stock unibody model it does add a
little bit more a few more pixels I
should say it goes up to 1680 by 1050
from 1440 by 900 which is the stock
non-retina model MacBook Pro 15 inch
resolution as it stands right now so you
can get a little bit more reza little
bit closer to retina not all the way
there but this is completely fine for me
i hook this thing up to an external
monitor and that really is what gives me
the ability to get tons of pixels
anyways
I'd rather have some extra performance
improvements over that Retina screen
that comes on the non upgradable retina
model now we are going to upgrade this
thing we have some RAM to test out two
separate 16 gigabyte kits from Corsair
we've also got two neutron GTX 480
gigabyte SSDs for almost one terabyte of
total SSD storage stay tuned for the
upgrade video coming up next on the
super macbook pro project</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
