a brand new smartphone form-factor a new
take we talked so much recently about
these folding devices and of course
we've talked so much as well about
notches old punches
what is the futuristic smartphone
well vivo they're they're taking another
shot at it with this new concept device
they're not selling this thing right now
but who knows it could be an indication
into an eventual product that they do
sell so what's special about the apex
well they got rid of buttons there's no
mechanical buttons no clicking buttons
there are instead capacitive buttons
touch areas on the side of the device
that you can tap it'll read your your
finger like any capacitive button you're
used to and then that will be your input
method but the other thing is there's no
ports either no holes there's not a
front-facing camera at all in insight
for me the front-facing camera not a
major thing that I'm engaging with so
I've talked before about the potential
for a smart phone option that just does
away with the front-facing camera all
together and that's what they've done
here in the form of the apex 2019 no
front-facing camera no charge port as
well with the apex you've got some pins
on the back magnetic pins similar to
like a MagSafe connector this little
cable will find the correct position on
the back of the device in order to
charge it up and give you more speed
than what wireless charging is capable
of that said I still don't really
understand why it wasn't just wireless
charging or if this even will have
wireless charging again it's just a
concept at this particular point in time
another kind of interesting aspect of
this device is how it deals with sound
what they've done here is they've used
some under display technology to have
audio transmitted through the glass of
the display the phone as you see here
sounds from
nothing here in Distortion probably the
most exciting thing for me based on what
I've seen so far is the fingerprint
scanner
vivos doing something different what
they're showing off is a full screen
fingerprint scanner so you can touch
your thumb to any spot on the screen
without any kind of thought now that is
currently one of the downsides of the in
display fingerprint scanner
with this concept phone here instead you
don't even think about it you tap
anywhere on the display you pick it up
you tap anywhere on the display and it
will read the fingerprint and unlock so
that's a fairly big difference in how
you interact with the device and how you
unlock it and this is important because
of course throughout the day you unlock
your device a ton now in terms of specs
they're talking about potentially a
Snapdragon 855 up to 12 gigabytes of RAM
and 512 gigabytes of storage so it's
obviously targeted as a flagship device
if it does eventually launch in this
format you can expect it to have a
flagship price to go with it
we've seen these motorized pop up
cameras and the comments section of
these videos is always full of people
that are apprehensive about the
potential for a breakdown the potential
for water damage but by doing away with
anything like that without any front
facing camera mechanism you now have
this solid body this solid device which
should be less susceptible to the
potential drawbacks with the motorized
components we've seen up until this
point in an era where manufacturers are
already eliminating ports things like
headphone jacks and so on are you ready
for this kind of concept are you ready
to do away with ports in general it does
seem that buttons are evaporating in our
lives or at least their importance is
being diminished via software this is
the natural progression I'm just not
sure that we're there yet the big
question here is the front-facing camera
or lack thereof is that is that
something you're prepared to live with
or do you need a solution for a
front-facing camera must there be one in
a smart phone for you to consider
purchasing it or could you live a lot
without a selfie cam do you need the
selfies we talked about this idea of no
front-facing camera giving you a full
screen display and now we might
potentially have it that's kind of
exciting though I'm not so certain that
everyone's ready for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
