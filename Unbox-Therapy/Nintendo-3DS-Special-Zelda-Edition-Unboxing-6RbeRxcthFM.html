therapy and as you probably saw in my
previous video I picked up a bunch of
stuff including halo combat Evolved
obviously this is the anniversary disc
and I hadn't picked that up yet a little
bit late to the party on that one but
I'm going to have that coming up for you
real soon as well as the ear force Delta
unboxing look at this case this thing is
nuts from Turtle Beach this is the call
of duty modern warfare Edition that's
going to be coming up in the next video
but right now let's talk about this
special edition Nintendo 3ds this is the
Zelda edition celebrating 25 years and
you're going to get a special paint job
as well as the game included so a couple
of nice perks for the holiday season
some are calling this the Zelda edition
that's what it says on the top of the
box so I suppose that's what it is and
it's going to give you basically the
appearance of the black Nintendo 3ds but
with a few little minor details and
minor touches to make it more Zelda ish
if you know humpy so we've got a couple
things in a box there's the console box
as well as the game of course we're
going to look at the game second so
first we'll get inside the 3ds box and
see what's included now it should have
the same inclusions as any 3ds and I
have previously unboxed the plain black
Nintendo 3ds so if you guys want to know
more information i've also reviewed it
as well i'll put links to all my
Nintendo 3ds content either up on the
screen through annotations or if you're
on a mobile device down in the
description so you can get an even
closer look if you have any other
questions so the first thing in the box
is this major Nintendo library a
boatload of paperwork here and you know
it's going to start out with your Quick
Start Guide in a number of different
languages this is if you don't want to
dive in to the novel that the user
manual is now I'm not really complaining
a lot of manufacturers are getting super
chintzy on the instructions not Nintendo
look at this thing that's a short story
right there but you can't hate I mean
nice color pages in there you know if
you want to know more about your system
assuming it's got you know this new 3d
the content on there maybe you want to
know more about it anyways
you've also got a little bit more
promotional paperwork and of course the
AR games which if you want to see more
of those definitely go to my other 3ds
videos as i mentioned earlier also we've
got the power adapter the classic
Nintendo grey power adapter this has a
proprietary connection point and it is a
travel style adapter meaning the prongs
can flip down for easier packing and one
thing I really like about the 3ds is
that they include a docking station I
think a lot of manufacturers chintz out
when it comes to including accessories
with the original package but not
Nintendo not in this case you're going
to get a dock they're not going to try
and sell it to you after the fact and
lastly we have the prize the actual 3ds
the Zelda Edition and as you can see
right away this is unlike any of the
other 3ds is currently on the market
you've got that special design up top
and on the inside you've actually got
some special touches as well
the buttons are done in gold all the
text on the device is gold on the bottom
you can see even more gold the top gold
panel let's get you closer here's a
better look at that design around the
edges now it's it's glossy just like any
other 3d it's just like the regular
black version of course it's going to be
glossy but it's also fairly durable you
can tell that the actual design is far
underneath the gloss and on the front
side you see we've got our 3d on/off
switch done up in gold all the lettering
is gold the a B buttons XY our power
button and text is in gold in fact every
little accents in gold even the little
lines on your d-pad is done up in gold
but the majority of the gold is on the
backside where you've got or underside I
should say where you've got all your 3ds
lettering etc and then up along top
you've got this plastic strip here
obviously where you insert your game
pull out your stylus now if you guys
want to see more of the ports and closer
imagery of the 3ds in general then
definitely make sure to click on one of
those links for my other 3ds unboxing I
go very in-depth with the regular black
version which obviously the ports and
functions are going to be identical to
this particular version - the extra
designs of course
so here is the game regular Nintendo 3ds
game I don't believe there's anything
specific to this particular version
since you bought it with the console
here it is little SD card sized game I
love these little games and on the
left-hand side we've got a little bit of
documentation the manuals done up in a
couple of different language English in
French here in Canada of course and
underneath that we've got a little piece
of paper commemorating the 25th
anniversary of The Legend of Zelda and
inside there's a little bit of
documentation about of course Skyward
Sword which I also unbox really recently
if you want to check that out check out
the channel for that and lastly we've
got a little bit of Nintendo Club or
Club Nintendo I should say stuff so
anyway guys if you enjoyed this content
hopefully you can like and favorite this
video as it does help me keep doing what
I do I want to let you know that I
appreciate your viewership you guys make
this content possible I couldn't do
without you and I've got a lot more
coming up tonight I'm gonna have a bit
of a marathon I'm unboxing all that
stuff I showed you earlier so stay tuned
