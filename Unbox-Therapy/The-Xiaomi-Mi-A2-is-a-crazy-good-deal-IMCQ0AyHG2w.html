is interesting for a couple of different
reasons one main reason this is called
the me a tube and it features Android
one now I know this is a controversial
subject matter regarding the idea of
Android one stock Android various other
skins that exist on Android devices look
I'm a fan of what's familiar in most
cases when it comes to operating systems
so when I see something that looks and
feels the way that Google intended I get
excited now that doesn't mean it's gonna
be for everyone some people like certain
features on certain phones that come via
the skin that is installed on there so
this is a personal preference type of
thing the me a two is the latest Android
one device from Xiaomi I did do a video
on the previous one the a one and I
liked it for the price at that time
especially when you consider how limited
the options are for stock and great
experiences now there are a couple more
but this is still a leader in that
department especially right now because
this thing is actually on sale at
Aliexpress I'll have a link down in the
description it is brand shopping week
recently I did the video on the Polka
phone you guys you guys love that you
clicked on it you watched it the stuff
that's happening at this end of the
market is really interesting it's like
finally getting some some serious
quality at lower price points now that
device is 300 bucks let's go even
farther in this case to almost 200 bucks
now the version I have in front of me is
the 64 gigabyte 4 gigs of ram it's the
gold one now you can see here you have a
dual camera set up on the back dual SIM
a 20 megapixel front-facing camera this
one has a snapdragon 616 it's not quite
as powerful as the poka phone but again
we're at a different price point here
and there are some advantages to that
processor it's very power efficient so
even though this thing only has a 3000
milliamp hour battery it's probably
going to be decent on the 660 processor
and then of course the thing that
excites me the most Android 1 it's like
I pop this thing open no matter where I
am in the world
with the global version here and I have
a familiar interface I also get rapid
updates I get security patches all the
nice stuff from Google I get it more
quickly via Android one I am glad that
these types of devices exist when I was
in India I met a bunch of you guys and
men the me a1 was so popular it was
probably the phone that I saw most
frequently had to do a follow-up on this
because I know how hot this device is in
certain parts of the world pretty
straightforward clear case but they give
it to you you can't hate on that I see a
dongle so unfortunately we do not have a
dedicated headphone jack we are moving
into the dongle universe there it is me
a 2 12 megapixel plus 20 megapixel AI
dual camera large pixels the pixels on
here are combined to get better
low-light performance and there's
various other advantages fingerprint
scanner is in a good spot this off
center camera unit you get a little
bounce type-c connector down on the
bottom there's also a light version of
this phone which actually has some
features this one doesn't it's also on
promo right now it has slightly higher
resolution and it has a headphone jack
so even though it's called light maybe
it's not so light this looks like an IR
blaster you could use this as a remote
control we have a standard power adapter
here though this phone is capable of
quick charge as far as gold goes I guess
it's kind of nice it's settled ah the
familiar face of Android 1 now at this
point here you're looking at an almost 6
inch screen in a universe full of
notches this is somehow kind of
refreshing you don't have to notch out
absolutely everything alright so let's
quickly set up the fingerprint on this
register my index finger and test this
out real quick you can probably tell
it's not the absolute quickest there's a
bit of a delayed animation there but
again we have to adjust our expectations
to match the price point just over 200
bucks I can live with that immediately
I'm comfy you see I'm comfortable it's
looking like a pixel it's feeling like a
pixel you swipe up from the bottom pull
down from the top it's completely stock
experience all the way into the set
of course every device I use are at
least a lot of them recently they aren't
Stockham right I'm putting a launcher on
but that launcher doesn't extend into
the settings menu so there's a bit of a
lack of cohesiveness and relearning
that's happening to me right now
in fact on the p20 Pro where I go into
the settings menu and things are just
laid out slightly differently and
therefore it's a little less comfy at
least immediately so when an operating
system is consistent across devices you
can change over more rapidly now that's
obviously why manufacturers are
reluctant to make stock devices in the
first place then you can flip between
them more quickly than if you buy into
whatever their ecosystem or whatever
their skin and whatever special features
they happen to have I think people are
compelled by the fact that you're
getting an OS that looks like it does on
a much more expensive phones like the
pixel or pixel to excel now I've heard
the speaker is supposed to be pretty
loud on this so
it might not have the best sound quality
that I've heard but it's louder than I
expected
now you can pretty much completely cover
it on the bottom in I'd say that speaker
exceeds my expectations actually it's
quite loud the camera okay cool now I
was hopeful because this is from Xiaomi
and because I recently tried out the
Polka phone with the 20 megapixel
front-facing camera I was hopeful that
this one would be similar if not the
same because I was impressed with that
selfie camera on there so let's go ahead
and check out the results and see if it
is you know it's a lower price point
actually look quite similar and quite
impressive this is where things are
getting crazy
once upon a time if you were spending
close to $200 on a smartphone it meant
you were making some significant
compromises in the camera department you
would get some terrible selfies I mean
even recent devices like the BlackBerry
that I was using the front-facing camera
was terrible but if you know where to
look and you know where the value lives
all of a sudden it's like whoa maybe
it's not the best in the world for the
price it's like detail holy bananas the
rear camera is a dual setup 12 plus 5
megapixel so first up no depth effect
beer in the foreground plant in the
background very little focus fall off
their image wise not bad again yes we
have lighting here but come on now now
we will try the same shot but with the
portrait mode on and I'll select the
bottle the depth effect boom the plant
is a little bit more blurry but it's not
really over-the-top it's believable kind
of yeah there's better ones probably
obviously there's some better smartphone
cameras but still at the price it's like
keeps getting harder to justify spending
the really big bucks on smartphones all
things considered ok so I know what
you're thinking you're like glue where
does it stacked up how do I compare it
to other devices in the similar price
range similar
bracket because there are so few Android
one devices then you're limiting your
choices and you probably would choose
this one but if you want to extend your
pricing a little bit like you want to go
up to 300 bucks into the Polka phone
range then you get a better processor
you get a bigger battery no you don't
get the Android one program but you
certainly get some things you might like
you get a design that I personally like
a little bit more as opposed to this
more traditional aluminum which actually
happens to be a bit slippery you kind of
have to figure that out for yourself if
you want a deal I mean this thing is a
deal right now
via the Aliexpress link that I'm gonna
have down in the description that's a
deal that's kind of tough to be myself I
have a high level of appreciation for
the stock Android experience you've
heard me talk about it before as far as
what that's worth to you that's gonna be
up to you I mean that's a really hard
thing to quantify whereas the value
associated the software interface and
the skin that's on there is is more
subjective it's more personal for me it
has a lot of value and if I was in the
$200 price range for a smart phone
decision I would seriously consider this
one if not just selected straight away
so because of that this is a major pick
for me at the price range and especially
at the current promotion there it is
another Android one development one
thing to remember if you want to save
even more cash and go down to the lite
version the a2 Lite you actually get
some things that this one doesn't have
like a bigger battery a headphone jack
and expandable storage so the light
version is not so light you let me know
down in the comments can you name a
better phone or a phone you would rather
have at this current promotional price
210 bucks USD starting for the me a 2 do
you have a better suggestion because if
so I want to hear it for me it will
probably be this one Android one I think
it's a cool thing and I hope it
continues because options are good
selections are good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
