you've been going so I've been thinking
a lot about the iPhone since the last
video I put up presented a couple of
different viewpoints on what this phone
represents this iPhone 8 and eventually
the iPhone 10 and the significance of
the iPhone as a product and Apple the
company as a whole they've both been a
significant part of the rise of this
channel my channel and the rise of tech
videos on YouTube so I've been thinking
a lot about the iPhone in general as a
product now taking me back to that
original iPhone Apple says is the next
big thing now I doubt very many people
would argue the fact that the iPhone
brand has had a substantial impact not
just on YouTube in channels like mine
but on the world as a whole now what
might surprise a lot of you is that the
initial iPhone didn't actually sell that
well I don't think people knew if they
wanted it or not if they needed it or
not 14 million units now that number
pales in comparison to the eventual
sales figure for the most popular
version of the iPhone ever the iPhone 6
and 6-plus
Apple sold around 200 million of those
so you can see how that business scaled
from the original iPhone to the most
popular version when you clicked on this
video you saw the title you saw this
outrageous claim this idea that the
iPhone might just be the most successful
product ever ever well I put something
like this on my Twitter recently and my
goodness did people fire back with their
opinions of what the most successful
products were now when we talk about
success we're not talking strictly
economically we're probably talking
mostly economically but we're also
talking the number of units sold the
number of units in existence the number
of units that are still being used to
this day in other words the durability
of the product because the next question
it tends to come up consumable
you start to mention things like
coca-cola and the Big Mac where your
dollar gets a break every
these things that you're meant to have a
lot of frequently and then they
disappear
what about Kleenex dominating more for
your money
and colored do it's hard to go anywhere
and not see a box of Kleenex but again
it's a cheap box sure over the course of
your life you buy a lot of it but how
much do you buy a minute do you buy a
thousand dollars a year worth of it what
about coca-cola those are about a buck
apiece you get a thousand of those so
here's the thing when you combine the
frequency at which you buy a product the
lifespan of that product and how often
you upgrade it and the overall economic
investment in that product you land on
things like this on these devices that
frequently change out for us there are
very few things in your life that you
spend the kind of money that you spend
on your new phone
Apple specifically has dominated the
luxury segment the average price of an
iPhone sold including older models at
retail is just under $700 per unit now
to put that in perspective the average
sale price of a galaxy device is around
$250 now that's because Samsung retails
less expensive Galaxy devices and
elsewhere in the world and they sell Wow
this is why when you look at current
market share figures you see Apple has
dipped down to number three but when we
talk about successful products in
general we're not talking about last
month we're talking about overall now
the iPhone has been around a while in
smartphone terms what is it like nine
years but that's still relatively short
when you compare it to the leaders in
other market segments so Horus dead you
who wrote this article which captured my
attention where he lists off the most
successful products by category okay
here we go
car bought the VW Beetle that's sold
21.5 million units now cars are
interesting because they're expensive so
that's a lot of transactional revenue
that's a lot of money turning over but
even then it's only 21 million units
when you scan all the way down to the
bottom two mobile phone you can see that
the iPhone has passed one billion units
in existence 1 billion car brand it
doesn't mean like Ford Mazda Chevy a
particular model over the years not one
version
of that model Toyota Corolla wins out
their 43 million units at the time of
this article of course that figures a
little bit higher now how about music
album Thriller by Michael Jackson 70
million copies vehicle overall the Honda
Super Cub 87 million units that's a
little a little bike which apparently
took over the world I was unaware of
book title Lord of the Rings 150 million
copies the Rubik's Cube sold 350 million
units and this got me thinking about
what about all those knockoffs probably
an even bigger number now this is where
things get really interesting to me is
when we talk about game consoles
PlayStation as a product one two three
four and the various versions in between
has sold close to 400 million units
almost half of the number of iPhones
that are out there but with a
Playstation it's kind of useless without
software and I know you're gonna bring
up the idea of the App Store on the
iPhone but the iPhone is functional even
without downloading third-party apps a
PlayStation without games the
expectation is that you will buy
expensive software for it so if you were
to tally up those 400 million
Playstations plus the average number of
games to go along with it now you have a
compelling argument PlayStation might be
the second most successful product ever
now things get even more complicated
when you head over to the Wikipedia page
of the best-selling phones ever because
at the top you'll see it's dominated by
a company you rarely hear about anymore
Nokia these guys occupy 1 2 3 4 5 6 at
least 7 of the top 10 spots with very
similar models the 1100 and 1110 those
bar-style phones which all of you have
seen and each one of those models sold
250 million units now smartphones don't
appear until number 3 where you have
that iPhone 6 and 6-plus that I
mentioned earlier in 2014 it's highly
unlikely that these devices occupying
the top spots from Nokia are still in
use today because they got sideswiped by
the new idea by the touchscreen
smartphone by the computer in your
pocket nonetheless they're still at the
top i OS devices will sometime shortly
pass a trillion dollars in revenue a
trillion dollars worth
of iOS devices just out there broken
down into individual units we're talking
about a billion iPhones either in
people's hands I'm sure some of them are
in landfills Lou
what about Android you tell us you're
using Android you like Android Android
is outselling iPhone that is where the
growth in the marketplace is happening
they have a far greater breadth of
product offerings that's one of the
advantages of Android now if we were
comparing Android devices completely
against Apple devices of course we'd
have a huge number but Android in and of
itself is not a product it's a license
the top Samsung device on this list is
not a galaxy phone at all it's the e
1100 of which there were a hundred and
fifty million units sold and that was a
bar-style phone the top galaxy device is
the s4 which sold around 80 million
units in other words not even half of
what the iPhone 6 and 6-plus sold but
even if you were to take all of the
Galaxy devices the best-selling Galaxy
devices and put them against this one if
you added up everything on this page you
still don't get to the iPhones figure
now granted if we're looking at this
thing as a race of course Samsung is
catching up rapidly and Apple continues
to dwindle as a percentage of overall
worldwide sales but when we talk about a
successful product we're talking about
the lifespan as a whole and that's why
the other side of the conversation gets
interesting with the coca-cola's of the
world now for those of you that are
gonna be down in the comments talking
about bottled water oil and coffee but
here's the thing those things in and of
themselves are not unique products and
you might say what about cars they're so
expensive it's not a fair comparison
well none of this is a fair comparison
obviously now when it comes to this
conversation about the success of the
iPhone in general Apple has one kind of
trick up its sleeve they call everything
iPhone every series of iPhone is iPhone
even when there's an older model last
year's model that becomes the budget
model even though it's usually not so
budget for the following year iPhone
five six seven eight I see these various
versions are essentially just
continuations of the previous version
being sold and so because of that when
you add them all up they become part of
this product
part of this billion figure and now that
brings us to the more abstract part of
this conversation
maybe we're not just talking about
success in a strictly economic sense
maybe let's also look at it from another
angle a relevancy angle there's one
thing you do every single day of your
life you reach for your smartphone or
you have it in your pocket companies
like uber and Google and tinder that was
spawned of this ability to immediately
access the web earlier today we're
watching music videos from the 90s and
you notice that people in the street
they're not staring down crouched over a
device so the implications here with
this particular product massive
behavioral changes that now exist
amongst society as a consequence of
access to one of these things what about
the camera the fact that everyone is now
carrying one what does that mean oh well
it means that when some sort of
injustice happens you can guarantee it's
gonna be recorded and uploaded whether
you're a fan of Apple or not the
implications are massive the numbers are
massive whether or not you think it's
the most successful product ever might
have to do with your interpretation of
success and product it's very difficult
to argue the dominance of the iPhone to
this point I personally think you can
make a really good case for the iPhone
as the most successful product ever but
even if the iPhone is the most
successful product ever I don't think
it's gonna stay that way all the data
we're looking at right now shows a lot
of manufacturers coming up quickly and
closing that gap on overall sales
figures for all time maybe we're on the
tail end maybe the significance of the
iPhone is diminishing and maybe this
iPhone eight right here is evidence of
that they're certainly not gonna sell
zero of them but I don't think they'll
ever have the market dominance that they
once did
this episode of unbox the P has been
brought to you by audible this of course
is your place to find all the audiobooks
you could ever want including one that
I've been listening to recently an
effective way to listen to books rather
than have to read them I know myself I
like to do it in the car if you have a
long commute
why sit there in traffic
bumper-to-bumper without learning you
could be learning something I mean I
like to listen to non-fiction stuff but
hey maybe if you like fiction you could
uh you could float off into some faraway
land instead of just being stuck in
gridlock now right now I'm listening to
the Steve Jobs book from Walter Isaacson
and I think that ties in well to this
video right here if you're interested in
some of the early stage development of
that original iPhone that I talked about
earlier you can hear a lot of the
backstory in this particular biography
and the cool part here is you can try it
out for free using the link in the
description or heading over to
audible.com slash unbox you get a 30-day
free trial and you get to download one
book that you can keep regardless even
if you cancel your membership that book
is yours on the house you get to keep it
listen to some books because you're
