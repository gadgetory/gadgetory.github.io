priced out that a hundred times maybe a
thousand my level of familiarity with
the thing I'm about to look at is very
slim there's lights on them cami on cami
on cami on turn your light on it's some
kind of glasses that display a message
in lights there's a lot of questions
here but that's why you're tuned into
unbox therapy you're here to find out
about the emerging stuff you had no idea
existed I mean that's what I'm here for
I think we're both here for the same
purpose world peace of course I'm gonna
put jack on the spot here Jack do you
know what language this is right over
here
no you don't know you don't bud wrong
bingo
whoa this like some Terminator stuff I'm
on my Arnold vibes right now whoa is
this a strap so they stay on maybe us
too
triple-a batteries this for the dude
that goes to the party and has something
to prove or you're just Arnold in which
case you wear these to the bank and to
the post office Terminator 2 is the best
Terminator right what whoa you're the
only one who thinks that let's have a
vote in the comments Terminator 1 or
Terminator 2 and you'll see what the
truth of the matter is this is where the
batteries go in the back here okay here
we go
let's see here I'm see anything yet and
the inside I don't know if Jack can pick
this up but there's like these little
slits so that you can still see through
them can you see that Jack whoa I got to
find the right look at that
Yee 7 9 400 Jack Attack is gonna
probably have those ones on right there
the waves
fireworks there's a few pre-built things
in here what does that say cool
oh it says go just go go somewhere get
out of here whoa
psychedelic oh good good bud here you go
who me oh I'm just minding my own
business good luck or what
no one's gonna he'll never pick me out
of a crowd Oh download the app you see
the app is connecting they're connected
wow that was easy look at this I can
create my own message now for the
glasses so I can put in some text I
throw unbox in there you know I could
put Jack in there
have yourself a Jack Attack I could have
Jack bounce along later that's look at
that oh my goodness creator gets insane
like I could draw something in here so I
can illuminate certain ones it's also
got an equaliser this is not a
legitimate equalizer obviously oh my god
it is whoa I take that back this is
actually we need some music I don't know
how accurate it is
I feel like Daft Punk right now robot
rock oh you want to talk about party
you got something like this going on oh
my goodness
and then the Explorer what does this
stuff other people have made oh my
goodness it is so anybody's design I
guess they can upload it and then you
can go ahead and download it too sexy
I'm too sexy for my shirt too sexy for
my shirt so sexy it hurts I'm a model if
you know what I mean as I do my little
dance on the catwalk yeah on the catwalk
you guys remember that Tom how old are
you get out of here I'm too sexy for my
pants whose you see you hijack I mean
that's one way to get the conversation
going you just show up with that next
thing you know someone's buying you a
drink that's not the way it works kids
do not take my advice on that when it
comes to unbox therapy videos there's a
varying degree of practicality okay some
things it's like wow I see immediately
how that is going to impact my life
tomorrow all right that's going to solve
some problem I'm not sure about these
from a practical standpoint they're
probably not going to solve a problem
you have I mean maybe they would maybe
they will next thing you know you're in
Mexico eating a taco you wouldn't been
doing that otherwise I'm too sexy for my
shirt so sexy it hurts</div></body></html>
