and my own possibly Jax this is a very
exciting moment here on unbox therapy
because when I heard about this thing
that's in front of me you see it's very
large I responded immediately to the
email I was like send this thing to me
because what I have in here is some tech
it is almost magical inside this box is
possibly the most advanced chess set
ever Ahmet this was launched on
Kickstarter I'm not sure what stage or
phase it's in right now I just know I
have one of the only copies on the
planet now I'm not even a chess expert
let alone a master but this right here
it's about to be some magical Harry
Potter type stuff and where did you see
it where are you gonna see it on unbox
therapy that's where there it is now
it's called square off there's your
pieces the concept here is that the
pieces move on their own
I don't you tell them that yet the
pieces slide across the table on their
own I don't know I don't know we're
gonna find out some power for it as well
that's about it oh and a note hey Luis
how are you finally we meet my creators
must have spoken to you about me but let
me formally introduce myself I am square
off the world's most evolved chess board
ever
how many classic tangible chess boards
allow you to play against an opponent
sitting across the globe you're that
jack rather than just have like a video
game type interface the physical pieces
are moving you can touch you can touch
it you get intimate with your opponent
playing options versus a friend or vs.
machine play against square ups
artificial intelligence 20 difficulty
levels
Wow I think it's going to be a WoW
moment when these things start to move
across the board so I'm guessing the
first step is to set them up power port
over here and then a power switch oh
cool I gave a little stand for your
phone I'm gonna power it on and I hear
like a little noise it makes I think
whoa whoa that sounded like a photocopy
or something now there's an app to go
with it so I've got the app Oh
pairen whoa I'm connected I can
challenge a machine or friend I start
with the machine I'm guessing I need to
have these things on me or me I probably
should have had them on there before I
started the game right King is over here
we'll get some beeps right now
this still right that's the way I did it
the right way that was right right the
Queen goes on the color I can play chess
just spin a lot kind of Miss this game I
used to play this as a kid I recall now
okay everything is set up get the white
on this side the black pieces over here
I've got the app open over here connect
to the board it should bring it up and
pair hopefully there we go and that
little beat tells you that you're
connected now I'm gonna play against the
Machine right now I say Lou looks like a
normal chess board I don't get it man
this this is where the magic is about to
happen so but I don't know let's say I
move this one you want to register on
the spot you're coming from and then the
spot you're going to now watch this Oh
I never claimed to be a chess master all
right people but I want to show you guys
what happens when a guy gets killed my
guy gets taken liam neeson stop oh man
you want this guy over here I put a
little pressure on the way this here oh
yeah back up I was gonna do something
stupid so you guys can see what happens
when a player gets taken I move here to
here take that guy put him over here now
obviously they're gonna take the Queen
look at them go
ha i watch the pawn will move in there
that's my pot now I don't know if you
guys are as excited as I am about this
but I just think this is a really cool
way to learn and interact with chests
I'm playing against AI right now but of
course it's not a video game the pieces
are actually moving it's like I'm having
to reconsent xual eyes the way I look at
AI because there's a physical movement
associated with it and of course the app
is updating those movements as you key
them in the different engines built into
it right now and I'm sure that'll be
expanding and of course many different
difficulty levels as well
oh good bye ha ha Oh even top of my
queen how about that I'll take that
little guy yeah there you go you heard a
couple of beats 4 check if I try to move
say my king there invalid move I get two
beeps
goodbye I don't understand you feel like
normal chess pieces they've got a little
bit of felt on the bottom I don't know
there must be some metal under there
something good night what can I say
I mean it's self-explanatory this thing
is crazy cool I don't know maybe you
grew up you're playing chess with your
brother all the time now he left I don't
know using them where did he go he went
away to school or he's in the military
or something he can just pop out his app
and still play against you and you can
feel like he's right on the other side
it's got to be a game-changing thing in
the world of chess I'm sure you guys
want check on your crowdfunding progress
I'll put a link down in the description
this thing is cool that's the bottom
