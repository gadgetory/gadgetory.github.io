came out a little while ago but somehow
I didn't have a chance to try it out
until now I'm rummaging through I'm like
oh my goodness I've never made a
dedicated video on any surface product
this one right here three thousand
dollars this is the surface book -
thirteen point five inch core i7
processor it's got a geforce gtx 1050
you could do a little gaming on here one
terabyte of storage and 16 gigs of RAM
GTX 1050 in a surface 3,000 bucks
you're not even get the pen inside the
box for that three grand
so there it is the surface book -
highest spec level it's your usual power
brick they give you an extra USB the
bricks there anyways give me an extra
USB this is one of the really unique
things about this laptop this crazy
hinge on it the charge port right here
let's try it out at least it's magnetic
we have a USB type-c dedicated volume to
standard USB s and what looks like an SD
card slot wait we have a headphone jack
you have the 3 by 2 aspect ratio I
really like this curvature on the side
here trackpad down here clicky chiclet
style very little flex in the keyboard
pretty nice display actually three
thousand by two thousand right well the
speakers are up here I can see the
almost hidden grills they'll work well
with the tablet but also they're kind of
an ear level let's go give them a test
why not million subscribers easy just a
lot of people it's more than the entire
population of New York City ten million
is a lot they're not the loudest I've
heard but incredibly clear I think part
of that is just the location of them but
really where this thing differs from
other laptops is when you go ahead and
detach it and you just you know you take
this to the couch there's a key on the
keyboard right here right there to
detach the unit so I'm gonna hit that
and see what happens so now it's
flashing
oh look at that how nice is that way
lighter than I expected so the whole
thing is 3.4 pounds and most of it is
down here if you just come back like
this magnets it goes in will would you
like to fill me in on the battery life
as stated by Microsoft stop it
he just said 17 hours what the base is
responsible for about 12 hours
76 40 milliamp hour and then the
clipboard as they call it is 2003 8 7 so
5 hours of battery life in here and then
12 hours in here and when connected 17
total you can find better values in a
laptop if that's all you're looking for
but what about ones that can do what
this one does from a versatility
perspective you have to grant it some
leeway because it has that ability of
course an Apple ecosystem you're
expected to have a MacBook Pro and an
iPad even though you're on a tablet
you're on a full Windows operating
system you aren't stepping from Mac OS
over to iOS there's the pen as well I
wish was included in the box all of a
sudden you reach up
you touch with precision or you detach
all of a sudden I'm out and about look
at me what aren't I doing mmm that's
legit - super comfy
of course has a button on it as well and
an eraser nub and you can see how it
understands the nuance of the stroke I
think this is really interesting the
whole package and I'm a little bit upset
at myself from not having looked at it
up until this point because this came
out a while ago always liked products
like that that can fill in a number of
gaps you're a bit of an artist but you
like to game a little bit over here but
you need a good keyboard because you got
to write an exam but you also need big
battery life because you don't want to
carry your power brick to university can
this go on backwards as well we'll look
at this that's your next mode as well
maybe you want to eat lunch in front of
it you know you have your lunch right
here you stick an Xbox controller over
here you've got a little portable
console scenario and does this fold down
as well
you have a 17-hour tablet kaboom
this is interesting this should have
been on my radar it's really cool those
are my initial impressions I told you
I'll take it home I'm gonna see what's
up I'm gonna use it a little more but so
far I'm kind of into it this episode of
