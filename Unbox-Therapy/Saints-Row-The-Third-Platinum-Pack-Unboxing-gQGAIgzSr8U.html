therapy just got back from the midnight
launch of saints row the third this is
the Platinum pack which includes a
special edition headset along with the
game and some DLC and the soundtrack the
music behind the game so cool value here
this baby retails for $99 which to me is
a good value you know a lot of these
collectors and limited editions get up
around 99 bucks and they definitely
don't include a headset you know usually
it's a figurine or a statue so these you
can actually use you don't have to just
stick them on your shelf and look at
them so that's real cool especially if
you're in need of a headset and as you
guys can tell by looking at the image
here this these headphones are actually
pretty decent quality it's not just the
you know afterthought they're adjustable
they've got some chrome like finishes on
the outside
along with controls on the right hand
air cup to control music and talk
there's also an LED indicator that's
actually the left earphone but I guess
it doesn't really matter you could wear
it either way the inside is a
polyurethane you know like an artificial
leather but it feels good and soft
here's a closer look at that inline
remote with volume control so again you
can use this with your iPhone with your
Android smartphone anything that uses a
3.5 millimeter connector iPad laptop you
name it so an all-purpose headset for
any 3.5 millimeter device as you guys
notice there it'll fit a big head a
small head so real cool inclusion
something unusual to get with a game so
I'm pretty happy about that I'm excited
about that so the next thing is the game
and the soundtrack so here's the
official score you're actually going to
get the music and audio CD anybody still
listen to audio CDs it's gotta be
somebody so you're going to get the
music behind of course you can put those
in your laptop and throw them on your
iPhone if you don't want to use the
audio CD of course and then lastly we've
got the game and the game has got the
DLC inside of it of course so I'll get
you a closer look at that paperwork and
let you know what you're going to get as
far as in-game content the game disc is
on the right we've got our one-page
manual or used to getting these days
here's a look at that DLC you see there
there's a blank space the code is
actually printed on the back kind of
anyways you get the octopus gun man
occult car and you've also got the Genki
or janky suit I don't know how to
pronounce that somebody tell me which
way it is and these are all going to be
in-game things there's actually another
DLC pamphlet under here there's that one
page manual I was talking about and this
one again is going to give you another
online pass so real cool you're gonna
get some DLC you're going to get the
headphones you're going to get the game
you're going to get the soundtrack all
for 99 bucks I think a fairly decent
value anyway guys if you enjoyed this
