therapy and today we're taking a look at
the hero edition of infamous - I just
picked this up a little bit late as you
guys know it came out a couple of days
ago but I'm still just as excited as I
would be had I had a chance to get it
straight away as you guys know I like to
get the special editions sometimes as
question as to whether or not they
should warrant the extra amount of money
you got to pay for them but I like to
have you know the extra features and
whatnot just from a collector's
standpoint Plus this one's going to come
with early access to uncharted 3
uncharted 2 being one of my favorite
games ever so I'm excited about that -
so let's talk about the unboxing first
we've got a little mini comic here from
DC it's got to be a dozen pages maybe
anyway it's cool to have next we've got
the action figure now these will become
super popular in special editions or
hero editions whatever the hell you want
to call them I've unboxed a number of
different editions with action figures
and this one actually feels pretty good
so far
let's go ahead and get it untwisted get
it out of here
so yeah it's got some good weight to it
decent manufacturing I'm not sure who's
responsible for manufacturing this
particular one but I'm pretty sure it's
made in China like everything else no
offense or anything but anyway there's
what he looks like and he stands on top
of this stand here yeah there we go made
in China of course it doesn't say who
manufactures the toy but like I said it
actually feels pretty good
added to the collection here's what it
looks like up close you can get a sense
for the details pretty impressive
actually anyway next we've got the bag
that they've included it's kind of like
a sling style bag so for a lot of you
trying to convince your parents to buy
this for you go ahead and tell them you
need a new school bag maybe maybe then
they'll listen to you and go for the
more expensive version but it's a one
strap sling so you're not going to want
to put too much stuff in here if you are
going to use it it's got a couple little
pouches punched
from clips here you take it off that way
and a fairly reasonable sized interior
you've got the main zipper on the left
hand side and another little zipper on
the inside underneath this flap so
there's the main compartment and of
course we've got the silica gel do not
eat you will die and then underneath the
middle portion here we've got another
compartment this one is smaller so yeah
I mean if you want to use this thing go
ahead if you want to keep it as a
collector's item go ahead and do that
too it's up to you as a beauty of buying
things do whatever the hell you want
with them so next we've got the game
itself and I'm not expecting too many
surprises in here like I said we've
obviously got that early access to the
uncharted 3 beta just go ahead and take
a look what that pamphlet looks like I
think there's also supposed to be some
in-game stuff that comes with the hero
edition four infamous 2 so hopefully we
get some special features not available
to those cheapskates that went for the
regular version I'm just kidding I told
you understand if you don't want to pay
the extra money for this version it's
for those kinds of people who have the
extra money to spend so anyway yeah
there is the uncharted 3 drake's
Deception beta voucher sweet and here we
go a super voucher for the hero edition
of infamous 2 so we'll go ahead and take
a look at what gets included on that
voucher and of course we've got the
manual and unlike some of the other ones
this one's actually legit it's got a few
pages in it which is decent anyway guys
go ahead and check out our channel I
just bought a new capture card so I'm
going to be putting up some gameplay of
this and subscribe if you want to check
that out later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
