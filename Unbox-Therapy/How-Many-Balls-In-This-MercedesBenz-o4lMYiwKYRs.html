interesting something exciting and large
big actually is a couple things and it's
going to be a twist in it so let's head
downstairs and take a look follow me
check this out
beautiful vehicles in this space right
now you're thinking loo what did you do
to get these Mercedes in here the CLA
over there the GLA now these are not
your average everyday cars because this
is part of a new thing a new lunch that
Carter goes actually doing but today
they're stepping the game up with all
the text features too you could either
go by the minute you could you could
take it for an hour you can take it for
a day you can pick it up and drop it up
anywhere as long as you're within the
home zone you don't have the extended
cost of like ownership insurance gas and
so on we're going to do a challenge
you're going to want to stick around for
that so don't move because if you look
over there you said giant green bag over
there you're doing something dissolve
but if for your benefit
this is all you have on the car now so
it's a little bit more stealth we're in
Toronto here but obviously this is
available in many many cities and it's
the same app so that's right here this
is where the tech magic happens you can
see I've got this application installed
you just launch open the app it'll take
a peak it'll look around for the closest
vehicle you see here this one is even
called unbox therapy that's because it's
in the unbox therapy HQ you see how
special that is you'll see the actual
vehicle that it's talking about that's
this one right here the GLA it shows you
the fuel level alright and it'll even
give you directions to get there if I go
ahead and start this rental take this
cold right here and type it into the app
nine five okay oh did you hear that boom
in the glove box there's a spot for the
key I'm going to feel right at home
after you jump in definitely you're
rolling you're going on a date if your
guy like Jack maybe maybe you find a
girlfriend finally I know it's hard to
believe of course we've got our climate
control you got to have that as well yes
kind of denim get it here you see a
table high heels and Ryan approaches
ethnic garb one of the most rare species
that's more like it as you can see he's
confused by his surroundings and then
goes Ryan back into his natural habitat
goodbye Ryan I told you it's got Android
auto and apple carplay you simply
connect you would be cable it'll prompt
you confirmed start ads right auto home
I hit the button and look at this let's
go your nav your phone your menu button
your music and now we have a wild calm
yes even more rare than a Ryan sighting
gracefully throughout the environment
inspecting the Mercedes Benz that has
entered his habitat and there he is
again
goodbye tom Godspeed oh baby
google play music you got your
subscription you got everything by
default it is suggest to use it for
driving I mean this is the beauty of
having the expandability of Android auto
apple carplay and I can put the graphic
to go whether you get the nice big
interface so you're not looking down at
your phone now we have an iPhone
connected Apple music podcasts audio
books and then your messages as well
chomping you got your cable pop in your
charging now and you got everything you
want right there I'm told it's like a
Harman Kardon sound system in here ooh
whoa
what's the excuse now rolling up in that
growing up in that car it's falling
apart
you get dents in it you get scratches
she's got a flat tire
what if you get enough zero get some
style you know
in order to mix it up a little bit and
also give you guys a chance to win
something very cool we've got in
addition we've got a bag of all we got
the ball pit balls we've got a fuel bag
we're going to see how many we can fit
inside of this vehicle right here you
are going to watch and you're going to
try to determine exactly how many balls
fit inside and if you guess correctly
the exact number and leave a comment
down in the comment section we will
select one person with the correct
answer and you will get $1,000 to use
car2go well first of all has anybody
seen Ryan we're going to need rhymes
help on it oh all right I'm heading in
I'm going to open the sunroof hey man
good thing we got a nice big sunroof for
this purpose the safe word is pizza
alright if I move route if I'm in real
danger count these balls as they come in
the vehicle the correct answer wins
Oh
then all you got well in kind of a weird
you're kind of an odd feeling man we've
got you're jealous right Oh
they'll slow down exactly so we are 95%
full right now the only the only way for
me to get the necessary oxygen I need to
survive is to poke out the sunroof
I found one deflated ball does that
count this counts alright if you've been
counting this count it's so weird it's
it
I mean gulp well this is in a weird way
this is kind of relaxing I don't know I
have like no stress on my body anywhere
who's been keeping track yeah I can't
say this is a spot I ever thought it
would be in my life I never envisioned
it you tell me how many V now involved
in this vehicle with me don't get close
desking exact number put it in the
comments down below get your comment in
there because one of you one lucky
person
he's going to win $1,000 a drive credit
for a beautiful Mercedes like this one
from carted off the exact number I want
the exact number do I look crazy yeah
Minna carful oh I can breathe
hahahahahahaha oh man okay so there you
have it we had some fun you made your
guesses one lucky person is going to win
a thousand bucks now it's time to bring
this back that's how easy it is I just
hop back in take you back to any spot
any spot and the next person can come
pick it up and have some fun themselves
so let's go let's get out of here
all right so this is the end of the trip
find a parking spot like I have here and
then prepare to end the rental so take
the key out slides into this spot back
into the glove box exit the vehicle and
then you'll see I slide this guy over
and rental boom rental would ended
automatically now if I like left the
sunroof open or a door wasn't completely
closed or something it would give me a
chance to do that say oh please close
the door first before you end the rental
but that's how simple it is now I'm at
my spot the vehicle is free for me to
reserve again if I want to use it again
well for the next person to come along
and have their own party maybe fill the
car up with some balls and see how many
there are
don't forget I want your guesses time to
win the Internet you can do it jack has
faith in you he actually does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
