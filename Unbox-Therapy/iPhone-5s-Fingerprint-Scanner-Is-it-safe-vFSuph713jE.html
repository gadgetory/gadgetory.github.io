be taking a detailed look at the
fingerprint scanner or sensor from the
brand new unreleased iPhone 5s we've
been lucky enough to get our hands on
the component pre-launch so in this
video we'll be taking a closer look
comparing it to the old home button from
the iPhone 5 and talking about these
security concerns and privacy concerns
when it comes to fingerprint scanning in
general the new home button looks
remarkably similar to that of the iPhone
5 for in previous generations but under
the hood are the necessary components
and the necessary technology to take a
high-resolution scan of your fingerprint
Apple is using hardware to create these
scans the technological method employed
is referred to as capacitance this
method varies greatly from traditional
electro-optical scanners which simply
capture a black and white image of your
finger and as such have been beatable
using in some cases a photocopy of a
person's print that helps to fool the
scanner and then grant access to the
person you don't want to grant access to
you may have seen these old
electro-optical scanners on laptops and
even some devices in the past like the
Atrix the new iPhone 5s uses the more
sensitive capacitance method instead of
bouncing light off the print to generate
a binary representation this method
relies on an array of miniscule
capacitive cells each less than a finger
Ridge wide these cells consist of two
conductor plates separated by an
insulating layer without getting super
technical this method also creates a
representative image except this time
with a much higher degree of fidelity
this presumably makes the new 5s sensor
tougher to crack
speaking of cracking fingerprint sensors
traditionally fingerprint locks have
actually proven fairly secure if the
technology behind Apple's new scanner
delivers on its promise it should prove
to be even more secure than previous
generations the problem with
fingerprints though is that unlike a
password or pattern on lock if they're
ever compromised I'll be difficult to
become compromised they can't be changed
you're stuck with them for life unless
you plan on becoming a cyborg or
swapping out your hand for a better
robotic version somewhere in the future
let's pray for that future this has some
would-be 5s users concerned what is the
consequence of storing all of this
fingerprint data from a huge chunk of
society is it safe can this stuff be
used against us before we delve too
deeply into that discussion I would like
to point out that Apple claims to store
the fingerprint data locally rather than
in the cloud or on a server somewhere
they've obviously designed the system in
this manner to ease potential privacy
concerns from skeptical citizens
especially in light of the recent NSA
leaks etc your fingerprint data is said
to live in a secure portion of the a7
chip inside your iPhone and only your
iPhone that being said I want to get
back to the original question is this a
safe way to store fingerprint data
should your fingerprint data be stored
on your phone and can it eventually be
used against you according to marcia
hoffman of Wired magazine the answer is
yes while there's a great deal of
discussion around the pros and cons of
fingerprint authentication from the hack
ability of the technique to the
reliability of readers no one's focusing
on the legal effects of moving from pins
to fingerprints because the
constitutional protection of the Fifth
Amendment which guarantees that no
person shall be compelled in any
criminal case to be a witness against
himself may not apply when it comes to
biometric based fingerprints things that
reflect who we are as opposed to memory
based passwords and pins things we need
to know and we need to remember simply
put your fingerprint is a physical token
rather than something you remember that
lives in your mind like a passcode the
Fifth Amendment gives citizens the
privilege against self-incrimination
this is why the government in
and civil cases attempts to compel a
person to make a testimonial but the
ball remains in the court of the accused
when a person has a valid privilege
against self-incrimination nobody not
even a judge can force the witness to
give that information to the government
this privilege only exists for the
contents of one's mind other evidence
not so much including what lives on your
phone and the fingerprint used to access
it in simple terms if your device has a
pass lock on it you know a passcode or a
pattern unlock and there's incriminating
evidence on that device you are not
required to provide the passcode
information to the authorities so that
they can look into it the Fifth
Amendment protects you from that so you
can keep that information in your mind
if it is self incriminating if that same
device requires a physical token instead
of data that exists in your mind the
authorities could presumably force you
to unlock the device therefore as of
this moment it appears that using a
fingerprint lock on your device
relinquishes your ability to invoke the
Fifth Amendment if there happens to be
incriminating data on that device locked
by that finger this might not seem like
a huge deal to you especially if you're
a person who likes to follow the rules
or somebody who's not planning to buy
the new iPhone 5s but you need to pay
attention and you need to care because
of the fact that whenever Apple adopts a
standard whether that be a new or old
standard it tends to accelerate the
adoption from everybody else and by
everybody else I'm not just talking
about end users I'm talking about
hardware companies and other software
companies that want to employ the new
technology for the sake of convenience
or otherwise so we might very well see
fingerprint sensors or scanners in a lot
of things that currently require PIN
codes so now my question for you the
audience does this information concern
you will it stop you from purchasing a
5s or are you gonna buy one and use it
right away for the sake of convenience
leave a comment down below because I'm
interested to know where all of you
stand on it anyway guys that wraps up
this video thanks as always for watching
if you enjoyed this content
please remember to leave a thumbs up
down below and also remember to
subscribe for more similar content and
actually some tests coming up when the
5s does actually launch of this actual
fingerprint sensor all right guys thanks
again and I'll catch you on the next
video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
