today we're gonna check out a speaker
hopefully it'll blow your brains out
is that enough can I just you're
probably wondering why I'm wearing these
sunglasses well if you want more
information go watch the last video
there is an actual video to be made here
this is the new diamond box bluetooth
speaker if you've been following the
channel for a little while you probably
saw the original diamond box video we
made well what they did is they took the
form factor compacted it a little bit
made it more portable supposedly they
kept the same sound signature which at
the time when I tested that video there
were a lot of oohs and ahhs in this
space right here I always get pumped up
videos about Bluetooth speakers because
we get to listen to music and evaluate
sound diamond box is an example of how
you can kind of push the expectations
when it comes to a Bluetooth speaker oh
oh it's got a different material as well
and that's important to note because
this one is a little more weather
resistant look help that looks good
right
that color whoa that's gonna get you
some attention from an appearance
perspective you bring that thing people
know it's gonna be a party if you like
to watch events on projectors link one
of these guys up now you have a totally
portable solution auxilary input power
switch on and off of course bluetooth is
well and then you've got this dedicated
volume knob one of the cool things about
these diamond box speakers is you can
see all the components there's no grill
over the top of it so you can actually
see the speaker units two tweeters and
this nice bass port in the middle there
on the back all you've got is your power
in it does have an internal battery as
well I almost forgot about this over
here is an actual 2 carats easy
diamond and it serves as the battery
level indicator for the diamond box hada
gets the name that I'm in box is anybody
taking me seriously right I mean I'm
still here guys just don't look at me
sideways or else diamond box look at
that comes up a couple of tacks
you know it's a party when you get you
get to see the woofers down here just
boo boo boo boo boo boo get down with it
this whole room is thumping right now
really amazing what you can can do with
a little cabinet we're so used to
listening to our digital audio in subpar
situations little crappy speakers or
tiny little earbuds that were included
with the device we're listening on just
to hear it breathe a little bit maybe
you like to be out playing basketball
some street hockey something like that
you have this thing out there's a
different level of motivation right now
that's some old-school vibes right there
with the handle oh my goodness it sounds
great what can I say they did it again
