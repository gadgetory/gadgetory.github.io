on something yeah yeah I would see that
man stow it man it looks like a clock if
it barks like a duck and it quacks like
a dog it's probably a clock okay it's a
smart clock ah right well here's the
thing it's meant to look like that while
doing something else completely it's got
a Wi-Fi camera with night vision Shh
with night vision look at the back
there's an app you see the whole room
it's hooked up to Wi-Fi to the cloud I
like the way they position is the
perfect way to stay in touch with your
home or office see and hear everything
using your smart phone or tough listen
if you wanted to stay in touch you'd
have a camera that looked like a camera
we all know what you're doing here with
the spy cam maybe there's one of those
situations where it's like you got the
housemaid Jack you got the housemaid
she's ripping you off she's stolen
you should wiped out you want to keep
tabs without everybody else necessarily
knowing you're doing so I guess that's
where this comes in I'm really skeptical
I'm wondering about the quality Wi-Fi
camera clock Wi-Fi connection and a
built-in battery infrared ray lets you
see well when there's little or no light
we shall be testing that and mobile
device recording you can save live video
it works with an app called Liz V
billable on the iOS App Store as well as
Google Play this box the quality of this
box is staggering one of the nicest
textures I've ever felt on a box with 32
gigabyte SD card you will also
experience the texture of a lifetime
cool built-in battery microSD it has a
power switch speaker power interface and
microphone so there's sound on there as
well I guess you could answer phone
calls when you're not spying on people
we have a power brick a relatively long
microUSB charging cable also a SanDisk
32 gigabyte card see that there jack
Ballu what else oh here it is it's a
perfect cube I like that when I was a
youngster was visiting Orlando Florida I
went to Universal Studios and I was down
on that strip there's that street that
has all the shops and restaurants and
stuff you know you go out there at night
and I was a kid keep this in mind and
there was a spy store down there I was
like no way we got spy cameras and
little hidden weapons and gadgets and
radiofrequency gear and things like this
and I was like from that moment forward
I mean that was probably part of my
gadget interest in general I don't
remember how old I was but this is the
kind of thing you would have found in a
store like that of course now you order
it on Amazon nonetheless still cool it
really does the job of looking like
something else quite well look at this
thing you got it very mean on a bedside
table or something who's gonna figure
that out
oh it has a battery it has a battery
built-in I guess if the power gets cut
someone unplugs it you're still golden
on the back you have a reset button a
mode button up down probably to navigate
the interface on/off switch the USB port
and then of course a spot for your micro
SD card and this looks like a speaker it
obviously needs juice
so obviously the SD card is gonna be
used for local recording but I'm
actually more interested in the Wi-Fi
capabilities like the ability for this
thing to string to a phone I think
that's kind of cool but anyway I don't
know I'm not gonna throw this it maybe I
should just throw it in and maybe I need
it boot it up can you see that there
okay we got to set it moult look at that
that's what it looks like when it's in
clock mode you don't know what's going
on you buy that really curious Oh
okay let's see if the app can help me
get this thing running here because as
of right now I mean it just it's just a
clock that's all it is so I downloaded
it add a camera plug in and turn on the
device you will hear a sound when the
device is active we heard the sound
right press and hold the reset key for
five seconds one two three four five we
did not hear that sound scan the qr-code
whoo-hoo feeling like a spy here jack
check it out okay here we go QR got it
camera name well of course there you go
see that Jack I'm putting in the Wi-Fi
password now to connect this to my Wi-Fi
here does anyone know that that's about
press to send acoustic wave it's like it
sounds like r2d2 right now this is one
of the more interesting tear up
processes that feels very high-tech it
looks like it's complete I'm gonna hit
finish whoa whoa okay so Jack is online
now whoa it's got me they caught me
red-handed whoa that's cool you know if
I look at this if I hold this up and
really examine this I can kind of see
the camera lens but I mean if I didn't
know it was there there's no way I'd
ever suspect this thing yeah I can see
Jack right there Ryan come walk close to
it come walk up to it it's not the
greatest frame rate if you were trying
to put your grubby paws on something
yeah yeah I would see that and now
apparently it also has night vision now
I can turn the sound on and off look can
I speak what is this speak button hold
to talk hello oh I guess feedback cuz
I'm right beside it but this is how it
would work
I'd be like you are in you are intruding
get out of my head out of my house right
now
now I see you you you filthy filthy
thief
if you don't get out of my room or right
now nobody calling the cops and you're
going in the paddy wagon you imagine
you're trying to steal something the guy
starts talking to you big Tom's gonna
say a few words that's a kind of cool
feature that actually might help you I
don't know I'm not I'm trying to vision
the circumstance but like I guess if
something was really going down
I can also trigger a recording straight
from here
remember the Donald sterling thing
remember that scenario like she wasn't
allowed to be recording him or why is
she I can't remember but then I don't
know what the rules are in your own
house I think even in your own house you
can't you can't record someone without
them knowing but if it's a thief
what if they broke into your house and
you can record him right I'm gonna hit
the record button so now it's recording
let's see I'm gonna hello there yes law
abiding citizen here I'm noticing it's
there's a little bit of lag there I'm
hoping that that recording sends the
video file to the storage on the device
in case there's some sort of error with
the communication linking up to the
Wi-Fi and then to your phone I can
switch to HD oh my goodness okay Oh Oh
much higher framerate
oh just much better in general maybe you
would use the lower definition just for
storage space so you could let it roll
longer let's be honest this is not a
professional video camera that's not the
idea you're trying to just see what's
going on and as you can tell you're
definitely able to do that and here you
can see the different video files
recorded in mp4 format look at that if I
click on the SD I guess that refers to
the SD card it's telling me about motion
detection here whoa so it even has a
motion sensor in it which could trigger
a recording I see it breaks them up into
little clips whenever it senses movement
all right there's a lot more settings
than I expected password modification
record-setting motion detection infrared
light and an email alarm that you can
set up so it's like it's kind of like a
legit security camera which just happens
to be hidden inside of another object
wow that's pretty cool I guess the last
thing to check out is the infrared so
let's go ahead and hit the lights
whoa do you see how well that sees me
and as you can see this is pitch black
guys and it's got a full infrared setup
you can see me clearly right now if this
was sitting like this with the time
illuminated in a room you're not
thinking twice about it it just looks
like a normal clock you can see him
waving he's way down there and of course
Jack over here doing his job as usual
couldn't do it without him alright so
there you have it I mean it functions
possibly even better than I expected for
what it is the size that it is how
hidden it is I think it does a pretty
good job of capturing the event whatever
that event happens to be the infrared is
really cool also and Ryan has just
informed me regarding the recording
restrictions apparently it applies
mostly to audio which is why you can of
course turn the audio recording portion
of this off but video on the other hand
in most places so long as it's a
reasonable environment you're not
putting it in like a bathroom or
something it should be okay so I don't
know I'm not telling you how to use this
thing but it is cool you look up
whatever applies in your local
jurisdiction but it is cool if you've
been noticing a few things don't miss it
around your house or something like that
pop this baby on crack the case wide
open this is cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
