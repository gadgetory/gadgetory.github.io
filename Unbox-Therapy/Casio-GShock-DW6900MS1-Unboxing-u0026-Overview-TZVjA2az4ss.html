of you that are into digital watches the
model today is called the DW 6900 ms -
one and if you just glanced at the back
of the box you'll realize that the model
number listed on the cardboard doesn't
correspond with the model I just
mentioned I've actually had this happen
a few times where I'll purchase a watch
that came from a store and maybe it was
on display or something and as a result
the cardboard that they packaged it in
is from a different model of course that
happens accidentally not a big deal
here is our casio timepiece limited
warranty that standard stuff here's our
manual as we flip through it we notice
right away that there's this neon
colored insert which ah is unusual and I
first glance it it looks like it's a
diagram on how to use the band as if you
needed a diagram to tell you how to put
a watch on here's some information
regarding some of the materials used and
how the state of California wants them
to be handled it's kind of strange
here's the watch itself and why waste
time out here let's get closer up to it
so as you can see you've got the
negative LCD and the red numbering and
as you hit the back like you saw that
the backlight was actually a bluish
color the entire exterior is Stealth
everything is black it's got a matte
finish the back is your regular
stainless feel you can see made in China
water-resistant 220 bars and you've got
this plated clasp here here's what the
watch looks like on my wrist and as I've
said in previous g-shock videos my wrist
is probably
average to large-size so it's a decent
size watch and here's a size comparison
against my vessel I've used my vessel as
a comparative watch in many of my other
watch videos you can see thickness here
the vessel model is called the observer
here you can see the back so a
substantial watch check out our channel
we got lots more coming up</div></body></html>
