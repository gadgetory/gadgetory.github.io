no you notice how every single historic
flick no matter where it takes place is
in English accent all right cool yeah
this is one of the coolest boxes I've
received in a while it's hard to even
call it a box it's more like a treasure
chest and if I turn it around
it says unbox therapy on it and look
look at that
what is it brass what is this made of
that is some cool packaging there is an
envelope that came with it
this is some real documentation here
whoa baby
certificate of authenticity 24 karat
gold Apple iPhone 10 customized and
electroplated with real gold by Jay
Bilas luxury in a nickel free
environment there's also a 42 millimeter
Apple watch series three stainless steel
there's an insurance policy on these I
guess you're spending this kind of money
on luxury item like that you you want to
have some protection so as part of the
program it's gotten certificate of
authenticity also a warranty card for
each of the two all who behold
substantial the series three Apple watch
and then we have the 256 gigabyte iPhone
10 as well so let's get started with the
watch $1300 immediately you're seeing
the gold plating on what used to be the
stainless steel body it's it's quite
seamless actually to the point where it
almost could be original like that the
strap also looks to be gold-plated on
the buckle you can see down here that
the text is all intact and then the
other items in the box too you know it's
pretty standard Apple watch oh my wait a
second nevermind
it's not big gold-plated the prongs you
never saw that and gold-plated Apple
watch charger they gold-plated the USB
as well as the charge brick that is uh
that's some attention to detail right
there remember you buy this thing you're
you're a Bond villain okay so we got the
watch now the main attraction here is in
the iPhone 2
with the watch this is a match made in
heaven the ultimate combo the 256
gold-plated iPhone 10 for the person who
has everything but needs to flex on
another level probably got like a
Bugatti probably got like a swimming
pool on the rooftop and a helicopter pad
I got like one of those systems where
you walk into each room and the music
changes with your mood probably got like
a rug that costs twenty eight thousand
dollars probably got like a command
center where they watch everything
that's on all at once here we go I'm
pumped up all right there it is ladies
and gentlemen I present to you 24 karat
gold-plated iPhone 10 that is unique
looking so it looks like it started life
as a white iPhone
holy smokes has got a serious protective
covering on it so it's not gonna have
any scratches when it arrives to you I
actually think the white goes better the
gold accents you're gonna get some
attention no doubt it'll put the two
together look at this you're taking over
the world right 24 karat gold plated
iPhone 10 and you see the 24 karat gold
plated Apple watch series 3 a
combination that goes together like
hamburgers and fries caviar and
champagne Haley who and Willie do this
episode of unboxing you buy skulkin more
specifically their crusher
wireless headphones base you can feel is
some sort of haptic technology that will

hours of battery life they have a
built-in mic and controls for answering
phone calls and so on and there's a
special promo currently if you pick

traveling pouch actually here are the
headphones very nice you can see they
fold up into a small package so they're
