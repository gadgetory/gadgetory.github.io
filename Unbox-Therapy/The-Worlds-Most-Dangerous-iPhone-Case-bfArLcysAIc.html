time so that you can apply the
yellowjacket into their arms and then
this is easily the craziest accessory
for a smartphone that I've ever featured
here so you can escape to safety I'm a
little bit apprehensive in general
because in front of me is a self defense
iPhone case it's called the Yellow
Jacket and it is the only backup battery
stun gun iPhone case like a currently
this thing can put out seven million
volts I don't know what type of
neighborhood you like to hang out in but
you wear it on the phone and if anybody
attacks you you hit them with the stun
any a part of the face the neck or to
the groin area down they go they leave
you alone it has a secondary
functionality of being a battery backup
as well 3,800 milliamp hours of power
that's positive that's what it looks
like very rugged boys and girls this is
a dangerous thing it is not a toy
concealed inside the yellowjacket is a
high-voltage stun gun dual safety
mechanism an ambidextrous trigger so you
can fire it off from the left or the
right it's not the battery case aspect
it's not the protection of the phone
itself it's the protection of you from
some attacker oh man look at that
warning this product can cause severe
injury or potentially death never leave
it unattended around minors only use if
you are in serious danger mr. Willy new
is getting nervous over there he's
sitting off-camera and he's starting to
get a little nervous this is interesting
they have included a screen protector I
guess if you're into self-protection why
not phone protection as well this is the
teal color but it comes in a couple of
different ones that's some full juice
right there
mega stopping power oh I think I just
armed it microUSB cable to charge it up
a little wrist strap so you can keep it
nearby another warning if misused oh man
so there's an outer case in an inner
case so this is your stun gun portion
and this is the inner case just goes in
like that there you go it's quite a
large contraption when you're holding it
but again you want the 7 million volts
so you're willing to put up with that I
suppose but now but not oh my goodness
would you look at that that is gruesome
they need to be sharp because if
somebody if you have an attacker that
has to poke through their clothing I
think you arm it like that oh oh my that
is a nasty sound a gruesome nobody wants
anything to do with that if you're some
kind of attacker and somebody hits you
with that my goodness you're backing off
you're moving away you're gonna wonder
what you got hit with will are you sure
you want to do this don't forget though
that is a clear warning you want to do
it sure all right let's go just remember
what I said this is your choice I want
you to tell the camera get over here and
tell the people that this is your choice
will he do this is on me I'm ready to
get stunned let's do it let's do it oh
man are you sure are you what do you say
will well this thing's evil oh man you
want me to do it to you yeah this is
heavy this is heavy stuff let's all hold
it there all right I'm not obviously I
don't want to hurt you man
all right all right you got a show
Willie do some love here hit him with
the thumb I won't really do to be fine
I'm sure he will be Bobby I think okay
I'm gonna go right there okay ready all
right
Oh in their official video they're like
you hit the neck you hit the groin but
the groin is there's a lot of material
there that's a tough hit but the neck is
often exposing neck to face mm-hmm here
it is man yellow jacket iPhone case
thumbs up for Willie do know was it it
burnt I smell burning
oh that your flesh Jack can you try and
tell them to take one was that the worst
one okay Jack I'll do it if you do it if
you like you should give him the
feedback like in a practical sense it's
obviously a deterrent like if someone's
hitting you with that when you try to
grab them or something you're like whoa
yeah what was that stun it stuns you so
you would back off and the sound is
gruesome on its own quick disclaimer
here you're not supposed to be out there
looking for fights this is a back-up
plan this is if every if everything else
fails it's bulky you're probably not
gonna carry this around yourself no no
so maybe you're a female you walk home I
don't know on campus maybe for that
night class I will probably feel better
with this thing in my hand I guess I
think the covert nature of it is kind of
the cool part and if something were to
happen it's it's obviously not for
everyday for most people but at least
stay through the battery in there as
well put your hands together for Willie
do put his body on the line for the
unbox therapy family if that doesn't
deserve a thumb nothing ever will Yuri</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
