interested in it wills telling me that
this is the world's smallest
ultrabook that's right laptop they're
calling it an ultrabook like as if it
can replace your laptop but look at the
size of the box it doesn't make any
sense right I mean that's one end
it's called dp2 max so we got a little
bit of paperwork inside the box it does
look like a full-featured laptop based
on this particular paper oh my god it's
like a shrunken MacBook that's this
almost netbook territory but they don't
want to call it that they're very clear
this is an ultrabook okay all right
let's look around the outside headphone
jack dedicated analog USB connector over
on the other side there's even a type C
port another traditional USB and what is
that guy that's got to be a display
board of some kind you might want
another display you might get down to
business now it's also the metal is made
out of aluminum here so it's close to
the touch what are they selling this
thing for well 700 bucks okay so that's
no joke price-wise does it have some
intel in it does it have a real chip an
Intel 8th gen processor so it's a it's a
real it's a real thing
what that's a laptop holy and somehow
the keyboard doesn't seem that small oh
quick brown box the quick room for
something this tiny it beats typing on a
tablet beats typing on a smart phone
that's for sure now the trackpad is
minuscule a Canadian Tunney you've never
seen this before in most parts of the
world it's a it's a coin and you can
tell the trackpad is roughly the height
of that coin the directional buttons
here are kind of tiny but then again
that they're they're also tiny on a lot
of other laptops that are nowhere near
this tiny front-facing camera webcam
down here so it's gonna get the up the
nose shot for something with this form
factor it's impressively packed it in
there now how big is this screen is this
what is this eight inches nine what is
it
8.9 so it's right around nine inches
that would take an adjustment period for
certain in a tight airplane cabin or
something you got to get that email out
right before takeoff it's in
narrative it's an emergency the
corporate America depends on it you can
pop that baby out no one even notices
you've got the trade table you may be
able to pull this out in circumstances
where a bigger laptop would just not be
suitable the only thing in here is a
type C cable and a power brick now
granted the power brick itself is about
the size of a smartphone power brick so
that's pretty cool like no big power
brick to travel with these things could
practically go in your pocket along with
this your traveling light that's for
certain so what is the actual weight of
this well 1.4 pounds ladies and
gentlemen it's lighter than an iPad iPad
pro 11 inch I think is a pound so it's
right around iPad weight but when it's
folded up it's actually more compact
there we go GPD you not appreciate
companies like this they just like you
know we're gonna do something different
now something else I noticed the way the
hinge operates like you can see there's
like it goes further than you might
expect on a laptop Jack are you seeing
this you open it all the way and it
becomes a teeter-totter do you know what
a teeter-totter is no you don't you only
remember okay you and your brother we're
on the teeter-totter once upon a time
look at that nice little that's a cute
little just you can't say cute jack
about many products these days
this is cute wouldn't you agree give me
a little nod there Jeff there you go
that's a cutie patootie as they call it
as he says it Jack says that every day
comes in you can't just it can't be
strictly novelty you can't be like oh
it's cool they made the world's smallest
like I'm glad somebody did it same time
I'm sitting here thinking like imagine
being trapped on this every day imagine
this was your everyday life Honey I
Shrunk the Kids Jack it's a tablet with
a keyboard Jackson I don't know why
you'd listen to him but that's what he
said I will say I'm hearing the fan kick
up a little bit a little you can hear it
here for yourself one of the drawbacks
of course about a tiny little
form-factor you gonna have some heat
especially you're talking about Intel
eighth generation this little button up
here on the top so Jack right there is a
fingerprint scanner actually a pretty
nice one so I registered the fingerprint
let's go ahead and test it out look at
that it's fast this is also a
touchscreen
maybe you don't even touch the trackpad
I will say though you get into that
weird situation of the thing kind of
doing that when you if you touch near
the top of the display what is the
resolution of this display what display
an enormous number of pixels seems to be
fairly common at this point specially in
super thin laptops where two speakers
fire actually at the desk
rather than at you and then they kind of
reflect off of that flat surface so
they're on the bottom side here these
two little grills think you're gonna
want to plug headphones in in my opinion
okay so will is telling me that the
display is 300 nits so 25 60 plus 300
nits which is decent you pick 8 or 16
gigs of ram when you order it up it's
got a 256 gigabyte SSD all right so it's
got an Intel M series processor in it so
it's not the fastest that you can find
in laptops but again that's not really
why you're picking up something like
this in the first place
anyone who gravitates towards this level
of portability is probably looking for
an email machine something that they can
watch video on interact with multimedia
here and there and I using this for
content creation and so forth I like the
idea of options I don't think it's a
daily thing for me 700 bucks for kind of
a supplementary computer maybe an extra
computer that you have that's a few
bucks to fit and finish the materials
it's actually more solid than I expected
it's a cool thing it exists in the world
if your Inspector Gadget
you probably want it this episode's
sponsored by LG LG just launched the
world's first IPS one millisecond
monitor g2g which means it takes 1
milliseconds for a pixel to go from one
state to another other brands are doing
1 milliseconds for panel response time
but this results in negative side
effects like brightness day
datian microcurrents and disabled
adaptive sink
it's a 27-inch GL 850 and the 38 inch GL
950 G and now you can add speed picture
quality into your gameplay there's also
a social media event going on where you
can have a chance to win the LG gaming
wander as a prize visit LG ultra gear
comm for details okay so the one that
I'm using here is a 38 inch curved ultra
wide qhd+ monitor it has a resolution of
3840 by 1600 and it's a nano IPS display
it also has Nvidia g-sync and 144 Hertz
refresh rate now it also includes RGB
sphere lighting 2.0 thanks again to LG
for sponsoring this video if you want
