checking out the ETA resolution
television here as you can see it's
gigantic I believe it's 84 inches as
well you've got a ton of resolution
they're putting regular HD to shame and
check out the scale of this thing
let me go ahead and get you guys an even
closer look
tons of pixels there
now this is not a production TV at the
moment
the rep from sharp told me we're looking
at 2013 for this television but they do
have a four cave set at 80 inches that
we're looking at 2012 for
this is finally giving you a better
reason to get a much larger TV because
you got the resolution now to support it
and it's the world's first 8k LC
this video is likely not doing it
justice either in real life this is a
ridiculous amount of resolution</div></body></html>
