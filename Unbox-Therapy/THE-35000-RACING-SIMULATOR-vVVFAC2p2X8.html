for a while okay it's a racing simulator
but it's unprecedented is it crazy yeah
maybe so MA I love these old LED
displays call up algae I said guys why
send me one when you could send me three
power them up juice them up GTX Titans
times three system from main gear but
the moment is now the truth is here let
me break it down for you so the displays
obviously very big these are 65 inch TVs
and the difficult part was figuring out
just how to rig them up in such a
fashion that would work I found these
mounts here company called RC it allows
for you to essentially maneuver displays
various sizes now OLED why OLED what you
end up with is incredibly vibrant colors
lots of saturation it's a really nice
viewing experience if you want more
information on that go watch the
original video so once I got those
things set up it was like alright gotta
drive these pixels well lucky enough I
had the system from main gear also
featured in a previous video it had a
GTX Titan but it wasn't enough still for
all these pixels so I had to go out then
put a few more in there beefed it up a
little bit the racing specific stuff I
looked around I did a little bit of
research I wanted something I don't know
just to be on the same caliber as the
other components
I looked beyond those logitech wheels
and moved up to a company called fnatic
so whether you're playing project cars
or you're playing dirt when you're at a
high speed and China it's fighting back
against you like an actual steering
wheel would now this part on the front
it's called the rim this one is a
replica from the Porsche 918 metal
pedals brake clutch and those are even
adjustable if you want to get crazy with
it
now everything attaches to this seat the
seat makes it easy they make these in a
couple of different configurations and
colors and this one is Aniceto course a
special edition which is red and black
let me jump in the seat and show you how
it all operates just do a little what I
look like I look like Michael Schumacher
huh so this game I'm playing right here
this is called project cars kind of like
a video game controller allows you to
navigate around I'm in practice mode
right now there's so many different
tracks to choose from including of
course the Nurburgring when it comes to
cars I told you is a lot to pick from
street cars all the way up to f1 car
LeMond style cars what you guys are
noticing here this guideline that's on
the track green means you're okay at the
speed you're traveling at yellow is you
better start to slow down a bit and red
is you're coming in way too hot so
that's just a little explanation there
I'll try and get it up to red let's see
here see so you can see it starts to
turn red you need a break downshift
anyway it's essentially you're I'm
crashing a million multi-million dollar
car you see you could do it in a
simulator can't do that in real life
it's a way of becoming more comfortable
with the various tracks of course going
into you don't know what the approach
looks like or the next turn looks like
so as you're kind of becoming familiar
with the track it's nice to have those
indicators eventually you can turn that
off on tracks that you're familiar with
so there you have it a peek at this
thing that I built I want to give a
shout out to LG for making this setup
possible to open invite all you got to
do is bring the pizza bring the beer and
you could have free rein come over in
and drive a virtual version of a two
million dollar car sound like a deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
