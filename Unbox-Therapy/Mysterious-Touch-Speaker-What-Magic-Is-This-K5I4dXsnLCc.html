on unbox therapy Bluetooth speakers non
bluetooth speakers actually pretty much
all Bluetooth speakers that's the thing
it's about Bluetooth speakers these days
so when this thing showed up I was like
wait what are they telling me drop and
play wireless speaker no wires no
Bluetooth no Wi-Fi excuse me you just
drop your smartphone on a speaker and
play your music compatible with all
devices with a working speaker so
somehow takes what's coming out of the
speaker on your device and like reamp
Allah I don't I don't know so I'm doing
the video from a company called Alex our
switch on the drop and play speaker
align your smartphone with this icon
listen to the instantly amplified sounds
all with no wires bluetooth or Wi-Fi now
you're probably wondering hey why would
I want that loo like what's the deal
here like what's the big deal once
you've connected something to your
Bluetooth it's pretty easy next time
around you just turn the thing on
link got no big deal but but but you
know you're having a party you're at a
party and everybody is playing their
clips playing their music now what do
you want you want to have all these
different people trying to link and pair
up it's all day maybe this is the
solution right here maybe what you
really need is this next level
technology where you just drop it on
more naturally do you want to link do
you want a pair are you sure about that
built-in induction technology for
crystal-clear sound I don't know if I
buy it they claim it's the easiest way
in the world to play music louder than
what's already on your smartphone maybe
they got some special
ah BAM okay USB cable and mini jack
cable you know maybe maybe they've amp
this up too much see what I did there
amped it up like maybe my expectations
are too high
it feels really lightweight there's a
blue LED and these icons here that's
where your speakers are supposed to go I
guess depending on your device I guess
it goes man that seems weird I'm nervous
this by the way is a seven plus okay
that's just out our speaker oh that
works I guess you can move oh the
location your device is huge
what is happening are you
here we go yeah closer to it
that's crazy I'm guessing that somehow
the vibration from the internal speaker
on a device is somehow being absorbed by
this material and then transferred down
to this channel now there is an
electrical component obviously there's
an on switch it's not the speaker grills
it's wherever that speaker lives
and once it lines up with those internal
speaker units
you've got this mega increase in volume
let's just throw something else at it
for the sake of it so I've got pixel
over here pixel XL - whoa
giddy up whoa this one amplifies it way
more something that happens here in the
office all the time we get a call coming
through supposed to be on speakerphone
need a real quick conference and it's
like which Bluetooth device which phone
am I on I look up the phone I'm like
when I connect what about you
we're gonna call it BJ yo aj going on
man
a little like do get a little karaoke or
something like that oh oh the woodchuck
Chuck's win the woodchuck shops if the
woodchuck could chuck he would chuck
jack sucks how much wood chuck if a
woodchuck could chuck wood how much wood
would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck
could chuck wood holy smokes you just
proved the concept that was way louder
you I think you guys are gonna have to
give AJ a few thumbs up alright this is
not easy my Mike look easy
it might seem easy but what AJ just did
that's some high level stuff come on
show me some loca alright thanks man
let from a quality perspective you're
not on the same page as a dedicated
speaker but that's not really the idea
this is amplification in a pinch keep
one of these on the coffee table keep
one of these in the family room and
anybody trying to amplify anything can
very easily do that pop their own tunes
on and then someone else can kick them
out and they can pick it up where that
person left off and for that I think
it's pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
