did I just say I don't know either so I
got a lot of toothbrushes but it's not
just any toothbrush this is apparently
the number one in the game it's called
the genius from oral-b they reach down
they're like Lou we think our toothbrush
has so many tech features that you
should make a video on and I said
alright that sounds cool but if that's
gonna happen you're gonna need to bring
your A game for the unbox therapy
audience as well to which they said how
about we send you 50 and a bunch of fans
get one of these babies as well if you
want to win one of these yourself
I'll have all the details down in the
description but basically you need to
take a picture of how terrible your
current toothbrush is posted on
Instagram follow me on Instagram follow
or be a bunch of people but to upgrade
their oral health
courtesy of oral-b and unbox therapy
that's right thank me later I feel like
a toothbrush right now I look like one
too alright so the genius it's it's a
special brush but but what makes it so
special
where does the tech come in apparently
there's something called position
detection a lot of people they're
missing spots with the manual toothbrush
especially the side that's on the hand
that you're using so if you're
right-handed you probably don't spend
enough time down here it can take a
picture it's got bluetooth there's an
app you can customize the lighting I
mean look at the packaging for example
holy smokes there's a travel case you
can see there's even a spot where you
could dock your phone if you're in like
a hotel room or something you just put
it right there while you're getting
prepared
now the smart travel case charges your
brush and your smartphone what holy
smokes this is intense this is
monumental three action brush oscillates
rotates and pulsates it does all the
eights position detection will help you
brush every area so you don't miss a
zone while we jump inside okay this is
the travel case
there's an LED a USB and then a power
connector open it up ooh little dock for
the phone that's crazy
who would have thought there'd be a
docking station for your phone if that
doesn't say tech for a toothbrush I
don't know what does you got two YouTube
videos right here you're catching up on
your subscriptions whoo bit of a grip on
there Oh
so the suction cup clips on to your
mirror and this is how you find out how
terrible you are at brushing your teeth
is this thing monitors does the
alignment tells you where you're
spending all your time I'm telling you
man I don't know I'm about to get a
master's course in oral hygiene there
already are some extra tips in here
Jefferson I'll you like a place to store
them it looks like you keep some
different ones you've got an at-home
charge spot too I'm gonna go with the
most advanced right the Corby cross
action brush head this guy right here
I'm gonna crack this open oh don't act
like you're not getting excited right
now the app is available for both iOS
and Android so you should be covered is
pairing right now choose a custom color
for your smart ring that's this around
the top you got the weather right there
why not grab the forecast while you're
brushing check this out I got water in a
unbox therapy mug over here how special
is that I need to set up my mouth
it's mapping my face right now I'm gonna
hit continue
I'm all set up whoa I got to get all the
section do I just go for you here we go
mmm
okay my session average I did 204 the
goal is two minutes so that the next
time you got to hit that 2 minute I
spent 20 seconds too much pressure next
time I got to lay off a little bit this
tracks over a day week month but the
main thing I noticed with the tracking
the phase tracking is how much I avoided
certain areas in my mouth so main thing
is I think I was brushing too short as
they suspected and as Jack told me I
probably didn't spend enough time in
certain regions my mouth feels so
invigorated I feel like a young man
again feel like I'm uh I'm ready for a
night on the town this might very well
be the most high-tech toothbrush on the
planet I mean I gotta say I've never had
this much information about my habits
about my mouth about my toothbrush don't
forget as well 50 of these things 50 of
these high-end toothbrushes are gonna be
going out to unbox therapy fans the
details are down in the description it's
all happening on Instagram it's super
easy to participate and as a community

toothbrushes that are out there and the
worst ones are gonna win so if you're
particularly embarrassed about what
