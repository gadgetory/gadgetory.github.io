crowded in here you might get a lot of
interference
very good okay so listen I'm at the
Sennheiser booth right now checking out
their latest headphones Vista HD 820
this is the new headphone I think I won
an award did it not it's fun quite a few
or HD a twenty this is a sort of the
latest incarnation of this headphone
this is the 800s but now it's a closed
back design so I'm gonna listen to these
two and kind of see the differences but
I'm gonna start out on the edge alright
yeah here we go
this is the the right kind of partner
and this is the HDV a 20 this is gonna
give you the right kind of juice of
speed into a headphone this caliber you
know what's crazy about these headphones
is how light they are the attention
there's like extended at home listening
session oh I find these to be more
comfortable
I think I'll take this one instead of
that one yeah exactly
war base maybe it's just to me it's a
little more possible they're gonna
coexist it's not like this replaces that
one one's better
yeah you're right your friends right
right right it's a different level right
this is that the coolest looking
headphone you've ever seen in your
entire life probably possibly I think so
that's Gorilla Glass right there and
this is a sealed off closed back version
of the legendary HD 800 in this case the
800s this was an open back design I mean
that has its attributes to it right
gives you that wise town stage an
alteration in this case is closed back
some thicker type of bass feeling to it
I have to say for me from my ears I'll
take this over this there's two options
here to suit different people's taste in
music I find this a little bit more
comfortable it's a little bit more
shallow and it's a single material there
that's a deeper cushion your ear fits in
there really nice but they're not heavy
that's the craziest part this is
probably the most exciting thing I've
seen here at CES for now okay so this is
a sort of like an impromptu giveaway
scenario a bunch of extra headphones
here for you guys I guess for whoever's
here Webber can get here fast enough
we have PXE 550 wireless you want a
little bit more styling at the HD one
the momentum there's a code word I've
tweeted this out and now we're gonna
wait to see how quickly people arrive
all right we're gonna upgrade some
headphones today say that about mr.
Koller is PXE 550 or THD one what's work
Spencer AC one okay all right what's up
it's easy right yeah cool okay cool but
do you know the cold word though Jack
okay oh that was quick look at this a
lot of people just got nicer headphones
they can enjoy music more who knows
where this is gonna go alright they're
less miserable with their lives now
because of the headphones that's what
we're doing we're out here helping
people alright
this episode of unbox the Epis been
brought to you by mass drop and more
specifically the new HD 5 8 X from
Sennheiser
and mass drop in collaboration that's
the only place you can get this
headphone if you're unfamiliar with this
series of headphones you are looking at
an open back design so you get that
really wide soundstage this one comes in
this jet-black sort of colorway you see
the Sennheiser on the top right there
and the metal grills on the side this is
a very lightweight headphone and it's
also the most affordable in the range
this is only a hundred and fifty bucks
through this particular drop now often
the trouble with a pair of premium
headphones like this is that they're
difficult to drive that means you have
to plug them into an amplifier or some
sort of stationary setup to get the most
out of them this particular unit is
meant to be easy to drive so you can do
so with a device like this with a
smartphone got the velour pads
completely around the ear because it is
an open back design there's not the same
sense of isolation for people who are
just getting into headphones I always
tell them you know you've got to try out
some open-back headphones a totally
different experience
all right so it's a new look on the
classic they sound great it's open back
it's audiophile quality without the
audiophile price 150 bucks but in
limited quantities I believe there's
only going to be 5000 of these so if
you're interested click the link down in
the description thanks to mass drop for
