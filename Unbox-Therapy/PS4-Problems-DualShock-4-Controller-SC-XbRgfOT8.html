4 controller a couple of days ago and
it's sort of been getting worse this of
course is the DualShock 4 I've got two
of them right now and the first one the
one that I guess I use more often the
one that came with the system started to
wear down really quickly and I don't
really use it that much I probably put
maybe I don't know 20 hours or something
into this
so not a ton when you consider how long
you're supposed to have and use these
controllers but what started happening
is that the thumbstick the material
that's on top of it for grip it started
to wear off
really significantly at first it was
just a few little pieces you would see
like little tiny pieces of rubber around
the controller near the thumb stick and
then it got significant where big chunks
ripped off and now it looks basically it
looks like the whole thing is going to
come off pretty soon now this is not a
unique experience I did a little bit of
research and notice that other people
online had the same experience there are
a few people on reddit talking about it
and that's where I found a particular
solution for this specific problem and
what that is is to put little caps on
top of your thumb sticks now obviously
this is not a perfect solution it would
be better if this didn't happen in the
first place
but there are these little caps you can
purchase on Amazon for a few dollars
which will fit over top of the thumb
stick and sort of replace it this grip
with their own grip and then if you wear
those down you haven't essentially
ruined your $60 controller instead it's
like a couple extra bucks and many have
mentioned on the Amazon reviews that
they do work on this particular
controller and some people actually
prefer the grips of the third-party
stuff anyway so that's a simple solution
for a problem that it seems a few people
have been experiencing but that's not
the entire story what happened was
shortly after me realizing this problem
occurred on controller 1 I decided to
start using controller 2 because well
why not this is one had the problem I
might as well see what happens with the
secondary one now in the second one it's
beginning to wear down in the same
fashion as the first but something even
worse occurred on it now I'm not trying
to bash Sony or the PlayStation here I
actually play the system a lot I'm a big
fan of it I've been playing a ton of NBA
2k14 or not a ton but a reasonable
amount and and I really like the system
and I guess I just want you know some of
this stuff to be addressed so that the
system can be even better than it
already is
but on this second controller before you
know I had a chance to really wear down
the material on the thumbstick I started
having this really weird kind of almost
like it's broken
like the thumbstick doesn't function
correctly and it makes this very strange
clicking noise and it's crunchy it's not
smooth at all and you know I'm not
really sure what's happening underneath
to cause this but if I give you guys a
second here to really listen to it as I
move it around I'm not sure how well
this is going to be picked up on the
microphone but I'm going to try and pick
this up for you right now
this one just standard movements are
causing this strange kind of broken like
click and then a grinding sound and when
you use it it's not just a superficial
thing or an auditory thing that you're
hearing or seeing it's actually
impacting the gameplay so there's some
inputs where the guy just freezes
on-screen he's not moving when you
pushed for him to go a certain way so
there's definitely something broken
underneath so anyways as you can tell
I'm not the happiest guy in the world
two separate controllers two separate
problems so as with any brand new
console there are of course growing
pains any new product for that matter so
don't let this like heavily influence
your opinion on whether or not the
PlayStation is a good system as I said
I'm a huge fan of it but I do kind of
want to get Sony's attention here so
that maybe this can be fixed as they
continue to release more controllers
maybe they can use a different material
on top I mean if this had have worn down
in the same way over the course of a
year or a couple years or something like
that I wouldn't you know hate on it it
wouldn't be a problem for me I would
understand that that's sort of over the
normal term of use to expect some wear
and tear on controllers but this started
happening you know within the first few
weeks of ownership and as I said it's
it's progressing pretty quickly now the
funny thing is that I have owned and
used an enormous number of controllers
for both previous generation
Playstations the Xbox Nintendo consoles
etc and I even made a video a controller
collection video so I will link it
somewhere here if you want to go check
it out as proof that I have a lot of
experience with controllers and I've had
really good luck in the past not having
any major issues with previous
generations of controllers in fact the
last generation the ps3 DualShock 3
controller has been incredibly durable
and whatever coding it is that they're
using on the thumbsticks here is perfect
it's the perfect level of grip enos with
durability
a big fan of these thumb sticks of
course I do like the fact that the new
ones are concave dal ittle bit there's a
little lip to grip onto but I wish they
went and used this material maybe they
will in the future anyways this video is
just a little quick warning if you want
to protect your controller you can put
those little caps on and maybe more
importantly if you want to make sure
that Sony hears this message do me a
favor and maybe share this video or
leave a thumbs up down below so the
video might get some traction but as I
said I'm pretty sure I'm not the only
one who has experienced this I know a
lot of people on reddit have experienced
it and now it's your chance to chime in
let me know in the comments if you're
experiencing the same thing if you are a
PlayStation 4 owner or maybe you've
experienced the same thing on previous
generation consoles and you have you
know some sort of insight into it
anyways that wraps up this quick video
hope I didn't depress too many people
maybe we'll get a response from Sony
which would be really cool and other
than that I will catch you guys on the
next episode have a good one later</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
