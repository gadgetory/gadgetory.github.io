another video today I've got something
unusual I know I've said that before
I'll probably say it again but in this
case it's truly unusual we're gonna have
a strange moment together this thing is
called the ostrich pillow I believe
welcome to the napping revolution so
you're thinking Lou what's the angle
here this could be the future of pillows
this could be the tech pillow the new
look the new style of how you snooze
you're somebody I don't know you're at
university they're trying to suck your
blood
don't let them snooze away the day this
is a wild type of scenario and a lot of
people are gonna think you're a weirdo
let them will I have the balls to rock
it probably not new filling for enhanced
dreams what else is there to look at not
much have a little nap time I remember
when I was in kindergarten they had a
naptime you remember that jack oh my
whoa whoa oh
I can't tell you what that feels like
it's like little micro balls in there
ooh very soft Wow not what I expected at
all and very light a little bag to carry
it around dream with me I don't know
maybe this baby's coming on the airplane
welcome to this napping revolution we're
in it now me and you
now do I wear glasses probably not do I
know how to put this on without
suffocating probably not oh whoa whoa
okay so I can still breed and then and
then we'll onion him down Oh
I mean I can't see you guys right now
that's sort of the idea here
stop laughing Jack what oh I can expose
the ears if I like maybe I need to hear
what's going on or I can shut them off
for sound excuse me are you talking to
me yes I would like a club soda please
but also if you're leaning up against
something oh right my hands where do my
hands go but why I kind of feel like an
ostrich right now this thing is weird my
head is super hot I'm hot are you
laughing look at that maybe that's the
look that's some like I'm on that Jar
Jar Binks game right now I think it'll
do the trick you just got to be able to
put up with the weirdness associated
with wearing that around people they're
gonna be scared of you maybe that's what
you're looking for</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
