over the years ones that I've covered
here on the channel and then even before
this channel existed and one thing
they've all had in common is battery
life that hasn't satisfied my needs and
I'm sure many of you are in the same
boat there is a solution that's out
there and it is often come from this
company right here Mophie and so today
I've got a little care package from them
for the device that I've been using
exclusively and for a while that is the
Galaxy s8 it's sleek its slender it's
pretty but what about the juice what
happens at 8 p.m. when you got your
podcast streaming and you get that
notification 15 it's frustrating okay so
here we have the latest and greatest for
Mophie the juice pack 39 hours of
battery life
holy smokes with and this is something
they added on their recent products that
I'm a huge fan of wireless charging they
also came up with this alternative
design the charge for power station mini
which has wireless charging as well and
magnets on the back so it can attach to
all the various charging peripherals and
even use this modular charging brick now
because it's part of the whole charge
force family here you can interact with
these various different devices that
multi makes whether it's the power
station mini the power station at the
desk mount event mount or the charging
base you could put these things
everywhere okay I'm gonna pull this all
out here products for the s8 and s8 plus
I'm gonna focus on the s8 version
because I've been using the SI to have
the s8 here juice pack on the Left
charge force case and Power Station mini
on the right this I'm more familiar with
the juice pack I had it for the s7
they're saying up to 33 hours of battery
life that would of course be a little
bit more with the SI plus the bets still
that's plenty of battery life even for a
power user 33 hours of talktime 23 hours
of web browsing which as you know is
more battery intensive 27 hours of video
playback and 111 hours of music playback
now you know these are optimal figures
it'll be tough to hit those numbers but
nonetheless astronomical figures imagine
your phone did that out of the box you'd
be a lot happier you're also gonna get
some impact protection it is a case
after all so if you were going to put a
case on your phone here's one way that
the bulk actually adds to the
functionality this unit has a 29 50
milliamp hour battery in it so there's
the case and one of the things I like
about the multi battery cases is the
fact that they've got this LED indicator
on the back this shows you how much of a
charge you have at a quick glance you on
the bottom they've switched over to USB
type-c there's also a pass-through for
the headphone jack because yes the
Galaxy s8 still has one now the speaker
will pass audio through this location
here it kind of channels the audio in
such a way where I actually prefer the
functionality because with the down
firing audio on any phone not just the
SI sometimes your palm will cover the
surface and muffle the audio you can't
do that when the case is installed
because it reroute sit up through the
top which then makes it forward firing
at your actual ear canal the top part
just pops off and the phone should slide
in so your buttons here are remapped to
the outside of the case unfortunately a
carry through here of the Bigsby button
which to this point I kind of wish
didn't exist because I'm hinted by
accident and I'm certainly not using it
so let's slide this guy in the top
portion goes on now here's something I'm
concerned with with this particular case
is reaching that fingerprint because of
the lip that the battery case introduces
here I'll lock it just to show you so it
functions it's just a little tougher to
reach in there I also like the fact that
the lip here comes down around the
curved edge of the SI now I do notice
that there isn't an adapter included for
the headphone jack as you can see here
it might be tough for your headphones to
get in there depending on the size of
the connector if for whatever reason
you're against the idea of adding weight
to your phone this probably isn't the
case for you I think that's where the
charge force case and power station many
might be a better solution for me not
such a big deal I'm used to having stuff
in my pockets it's heavy to begin with
oh look at that we get it we get some we
get the flap out we get the fold out on
this one so yeah this one here puts a
slender case with the magnet and the
wireless charging in it but it leaves
the battery out as a modular device that
you actually add to the case when you
need it
whoo so that's the case it has a leather
like material this time they have
included a cable so this little guy is
part of the charge force universe it's
called the power station mini also has
an indicator to let you know how much
battery exists inside of it if you want
to get real crazy take the universal
battery pack and slap it on to the
battery case look at you now I mean you
got battery first I don't even know if
this is supported by Mophie so try this
at your own risk the intended use is you
have this slim case here and then this
guy when you need it
kaboom no cable between the two still
usable like this when you don't need the
juice anymore kaboom you take it off and
you just have your phone let's try it on
whoo kind of into this one I might
change it up I might not go with that
guy I might go this way and then just
now let's test it out so if I turn this
guy on if I flip this over we are
charging up just like that and then if I
peel it off let's go ahead and try this
there goes it stops back on boom chart
unbelievable this is the kind of stuff
that phone manufacturers should be
thinking about and it's definitely the
kind of stuff that you as the tech
enthusiasts are looking for they're
making some great solutions at Mophie if
you want to check these out I'll put a
link down in the description like I said
earlier I've been a user of this stuff
for a very long time and there's a
reason that it's basically my favorite
phone accessory that's out there whether
it's the SA or the iPhone</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
