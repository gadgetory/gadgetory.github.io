at the point that you're watching this
this is not out yet this is gonna be a
Kickstarter product and it's launching
on June the 20th so any day now this is
a SmartWatch type of device which also
houses fully wireless earbuds as you can
tell from the picture on the package so
it's a two-in-one device as you know the
whole kind of purpose of these fully
wireless earbuds is ultimate portability
so what better portability then right on
your wrist whenever you need them then
you pop them into the SmartWatch module
and all of a sudden they can charge up
as well yeah this thing is got good
audio quality qualcomm smart audio chip
aptX hi-fi sound and also fitness
tracking so you're gonna be able to
track your steps and your activity if
you do a workout or something they also
say it's an ultra stable bluetooth
connection so there is an app to go with
it let's go ahead and check these out
it's beyond a prototype but it's still
early it's not retail yet so there's the
white one first up and here's the black
one so this is what the unit looks like
and that's the bud right there so it
sort of looks like a samsung galaxy bud
something along those lines
it has Chrome on the outside here as
well as the logo and an LED light so you
would just plug that into the right side
like that and it clicks in it's
spring-loaded it clicks in and you can
put them both in at the same time and
also pop them both out at the same time
when you're in there it basically just
looks like a watch now the band is like
an Apple watch sort of the way that it
attaches it's also similar material on
the bottom side of the unit you have
your charge port there as well as a
heart rate sensor remember I did tell
you this is a fitness watch as well over
here we have the black one same idea
earbuds go in they click charge cable
functions via a magnet is gonna attach
oh actually a fairly strong 90 minute
benefit and drawback I mean maybe you
want like some sort of little dock or
some other type of attachment but this
is super portable to be honest I'm kind
of I'm fine with that type of charging
right there okay so this one is char
now 100% you can see what the watch face
looks like pretty standard out the gate
how do I interact with it though I don't
know is it strictly from the app oh look
at that
pop those out earbuds come out there's a
touch screen alright let's check this
out let's let's get to the bottom of it
there's the app add the device we're
buds Oh found it just lay that connect
the band press and pop out the buds from
the band make sure the LED indicators
and the buds are flashing white oh those
are actually quite isolating does that
it are we connected that that was
actually quite easy so here it shows the
actual I should put this watch on right
now I guess okay so the watch is on
without the earbuds in it's actually
pretty light now this here shows that
it's connected it'll show you the steps
these of course are steps based on me
moving my wrist around emulating steps
heart rate how many floors climbed
running cycling so you can track what
what can you really track it oh that's
kind of cool alright so you could track
your duration speed and calories burn
let's see if I can use the heart rate
monitor here yeah okay so heart rate
monitor functioning no this is all a
bonus as far as I'm concerned right
really what this is about is the ear
buds I should listen to some music right
now Wow okay
these are loud I'm always complaining
that earbuds are too quiet not these
ones whoa
now they do sit a little deeper in the
ear but they're light they're small and
they're loud these are loud can you hear
these really there's no bleed at all
these are way louder than air pods
they're way louder I'm very surprised
that it's not what I expected in such a
small package especially something that
charges in a watch I just got to listen
to some hip-hop I did rock there let me
just get some hip-hop real quick here
you know what like I had've it I didn't
have the highest expectations with these
because it's like are they charging a
watch it's a new company it's a
Kickstarter they sound good for somebody
buying this type of thing they're
definitely an acceptable round and like
I just said I mean they sound better
than like air pods I don't know do we
have a price on this well we have no
price who knows we don't know we don't
know we don't know what it's gonna cost
I mean there's a lot of other questions
because it's still waiting for the
Kickstarter on the 20th we just happen
to get it early I mean if you're trying
to gather anything from this video they
sound better than I expected the watch
itself is more comfortable than I
expected I don't know if for a lot of
people is gonna be a complete
replacement for a smart watch since
pretty much everything is controlled via
the app as opposed to the watch itself
so you're gonna be in the app fairly
frequently like I said earlier I think
the fitness component is a bonus but I
think the main cool part is the fact
that like you have these things that can
charge up right here look at this put
them in this product at the moment is a
proof of concept it's like wow we can do
that we can put a fully wireless set of
headphones into a watch form factor I
would say it's a little beyond my
expectations but I still feel like this
product is early so it's hard to
evaluate it as a commercial product for
my personal taste I will probably go
with the black one it's a it's slightly
more subdued than the white but they do
have the two colors represented
it's a Kickstarter so keep that in mind
when you evaluate it and definitely wait
for the 20th to see all the claims on
the page it's gonna be more details with
battery life and so forth I can't
endorse it at the moment but I'm saying
right now it's kind of promising</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
