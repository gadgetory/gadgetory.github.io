another video and as you can tell in
front of me I have Apple's latest
creation the iPhone 6s smart battery
case I saw pictures of this thing this
morning and I was like Jack you know
what we're making a video I got a few
words to say just a couple all right
more than a couple these things look
weird I'm sorry
Apple was sitting in the factory and
they were like hey we got a bunch of
leftover rectangular batteries what are
we gonna do with them idea battery case
not only the iPhone battery in the case
of the 6s is pretty small to begin with
for a phone that size but then it's like
when you come up with a solution it's
such an awkward approach it looks like
an afterthought here's this big giant
lump on the back okay there's no other
way to describe it I'm not sure why that
is done the way that it is but this is
what we have this is what we're dealing
with I believe right now it's only
available for the 6s I have the two
colors in front of me black and white
let's open them up these babies are a
hundred bucks each hundred bucks so
there's a little bit of weight there
some soft some soft inside a lightning
connector little cutout for the speaker
microphone headphone a lightning
connector on the bottom to charge this
guy up
it's got like a rubber ish feel to it
and it's not too hard it's kind of bendy
actually I mean I'm thinking that things
gonna get dirty you put that baby in
blue jeans or something or you give
something like this to Jack forget it
spaghetti sauce gravy and now you can
really appreciate that Plateau
super weird let's insert an iPhone 6s so
you just sort of fold the top a little
bit and slide it in okay so you can see
here iPhone battery status 53% in
charging case status
73% so this is really the only benefit
over other iPhone battery cases is that
we can see the status right here I much
prefer to carry around a separate
battery backup like a little could be a
little rectangular box I much prefer to
have something
dedicated that I can stick in my pocket
and then get some juice and then put it
away
let's try the white one out such a weird
thing that's happening in smartphones
right now where everybody battles to get
the thinnest phone works out all these
weirdo hacks to get more battery for
that phone that really is lasting for
nobody this phone doesn't last a day for
me doesn't last a day for jak meaning a
wide variety of users and in a wide
variety of use usages things people do
on their phones and and everybody's
ending up in the same place halfway
through the day needing to plug in I'm
getting a phone call right now hello how
do you feel about the battery life on
your iPhone horrible does it does it
make it through a day yeah okay evening
dinnertime you're already ready to
recharge you're proving my point right
now in this video real-world scenario
happening for you in real time would
completely be fine with a slightly
thicker device but this is what we get
instead we get Mount Rushmore over here
my recommendation just go for one of
those battery backups let me get mine
real quick
just before I go this one is cool
because it has built-in cables so you
got a built-in lightning cable built-in
micro USB another option is one like
this even smaller Mount Kilimanjaro
Kilimanjaro or Kilimanjaro that's Table
Mountain nobody couldn't could have
called this if you if you asked a
million designers to drop what an Apple
battery case would look like an iPhone
6s battery case would look like I don't
know that anybody could have predicted
this this is shocking stuff right here
guys little fired up and then you got to
put it in your pocket I'm going to do a
pocket test pocket test real quick like
these are not super skinny or anything
Jack stay away from my jumper you look
at all that linked and stuff are you
seeing that right now it just picked up
like all the fabric on it okay this
white material forget it that's a
nightmare already I just put that's one
time in yeah but this one's not gonna
get as dirty I mean still pick stuff up
I just don't see how spending $100 on
this makes sense I just I don't know I
personally would not recommend it all
right there you have it apples take on
the phone battery case today is a weird
day my friends but I'm happy to share it
with you thanks very much for watching
if you guys enjoyed this video make sure
to leave a thumbs up down below and I
will catch you very shortly on the next
episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
