therapy and today we're taking a look at
the sony ps3 media / blu-ray remote
control now it looks a hell of a lot
like the older remote that shipped
originally alongside the ps3 but this
one is quite a bit different it's got an
infrared sensor to go with the bluetooth
connectivity meaning it's going to be
able to interface with your television
your a/v equipment etc whereas the old
remote control in my left hand here was
bluetooth only so basically it only
functioned as a ps3 remote and that was
it now the reason why this is important
is because the new ps3 display the 3d
display they came out with for the
holiday season here the one that I
recently unbox if you haven't seen that
I'll put a link in the annotations as
well as down in the description the new
display did not ship with a remote you
may remember me saying that a huge
headache people are like what am I going
to do I got to reach around I got to
walk up to the display every time I want
to turn it off well it's not a perfect
solution we do wish obviously that this
was included in the displays box but it
wasn't so it's your only way now to you
know interact with your television or
ps3 display I should say with a remote
you've got to go pick this up now Sony
did include batteries which is always a
welcome thing nobody likes to go
searching for batteries when they get a
new device as you'll notice there are a
number of new buttons and functions on
this new remote that did not exist on
the previous version you've got that big
empty space on the bottom side of the
older bluetooth only remote and that's
been filled with volume and channel
buttons that's because this can now be
your universal remote controller can
control your television as well as your
ps3 there's also some added buttons
along top I'll give you a closer look in
a minute so here's the older remote and
as you'll notice there's this big hunk
of space below the Bluetooth icon that
isn't being used for anything kind of
strange for a Sony remote control and
here's the new one now you've got a TV
button you've got a button for your
amplifier input selector 3d on and off
for compatible televisions device
selector you've got your regular
PlayStation stuff in the center this is
pretty much identical to the older one
and then down on the bottom you've got
your volume and channel you can see the
icons on the bottom side I
fiying that it's both infrared and
bluetooth unlike this old model you'll
see there's no infrared sensor on the
front side
it's bluetooth only whereas the new one
I'll give you a quick look at it and
I'll show you the fact that it does have
an infrared sensor on the front as I
mentioned earlier allowing it to
interface with all your standard AV
equipment that uses that technology
anyway guys if you're out shopping this
holiday season and you need one of these
or you picked up that display that was
remote less make sure you get the newer
one look for those volume and channel
buttons otherwise tell the person at the
store to go in the back because
oftentimes they have them back there
they just didn't know to replace the
older ones with the newer ones anyway
