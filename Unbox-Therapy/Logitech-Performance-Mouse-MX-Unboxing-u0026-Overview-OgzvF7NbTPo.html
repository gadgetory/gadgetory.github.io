therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Logitech performance mouse MX now
this is logitech's top-of-the-line mouse
and I've been a fan of Logitech mice for
as long as I can remember in fact my
last mouse was called an MX revolution
which is very similar to this model but
different in some key ways first and
foremost the MX revolution required a
separate docking station in order to
charge this new model has a micro USB
port on the front that can connect to a
cable and you can actually charge while
using it which is incredibly important
for me because there's nothing worse
than coming back to your computer and
needing to use it and having your mouse
be dead on you it's troublesome anyhow
to talk more about what we're getting
inside the first thing we're gonna look
at is the disc and documentation now a
little piece of advice for me whenever
you receive these products it's probably
better to go up to their manufacturer
website and get the latest driver
because who knows how long ago this
thing shipped out here's some important
information not important enough for me
to read and then we've got a little user
guide here or power tips I should say
and this mouse can actually be using
some different ways you can customize
the buttons to do a lot of different
things in my case on the Mac side I
program one of the buttons to control
expose for example here's a little
flippy guide telling you how to get her
start it up anyway looking at the device
we can see it's got a fairly standard
scroll wheel on the top four-way as well
as a button for adjusting the way that
that wheel feels
we've got forward and back a zoom button
and there's that extra button I was
talking about right where your thumb
rests it's got a dark field sensor on it
which can track on anything even glass
so that's pretty impressive and it just
feels good in the hand it's very
ergonomic there's that micro USB port I
was talking about on the front now we
got a lot of little extras with this
including a carrying case of course a
micro USB cord the mouse will be pretty
useless without that
and like I said you can charge and use
it at the same time it's a long cord so
it's not going to be an issue next we've
got a little USB extension cord now this
is for if you're using a desktop
computer or any computer that's far away
from your actual Mouse you can take the
little nano receiver plug it in to this
extension and get it closer to where
you're actually using the mouse the
reason that's important so you can get
good reception that being said my
receiver is far away from the mouse
right now and it's working fine anyhow
here's a wall adapter in the event that
you need to charge it up even faster
this should give you a quicker charge
than the usb on your computer as always
