another video and today I've got
something that was a bit of a surprise
this box came from Motorola other than
that I know nothing about it you can see
on the front here it says slide to start
fragile breaking news otherwise a
Motorola logo and the same thing on the
other side so let's go ahead jump inside
this mystery box and see what it's all
about ah the new Moto e of course check
this out we got a little welcome desk
and what looks like a special exclusive
doorway whoa
start with Moto e calm this is a pretty
wild unboxing experience the phone is
the last item in there there it is the
new Moto e hidden down there inside this
amazing box 4G LTE 4.5 inch display
quad-core processor 2390 milliamp hour
battery micro SD card slot not what I
expected at all your sneaky motorola
there's a little USB Drive Motorola
branded welcome to the new Moto e press
conference you probably have enough
events and press conferences to sit
through next week so we're bringing this
launch directly to you experience the
new Moto e the way you want complete
with pass well done
motorola here we have a different color
for the side frame if you want to go
with blue or a case is also included in
this translucent teal and then lastly
you have a charged brick pretty obvious
stuff this is a very comfortable phone
to hold it's a really nice form factor
it just fits really confidently into
your hand I also like this texture they
went with on the outside very grippy and
satisfying so the new Moto e looks a lot
like the previous generation with some
minor tweaks the first thing that stood
out to me is this removable band around
the sides so you just pop this off and
you can personalize the look you can go
ahead and insert on there and really get
a different look without the need to
have the bulk of a case if you're not a
case person I would assume that these
are going to be available in various
different colors if you're not a fan of
the blue another thing that happens when
you remove that portion is it gives you
access to everything you need as far as
your SIM card slot as well as your micro
SD port for expanding the storage on the
device
anyways I'll leave the blue one on I
think that's a kind of cool look
otherwise you're looking at a pretty
familiar layout you have your speaker on
the front as well as your forward facing
camera on the side of the device you
have your lock switch which has that
really cool texture on it so you can
tell the difference between your power
slash lock switch from your volume
rocker just by touching not even having
to look you have your rear facing camera
in this location as well as your mic
your micro USB port lives down on the
bottom of the device so there you have
it the new Moto e got to give creativity
points to Motorola for this really
wasn't expecting this wasn't expecting
this device the box or anything anyways
that were haps up this unboxing and
first look the new Moto e from Motorola
I've been a fan of the various Motorola
products that have hit the market
recently you may have seen my video on
the new Moto X highly configurable
really nice form factor this phone is
arguably one of the best value devices
on the planet when you're thinking about
a cost to performance ratio if you
enjoyed this content make sure to leave
a thumbs up down below thanks as always
for watching and I'll catch you on the
next episode later
