another video and this one's a little
bit different from usual as you can tell
I've got a different microphone instead
of the little laughs Mike I've got a
nice big one here as well as some studio
headphones the reason I'm using these is
to celebrate the launch of our brand new
podcast it's finally going to happen and
I owe a big shout out to sure for
helping make it possible this is an sm
7b which is a broadcast quality
microphone and these are the SRH 440
headphones and their studio level
headphones they sent out a few of these
so that we can turn a portion of the
unbox therapy lab into a podcast studio
capable of dealing with guests that are
actually here on location and maybe
doing some other things as well so the
purpose of this video right here is to
ask you guys the audience some questions
about how you want to see this podcast
happen question number one where do you
want to see it uploaded to do you want
to see it here on the main channel do
you want to see it on a secondary
channel would you guys be interested in
downloading it from itunes I want to
know how you would like to consume a
podcast coming from the folks over here
at unbox therapy what topics do you want
to see covered on this podcast obviously
technology is going to be an important
part but do you want to talk about
culture as well do you want to talk
about gaming do you want to get into
music I don't know let me know down in
the comments section I will be reading
through all of the different comments
because I do want to know what you guys
want to see ultimately you'll be the
ones that are watching it and I'm
excited to see what your opinions are on
these things the next question I have
for you is regarding guests do you want
to see guests on this podcast if so give
me your suggestions down below of who
you would like to see featured we can
either have them call in or maybe if we
can really work things out perfectly we
could even have them in studio from time
to time or we could actually have the
audience call in I mean there's a lot of
ideas that we are passing around here in
the studio at the moment but i do really
care about your guys opinions as well if
not more because like i said earlier you
are ultimately the ones who will be
watching it anyway guys that wraps up
this video right here as you can tell
the intention was to get your opinion so
we can make the best podcast possible so

the comments if you're excited to see
what this podcast will
become then make sure to leave a thumbs
