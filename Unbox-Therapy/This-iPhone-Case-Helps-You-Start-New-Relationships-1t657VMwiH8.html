everybody's got one it's the hot thing
to do right now to have that's the
future of boom boxes I mean when I was a
kid a boom box was that giant Masonic
thing with a cassette player in it well
that was a while ago now it's about
bluetooth but what is the issue with a
lot of these Bluetooth speakers that are
supposedly portable but unfortunately as
portable as they are they're not with
you when you need them when the mood
strikes you might need some very white
to enhance the moment well that's what
this product aims to do this is a
Bluetooth speaker that fits right on to
your phone it's part of a battery case
this Zagg speaker case it does that it
gives you eight hours of talktime it's
got an 1800 milliamp hour battery but at
the bottom there's a grill and that's a
speaker what do we have here look at
this happy couple that could be you
she's into him but only cuz of the case
this guy wouldn't be here right now in
this situation without the case same
thing goes down here look this guy is
even charging her up I don't know about
you that's step one in any relationship
jack doesn't know anything about it
enough is enough here's what it is
excuse me Kate holy aggressiveness
Wow I like the design of that play pause
mute power a USB port for power sharing
because sharing is caring a micro USB
cable to keep this guy charged up and
then the bumper portion this has me
thinking you have this on the phone clip
this off you have a little conference
call chat it up it's got a microphone as
well okay cool this just slide in sweet
okay just a little bumper you still have
access to your ports as well as your
volume buttons what do I do I go like
just clips in there look at me now it's
a little bit thicker but at this point
now you've got an 1800 milliamp hour
battery which also functions as a
portable Bluetooth speaker that you've
got on you now unlike a battery case
your phone isn't immediately charging
when it's inside of here instead you
would have to connect your phone to the
case itself I would recommend a short
little cable that you carry with you
that could go from this USB port into
the Lightning port hello there let's see
here yes zag speaker case comes up and
we're connected
oh that's way louder than I expected it
to be wow that's way louder than I
expected so theoretically you got this
off it's anywhere on the table I could
get up and walk away
I like this you might just want better
audio for video that you're watching
couple people gathered around the phone
which peel this off watch your video
I've done this before I'm gonna start us
off fantastic go for it
you've got your audio to go with your
video we should do a quick comparison
versus the phone turn off the Bluetooth
you can hardly even listen to it like
that you never know when a party's gonna
strike and you want to be the guy who's
always prepared why carry a backup
battery when you can carry a backup
battery that has a speaker built-in
whether you keep it clipped on to your
phone or just in your pocket that's
pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
