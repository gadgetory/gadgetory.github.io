the i9 based MacBook Pro he said it was
throttling our pal Dave 2d just
published the video where he shows that
there is really no benefit in buying
these new computers intrepid youtuber
David Lee has found that the chloride
macbook performs worse than the core i7
version so there was one video in
particular for mr. Dave 2d is the great
friend even better human being and there
was so much truth in that video so many
things I agree with but the Oprah how
come that video I think was a little
skewed here you are there you are ladies
and gentlemen Dave 2d
so how we gonna do this you're doing an
interview all right so listen if you've
been off the internet or you know
nothing about tech then you may have
missed mr. Dave 2ds big video let's
giant enormous game-changing video in
which he uncovered some interesting
details regarding the new 2018
specifically core I nine MacBook Pro now
I did a video I unbox my new core 9 it
seems that he was dead set on making me
less exciting less in love with his new
hardware because he had his own
trajectory there he's like thermal
throttling I'm cooking scrambled eggs on
my laptop now he says I didn't intend to
get a new kitchen appliance
he said just hold on in your video you
quoted me that's correct
hot carpet I never called it hot garbage
well yeah it was something along those
lines he gets this super hot MacBook Pro
and he sticks it into a freezer the
internet was like it's a MacBook in a
freezer they loved it okay
big hit ok my original intent was not to
make a hit piece or anything like that
it was just like a straight objective
look at the MacBook what we were seeing
is this this throttling if you want to
call it sure you now explain to the
audience ok thermal throttling computers
particularly laptops they want to run at
a temperature that is tolerable a high
temperature above that level the CPS is
slowed down to make it cooler the more
frequently that happens the worse the
performance of that device so
essentially what happens here in the
case of the newest 2018 MacBook it gets
hot in order to protect itself at a
certain point it has to sort of slow
down yes right this has been addressed
at this point by Apple and they through
software address some of this thermal
throttling is that correct that's
correct
now to get to that stage I remember
thinking that there was a chance that
people would take this video poorly just
to quickly explain why I think Dave's
video was a little skewed is the main
test to use was honestly the perfect
recipe to completely cripple your
computer when that video went live some
people thought that that the new MacBook
was not throttling and he just made me
doubt my own work and I went home that
night thinking people like Marquez from
TLD they were like wait wait wait let's
be clear yep you respect okay
absolutely I read a headline that says
Apple works with youtuber Dave 2d to fix
every MacBook and save the world sure
that's exactly what they all read that's
not what they read there was a part of
me that thought maybe they're trying to
publicly disprove my work which would
have been terrible and that's not what
I'm not happening and the new MacBook
Pro here did it in 21 minutes 21 seconds
when I hit render it will be 15% fast
but there was a part of me those like
that maybe that's what they're trying to
do so how specifically did you and Apple
work together originally they wanted the
whole project follow just it wouldn't
too much work and too much effort to
send them the whole thing those project
balls are big I tell them like the
compression format and then there was
like a lot layer that you apply over
your footer should give it a particular
aesthetic really taxes that laptop heart
with that lot and with the camera
settings they were able to replicate a
similar workflow to mine and I think
that helped them figure out what was
going on this point right now they've to
be right now this core i9 chip as it is
right now should it be in the current
structure of the macro pre-loaded
question man it is a very very thin
device this is if I'm not mistaken the
thinnest six core 15 inch laptop
you can't put much more in here you're
now sticking the world's fastest chip
and you're gonna have limitations I
think for some users that I 9 delivers
something that weaker processors can
build something extra so the answer
question I think it does belong in here
but I think the expectations of
consumers can be a little bit skewed
it's definitely not operating at its
peak capacity within this framework
it's obviously unusual for a company
like Apple to reach out to someone like
you
that's not something you expect it to
happen is it no I wouldn't say unusual
you'd say as usual happens usually it
may be unusual as the word I'm just
saying that there is this narrative
online there's at least a group of
people applauding apples saying this is
the way you do it that's some sort of a
claim like your claim and rather than
get defensive about it they get on from
it too like let's get Dave to these
phone numbers let's see if we can get to
the bottom of it pull
disclosure here whatever this software
patches I have my my own skepticism
brand-new laptop it's only affecting
poor i9 it's like we're just gonna roll
a little patch here five minutes later
yeah
get yourself a Big Mac and a coca-cola
and and all of a sudden we're not having
an issue but nonetheless they went about
it in a path that at least myself I
can't remember them doing it's a
different Apple I think that there was
pressure on them to make this to resolve
it mm-hmm
you've had this impact you saved
everyone's MacBook Pros in the whole way
hey let's let's be real here I didn't
save anybody's MacBook I think that this
is something that what it would have it
eventually from someone and it would
have just been you know it would have
the same thing wouldn't happen if you
were advising an individual which spec
MacBook Pro is the value point easy it
wouldn't even be the 15th maybe the 13
those quad cores make a huge difference
on who's 13 I think for most people they
don't need something big and it saves
them a lot of money I think that like
mid tier i7 is probably where the sweet
spot is value point yeah anyway big
shout out to Dave 2d for breaking down
the story right from the horse's mouth
he brought it to light I think Apple in
this case should also be commended to a
certain degree for taking this type of
approach Apple took a step here we're
gonna hit up a guy hosts videos on
YouTube to help us get to the bottom of
something we're not gonna hide it it's a
little bit of a silver lining there it's
good when you heard Apple was trying to
get in touch with you were you a little
bit scared at any point absolutely okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
