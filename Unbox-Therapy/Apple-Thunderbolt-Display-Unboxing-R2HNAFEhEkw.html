therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Thunderbolt display from Apple a
unique display in the sense that it
offers some expandability and
functionality that really no other
display on the market offers I'll be it
at a price this retails for about a
thousand bucks so you know it's not for
people trying to protect their
pocketbooks anyhow the only other thing
in the box besides the display is a
little user manual here telling you how
to get it up and running you probably
won't need to read this and other than
that you've got the power cable so
nothing too exciting there the display
is what this unboxing is all about and
first of all the reason why I'm excited
about this Thunderbolt interface is
because it gives all this expandability
right on the monitor and the reason I
like that is because I use primarily a
MacBook Pro and this is gonna allow for
me to leave most of my peripherals
connected to one device and then I can
you know pull my macbook pro from the
set up remove just two cables get on
with my life come back insert two cables
and have access to all of the extra
peripherals connected to these ports
here so on the back of the display
you've got three USB of firewire 800
another Thunderbolt port and a Gigabit
Ethernet port and you can leave your
devices attached to these and then sort
of insert and take out your MacBook Pro
as you so desire very cool now the
display is not very adjustable from the
standpoint of normal monitor
adjustability there is no height
adjustment it's just got a little bit of
a tilt to it but I've gotten used to
this with most of Apple's monitors over
the years you're just gonna get a little
bit of tilt and you sacrifice you know a
little bit of adjustability in exchange
for a nice appearance of course as it
has might be the case with a lot of
Apple products you're also gonna get an
iSight camera built-in
a microphone to replace the one that
you're probably not going to be using on
your macbook pro you've got the
Thunderbolt cable of course which
transmits everything that you need to
transmit to the display and you've got a
MagSafe connector built in to power your
macbook pro or air as well the entire
display is about the width of an SD card
and here is the beauty as I mentioned
before two cables to connect and
disconnect
when you want to pull your MacBook Pro
away from your desktop setup very very
convenient I mean this thing's even got
speakers built-in so the Thunderbolt
interface really allows for an
incredible amount of data throughput and
that's how devices like this are
possible even outputting the amazing
resolution that this one does you're
getting 2560 by 1440 pixels pumped out
to this display a ton of screen real
estate I'm really impressed to this
point if you guys want to see a review
