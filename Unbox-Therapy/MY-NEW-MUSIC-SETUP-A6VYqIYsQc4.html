another video except today it is
something completely different now I
know I've said that before but this time
you can really tell what's different
because we are not in the normal
environment this is a different room
that's in the unbox therapy headquarters
and as you can tell it has now recently
been dedicated to the idea of music
production I've been into music for a
very long time I used to actually have a
little amateur studio in a converted
school portable I'm getting back into it
now and I've been experimenting with
some of the new equipment that's
available and absolutely loving it so I
figured I might as well share with you
guys how this setup works what's in it
and then also if you guys want to hear
some of how I've been using it I have a
new channel where I've been recording
some of it so you can go check that out
I'll link it in the description but this
video is just sort of about explaining
the different stuff and and how I use it
so I guess we'll start over there some
various headphones some wireless ones
some wired ones kind of a key component
in any music setup you're going to have
to have
some headphones this is the Roli
seaboard rise and it's like a new take
on a MIDI keyboard although it's not
really even a keyboard it's soft to the
touch and sensitive look at this it
almost plays more like a stringed
instrument than it does a keyboard but
it got me to thinking like since we are
triggering in the MIDI world such a wide
variety of instruments why is the
keyboard model stayed the same
maybe there's space for something like
this it works as a regular MIDI keyboard
or it works with their own software
equator for a rise they make a bigger
version of this - it's not cheap that's
an issue for a lot of people this is
about 800 bucks
really interesting I've got a microphone
over here shure beta 57 miles right now
this is the RC 505 boss roland as I said
before you see five tracks here
dedicated to a loop on each this is the
kind of thing that I had always wanted
when I originally started with music
tactile quick ways to sketch out your
thoughts if whether that's beatbox
or otherwise two one yeah yeah all right
I can't give you guys so much I've also
got a little mixer over here just a
little Mackie mixer the reason I'm using
this right now is I'm sending the outs
from this guy into here so that I could
then send that out to these studio
monitors while still maintaining a
record out for the Shogun over here
Shogun basically a monitor and recorder
ProRes video speakers these guys these
sound fantastic I got to be completely
honest with you guys
lots of low-end at HS eight the eight
stands for the eight inch woofer the
amps are built-in so you don't need any
kind of separate amplification and the
amps are paired to the actual speakers
so you know you're getting the right
kind of cohesion there this is the
Apollo twin from Universal Audio and
this is my audio interface of choice
this thing can pretend to be all kinds
of classic preamps that people in the
music business get all excited about it
can do it in a in a very small package
this is probably looking strange to you
this is a ring light that I built they
switch colors red green blue yeah what
can I say like I couldn't find the
product I was looking for a nice LED
multicolored ring light so I just made
it there's a gh4 over there with a
wide-angle lens for capturing everything
that wooden keyboard you saw in a
previous video just because I'm trying
to get with those natural
lives on the other side of me here
complete control s 49 this is a more
traditional MIDI keyboard and what's
cool about this is it integrates really
well with Native Instruments Komplete
which is a set of sounds and essentially
give you the ability to trigger these
pre-recorded instruments that have been
recorded in optimal environments so you
want a grand piano
you got a grand piano you want some
percussion you got percussion this is
all power just by my MacBook Pro
currently one more cool thing this
little guy here is a remote control for
the power outlet on the wall and when
you have this much gear plugged in it's
like are you really going to go hit the
power switch on each one so I'll put the
computer to sleep and then just hit the
off switch and turn the entire power bar
off and everything goes out
I suppose I forgot one more thing the
microphone over there in our little
homemade booth it is a sm7b from sure
great dynamic mic especially for
untreated spaces if you got to use it in
a not perfect environment gonna do a
little bit better than a condenser
microphone in a similar space all of
these cool things will be linked down
below as I said before I hope you guys
enjoyed this video a little bit
different but something I've been
working on so I really just wanted to
share it with you guys it's a it's too
cool not to and if you're feeling it and
you're into this kind of stuff you can
head over to my second channel as I said
before I'll put a link in the
description and see some of the stuff
I've been working on again it's
something that I've been into in the
past and kind of fell off got really
busy with what's going on with unbox
therapy decided to jump back in and it's
been liberating as liberating as a deep
breath so let's do it together deep
breath and that's another video goodbye
