different computing devices I did the
iPad pro experiment in which I just
couldn't get used to that tight cover
I know it's slim its slender but I
started to long for a more tactile click
now I have an extensive history with the
MacBook products but you know that
keyboard has changed a lot over the
years we're now using butterfly switches
which will loves if I wanted to find the
ultimate laptop or typing experience
clicky keys who should I look towards
and of course Lenovo ThinkPad came into
my head because I was like man I
remember back in the day I had a
t-series with a real nice keyboard I'm
hoping that maybe this thing is the
ultimate laptop typing experience
it's the x1 carbon it's thin it's light
it competes directly with the MacBook
Air of course this is on the windows
side this one what's the spec all right
do we have this back here we don't have
the spec use the one I have is the
classic black Perkin we got the box in
the box scenario this is a nice looking
box over here all right
ooh Oh boom see man elevate good night
listen Shh
whoo-hoo nice and thin I don't know jack
am i switching the windows at night
night MacBook time okay that's pretty
slim type-c connector as well on the
power adapter here we go
mmm-hmm look at that it's thin it's
light yes there's actual carbon we have
a headphone jack a USB on the other side
Type C this is a networking breakout for
a wired connection via the docking
station another USB in a full size HDMI
out so different from the styling that
we're seeing so commonly on laptops
today military utilitarian get the job
done make the trade do the deal business
is getting done here let me give us a
little taste I see a little curvature to
each key cradling the fingertip oh yeah
yeah okay that's a keyboard which keys
on there there's letters you type them
you hit them there is travel and the
whole thing it's super solid
there's no flex in the deck whatsoever
since you're all business you can cover
the front-facing camera very nice you
still have the little red touch point
tracking surface there certain ThinkPad
people they love that thing I never got
used to it I'm probably on a trackpad
myself fingerprint scanners over here I
might be a little nicer to see it
somewhere where you're gonna touch more
frequently like the power switch but
anyhow you have the fingerprint scanner
there let's go ahead and boot it up a
matte screen it's somewhat anti
reflective when compared to the glossy
stuff that we're used to seeing also
happens to be touch screen so you could
reach up and tap away now another thing
I've always liked about the ink pads
look at that all the way down to there
Kirk was telling me he's at yoga the
other day what poses that sleeping dog
it's a sleeping dog you see I know my
yoga look you know what you hold it like
that
oh my god it's slender super light what
is the weight of this will 2.5 so
lighter than a MacBook Air so you're
saving 0.25 pounds quarter of a pound
quarter-pounder you're saving a quarter
pounder maybe you want the quarter pound
maybe you need to carry this and a
quarter pound what is the screen size
this is also a bit bigger right 14 inch
so the MacBooks a 13 inch this is a 14
inch plus it's a quarter pound lighter
okay there that's full brightness I feel
like I didn't show you before if I'm at
a Starbucks I'm on this you're like that
guy he's probably doing something series
you see the same guy but he's got the
macbook Shh
forget about him that guy he's no
trouble you can listen to it yourself I
mean you can hear them but they're not
they're not slapping you in the face now
an area I'm a little concerned is the
speaker performance okay
sound is coming on the bottom meter
there's two speakers that fire against
the table they're right there oh you
know what I mean it is better coming off
the table oh I just noticed the eye
lights up on big pads that's a
futuristic touch this is like thinning
light ultraportable hacker this is your
neo it's the matrix post-apocalyptic
future this thing scuffed up a little
bit you slide it into like a bag that's
beat-up this thing is so light it's just
like a frisbee
Will's MacBook Pro is a 15-inch laptop
it's like four and a half pounds bring
that laptop over here well with us your
favorite part of the day ah this is
powerful graphics card okay like we
understand it's not a one-to-one
comparison give her a shot yeah it's
pretty light no hold it hold each one
don't hold it going oh yeah yeah yeah
obviously this one's heavier yeah so
you're converting so you're converting
over you're done with this I'll just
throw this out for you
feels good though right mmm give the
keys a little little tinkle oh yeah you
sure now
hey yeah that's what I like those Oh
if you're in like a Starbucks that's a
little much well if you type like that
but I'm doing the same here but you know
what though like what build quality for
the keys is actually pretty good it's
the only way to test it you press on the
corner of the spacebar if the whole
thing you know kind of works with it
yeah kind of all presses down that's how
you know it's like a good design
hmm-hmm-hmm oh this don't do that buddy
hmm I haven't exclusively used Windows
on my laptop in a very long time so what
would you say will he do to the idea of
me getting rid of the MacBook Air and
just going x1 carbon for a bit you don't
think windows is gonna do it for me I
think so it does email it does YouTube
pretty well you're trying to say I don't
do very much hmm huh I'm into it man I'm
looking to try more stuff out then go to
Starbucks I can be neo I can do the blue
pill I can do the red pill to to I do
both pills let's tell them what the
configurations are you can get an F HD
IPS anti glare you get the same display
with multi-touch that's the one we have
right here but it's only 300 myths
look at those nits Jack if you step all
the way up to the HD rwq HD display it
gets glossy you get dolby vision because
of the HDR thing and you go up to 500
nits storage 256 up to 1 terabyte 16
gigs of ram on all the versions up to an
eighth generation intel core i7
8650 you that's 1.9 gigahertz up to 4.2
gigahertz turbo boost okay it starts at
1300 so the macbook air starts at 1200
this starts at 1300 they're orbiting in
the same solar system it's an
interesting package I feel like I'm
having a bit of a throwback a bit of
laptop nostalgia going on but in a
modern form factor in terms of size and
weights but for now I'm gonna start a
little Windows experiment multi-touch
really nice keyboard mm-hmm I'm going to
touch this keyboard and I'm gonna see
what happens
okay let's do it yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
