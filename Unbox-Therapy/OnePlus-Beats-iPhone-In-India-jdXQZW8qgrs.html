as super SAP on YouTube videos are made
on YouTube by you that's right man
it's a good time isn't it it is it's the
first I mean here in Toronto we got to
talk about the hot smartphone topics
this is one plus going at Apple the big
dawgs
with this tweet right here in which they
say I dare you small lowercase I the
caption within the image there hey Siri
which is India's number one premium
smartphone it happens to be 1 plus suits
right give it a shot I have an iPhone
let's see if I bet they're lying hey
Siri which is the number one premium
smartphone in India it is of course the
oneplus oh it is ok cool like what is a
premium smartphone this states that
oneplus occupies 33% of the premium
market in India
Samsung 34 and Apple 23 I'm assuming
that premium in India is somewhere
around $500 and up somewhere in that
territory even more expensive than here
though like brand what I've heard from
the Indian follows I'm sure you have as
well is that they have to pay like
almost double what we'd have to pay the
funny thing is if you shift the
marketplace and you talk about North
America mmm then you don't talk about
oneplus as a premium yeah it's kind of
like mid-range we refer to as mid-range
something like this yeah the same in the
UK right a lot of people that don't live
in and you don't realize how successful
oneplus has been in India its massive
like whenever I put a 1 plus video up on
I'm sure you've had the same the
response specially from the Indian
audience is massive like so here you can
buy 2 1 plus potentially 2 1 + 60's for
the same price as an iPhone over there
I'm assuming you could probably buy like
three right so fit the whole family
exactly there's a reason that oneplus
has had so much success in in India and
elsewhere hmm the idea of premium for
less as opposed to it's a budget
alternative like its own you would only
want a oneplus device if you can't
one of the others I think even if you
compared the oneplus to something which
is stock Android the pixels for example
this still feels faster and smoother I
still prefer the speed and just the
overall performance of oneplus device
it's crazy what this brand has achieved
to be honest to be on the spectrum of
brands like Samsung and Apple who had
such a head start in the space oh yeah
showcases how quickly things can change
in the smartphone game and are changing
yeah - now at least having the
conversation about what is the value for
money hmm like this is better for
everyone because what does it end up
doing if they can bring that price point
down all of a sudden you have Samsung
talking about the the em stuff in India
they're gonna have their you know that
other budget brand Apple's talking about
being overpriced Tim Cook said it
recently it's all good for the consumer
competition is is Kidman I've said this
many times on my channel that when it
comes to bang for buck oneplus is the
brand to go for they come in straight
away with a competitive price I'm like
you know what you're getting and you can
go in there you can buy a phone and you
will generally be pleased it takes most
of the box as for most people oneplus
has been clever let's not discount the
old model yeah let's just crank out
another one you forget about a phone
that was out in fed when it's December
right yes old news where is if you have
another version of it he gets people
talking again you want the fresh one you
want the fresh one you want the new one
and that's what everybody's talking
about they get the press coverage they
get us guys talking about it what
oneplus is doing is very smart if Apple
was interviewed if they asked him cooks
he'd be like what's worse once less yeah
I mean just the fact that if you
remember the oneplus sixty event in
Brooklyn New York Apple went in and had
the iPad event an hour before it was
kind of like all right we're just gonna
question you like flicking a fly yep
flick him fly I've been on a net yeah
now one thing to remember here is that a
lot of people you know put value on on
brand affinity like how does a brand
make you feel how long have they been
around how trusted are they we're
sitting here talking about how amazing
it is what oneplus has accomplished in
such a short period of time
it's important to note that they're
they're not Samsung they're not Apple
they may never be
one plus if you if you ask somebody oh
one plus somebody my friends will be
like what when you post a video like
what the views that you get on a 1 plus
video are not commensurate with the
public perception of the brand mmm it
gets similar views to a Samsung video
but where are those views coming from
well they might be more globally
distributed that's what I think it is
because when I post something Sam single
Apple like US and UK right right but
then one plus it's a little bit varied
like it's more international so I think
there are some areas where oneplus is a
familiar brand if you have an iPhone
you're gonna buy it and that's why I
mean we're so many generations deep into
it in just getting out that ecosystem is
too difficult for you whereas if you're
somebody new and you're kind of looking
around you're like okay maybe one plus
is gonna be an option in those markets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
