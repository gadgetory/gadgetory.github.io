have an unboxing of epic proportion
happy to have you with us because this
my friends is the NX 90 from Asus
designed in conjunction with B&amp;amp;O
otherwise known as Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen to be
the best sounding laptop ever created
have they achieved that I'm not sure one
thing I am sure of they've created an
extremely religious unboxing experience
this box is like a giant box of Cohibas
it's like a giant cigar box - the scent
instead it smells like a factory which
is exactly how I want my electronics to
smell fresh you know what I'm saying
anyways as we pull this out first sort
of accessory we're going to get to
because we got to get to those before we
get to the meat and this is a little box
that looks like it has our documentation
in it why waste time out there let's get
a closer look under the bright lights
first things first we have an NX Series
drivers disc this is going to come in
handy if you ever need to reinstall the
operating system and after all this is
Windows so expect to do so at some point
next we've got our user manual which
feels like it's a little better quality
than your average user manual but I
guess that's what we should expect we've
got some more boring documentation as
always some safety related stuff and the
last thing in this pocket is our
warranty card which is less of a card
and more of a book something to mention
is asus has a heavy duty warranty two
years worldwide first year covers
accidental damage as crazy as that
sounds it's got to be the best warranty
in the business here is a restore disc
for Windows which is cool to see because
most manufacturers don't include those
anymore and we have a last little pouch
here which says for you from the nx90
team this appears to be some kind of
special gift for spending our entire
entire monthly income on this thing and
here we go we have a note here from the
nx90 team telling us how lucky we are to
own this thing and how they've made the
best laptop ever we've also got some
artwork here on the other side of it and
the rest of these cards actually ended
up being postcards now imagine imagine
that your family and friends look out it
because you're likely going to receive a
picture of my new laptop in the mail
within the coming few weeks oh and as
the man himself as to dude who designed
this puppy and so next thing we got to
get into is the cables and accessories
and there are a lot of these why waste
time out here let's get these under the
lights - first is an external antenna
this is going to be used to tune
over-the-air HD stuff or analog stuff
because this this laptop has a TV tuner
in it here's the power brick which is
obviously huge it is a huge laptop after
all huge laptop equals huge power brick
but I've seen bigger to be honest with
you and here's the other end of the
power
this is doesn't really need to be
explained North American plug I'm in
North America that makes sense here's an
adapter to hook up to a cable box or
cable feed and this is an extension for
it now let's get this beautiful box out
of the way and get into the laptop
itself because after all that's what
everyone's here for and after I remove
this plastic here in slow motion you'll
notice the laptop is very reflective
because you're staring at my ugly mug
there
they're using polished aluminum which is
unusual we've only seen brushed before
but look at that baby I mean that stance
is pretty unique I've never seen
anything like it before let's get closer
alright guys I just wanted to give you a
quick boot up sequence here as well as
give you a little bit of insight having
used the machine for the last couple of
hours first in regards to the sound it's
not quite as loud as I expected it to be
that that being said it makes up for it
in sound quality you get some amazing
stereo separation for a laptop unlike
anything I've ever heard before it's not
like the volume is quiet or anything
like that it's louder than any other
laptop I've had I think my expectations
were just seriously high considering my
knowledge of Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen in their
past product history I also want to give
you a quick run down to some of the
specs on this machine first of all it's
got a core i7 740 QM in it it's got an
18 point 4 inch screen that has 1920 by
1080 resolution it's got a blu-ray drive
a geforce GT 3 3 5 M 1 gigabyte graphics
card it's got a terabyte of storage on
two separate 500 gigabyte drives and
it's got 8 gigs of RAM so power is not
going to be an issue with this machine
but keep in mind it's nine point seven
pounds this is not portable by any means
and I sort of think it makes more sense
in a stationary location almost as a
replacement for an all-in-one that you
could pack up if you need to check the
channel subscribe I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
