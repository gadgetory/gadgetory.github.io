know about me my friends my relatives
Jack that I don't like to be hot I'm the
kind of guy like to keep it ice-cold I
like to keep the temperature in the
office a little bit chilly feel like I'm
more focused that way get you warm you
get a little bit too comfortable you get
too comfortable you doze up you take a
little bit of a nap
got to keep guys like Jack on their toes
turn around and have a little blanket on
and a pillow this right here might be
able to do that for you I don't know
the evapo ler or IVA polar your perfect
local microclimate wait what a personal
air conditioner that sits on your desk
doesn't what it doesn't vent out a
window like a window banger what's it
doing what is this technology this seems
interesting to me you can never get that
right temperature I'm too hot he's too
cold
she's too warm he's too old dr. Seuss
you can have that one for free it's
gonna require some water in there don't
do that do that we don't need a power
brick a micro USB cable the actual
evaporate oh oh
Jack's favorite bedtime snack silca gel
I see a filter in their grid a fan is on
this side protective covering on the
screen this is the water reservoir comes
off fill that up in there micro USB port
right there I mean this seems simple I'm
gonna get some water give me a second
what are we do Oh slide her down from
the top oh oh it's going already 23.3
what is that the setting or the current
temperature oh this is a wheel on the
top now I'm feeling air cold air but how
it's sucking in air from back here
there's a cool light on it yeah can you
see that it's like a nice teal aqua
color to it that is actually cold air
this is not a fan there is some tech
going on in here I may have found my new
favorite desk accessory when Jack's
getting frozen out over at his desk he
goes blue a kick I can't feel my little
Tinkler's and I go man up man up it
might even be colder than our air
conditioner this is genius
now it says 23.8 at the top and 22.2 at
the bottom one is the air it's sucking
in and one is the air it's blowing out
because it shows an arrow here's how
they're suggesting you use it so let's
say okay 30 degrees will be a hot day 30
degrees Celsius but you can see it can
knock it down by up to 10 degrees
Celsius in some cases relative
temperatures 24.3 and what it's pumping
out the front is 19 I mean that is
brilliant oh my goodness
I just discovered the menu here and see
how this wheel spins here I get a menu
color Wow there's a bunch of different
colors this is like a violet sort of a
pink red yellow super light greenish
light blue another kind of green tone
darker green it's like a little mood
light as well I think that's cool we
could turn the brightness of the mood
lighting you can switch from Celsius to
Fahrenheit when the evaporative
cartridge dries out the device notifies
you by changing the color to this one if
we can do a better job at cooling the
space directly around a person create
these microclimates I don't know it
seems more efficient at least in in in
theory this room gets hot hotter than
the other ones just create a
microclimate</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
