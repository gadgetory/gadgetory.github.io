here I'm finally here you're in the
house I'm in the house turns out that
you're just down the street from us here
literally just I got kind of one-wheeled
here you got a following on YouTube I do
people they like yeah yep very
informative cool they send you the photo
you kind of rieta tit yeah that's
something I started recently I thought
it would just be interesting to edit
other people's photos as you probably
know this channel here it's all about
technology I'm aware heavy focus on
smartphones because I have you here I
thought this would be a good opportunity
to launch a brand new segment here on
unbox therapy today today I asked the
guest which is you okay to show me their
smartphone okay let's go right now let's
go now that that could mean a couple
different things I think people are
gonna be interested in which smartphone
you're using sure and why sure what is
on it what on the homepage we're going
into it let's dive in it's happening
let's to it right now
okay the actual just iPhone you had to
check his notifications first he was
like what am I about to show off I have
nest notification and my friend Maddie
papaya which mean yeah
iPhone ten okay ten I have an upgraded
since wow I haven't really found the
need for it yet when I'm updating my
phones like I just there needs to be a
significant reason for it because I'm a
photographer the camera doesn't draw me
as much because I already deal with tons
of DSLRs and high production value
cameras on a regular basis so not being
like an everyday camera user where this
would be my driver like it's not a big
deal and in a certain way like I would
assume maybe I'm wrong you can probably
do more with impulse yeah with the
images that you do end up taking yeah
you you you may go in there and feel
like you're gonna edit it a little bit
whereas a more average customer might
which is they're straight out of camera
snap done in which case they may benefit
more from some of the software base
number two happening still super thin
still has like the depth sensors in it
so I can still get like the depth of
field out of it if I want even being a
photographer I still use this as much as
my regular camera I guess my go to
taking pictures your kids or whatever is
happening in a moment
I pulled this out first so you're an iOS
guy you're an Apple guy yeah have you
dabbled in Android I have would you
consider a shift more so recently I
would because there's a lot of things
that just make me go like Oh a pole come
on it's just that like if you don't work
once it's a comfort thing you got into
it so many years ago everything like all
your friends and lammeter keep on - a
lot of people tell me I message is a big
message and airdrop man or I can't get
over that what's on the homepage what
are the important apps ok I'll tell you
one of my most liked used apps right
here that I love because I'm like I
would say like I'm addicted is the
arrived app made by Shopify calls
through your email and it finds all your
tracking numbers and puts them all in
this app has like little pictures of
everything that you've bought so you can
just keep a bird's eye view on
everything that you have and I love I
love getting mail honestly this will
change your life
Wow real target to change everyone's
lives you didn't fill the page I didn't
fill it up there's a it's a bit of an
odd distribution ok yeah like you've
you've left one spot I did yeah messages
and Instagram are the most used that's
where my thumb naturally sits so it's
strategic I don't want I don't want
there to be an app below and beside
because I might hit it by accident and
then things would start getting weird
right I've got a system for this
you've got nest here yes you own some
nest prado nest is used a lot and the
thermostat I've got the cameras and the
doorbell YouTube YouTube studio
YouTube's pinnacle youtuber I the
YouTube studio is a stressful app it's
just usually letting you know like what
you should be doing better this Apple
Maps not Google Maps okay I'm Paige it
is can we talk about it I just like to
issue a perfect no no I know you don't
believe it so I'd like to issue a formal
apology to everybody watching so apple
carplay in my truck was only using maps
from Apple but it just recently got an
update and now it uses Google Maps so
six phone call notification yeah
502 email notification yeah that's
pretty good right now
502 like I'm in a good place I'm feeling
good about that but you're saying your
inbox is active and you're a happening
guy it's nothing's right but yeah it's
not all good stuff in the inbox but it's
definitely a busy place okay
do we go over lets why can we go over we
need swiping over to the next page this
is where things get fun oh I know what
ember is Oh amber life changing again I
keeps your coffee warm for like up to
two hours up to like a hundred and fifty
degrees around that's cool I might be
you in an edit I might get in the zone
and then 30 minutes later my coffees
cold
not anymore but it is an expensive mug
oh it is not cheap at all yeah you gotta
be really into coffee together it oh you
got the Chemex on the lawn I told you
man I like coffee Wow I took that photo
like as far as the ritual is concerned
of actually making coffee with the
Chemex it's a very sensual experience I
need you to unlock again I'm one of the
most fun parts of the Chemex is like
just the process of how what would you
name it and you have turbo skin you have
turbo skin her both scan belongs in the
business folder yeah I mean I guess so
what is DFB oh that's we can't talk
about that we can't talk about that one
that's an off camera app yeah yeah Wow
what's unfold unfold is an app that's
actually really cool that lets you
customize Instagram stories so if you
want to make them look a little more
artistic with layouts and not spend a
lot of time with it you can snap a bunch
of photos for like a photo series or
something drop them into templates that
have in-app purchases and stuff like
that and then when you put those stories
up on Instagram it just looks like a
designer made them it just complements
your photography and what you're trying
to showcase on stories a lot better I
can't help but notice skip the dishes
skip the dishes yeah they're like a
go-to restaurant for you on skip dishes
mucho burrito oh okay Booster Juice
mm-hmm yeah I Robot it might be my new
favorite thing things get messy at home
and I never thought a vacuum could keep
up to it this guy incredible literally
has brought more joy to my life
Wow yep that him there that there is
yeah so he goes over Robbie goes over
mounts himself and empties himself into
that Tower wow I really just sit there
and watch we're getting some hot
recommendations here I can't have a
background that's so busy that it makes
the apps look disgust I agree with that
it's one of the reasons I've never been
on snapchat because I hate the icon it's
really interesting the way people set up
their devices it is this is a wide
variance and people have strange methods
crepper how they make those decisions
you know what are we got here we'll
we're just we're just looking at the
Instagram right now I'm pretty hardcore
at the Instagram like I even have
separate accounts where I preview the
photo I'm going to post beforehand so I
can see if it matches with the tonality
of all the colors it's very snowy yes so
I usually transition through the season
yeah so if you keep going you'll see
it'll get a little warmer starting
around here you keep going down you see
slowly start introducing those winter
scenes so that the transitions nice so
we're in the fall now Wow
so we don't need the weather report we
really just blog on it a cigarette no
you know what season we're in ladies and
gentlemen it's it's Peter McKinnon you
gotta check them out on YouTube he's
doing cool things good time thanks for
looking at my stuff you got it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
