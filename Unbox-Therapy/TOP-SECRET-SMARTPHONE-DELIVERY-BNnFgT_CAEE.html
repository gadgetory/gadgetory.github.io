special delivery could you guess what's
inside that is right my friends and
exclusive first unboxing of the Huawei P
20 P 20 pro and the new porsche design
mate RS right up here like a triple
camera never seen it in an actual
smartphone until right now
one two three four first up this is the
p20 the fingerprint sensor remains on
the front this is your first look at the
display and you can see they've
implemented a notch scenario like some
other manufacturers but they were able
to shrink it down smaller than the
others that I've currently seen this
visual identifier on the power switch I
like that you see this is the black
color dual camera like a set up over
here but it does come in another color
as well midnight blue and this one is
vibrant my goodness what do you think
about this color near jack holy smokes
all right so that's midnight blue black
and there's also a pink gold version
that will be available quick charge
power brick type-c cable a headset also
a type c2 mini jack connector next up
the pro version we have black and
another color called
twilight 128 gigabytes of storage and 6
gigabytes of RAM an actual triple layout
on the back that is pretty wild so the
non pro version is five point eight
inches of screen space the pro is six
point one inches on the non pro version
you're getting an LCD display and then
on the pro you step up to an OLED
display let's check this one out okay
this is called Twilight and this one is
apparently all the height
this thing color shifts from blue to
purple on the back this unique color
kind of extends into the aluminum frame
as well this is not standard metallic
aluminum it has a tint to it which
matches the color shift of the back that
is a nice looking phone along with the
larger display and the slightly bigger
form factor you get a bigger battery on
the pro as well if four thousand
milliamp hour battery and then on the
non pro you're gonna get thirty four
hundred million hours but you've also
got what Huawei is calling the highest
resolution selfie camera on any phone 24
megapixels on the selfie camera is that
what we're doing now huh
40 megapixel in the rear sheesh aperture
portrait photo video pro now if you
select more here there's a slow motion
function up to 960 frames per second
also a night shot mode for enhanced
performance in low light here we go
selfie camera couple of pixels in there
let's try some stage lighting real quick
I'll go and get myself in there dramatic
the drama
let's try standard one-to-one Wow
show them the beard hairs Jack look at
the eyeball let's move to the rear
camera here guys this is insane when you
go into the settings for the rear camera
you have a choice between 7 megapixels
10 megapixels and 40 megapixels 72 96 by
54 72 this camera is gonna try to use
its AI features to determine what an
object is before you take the photo to
optimize the settings for that
particular object so if I take this prop
that's a cold that's a cold coca-cola
also gonna have a bokeh enabled mode
where it searches for the edge in order
to blur out the background we're
bringing in the plant greenery
it knows boom
that's a shot guys they're not messing
around here this device can apparently
see far more scenes than even the mate
ten could do so now there's nineteen and
there used to be thirteen before that
they can do cat dog food blue sky
flowers natural colours close up night
shot Jack just brought an old slice of
pizza
what kind of savage wouldn't put it on a
plate food delicious food it said ah now
another one that I think is cool is
actually the text-mode it finds the
edges of the box as well you get this
really clear image which is flat these
look delicious
did you bring these Finn oh I got it
food these are the almond or the pizza
in the background there okay now let's
talk a little bit about the video mode
the different resolutions available up
to 4k slo-mo there we go
slo-mo lets you record slow-motion
videos with no length limit super
slow-mo lets you record short videos at
32 X slow-motion or 960 fps 1 BAM now
why does everything look good in super
slo-mo let's give the fingerprint
scanner a test boom a quick one you have
a 40 megapixel RGB camera with an F 1.8
aperture then a 20 megapixel monochrome
f-16 that's gonna help out in low-light
situations and then an 8 megapixel
telephoto at F 2.4 together this gives
you the opportunity to zoom up to 5x
optically so no digital zoom and no
quality loss few more specs on the
display here this is 20 to 40 by 1080
for a PPI just over 400 horsepower is
provided by the Kirin 974 both of these
devices the pro and non pro and both of
these devices are gonna ship with
Android 8.1 so another advantage of
going pro versus non Pro you're gonna
step up to I P 67 certification so it's
gonna be a little bit more water
resisting a little bit more durable ok
so last but not least we have before
design huawei mate RS you see the device
right there Porsche design on the bottom
a special headset couple of different
international chargers and also a case
genuine leather case very important
gotta be genuine the same three camera
setup as the p20 pro the design is
different so you have these in the
center of the chassis a fingerprint
scanner here too now this model is also
capable of wireless charging the porsche
design wireless charger to go with it
this little puck here have the entire
setup so here's what it looks like with
the case install that's a look oh my
goodness look at that if you're gonna do
a case so there you have it the p20 p20
pro and the porsche design huawei mate
RS unveiled here exclusively on unbox
