there this that's what they're calling
the world's smallest bluetooth speaker I
don't know how they know it's the
world's smallest but I'll tell you what
it is small I'll just lift that on top
that's a quarter so it is absolutely
tiny I was looking at the Amazon page
250 customer reviews and four out of
five stars on the rating so people seem
to like it it also appears to be
multifunctional it can do music
hands-free calling and a selfie button
it can act as a selfie button which as
you know it's very important to me
personally
anyhow it's got a selfie button on there
okay listen I don't know who that's for
maybe it's for you
what else play music while you're on the
go with a 10-meter bluetooth 4.2 range
comes with a strap that makes for
convenient carrying answer phone calls
with one click and listen via speaker
okay so it's a it's a bluetooth speaker
it's tiny what's the price well fifteen
fifteen dollars that's making this the
cheapest thing featured on unbox therapy
for a really long time people in the
comments clamoring Lou get back to the
affordable stuff I want you to uncover
gadgets I want you to uncover deals
maybe this is it maybe you need a little
Bluetooth on-the-go you know you don't
want to spend a ton of money you need
something a bit better than the phone
speaker you don't make maybe you're in
an environment where you need a little
speaker you can put out and you don't
want to leave your phone sitting there
do you know what I mean because a lot of
people they won't play with the phone
play the music with the phone but maybe
you want to leave it on the table
public region you you still got stuff to
do as well
you don't want people to mess with it
plus can play your music on the table
and keep your phone in your pocket and
carry this thing around and really not
even notice it cuz it's so small so a
party all the time any time just you're
constantly partying let's get this baby
cracked open we'll pair up to it
honestly my expectations are not very
high it is small though would you look
at that little guy
wow you really could pocket this thing
and not even notice all right there's
the selfie button on the back microUSB
over here to charge it up comes in a few
different colors as well black white
gray red and pink okay lots of colors to
choose from also in the package a tiny
little USB micro USB cable look at that
guy to charge it up and a strap as they
mentioned before to like keep it nearby
so I think you put the strap on like
this you pull it through and then I
guess you could put it on a keychain
because it's a little loop there but I'm
pretty sure this is like a locking
attachment to a headphone jack we have a
headphone jack let's see this here it is
so you could carry it like look at that
style as you play the tunes it's on it's
on when it's on okay that's a cool cool
little touch I suppose
it's probably dead oh nevermind you hear
that it'll talk to you as well Bluetooth
device ready to pair okay let's see if
it pops up here okay
gives me the battery there 100% battery
we're connected to the little speaker
it's the moment of truth ladies and
gentlemen something the size of a
corridor how can it really sound can it
be good I don't know I'm nervous
it's louder on the table it's somehow
louder on the table a little bit least
I'm in my ear so here's what I say I
think is a cool product this sounded me
it's not gonna blow you away right it's
not like oh that's a serious Bluetooth
speaker it's gonna sound a lot like your
smartphone speaker maybe a little bit
better but the thing is you don't want
to just leave your smartphone on the
table that's the point of this thing
it's small enough that you don't mind
carrying it and it's cheap enough that
you don't mind just leaving it out to
play some tunes
you got it charged up you know this
thing can stay in your pocket or you can
DJ from it you add a little little
get-together a little gathering you know
I don't know what you like to do you get
together you have a conversation you
have a few drinks you put this guy out
you might have a tiny bit more bass than
your average smartphone speaker but
mostly it's a portable speaker that's
kind of like in a way it's just that's
just a little bit more social
you know you
what I'm saying right now you're getting
notifications coming through you don't
want to leave the phone on the table
there's this private stuff going on so
you keep the phone with you but you have
yourself a little portable party this is
pretty cool for 15 bucks and never mind
the selfie button if that's what you're
into Who am I woah selfies yeah it's a
hole it's a party that's a real party
Kirk you don't know how to party it's
not a party till you've got the world's
smallest bluetooth speaker while you're
firing a billion selfies at the same
time my dad just killed it you guys feel
me right you know what I'm saying
Jase know what I'm saying 15 bucks you
don't even really mind if the thing goes
missing if you leave the party you
didn't take it with you it's like big
deal you leave a party without this guy
oh it's gonna be a frantic moment get
yourself one of these and stop worrying
it's that's the idea
15 bucks it's on Amazon it's better than
I expected it to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
