what's up guys it's Lou from unbox
therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Turtle Beach ear force px 5 wireless
gaming headset now this headset is gonna
work on either your PlayStation 3 or
your Xbox 360 and it's going to allow
for you to enjoy 7.1 channel surround
sound emulation the way it's going to do
that is by using the optical audio
output on either of those aforementioned
consoles now since they're wireless
they're gonna require batteries in order
to be powered next we've got a remote
this is going to be used if you're using
the headset with your Xbox 360 so you
can control chat volume and whatnot
while plugging this into your controller
next we've got our USB cable mini USB to
USB this is used for programming your
presets into the headset here's a USB to
power this is obviously for powering the
device and lastly we've got our optical
cable this is how you interface with
your console so let's see what else
we've got in the package hiding
underneath the headset itself are some
documents of course the manual as well
as some other paperwork this is actually
going to be useful in the case of this
device because it is fairly complicated
to operate there are a number of
different ways you can use it we got a
sticker that says play like a pro I'm
sure you all already do and then
something that says stop how about we
don't stop let's keep this going so get
into the headset which is important
after all that's what we're here for we
see we've got a real nice boom mic
that's really flexible and really
adjustable we've also got our power
button on the right ear Cup the
turtlebeach logo on the outside and the
inside of the headset a nice plush
headband with a leather like feel on the
outside and a turtlebeach logo embossed
on the top
and like most other headsets it's got a
nice tight adjustability we've got our
controls on the ear cups themselves we
have bluetooth volume bluetooth power an
LED mic mute and our main preset button
we've also got USB Xbox another preset
button and our game volume control on
the back of the head unit we have our
digital in and out we've also got analog
line in our line in volume as well as
our power on the front of the unit we
have our 3.5 millimeter jack volume
