mmm little bit altered mm-hmm happy
birthday dude okay okay it's called the
physics way tap and what it does is it
takes your standard beer that comes in a
bottle and it turns it into draft beer
using micro foam it's like having your
own tap your own bar at home and all you
have to do is put your beer bottle in
here you're probably thinking I don't
understand I don't get it I cracked my
beer bottle at home I like it it's a
good time I enjoy it but what's wrong
with it well there's actually a
discernible difference between what you
get at a bar in a draft glass and what
you get out of a beer bottle the texture
with the size of the bubbles the
carbonation I did a video previously on
the first version of this product it's
actually quite different you put it on
the table for a party there's football
in the background everyone's happy and
they're just like hey man what is that
gadget and why does my beer taste like
I'm at a bar scientific engineered using
patent-pending fluid dynamics and sound
technology to enhance the flavor and
taste of beer sound technology leverages
sound waves to convert the beers natural
carbonation into densely compact uniform
bubbles what sound waves it enhances the
flavor and taste of all beer including
IPAs pilsners brown ales stouts porters
and lagers what was that this one is way
more portable than the last one that I
looked at and the size of it your wife
might actually let you keep it on the
countertop slide it in any regular beer
bottle close the top boom tap it top it
you're done yes look how small that is
look at that little guy come on now
that's cute Oh silica gel for Jack it's
been a while I got him that guy pull it
like this to fill up the beer and then
push it back
to top it off whoa straw in the center
here is going to go inside the beer
bottle so you press the button on the
front
and it lifts right up draught beer at
home we are gonna need batteries and
they didn't include batteries I'm
knocking points off all right we got to
find some Willy do Willy do with the
batteries coming through Willy do coming
through all right so I have one two
bottles of Molson Canadian here I'm
gonna keep one just on its own so I can
do a taste comparison ooh
get the plank glass over here now you
straighten out the glass and you pull
this lever in the opposite direction
check this out look at the micro bubbles
there look at that that's different than
just the foam if I smash one of these
into a glass okay let's give it a taste
mm-hmm very creamy a lot more creamy and
factor it's like a draught beer what can
I say it's it's what they say is legit
here now I'm gonna do the comparison
real quirky whoo it's just different I
can't lie it's just different that's
just a little bit more elegant this
right here actually tastes like a beer
from a bar off the top so here's the
thing I like beer but when it comes to
beer and knowledge and so forth Willy do
sits at the top the man has been
drinking beer for a couple months though
I don't drink via that Willy do has
tried every beer on the planet all right
beer from Belgium check France check
Germany check Slovakia check mm-hmm
No maybe I embellished it a little bit
in fact one will do sat down he said
listen man I don't I'm not the guy like
I don't know much about beer so he's
actually perfect for this we're gonna
see if he likes the taste of the bottled
beer better or the physics beer try a
plain beer first
just plain think about it okay you got
it in your head yeah all right it's time
for me to change the game here if this
is garbage
you say that man and say it the people
need the truth and roll down the glass
now we're gonna top it off for you
I just did that for you man look at the
look at the micro don't actually don't
be swayed by the appearance let your
taste buds do the talking there's
actually a different taste mm-hmm I
would say it's better as a better
texture mmm
a lot like silkier take another sip go
back to the regular beer now come back
here one more time yeah this is
definitely a lot creamier it's a nice
texture it's different I like if I had
to choose yeah I prefer this one wow
it's a little bit different yes in terms
of the texture but the taste is still
there mm-hm
which I do you know someone enjoys it
kind of tastes like if you ordered a
pint at a bar a beer at a bar does taste
a little bit different it does it is a
little bit creamier both will and I
prefer both like the physics if you're a
beer dude become a beer dude so we just
keep drinking</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
