it's 2018 if you're not using a VPN and
a good VPN you're doing the internet
wrong visit the link in the description
you need Nord VPN I've been using it for
like five years so I made a video about
this phone a really long time ago at the
beginning of the gaming smartphone trend
smartphones designed specifically for
gamers with gamer features LEDs special
colors aggressive styling so I made a
video about this is called the Black
Shark it was one of the first ones that
came to my attention but at the time
wasn't available for me to get a
hands-on with I have it in front of me
now they finally sent it ok so this is
it
wooo yes very aggressive very gamer if
the whole thing is a metal body grippy
as well this has a rubberized kind of
grip to it on top of the metallic finish
I kind of don't mind the design yes it's
gamer ish but not too over the top
oh the game controller is in here a case
so it leaves the back open and
improvement in cooling I'm guessing
that's interesting so it doesn't change
the look of the device very much it's
it's sort of like a bumper that's the
controller so you get a joystick
shoulder buttons tons of grip it looks
like it charges over USB type-c oh good
call will case first then look at Willy
do over there huh just so I have this
the right way Willard is going this
probably like that oh yeah that locked
that's a nice looking little gaming
device definitely better than just the
phone on its own now you still have
access to your cameras on the back as
well as all your other switches no
headphone jack type c2 mini jack it
feels very high quality no plastic in
sight the whole thing is metal the
fingerprint scanner because it's not on
the back is on the front here it's a
Snapdragon 805 eight gigs of ram four
thousand milliamp hour battery it's kind
of like a polka phone but gaming
12 plus 20 megapixel camera setup there
on the back front-facing camera here is
20 megapixels so we have a dual SIM card
tray oh it's already set up and has
pubsey already on it comes in either 128
gigs of storage or 64 starting around
480 bucks us another thing I'm noticing
is the skin looks pretty stock on here
very stock oh my goodness
very stock you can probably tell
immediately the bezels here are not very
small by today's standards you got a big
forehead a big chin in the unit that
ships to you may have some version some
sort of a skin on it so just be aware of
that so the display is 1080 by 2160 you
have audio coming firing out of the
bottom as well as the earpiece region
well done Jesse James on that one but
also the speakers on this are nice and
crisp delete I feel like I should just
pop that song up on my polka phone cuz
it can't it definitely doesn't sound
that good they thought about the audio
there is some audio kicking out of this
of course they had to think about it
though how are you gonna call it a
gaming phone and not think about the
audio Oh Dave two DS about to be mad
whoo
first impressions with the thumbstick
very responsive and way better than
grabbing onto the screen for sure
so they've mapped it right out of the
gate and you just connect via bluetooth
to controller
and you're pretty much up and running it
is as advertised it feels more like a
controller obviously that's what we're
going for right so yes this is cool I'm
a fan of this it's not gonna immediately
make you a pro star gamer obviously but
if you are interested in extended gaming
sessions on a smartphone this is just
gonna make it so much comfier this has
one of those vapor cooling situations to
keep the chipset cool while you're
pressing it like you would via a video
game so this key on the side it's called
the shark key and when you click it and
say you have toggled the shark key to
close all current applications and enter
shark mode oh man
uninterrupted gaming no notifications no
incoming calls featuring intelligent
frequency and voltage regulation and RAM
cleanup it just freed up some of my ram
specifically for the purpose of greater
gaming performance that's cool you can
also see how much time you're spending
playing games you have some statistics
available to you and then to go back to
standard phone mode you just switch the
key back and you go straight in you've
got a camera set up here it looks very
similar to what I've been working with
on the polka phone which is of course
also a Xiaomi product pretty nice image
not bad you already know I'm not a big
fan of these portrait modes but
nonetheless that's how it works you can
see the focus fall off far more drastic
than what the lens is capable of
creating on its own it's acceptable it's
not the main focus of his phone it's a
special type of phone for a particular
type of enthusiast if your smartphone is
your main gaming device you're gonna
start looking at devices like this which
are tuned up for that purpose and of
course in this case even a special
interface nonetheless there it is the
black shark the first of many gaming
specific smartphones that I'm sure we're
gonna see as manufacturers continue to
attempt to differentiate their devices
for different users for different use
case scenarios and
specifically the gaming market because
it has become such a prominent place for
gamers there are so many new users
especially in emerging markets where
this will be their de facto standard
possibly only gaming device and so it's
cool to see these different
implementations of how you can be gaming
on a smartphone this is one of the best
I've experienced</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
