recently you could probably tell I've
been using Mac books for years and
recently you know bumping into some
problems keyboard issue that keeps on
flaring up but in the meantime I've been
experimenting a lot more with Windows
and the wide variety of choices that you
have look at that all the way down to
there Kirk was telling me he's at yoga
the other day what poses that sleeping
dog it's a sleeping dog you see I know
my yoga it's just a little bit more
exciting to be honest because there's
more choice did a video on this guy here
this is the x1 carbon Lenovo ThinkPad
two and a half pounds it's got an
anti-glare display as well which I've
actually grown to really like using near
a window prior to that the surface
laptop 2 that I have here is mostly
aluminum with of course in the Alcantara
interior as much as I wanted to love
this one the keyboard was just a little
bit too flimsy
maybe I'm hammering a bit hard when you
put them in a showdown between the x1
carbon and this one the keys themselves
yeah I mean they're nicer they're nicer
on the laptop by a touch
I just gravitate towards that one you
have tablets and iPads and smartphones
in so many different devices competing
for your attention and when you reach
for one of these you want to have a nice
keyboard experience a nice display
experience the speaker experience
haven't been super happy with on x1
carbon saloon 2 speakers on this are not
as nice as pretty much any MacBook that
I've used so anyhow that brings us to
today the x1 extreme this is the Lenovo
equivalent to the MacBook Pro this is
the workstation this is the gtx 1050
this one has a core i7 in it this is
configurable up to 64 gigabytes of ram
in fact if you buy this laptop in a form
of the p1 then you could be looking at
intel xeon processors in a laptop it's
got 2 slots for SSDs but the craziest
part about this is it still comes in
incredibly light right at four pounds so
think MacBook Pro think thin and light
okay here we go this one has a 4k
display on it that's a ton of pixels for
a laptop but it does come at the expense
of being a bit heavier compared to the
x1 carbon I mean you're gonna notice the
difference more screen real estate on
this side it actually supports quick
charging 135 watt power brick which
isn't even not huge think of quick
charge for your smartphone but for your
laptop and it's about time that took
place they've gone with a proprietary
connector here I think it's worth it in
exchange for quick charge on your laptop
it's got the soft touch to it it's all
business but that's alright it just says
I want to get the job done nothing extra
you have an SD card slot a couple of USB
ports over here there's a Kensington
lock to Thunderbolt three USB type-c
connectors HDMI out Ethernet breakout
and also a headphone jack much different
than the Apple approach on the MacBook
the rapid charge will bring this laptop
up to eighty percent of its total
battery capacity in a one hour charge ok
cool this one there's a little bit more
room on the deck the trackpad looks a
little bit larger than the x1 carbon
let's take a quick peek at that yeah
it's a bit taller and the fingerprint
scanner moved this one they say is anti
reflective but it has glass over top so
it's gonna be more reflective than the
one that I'm currently using on the
carbon this is the best whoo look at
this like why don't more laptops do that
let me go flat if I have to that is
crazy
so if you're all about contrast and
vibrance and so on this is probably the
display that you're going to select if
you go with this particular system
having 4k resolution in something that's
15 inches I mean that's a ton that's
some serious pixel density going on
there let me do a little bit of typing
on his keyboard I'm curious
quick brown fox jumped over that Lee
easy dog I love these keyboards man I
didn't realize how deprived I had been
for so many years butterfly key switches
when we've even when they worked like
you just feel like getting after it it's
like the carbon with some added
stability if typing is of utmost
importance to you apparently the audio
performance is better here than it is on
the sixth-generation carbon that's a
hundred I feel like I hope that I've
uncovered some value it does sound
better than the x1 carbon it's still not
macbook pro level sound the fans are
jumping on a little bit again we got we
got hot or hardware I mean that's the
bottom line and the screen I'm seeing a
lot more color and saturation in the
video when compared to the 1080p display
like that's a really good-looking image
right there in the 4k display is so nice
to look at but it's gonna increase your
power consumption obviously you could go
in and and create some some very
customized
versions of that product you can spec
this unit with an i5 and i7 like I said
you go to the workstation version where
you can go all the way up to a Xeon and
it's not even over once you own the
thing because you can pop this bottom
off right here and you can actually
upgrade it yourself you can throw
another SSD in there it's actually
pretty easy to do and they don't mind
you doing it you're not like voiding a
warranty or anything like that is the
extra horsepower worth the added weight
scale size and so on when compared to
the x1 carbon which I've been liking
look at the way I handle that with one
hand I've been liking this so much it
might be for me and my day-to-day tasks
that this is a bit more convenient I
don't really know yet but I'm real
interested in what Lenovo is doing with
the ThinkPad line it's got me fired back
up if you're like me and you've been on
a macbook for a really long time it
might be the time to take a glance back
it's the extreme version it's the
desktop replacement sort of workstation
little bit of gaming it's like the power
ThinkPad if you're looking for something
smaller lighter
this is 2.5 pounds go check out the
video that I did on this laptops your
cool get one type something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
