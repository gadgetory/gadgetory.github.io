something beautiful today this is what
you signed up for this is what you
subscribed for this thing in front of me
it's a smartphone flexible watch wrist
worn phone call text message you put on
your wrist it's a whole phone that goes
on your wrist with a flexible display
that wraps around your wrist this is
this is wild just such a different
ambitious futuristic kind of approach
and that's what I got in this business
for like you know to see crazy things
like this it's a physical product it's a
thing you're gonna be able to buy from
Nubia it's called the Nubia Alpha and
how do we crack into it here we go oh my
goodness gracious
that is a smart phone what now they say
it will work as a SmartWatch as well but
they dis look what the display does goes
all the way around like that there's
just a straight-up Bluetooth version
which is like the most futuristic
looking SmartWatch and then there's an e
sim version that's your whole smartphone
on your wrist it's got a metal band kind
of like a high-end wristwatch it comes
in more than one color as well there's a
gold version this is the black this is
more my style you can see it has a a
camera on it as well it's a 5 megapixel
camera that's a whole phone its wild
what else is in the box let's check a
cable to charge it up hang on
ah there we go ok cool all right so the
cable just goes into here it stays
plugged in and then this piece goes on
here to charge it up
similar to other SmartWatch
implementations for charging there's
also a very slim little charge brick
included in the box as well ok cool now
I'm noticing as well looks like there's
a heart rate sensor in the back which
you have probably seen before on a
SmartWatch but never in a SmartWatch
smartphone the band is kind of unusual
also because it has to be wide in these
locations to accommodate the flexible
portion of the display on the other side
holy moly all right it's charged up look
at this crazy wow this is the setup
screen flexible display as you can tell
English has been selected let's go ahead
and click Next here look at the user
terms this is the most narrow display
I've ever used
next allow allow allow allow allow Home
icon left wrist male hold on okay we're
connected is this guy ready to go oh my
goodness gracious would you look at that
I gotta try this thing on oh that is so
weird it's futuristic Inspector Gadget
Blade Runner the future just has these
things in it you know it you feel it oh
wow they nailed the sizing for me as
well uh that's what it looks like rolls
around the entire wrist look at this
thing you scroll it's kind of hard for
you guys to see with the reflection but
look at this this is how you interact
settings
well that's brightness actually 30 being
maxed by the looks of it it also has
gestures so you can navigate without how
do you do that oh what'd you think oh
yes go it's a little hit and miss but it
does work Oh are you seeing that imagine
you see me in the street uh-huh really
doing all this on their way wow it
actually this is working better now
you can use the buttons as well or you
can just reach out and touch it
so anyhow settings up here
next is time obviously it's a watch
still so you're gonna have this you know
you're gonna have this face in the
center your fitness aspects like the
steps you've taken activity level
battery life over here and then also
some options phone calls health and
whatnot now if I scroll over here it's
almost like a different menu to interact
with it just keeps scrolling all the way
around like an infinite wheel map we
chat messages calls camera oh that's
weird
a 5 megapixel camera how do i I took
what it moved on me you can see him move
the camera around okay here we go 5
megapixel can i zoom there's no zoom
going on you just scroll not the
greatest selfie I don't know if you're
looking for some kind of spy cam Dick
Tracy style then that might work so the
phone call can function either directly
from the device or via Bluetooth because
of course
it features an ECM so you could have
your SIM card directly in here and it's
a standalone or it could trigger a phone
call on your device now if you move over
to the next menu then it's mostly health
related heartrate health workout indoor
running outdoor walking one more time
schedule stopwatch countdown alarm music
system gesture health setting sound
display oh baby t 9 t 9 typing
hey stop watch useful dope there you go
check out the scrolling watch weather
very nice so as a SmartWatch without an
e SIM setup without having your number
attached to it directly it works
basically like other smartwatches you
have notification management so you can
send notifications through to this
device of course you have a bigger
display for things like weather and
messages and so on there's a t9 keyboard
in there that you can use not sure if
you'd want to because of course it's a
bit slow now it has its own internal
storage also so you could load up songs
directly onto it if you wanted to well
there's also a marquee feature ya
Marquis let's check this out create edit
Oh
see look at that can I say anything I
want all day long Willy do and Otis
on their way save oh hey Otis
on their way whoa it stopped it on too
long
this thing is bananas I don't know who
is well who's buying this thing you know
it's kind of like these flexible
displays have inspired hardware
manufacturers and they're like we got to
do something we can bend in this play
now it should be fold and refolding
things should we curve around the wrist
maybe it could do some things well it's
more like a SmartWatch with a bigger
display than it is a smartphone that
you're wearing on your wrist and as a
SmartWatch it's honestly it's kind of
huge it's kind of big it's a whole thing
we'll get in here we're gonna chat for a
minute I can see a future in this where
go on we're listening it would just be
like a strap of OLED all the way yeah
okay I can I can see a future in this
it's basically so you're all about it
you're all about it I didn't say that
what you know it's it's pretty cool yeah
I mean look there's there's a long way
to go with this and I would say that
this is actually really cool okay this
is really cool just from a hardware
perspective ambition gadget factor yup
definitely I mean if it wraps around
like I think that would be the move it's
cool it's super futuristic like I said
when the video started Bladerunner
matrix Total Recall Star Wars Star Trek
demolition man lawnmower man Futurama
back to the future to the Future
self-lacing sneakers hoverboards we're
not ready for this yet mankind is not
ready for this yet it's the Nubia Alpha
and one day we're all gonna be wearing
one maybe not this one but like you know
version 12 yeah 20 years is a long time
well I know you don't know what you're
wearing you don't know what you look
like in 20 years probably won't be
wearing anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
