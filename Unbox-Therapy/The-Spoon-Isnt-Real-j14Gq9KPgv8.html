what exactly is going on I might be
included in that I'm also kind of
wondering that but I do have a product
today we're going to test it in a in an
unconventional way because we're
Canadian why the company is called a
maze fit and the tracker is called arc
it's got a heart rate monitor on it
I'm hoping it's kind of durable it also
says on the back it's ip67 so water
resistant dust rain splashing how about
ice actually kind of sleek so it's got a
clock on it as well move beautifully I
got to hit the ice first we'll see how
beautiful it is room also evaluate the
beauty of Tom it's coming out of
retirement for this video if that
doesn't deserve a thumbs up I don't know
what does Tom give them a thumbs up look
at that
here you can catch a closer look at the
heart rate monitor on the bottom it's
also got a traditional watch style band
which I like babies magnetic right there
look at that this guy just look at that
Oh footsteps heart rate well obviously
there isn't one right now battery life
and back to time I like that simple you
hardly even notice it there they will do
a few challenges out there what do you
say Tom let's get out there get out
there it's what I've been waiting for
many years the time has finally come the
test
of all ties will the fitness tracker
stack up to a hockey players needs look
at that that could be that's me right
Doug Gilmour use your name Doug Gilmour
not taken alright that's a special day
right there
Tom when's the last time the Leafs were
actually good like Doug Gilmour that era
they lost the flame Gretzky they were
also Wayne Gretzky you essentially put
in your height your weight touch the
button to confirm Oh check it out see
boom confirm
here's how you play a game ha ha ha ha
fun so I'm here you're going to have
your steps asleep data set your goals
change your units so on Tom what's a
good heart rate for exercise 220 minus
my age okay so around 190 it's a lot
easier to do some cardio that's fun to
do then you're sitting on the bike what
you doing you don't want to be on that
bike is staring into into nowhere what
are you doing
can we do in check let's do a check I
tell people are doing some serious
cardio man but what other sport you have
one minute shift some kgs a 45 second
shift
hockey's the sport with a natural
interval training you come out
go hard full clip one minute at a time
come down to heart rate come down you do
it all over again I'm like the
ambassador to hockey right now
ambassador to Canada I got water bottles
on the bench what are they full of maple
syrup that's right
I got that ticker ticking tick tick tick
tick tick to pull I'm in that range
Tom says I'm burning fat right now you
called me fat take a step back all right
so it's challenge time at the end of the
rink over there there's a tiny little
water bottle which you can probably
barely see you through then Tom and I
are gonna slide a few pucks down there
first guy to hit it wins wins the
internet wins a thumb in the right place
that is a tiny target man Oh sakes
Jesus oh that's much better than mine oh
that was Tom 2/10 number 3
aah I keep going to farther right aah
oh that's not bad
ohh ohh ohh
oh that's it okay oh I'm having a matrix
moment I need to bend this moon right
now
now the spoon isn't real this boon is it
go like it's bone is real
the spoon is it real real this boat is
not real
that was clean those clean crossbar we
got try to hit the crossbar with a slap
shot from here hopefully Tom does a
little bit better on this one here for
Tom in the last challenge the spoon was
very real see the matrix hit the
crossbar not the matrix by far shot like
the trick shot I forgot where we can we
can do ba when the bright lights are on
sure uncle Lew baby pass home so another
thing about this fitness tracker right
here is ip67 water-resistant right now
does that is ice included in that oh
ip67 let's find out Oh still ticking 500
is 15 steps you're got a lot of water
from that lens
all right so what do we find out besides
the fact that the spoon is definitely
not real we found out that this little
guy can actually hold up to hockey which
in my opinion got to be one of the most
rugged sports out there it's very slim
so it doesn't interfere at all with my
movement I don't even notice it actually
when I'm playing we track the heart rate
we got it up to what 170 plus that's
kind of cool we can see where it spiked
you see the average as well is the arc
hockey ready I don't know I think we
found out we also found out a few other
things don't play hockey you can see the
matrix get out here on any surface stick
the water bottle at the end find out
who's the one yo thumbs up if you want
another hockey video this was too much
fun to do it there's 15 seconds we're
down by one he's coming down the ice he
crosses the line he sees the net he
lines it up thank God wait a shot corner
the trail oh wow
hi buddy
you</div></body></html>
