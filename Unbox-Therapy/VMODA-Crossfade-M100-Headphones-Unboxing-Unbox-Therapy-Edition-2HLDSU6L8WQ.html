therapy and today we're taking a look at
the crossfade m100 headphones from
v-moda these are an over the ear style
headphone that are very popular amongst
DJs they have massive 50 millimeter
drivers inside which is going to give
you great representation in the low
frequencies so if you listen to bass
heavy music and you really want to feel
that Rumble these headphones are going
to have no problem representing that
kind of audio now in this particular
case these ones have been customized you
can go ahead and customize your own if
you happen to purchase them these have
been customized for unbox therapy and
you get a closer look of course here in
a moment if you guys are interested in
pricing and availability on these
headphones I will put a link down in the
description also in the description
there's going to be a link to a poll
that's going on right now for the top
headphones in the world top DJ
headphones so if you have experience
with these or other headphones and you
want to put your vote into the poll I
will put a link down there so you can do
that
anyways let's talk about the unboxing
here like all other v-moda products the
unboxing experience is really nice
high-quality materials everywhere on the
inside you've got a little bit of
paperwork from v-moda as well as the
carrying case for your headphones the
m100 s do fold up they are fairly
compact so they do make sense as a
travel headphone even though they are in
around the ear style you can also add a
microphone to these if you want to use
them as a headset I'm not going to go
through the paperwork here don't want to
bore you guys instead let's jump right
into the headphones and take a closer
look at this custom design if you guys
follow me on instagram you've probably
already seen a picture of these if you
don't follow me on Instagram I'll link
that down in the description so you can
go ahead and do that but for those of
you that haven't seen these yet I think
that they look pretty badass
you've got the unbox therapy logo on
each of the two ear cups but believe it
or not these panels on either side these
shields are actually interchangeable so
if you get sick of the logo that you
customized on to there or if you just
get sick of the color that your
headphones have shipped with you can
actually change these
later date there's so many colors
available from red gold to green to
crimson I mean you name it
in terms of other items inside the
package you have a quarter inch audio
adapter as well as some rubber grommets
for putting into the ear cup that you're
not using for your audio cable if you
just want to cover up that hole and then
you've got a couple of braided cables
this is the first of the two this one is
longer than the next one and it looks to
have a sharing port on it I think that's
if you want to split your audio and
share it with somebody else
the next cable is very similar in the
sense it's the same color it's also
braided but this one's a little bit
shorter making it better suited for
mobile use as an inline microphone as
well so you can answer your phone calls
and it also has a button so you can
pause and play whatever content is
streaming from your device now it's
obvious that these are really
nice-looking headphones especially in
this color scheme they are available in
a number of other color schemes as I
said earlier you can get them in you
know plain black if that's what you're
looking for but appearance is only part
of the equation when it comes to
purchasing a set of headphones and sound
is obviously the next consideration
probably the more important
consideration and these are no slouch
when it comes to reproducing high
quality audio these things have actually
blown me away comparative to some of the
other stuff that I've tried and I'm not
alone I was reading through the reviews
on Amazon by the way these things have a
four and a half out of five star review
rating on Amazon with over two hundred
and eight customer reviews so a lot of
people compelled to talk about how much
they loved these headphones even if you
go to the super stuck-up super crazy
audiophile places like head fie people
are really big fans of these particular
headphones right here and it's for good
reason they sound amazing so anyways
that wraps up this video if you guys
enjoyed it please remember to leave a
thumbs up down below and other than that
I'll catch you on the next one</div></body></html>
