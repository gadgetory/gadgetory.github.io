while now I know I understand since my
last Galaxy S 9 video when it first came
out I did preliminary impressions type
of video I had pre-release units so I
couldn't even hold on to those I had to
send those ones back I realized man I
haven't extensively used the s9 yet or
in this case the s9 plus I'm not really
doing my job here as painful as it may
be for me today I'm gonna switch over
from the pixel to XL like a warm blanket
to the s9 plus I picked this up today I
decided while I was over there to pick
up the fast charger the wireless fast
charger as well Samsung they really do
the wireless charging best what do they
say ten minute charging wirelessly oh my
goodness that's exciting on its own okay
so what did I get I got the 64 gigabyte
titanium gray no contract I just picked
it up bingo maybe in this case it means
I'm gonna be a little bit more critical
because I put my money where my mouth
was I did or I'm doing that actively
okay the unboxing experience you've
probably seen this at this point last
time around I actually chose to switch
to the s8 rather than the Plus version
this time around I'm like bigger battery
the camera set up the unit right here
titanium gray on the back probably put
some kind of case on this new camera
setup moved the fingerprint scanner
which was my number one pet peeve on the
previous version type C headphone jack
which they kept that's important to me
peel that off no notch City USB
connector here in order to transfer
files from your previous device fast
charge power brick this is something I
was kind of excited about AKG headphones
now that's a nice little bump that's a
nice little bonus there look you're
aware alright this is sort of the
flagship to beat or at least it has been
for a long time
price-wise 839 not quite $1000
everyone's always gonna want to have a
status symbol look I got 800 I get 800
dollars you see that's mine but I think
for the mass market the real innovation
is somewhere
down the food chain a little bit in that
mid-range where you're getting like 90%
of the experience of this maybe even 95
in some cases for almost half the cost I
am glad that Samsung didn't jump all the
way to a thousand bucks unlike some
other players in the marketplace not
going to name any names sometimes you
like to bring one for your teacher if
you're trying to you know up the grades
in school I'm not new glasses so Samsung
what is so magical about the galaxy line
of devices other than the fact that then
other than the fact then other than
other than that they spend boatloads of
money telling you about what's special
their marketing it's still it's
penetrating the cultural mindset in fact
many people they just correlate galaxy
with Android and vice versa you know
we're talking about OLED the best in the
biz it's still a Samsung display so you
might be surprised to know Samsung is
supplying even so even to Apple so for
those of you in the comments that are
like iPhone for life bro there's a
relationship between these top level
brands in many cases that device that
you love so much it has pieces and
components from many different players
and that's good that's good for the tech
bits very comfy as well if you've ever
used I mean you hear the tone already
what's different here an upgraded camera
system you got some super slo-mo I had
the lighter out Jack can sub in the clip
right now
kablammo oh so pretty you also have the
variable aperture this is insane for a
smartphone bit of a gimmick possibly
fingerprint city yes of course another
glass phone I ordered a couple leather
cases can I say something about leather
cases I've been looking for good stuff I
can't find it it busted on my recent
trip not durable there's not a good one
out there I'm so angry about it I might
just make one how about that all right
let's do the ceremonial SIM card switch
because yes he's not gonna do it he's
not gonna do it lose a pixel fanboy
Google fanboy that's a real sim card
that's my real phone number don't leak
at this time Jacqueline let's slot this
baby in microsd card expansion all right
options are good there we go there we go
okay cool
boom I apologize my sweet pixel to excel
the days were good nonetheless your old
news for now my allegiance is nowhere
alright so you can trust I'm looking at
this as objectively as a human possibly
can
and I'm going to let you know the
verdict this kind of stuff first party
accessory they have the potential to
improve your relationship with a gadget
and I don't care who you are I don't
care where are you from once you try
wireless charger just like that's magic
let's get this leather ish you can just
charge like this BAM or look at that and
then the up the slide in the up and now
your docking well you know I don't want
everybody staring at my I don't want
Jack you know peering into the the
private life you catch him just taking a
peek in there don't you
guess what Jack mind your own business
mind your own business for once why
don't you alright look it's a switching
video I can't give you the whole
breakdown right now because of being
honest immediate enhancements are
getting a headphone jack back I'm
getting a better display I know that to
be true wireless charging is back let's
see what happens I have officially
switched to the s9 plus prepare for
fireworks today's episode of unbox the P
is brought to you by up C up C this is a
new service a new take on the whole
warranty shenanigans that exist at your
local retailer when you buy a new device
like this one I told you that I just
went to Best Buy and I picked up this s
9 plus with my hard-earned cash and he
tried to hit me with the warranty
alright now we're all well aware that
those sales pitches are so aggressive
because the margins on those warranty
sales are high and that's where up C
comes in they got a new take a more
affordable warranty even for a brand-new
expensive phone like the one in front of
it you can get a 2 year warranty with up
seat on the s9 for 79 bucks
$79.99 ur right now doesn't end there
because they make it easier to make
actual claims this is one of the
downsides with those warranties when you
go to make a claim there like could you
cross your T's did you dot the i's do
you have the original car where's the
original receipt a photocopies not gonna
do
I'm trust me they don't make it up see
makes that easier if I allow you to just
take a photo of your item and add it to
your inventory and that's it you're gold
from that point forward that particular
device is protected but you can also
give warranties for like TVs and various
other gadget and they all live in a nice
little interface so you can see what's
covered and what's not up see gives you
up to 45 days to add protection to your
purchase if you bought a new phone
recently you can still add to it just
make sure it's within 45 days I want you
to head over to up see calm and use code
