bastard not 100% sure it's a handmade
bamboo sound amplifier now this falls
into that category of phone amplifiers
that don't need to be plugged into the
wall instead they're using strictly
acoustic amplification I have thought
these things are pretty cool for a while
not sure how much it's going to amplify
sound but I'm looking for something
where I can just quickly drop my phone
in move it around from desk to desk
maybe even just amplify the speakerphone
on a phone call for example so this one
does that and I think it looks pretty
good it's made out of bamboo you know I
like bamboo so there's a picture of the
side dock and play that is a pretty
straightforward package whoo pretty
sleek this is a giant package of silica
gel for Jack there you go buddy
it comes in a couple of different colors
this is kind of the classic bamboo look
it also comes in some darker finishes as
well now that is that is very nice I
mean it looks like it's carved out of a
chunk of a stock of bamboo maybe it is
on the side here engraved loud bastard
based hard now because the slot here is
so big it doesn't really matter what
your device is I mean for example here's
an s7 with a battery case on it and that
goes in there here's a regular iPhone
6's I'm not really sure if you want to
kind of have it that way that way or
slid down now there's all kinds of like
professional versions of this as well as
like its DIY versions you'll even see
some people turning beer cups into
acoustic amplifiers or some people just
on your bedside table have like a glass
that they drop their phone in and then
that helps to amplify it as well
essentially you're looking at an
acoustic amplification technique this
stuff is super old fashioned and been
around for a while but anyhow this is
just on an iPhone
hi phone 6s as you know speaker is on
the bottom
that's your volume you're working with
so not very much now let's see what
happens when we drop it in here
so it gives it a little bit a little bit
more low-end again let's do a comparison
here without and then with so it not
only kind of amplifies it a bit but it
also gives it a bit of a thicker tone as
well for the sake of it I'll do it on
the s7 here as well now into the device
here now I would say works even better
on this one it's not going to replace
like a Bluetooth speaker for example but
it's kind of like a nice little I don't
know design piece aesthetically it might
be pleasing to you it's really easy to
move it around and it's kind of just a
place to stick your phone anyway so I
could see people just having it in their
kitchen and just kind of dropping their
phone in there and then boom it's it's a
little bit louder it's not going to take
your music a stadium level but it is
certainly going to do the job of
slightly amplifying what you're getting
out of your smartphone speaker without
the need to plug anything in and with it
I don't know a kind of aesthetically
pleasing look to it they're not too
pricey check them out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
