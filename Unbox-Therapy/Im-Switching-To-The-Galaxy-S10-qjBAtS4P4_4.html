switch up the smartphone I'm all pumped
up I'm all excited by the latest from
Samsung now you know I've been on the
oneplus sixty good experience I'll tell
you a little bit more about it before I
jump into it I do have to give a shout
out to the new clothing sponsor look at
me I like simple stuff all right no
logos from a company called built you
probably knows me wearing the material
it's beautiful I'm gonna have a link in
the description you need to go check
these guys out there's also a discount
like a serious discount just for unbox
therapy viewers so read the description
click the link get some new threads keep
it simple keep it basic so what about
the 1 + 6 T the McLaren Edition yes very
quick it had the rapid charge honestly
no real complaints kind of what I
expected it to be didn't miss a beat but
as is the case you can't be on top you
can't be the most exciting for very long
there's always some new thing coming out
and the hot thing right now is over here
the Galaxy S 10 look at the colour a
little rainbow effect depending on the
angle oh so exciting with the extra lens
on the back the new high-tech
fingerprint scanner which I mean it's
just a tap it's actually just a tap you
see where this one is really better it's
kind of like how I mentioned in the
previous video is when you have
something on your hands if you have
dirty hands wet hands and so on this one
can work a little bit better it's
probably a little more secure as well I
want to test that out wireless charging
I get wireless charging back that's the
one thing I missed on the oneplus and
surprising I read an article about how
oneplus is is still not gonna put
wireless charging into the oneplus 7 I'm
like I get it you're trying to make a
point they're very fast charging but I
just I can't get with that I feel like
it's a feature I just want to have I
don't want to I don't want to Russell
you know I got a headphone jack on here
very exciting of course a display just
ridiculous we got the new UI I can't
wait to use on the day-to-day basis
nevermind my hole punch hidden by the
built-in wallpaper on purpose
now I deliberated a little bit I was
like should it be the s10 should it be
ten plus or should it even be the s10 II
for whatever reason this one was
speaking to me the most so that's where
I want the sim card to go then when it
comes to the e which I actually have it
over here slightly different form factor
the fingerprint scanner over on the side
and then the lower price point I may
still switch to this one taking a slight
dip down in price point are you giving
up a lot so maybe I'll switch to the e
after I should close it out real quick
and just say oneplus keeps doing it to
be honest
you look at the package what they're
able to deliver further price the speed
the snappiness with the animation cut
down some of the tweaks that actually
improve your experience this is just an
easy product for me to recommend how
long have I use this for will he do
could we get a readout a month I could
totally live my life in the oneplus
universe though I will say the price of
the oneplus devices it keeps going up a
bit too so things are starting to merge
now it's almost starting to overlap it's
time for the ritual the sim card is
coming out and it's going in to the
latest from Samsung it's the s10 the
latest the greatest man it feels slender
it's light its slender you feel right at
home don't you all right there you have
it ladies and gentlemen
sim card is in you see the little icon
right there it's been a good run mr.
oneplus now it's time to die until next
time
Samsung for the wind
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
