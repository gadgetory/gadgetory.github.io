of a development turns out a bit of a
fiasco I was over on the verge reading
about Huawei and apparently they got
caught faking some photos in a recent
commercial I don't know where this
commercial aired but nonetheless a
commercial in which they make it seem
like the photos within the commercial
are being shot by their device which is
in this case the Nova 3 smartphone when
in reality those photos were actually
shot with the DSLR in defense of Huawei
here at no point in the commercial did
they say that the photos within it were
taken with the smartphone now you have
seen smartphone commercials in the past
where certain brands do say that that's
not the case with this one here but
nonetheless people are upset the whole
thing started on reddit that's because
of how people found out that these shots
were faked the actress in the video she
shared some behind-the-scenes photos of
some of the selfies that took place in
the original video you see the guy he's
got an empty hand he's just got an empty
hand out here but at the same time he's
making it look like he took the photo
that it's a selfie that's being taken I
feel bad for the actress she was just
trying to say look it's this fun shoot
she's probably not a smartphone
enthusiast herself in which case she
would realize how much this matters to
the super nerds out there that want to
see the actual frame from the camera and
the crazy part about this fiasco is that
these devices these new Huawei devices
are producing some of the best images of
all smartphones on the market right now
so even more so you want to see the
actual results now I have to say I
wasn't that surprised when I read this
article I've had experience in these
types of environments in these
production environments while it lands
in inside of Huawei's responsibilities
it may have more to do with the
production staff saying oh I just want
to get let me use my DSLR I'm gonna want
to get all the resolution I got to
modify it later I got a color correct to
match maybe not even clearing it in
advance with the brand you might say loo
you're defending the brand year
ultimately the brand has to make the
final call and of course they're the
ones receiving the criticism
now especially since in the past they
kind of got caught up in a couple of
other circumstances in which people were
skeptical about certain images that
popped up now you know I'm currently
using a huawei device the p20 Pro and
one of the reasons I'm using it is to
test out the new camera tech the
triple-n system the crazy night photos
and I can tell you that that camera is
incredible it's making a case for the
best camera on a smartphone so what
happens through situations like this is
people start to get skeptical when they
really shouldn't even be because the
hardware speaks for itself when you get
it into your hand therefore there was no
reason to fake it in the first place
obviously you can go watch the original
video I'll link the original video it's
still on YouTube it's still live at this
moment so you can distinguish for
yourself if you find it to be
particularly offensive but this kind of
stuff happens in commercial shoots in
general this is the reason we don't
trust advertising we don't look at a
commercial and say that must be true the
reason people gravitate towards content
like this on YouTube looking for the
truth because these types of tricks are
actually pretty commonplace in
commercial behavior you know turn a
little knob this way flick a little
switch that way I'm telling you from
personal experience so what does this do
what should this do this should
reinforce that you should look for
alternative opinions that you should
reserve your judgment and you should
look for real people that are testing
this stuff out the real shame here is
that the cameras on the recent Huawei
stuff they're great the reason that
matters coming for me is because I'm
accountable to you if I tell you a lie
about something you're gonna come back
and say but I don't trust loo anymore
I'm not gonna watch Lou anymore so stop
assuming that commercials are completely
truthful many different brands get
caught up in weird stuff like this
sometimes someone gets a little extra
motivated they get the tripod out it's
like no we should do it this way now and
then it's a power struggle and so on so
maybe all right it's possible you can't
place all the blame strictly on the
brand here you guys know the truth in
general these brands should just be
sending sending the devices here to the
truth zone you tell me down in the
comments when you watch that commercial
at any point did you even think that
those frames came from the smartphone
because I was skeptical from the minute
I clicked the play and I think I would
have been even if I hadn't read this
whole article and checked out the reddit
post and looked at their behind the
scenes images anyways you let me know
go watch the original links in the
description it's more the same guys
