situations raised a bunch of money on
Kickstarter it's a completely different
type of headphone from anything I've
ever tried before the V share vai share
I think it's V share the main thing here
is this really unusual design that
allows it to sit on the side of your
head differently than any ear cup before
using 3d printed components it's got a
really unusual look what does it say
doesn't tell you much on a box if you
watch the Kickstarter video they claim
this is like the most comfortable
headphone ever let's find out if they're
telling the truth you all right inside
the box we have the second box in the
box no accessories these are the little
contraptions I was telling you about
clip-on to the ear cup and then sort of
like oh maybe kind of like this we'll
find out you're gonna catch some looks
that's for sure if you're rocking these
headphones be able to hear your
surroundings a little bit so you don't
feel so confined if someone approaches
you you might want to feel their
presence as opposed to later
I know some of you probably like men I
don't want to hear anybody so they've
included separate ear cups for a closed
design as well these are more
traditional looking will close around
your ear and create a more isolating
experience when you want to shut the
world off so these are open and closed
back designs now they are wireless as
well micro USB to charge up and a mini
jack cable if you want to use a wired
connection and then now these also have
another feature which is the ability to
broadcast the signal that's playing on
here two other headphones similar to
that headphone that Tom and I tried
recently in which you could share a
single Bluetooth source with multiple
headset who'd have a lot to it it seems
huge whoa that's a statement right there
it's got a very padded headband here
there's an on and off switch over here
the ear cups themselves are actually
pretty slim micro USB down here to
charge them up plus/minus for volume and
then you can select between the various
sources here depending on where your
audio is coming from an extra set of ear
pads alright let me just check the quick
start real quick check the quick start
quick and see how that Jack are you
awake are you still are you alive over
there Jack's been surviving off of the
cake that LG sent us for the last three
days did they inject it with all the
necessary nutrients to keep a man like
Jack active there is he's dead all right
we can't talk about that you all know we
have to do the jack reveal at 10 million
subscribers so he can't die yet did I
say 10 million or did I need a hundred
hmm just tell like five or six friends
if every single one of you tells a
friend to subscribe I don't know maybe
we'll be at 10 million immediately what
a letdown it's gonna be hey Wang Wang
attach the air frames here we go look at
that pull pull pull
that's a strange look right there jack
if that's your goal you're turning heads
that's for sure
I completely still hear my surroundings
obviously it's a little odd at first
there's really no pressure point or
anything like that they're just kind of
there what does that look like Jack can
you get a good view of it there or maybe
that's what these pads are for they can
go on these one
all right padding oh yeah yeah the
padding is a must so there is an app
slide the power switch to on okay on
that he's powered up right now no you
think these are dead alright so it's
been an evening now left them in the
studio charging so I have the app
downloaded as well so I'll just power
them up and they have lights and the
jack can you see those lights in there
yeah there it is
bye okay so we haven't equalizer we can
kind of tune our sound a little bit here
let's go with open medium here's the
moment of truth let's see what this is
all about is this the real deal is this
a gimmick I know it is such a weird Tom
look at these headphones go shake your
head at me play some mellow jazz
vitamins well then right now you hear
nothing come a little bit closer
oh this is a kind of a different
experience right now some a little more
modern this probably has volume on it as
well oh there we go
you hear that now they're gonna bleed
out if you want to listen loud
especially to certain types of music the
sound is bleeding all right not like a
closed back headphone not that you would
expect it to with any kind of open back
design you lose a little bit in the
low-end the kind of kind of pump as my
world been altered by this unusual
design no not not really we've still got
the clothes back ear cup so these are
kind of modular I should do one in one
they're closed back open back you see
that let's try this now I can tell right
away before I even play music this year
and here it's isolated Oh
you probably already knew this but if
you're listening to hip-hop you you want
to close back headphone for the most
part because you're looking for the
punch you're gonna get punched in the
face figuratively of course unless
you're Jack in the bedroom he's into
some weird stuff you plays a camera
after all or at least that's what you
guys tell me so now you play the theme
to the Twilight I would rather have
these ear cups but then well then why is
that different than other headphones but
what can I say I've listened to
open-back headphones that are a lot
better than these but even then these
headphones aren't incredibly cheap so it
gets weird but the weird thing here is
that the whole package and experience it
comes out feeling a little bit cheap to
be honest it's an innovative approach I
like modular stuff they're not a gimmick
but the hype is probably not real on
these the hype train has halted and I'm
the conductor the height is real maybe
it's not either way I'm here to let you
know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
