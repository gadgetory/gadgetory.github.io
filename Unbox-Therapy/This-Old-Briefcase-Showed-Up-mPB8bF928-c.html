therapy headquarters
tell me everything headphones phones it
all gets covered you it all gets sent
here but here's the thing every so often
something it sneaks it flies under the
radar it finds a shelf or a hook a
cranny
what's a cranny Jack I don't it's like a
nook
it's a nook is a cranny like enough I'm
not gonna cranny and maybe it doesn't
end up on the show immediately but you
bump into it again and you're like oh
right that thing was kind of cool and so
today's one of those days I bumped into
this product looking around downstairs
at the studio and I was like right this
thing basically a suitcase it came from
a guy another youtuber guy named Shaun
Hogan he was really amped up about
building these very unique one-of-a-kind
speakers I'll just I'm just gonna say it
it's a speaker there's a speaker inside
the suitcase and inside this suitcase is
another suitcase which has been turned
into a speaker Sean this guy who sent
this over on his channel you can cease
doing all kinds of different DIY things
you should go check out his youtube
channel I'll link it down below because
I took so long to get to this I was
looking up his project specifically this
one here the retro blue it turns out the
project is no longer active but I
figured it was gonna be worthwhile it's
better now than ever because this guy
you put a lot of effort into this thing
and maybe we can convince Sean to get
back in the business who knows you know
this briefcase here is just the shipping
container whoo how nice is that on its
own Hey
oh that's in every one of your favorite
movies right there when the briefcase
opens who knows what's inside it's a
it's a pulp fiction moment I think I
give Pulp Fiction Quentin Tarantino some
credit for the existence of unbox there
because the moment that I witnessed the
glowing briefcase I was like right I
connected the dots yeah here we have and
here we go this is a legit retro
briefcase readme enclosed as a
handcrafted Bluetooth suitcase speaker
personally made by me it may rattle at
high volumes buzz from certain
frequencies and though it isn't the best
looking suitcase in the world it has a
great amount of something that most
consumer electronics lack character and
you know what I want to take this moment
right here to just send some love to the
character that is Shaun Hogan to begin
with so this is basically a prototype
that he sent over he says it's a five
out of ten in terms of sound he was
hoping to eventually do a Kickstarter on
this and get to something that he was
more happy with but this was meant to
kind of illustrate how he envisioned
these retro looking speakers to be oh my
retro blue made in the USA it's wireless
as a Bluetooth in it go out and have a
blast take it to a party he says that it
lasts up to 24 hours on a single charge
that's cool would you check that out
that's like it's like a relic from the
past he's got these speaker units
built-in I'm assuming he hid it you
could see how he had to make these
cutouts this was an actual suitcase just
a suitcase there's an on/off switch very
old-school toggle there ooh and mega
satisfying it still has juice whoa whoa
I do like that the cord also has a kind
of retro look to it I mean for a DIY the
mean I might be inspired here and let's
see maybe it goes into discovery mode
immediately oh there it is retro blue
0:02 now I assume for volume controls
you're just using
home
I think what Sean said himself is
completely true in this case this is not
the loudest most polished Bluetooth
speaker that's ever been on this table
or in this studio but what it doesn't
have there it certainly makes up for in
character and impersonal touch effect in
its it's been crafted by one person you
know they mean their vision happening
right here so I got to give a lot of
respect him for that for the creativity
associated with it had he had time and
had the Kickstarter done successfully
and maybe if an unbox therapy video had
to come out earlier the outcome could be
different but that's why I want to
encourage you guys to head over to his
YouTube channel and just give him some
some positive support send some love his
way maybe encourage him to get back into
the game maybe you could just make one
offs for people I don't know but he's
obviously talented when it comes to the
craftsmanship so shout out to him for
sending this over and I apologize for
taking so long to get to it there you
have it you never knew it but you could
DIY your very own suitcase Bluetooth
speaker the proof is in the pudding</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
