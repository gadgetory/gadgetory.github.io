another video and today it's a
comparison I've got the entire family of
galaxy s6 in front of me I've got the
whole galaxy this is the edge this is
the standard s6 and over here I have the
new s6 active and I'm pumped for this
device for a couple of reasons I started
out attempting to use the s6 edge as my
daily driver there were a couple things
that were bothering me with it it's not
the most comfortable device in the world
to hold oh my phone is so slender the
edge is so sleek eventually what happens
is you're just sitting there trying to
use it maybe your finger will creep over
the edge inadvertently tap the screen
trigger the haptic feedback so on and so
forth it's just not the most comfortable
or fought out device in my opinion
there's just not enough plus when it
comes to having this glass wrap around
the sides so I moved over to the
standard s6 which is in the center here
that was a lot better it's a lot comfier
to hold sitting back on the couch lying
in bed so on and so forth I wasn't
having those inadvertent clicks and now
I had a solid place to rest my
fingertips these fingertips I just said
fingertips
trying to make videos here god damn it
but that said not everything was perfect
in galaxy land this thing is barely
getting through a day of usage I'm
playing with phones I like phones I'm on
Twitter it comes to like I don't know
seven eight o'clock at night and it
wants to be plugged in it's a
consequence of having a very sleek in
glass looking phone fine so be it but
the s6 active improves the battery life
significantly what do we have here 3,000
is it 3,500 milliamp hours of power
that's a thousand more roughly a
thousand more than the standard s6 and
as you can see the form factors not all
that different it's also waterproof it's
rugged it's more damn manly if you look
at it military spec ip68 1.5 meters of
water for 30 minutes we're probably
going to test that in an upcoming video
because that's fun so you're getting a
more rugged device and a bigger battery
power users are probably gonna be happy
about that but you're getting some other
things too you've got a SIM tray that
you can remove with your fingertip
instead of a sim tool I'm changing
phones all the time and having to search
for those little sim tools just pushes
me over the edge every so often also you
have a really big tactile and grippy
buttons you have a grippy foam when you
hold on to that you know you've got it
you can do like we've done here you can
put some skins on your devices to make
them a little bit more grippy these are
from D brand of course link in the
description if you want to check it out
with this device you've got that nice
rubberized confident manly grip other
specs you're dealing with essentially
the same device as the standard s6 and
that's a good thing you've still got
that great camera a really quick
processor so it's snappy you're not
gonna have to sit around and wait now
there's one more difference on the s6
active and it's one of my favorite
features as well you have this little
button here they call it the active
button that button is yours it's yours
to own in love you can do whatever you
want with it it could be an app it could
be a webpage buttons are good I love
buttons physical buttons on the front
that carries around too
you have physical buttons for
multitasking home and FAC now not
everything is fine and dandy on the s6
active side though you're going to take
a bit of a hit when it comes to the
speaker it's on the back of the device
so if it's on a tabletop or even if
you're holding it it's going in the
opposite direction of your ears that's
never optimal you're also giving up one
other thing the fingerprint sensor this
fingerprint sensor is a leap in the
right direction for Samsung from the
previous version but it's still not
seamless there would be times where it
would miss every so often not having the
fingerprint sensor on active was not
such a huge deal to me the s6 active
answers the the questions that I had
about the other devices the things that
I was a little bit lukewarm about it
pretty much conquers those this is a
confident device something that I think
is going to be really comfortable in my
pocket form factor that you're looking
at is the form factor you're gonna get
essentially wearing a very slim case
around the regular design as you can
tell I'm pumped up about this thing I'm
making the switch this is going to be in
my pocket the active is not gonna be
available to everybody unfortunately
it's an ATT exclusive so I've sat here
and said all these things that I like
about it and you might not even be able
to buy it I really wish that this device
was more available maybe if we make
enough noise maybe if this video is
popular enough maybe Samsung is going to
make some alterations I know a lot of
you would love to have this device on
your network this is a beauty so there
you have it the s6 active compared with
the standard s6 and the s6 edge I hope
