you might like me be interested in a bag
of chips here and there on the rare
occasion when you're not eating kale do
I look like the kind of guy that needs
but there's a problem with snacks
specifically snacks to come in bags you
might not finish the whole bag although
you might be tempted your conscience
might kick in and say hey you chill out
on a chip she's gonna be 5 on a pound
then you become one of those TLC TV
shows that's how it goes right well
here's the problem how do you keep them
fresh how do you keep them fresh how
about this the Eco sealer this baby will
reseal any bag now maybe it's not chips
maybe you're more of a popcorn guy God
knows what you like to snack on this
thing will seal that bag back up so when
you're done you're done and then you
crack it back open stays fresh how does
it work the magnetic strip on its base
will let you attach it to a fridge
freezer or microwave unbelievable so
it's always nearby let's crack this open
eat some chips and find out if it's the
real deal user guide press down and
preheat for 3 seconds then aligned
across to seal it what is this whoa a
nice little flat micro USB charge cable
goes right in there like that there's a
magnet here that even metal that
interesting ok now I'm really feeling
like I might need to read this manual is
there a power switch on here does it
just start going I'm gonna burn myself
I'm gonna get burned here aren't I well
hey listen that's what unbox therapy is
for I burned myself so you don't have to
the only thing is does this hmm Wow
goes up to 150 degrees Celsius in 3
seconds ok so yes I will likely burn
myself today all right so I've fully
charged this guy up I've got some chips
here Miss Piggy's need i say more
i let me a quick taste test
very addictive so how do you shut it
down time to get back to fitness mode
time to get back to kale shakes or if
you like Jack you do the body pump the
hot yoga the the hip-hop dance class so
you've got a bag here it's open you can
see what you want to do is keep it nice
and flat like this grab your guy here
lift it up go from the lock position to
the seal position hold it down 1 2 3 and
start to move it across like so and this
thing is so hot it moves right through
the surface of the bag look at that is
that look it you see that jerk that's
airtight it's melted together as if as
if it was the first time and now look my
miss Vicky's are ready for round 2
miss Vicky's you're not a sponsor yet
give me a call that is look at this
that's a game changer can I open it up
just like a regular chip bag yes I can
maybe you have um some candy swedish
berries sour patch kids any of these
things that come in a bag what
everything comes in a bag so forget
about buying zip locks extra zip locks
save the planet while you're at it Jack
can keep his grimy paws out of there
like jack is it sealed Jack leave alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
