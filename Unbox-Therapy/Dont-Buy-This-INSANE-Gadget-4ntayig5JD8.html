for this you need to blame Willy do aka
hilly whoo this thing here I mean you
can tell from the presentation very
sketchy but I inspected what was in this
bag and I was like man that is so crazy
that might just be crazy enough for me
so let me show you what I'm talking
about oh my goodness
a little muzzle there it's called blocks
Vox this strap and these earbuds now
this thing is crazy it's bananas it's
wild what you do with this thing is you
strap it on your face and you supposedly
you have a private conversation in
public so that the people around you
can't hear what you're saying while
you're talking into your headset so this
is what you're gonna look like something
like this
you can play nearly right now I assumed
you could still hear me wait muffled a
little bit I don't really of course the
tighter that you put it on man you
really gotta breathe through your nose
yeah I'm gonna choked out the tighter
you put it on the quieter you're gonna
sound okay the quads the tighter you put
this on the quieter that you will sound
now I get it this goes over your mouth
this thing straps on to hold it there
but then how are you talking there's no
microphone in here right there's a
little mesh area over on the side right
there it's the size of your microphone
piece on a generic straightforward
headset like this one there's a little
slit on the outside and this inserts
into there like that so now you have
access to the mic and then this goes up
into your ear I'm gonna talk to will I'm
gonna try to talk to will I'm gonna try
to call will through this and we're
gonna listen to what it sounds like he
didn't tell us if it makes any sense or
if this is the most ridiculous big to
ever come through unbox therapy HQ
you're gonna look a little bit insane
obviously wearing this in public Jack
you can't pull it off but guy like you
oh man oh my goodness
is already it's feeling really bad right
now tighten this up a bit here can
anyone hear me right now you guys can
hear me right now oh man this is
uncomfortable it's just weird can you
still hear me right now
keep down what if I'm this volume right
here very mentally can say okay well get
over here we need you brother who's not
comfortable oh my this is wrong are you
sound good you sound pretty clear yeah I
mean it's not bad I can probably hear
you there's no muffling there yeah it's
it's a bit weird though because I can
hear you clearly hear of what you're you
know here it's like a low-end situation
what's that
I mean it does work no no this is this
is what you did see I think the truth
about this is that wills trying to
muzzle me and hearing my crotchety old
tones yeah sometimes well that's rude
first of all tell the people the truth
it's a little ridiculous looking tried
on here you go her oh yeah no try it on
I don't care you take it off take it all
in oh that's your whole story right
there it's really slick this is not
possible
this is not a thing do you want to see a
future in which people are walking
around is on there no no it kind of
works if you want to mumble yeah it is
what it is I guess I mean you're shaking
ahead should people go and buy this
thing yes or no will oh man yup of the
others but no I would say no exactly you
roll up into the Starbucks with this
they're seriously gonna wonder what
you're about even if this thing worked
perfectly just the appearance of it
alone it's so catastrophic yeah so
offensive yeah that it cannot possibly
exist you wouldn't you would need to
have a private conversation so badly in
a public place to justify ever reaching
for this thing this is a disaster I mean
we're cyborgs the whole strap is uh very
this is gonna be forever associated with
Willie do you happy but is your identity
brown Willie do well yes he believes
this is the future he put this thing in
front of me he ruined my day and also
ruined yours all right so there it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
