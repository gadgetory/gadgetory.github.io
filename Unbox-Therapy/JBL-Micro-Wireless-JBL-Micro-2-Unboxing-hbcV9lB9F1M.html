therapy and today we're taking a look at
two products from JBL on the left-hand
side we have the micro wireless and over
on the right is the micro 2 and while
they look pretty similar there is a
significant difference and it lies in
that name Wireless that's because this
wireless model features bluetooth
streaming so you can take your
smartphone or any device that's enabled
with Bluetooth and stream audio to the
speaker the micro 2 on the other hand
requires that you use a mini Jack
connector 3.5 Milka nectar which pretty
much every audio device has but it's
wireless as well in the sense that you
don't need to be tethered to the wall
both of these devices feature
rechargeable batteries with up to 5
hours of playback and also a surprising
amount of bass for this form factor this
is an incredibly small speaker that will
fit in your pocket now if you guys
missed out on my last JBL on box I took
a look at a slightly bigger speaker from
them which is called the flip I'll
probably link it down in the description
so you can go check that out these are
more affordable solutions if you're
looking for portable audio for your
device if you guys want to find out
pricing and availability on these two
models those links are down in the
description as well so besides the
speaker you're also going to find a
couple of accessories in the box the
first is a soft touch carrying case with
a drawstring on the top this can be used
to store the device and also to take it
with you when you're traveling it'll
keep it free from dust etc next we have
a micro USB cable which will be used to
charge the device as I said earlier it
will last for up to five hours once it's
fully charged now I do like the fact
that it uses a micro USB cable rather
than something proprietary meaning if
you lose this cable forget to bring it
with you when you travel you will have
other means to charge it because micro
USB cables are pretty cheap and pretty
ubiquitous and I already carry a bunch
with me because that's how I charge my
phone etc taking a closer look at the
device you can really start to
appreciate just how portable it is this
thing will easily fit into a jacket or
sweater pocket you have a power button
as well as a volume wheel for of course
controlling volume and on the other side
you'll notice a mini Jack connector
that's because you can daisy chain this
device to other speakers to improve the
volume of that sacktual e pretty cool
well there's also a microUSB port as I
mentioned earlier that's going to be
used to charge the internal battery
which will last up to five hours and a
very cool design feature is this cable
that's built in and wraps around the
outside so if your device doesn't use or
feature bluetooth you can use a
traditional 3.5 milk cable and since its
built-in it's always with you so you can
interface with all kinds of devices even
if it's unexpected
it all fits in very nicely and the
device still fits flat on top of the
table with that cable wrapped around so
a very cool design actually now moving
along to the micro 2 I'm not going to go
into an incredible amount of detail here
only because this device is the same as
the micro Wireless - the Bluetooth and
the only other difference is aesthetic
the cable here is orange which I
actually like and so you're still going
to get that 3.5 millimeter cable that
wraps around the outside that awesome
design feature except like I said before
in this case there is no Bluetooth
functionality so you will need to plug a
device in and have the wire running
between the two so let's go ahead and
listen to some music and get a sense for
how this thing sounds
so as you guys can tell you're going to
get a significant amount of bass and
volume in general especially when
considering the form factor here this
thing is portable it's pocketable and it
has an internal battery so you're using
it wirelessly now is that going to blow
the roof off of your party but that's
not really the intention here the main
thing is to improve on that crappy
built-in audio that you've currently got
in your tablet or smartphone if you're
looking for something a little more
powerful check out the description where
I've listed the JBL flip which is a
slightly larger portable audio solution
from JBL you can check out my video on
that and get some more info anyway guys
if you enjoyed this video please
remember to leave a like and favorite
down below as it does help out a bunch
and as always if you're looking for
pricing and availability and anything
that was in this video the description
is your friend that's where all the
links you need are and thanks as always
for watching I'll catch guys on the next
video
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
