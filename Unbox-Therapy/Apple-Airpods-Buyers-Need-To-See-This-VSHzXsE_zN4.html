from East Brooklyn labs these guys
reached out a while ago they had a
product for a pair of headphones I can't
remember was at the ATH em 50s I believe
to turn a wired headphone into a
wireless bluetooth headphone this
accessory this product I think is even a
step better it's an air pod charge case
and it's something I think Apple should
have done themselves from the jump from
the get-go as you might have guessed
this is going to add wireless charging
to your air pods now these are not the
greatest earphones but they are
convenient for certain circumstances
it's a tiny little package and of course
if you are in the Apple ecosystem they
pair up really nicely to any Apple
device they give you you know the nice
little look there are plenty of people
using them and there is top right now of
a next version that Apple is working on
and I hope they take some advice from
this little innovation here in order to
add wireless charging to it because it's
one of the it's one of the slim little
headaches that goes along with this you
just have a standard lightning port on
the bottom there not that there's
anything wrong with that but the idea of
having you know a little wireless charge
pad on the bedside table and just
dropping those on there and there's been
all those delays on Apple's own wireless
charging pad so who knows what's
happening with Apple and wireless
charging in the meantime we have this
product that I want to check out it is
the air pod charge case apparently it's
made out of silicon 2.5 millimeter
silicon case hard plastic inner shell
for extra protection and compatible with
any Qi wireless charger so it's just
kind of a cool little accessory for a
product that I know a lot of people have
I see a lot of air pods out in the wild
so it could be a solution for a lot of
people to keep their ear pods charged up
okay the case itself it does seem like a
protective cover kind of like a silicon
a silicon look at this that's it it's
pretty standard
factory-fresh you don't put the air pods
themselves but you put the whole case
into here okay so you get you're gonna
want to have the wireless charge symbol
on the front of the case and then this
guy's gonna fit like this so you can see
there's a little cutout there so you can
get your fingernail in there and then
that's it pretty nice alright so a
little bit of protection added also you
still have access to the button here I
guess you just drop this on to a
wireless charge pad let's give that a
shot ok cool
from the latest doogee video so we just
dropped this guy on and the blue light
comes on can they see that they can see
that
oh man that's convenient that is super
duper convenient it's better than a
cable it's better than a cable you just
drop it on you'd never even think about
it you just find a little hole for your
air pods and they're always charged a
simple little gadget I thought you guys
should know about it's from East
Brooklyn labs I think if you're an air
pod owner you should definitely check
this out
you can add wireless charging to it how
much is this will 24 bucks it's not bad
either plus maybe a little bit more
stealth if you think about it I don't
know if you're a huge fan of the the
dental-floss look of the air pod case
but now you have a slightly more stealth
appearance I think that's a bit of a
deal possibly even a steal $24.99 are we
gonna drop a link if it's available in
other colors as well black blue pink and
white oh yeah it's just like on the case
is it available on amazon also amazon
holy smokes Willy do you knocked it out
of the park it's a nice little gadget
that's what the people are looking for
that's what they want East Brooklyn Labs
there you have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
