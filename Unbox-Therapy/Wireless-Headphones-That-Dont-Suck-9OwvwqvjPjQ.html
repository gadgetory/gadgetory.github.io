another video but before we get into it
I want to give a quick shout out to
another video that I did on tides
channel they asked me to mess up one of
my favorite garments yes one of my
favorite hoodies I put a couple of
different sauces on there and chocolate
ice cream and the challenge was to see
if they're tide pod product could
actually get those stains out so I could
keep wearing it and looking pretty for
you here on unbox therapy so go check
out the video there's a link in the
description probably an annotation as
well show some unbox therapy love for
tide because everybody needs to have
some clean clothes get yourself cleaned
up a little bit easier for mr. Jack
isn't it isn't it what's up guys Lew
here back with another video and today
we've got some headphones you guys know
that I love headphones these ones are
special they've been looking for so long
for the perfect set of wireless
headphones to have at my desk for
convenience bars wireless headphones go
these are some of the best that exists
as far as I know because they use
uncompressed wireless digital frequency
response transmission that sounds pretty
complicated there's no compression
that's applied to the sound like in
bluetooth it's using its own RF
frequency so essentially the idea here
is the highest quality sound without
wires it also has this really cool base
station that charges the headphones
giving them up to 18 hours of battery
life these are one of the reasons that
I've been holding off on episode 3 of my
desk tour because I wanted to make sure
these got on that desk before I did it
they're not cheap then again a lot of
things here on unbox therapy aren't but
as many things in life follow this rule
you get what you pay for right right
Jack alright pop these babies open
accessories the actual RS 185
oh yes nice and light
surprisingly light when it comes to fit
on a pair of headphones it's as
important in my opinion is sound
where's my phone going off hello hey I'm
in the middle of making a video like
actually recording right now you I think
you just made it in the video yeah yeah
you're a big star now okay say hi to the
world real quick I'm gonna put you on
speaker really you do okay but this is
the base station this can sit on your
desk look at that essentially act not
only as a charging stand but a stand for
your headphone so here we can display
them charge them at the same time as
well as have all of our controls so we
have volume on the front a level button
for alc or MLC and then at the top there
is a battery indicator on the back here
is all of your i/o you have a digital
optical in so yes this can take a
digital signal and then you have an
analog one if you're going low-tech
old-school not that there's a problem
with that and then a power as well and
here is your selector for whichever
audio input you're using on the top is
the charging section those little pins
will charge up your headphones and that
pretty much rounds out the transmitter
the accessories some paperwork when I
was young I used to go to bed with the
manuals from the latest gadgets that I
had purchased and when I say go to bed I
mean go to bed okay think about that a
bunch of powered app there's North
America Europe
somebody told me what this one was
recently New Zealand Australia
AJ perfect booyah
ready for power so here we have an RCA
style cable for an analogue input an
optical cable for digital audio and
batteries so there's a couple of little
tabs here telling me to twist the ear
pad and that exposes the battery section
one battery two batteries Vellore style
or microfiber style ear cups super comfy
for me they don't get as hot on the side
here is where you're going to
control everything here you can see you
can control level left and right and
volume as well now these are an open
back style Sennheiser does make closed
back wireless headphones as well okay so
now I have these hooked up to an audio
source you're probably going to have
these in an entertainment unit or hooked
up to your computer permanently now I
noticed a couple things on the front
here this level button controls the ALC
or MLC so that's the automatic level
control or manual then you have a knob
here for controlling the input level so
let's go ahead and start up some music
so you don't want to overload this
manual control so if I go to automatic
level control so it sort of finds the
right level and then I suppose you're
going to control the volume here on the
headphones so the the ALC is working
perfectly right now it's not clipping at
all as you can tell
sound is bleeding here like crazy but
that's the intent with an open back
design if you're concerned with like
disturbing people in your directive
vicinity if people are sitting in the
same room as you like in an office type
environment that might be an issue but
if you're in an office where people
can't get down with instrumentals like
this you probably don't want to be there
anyways I'm going to turn it up now so
if you overload the manual control
you'll actually get a red light
indicator so that's really cool so you
can kind of fine tune it okay so we're
working with plenty of volume there
plenty you can really blast these things
if you want to I'm gonna go ahead and
try them with a number of different
sources and if you guys have any more
questions about them I will be using
them on the daily so hit me up on
Twitter I'm at unbox therapy you can ask
me questions there so far very comfy and
the sound is well impressive once again
if you're interested in pricing and
availability the links will be down in
the description these are about to find
a new home on my desk and they gonna
look pretty damn pretty over there if
you enjoyed this content make sure to
leave a thumbs up down below thanks as
always for watching and I'll catch you
on the next episode later you're
probably so cool that you listen to
bands that don't even exist yet
that's as cool as it gets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
