another video and today it's all about
the Galaxy Note 4 which I've been using
for about a week actually a little bit
more running it through various tests
testing the battery life the camera
performance I did an unboxing video as
well as a 4k camera test you should go
check out those videos if you're
interested in this device but I've been
receiving a huge number of requests
possibly from Apple fanboys suggesting
that I've been unfair in been testing
the iPhone 6 plus but not doing the note
4 yet and there are some questions and
concerns with this device even though it
looks durable at first glance you have a
brand new metallic exterior that you
didn't have on the note 3 now the note 3
on the other hand has this internal
chassis with a plastic exterior and it
did incredibly well in my bend test you
can go check out that video through a
link in the description it's one of the
toughest devices that Consumer Reports
tested as well holding a hundred and
fifty pounds of force before completely
giving in whereas the iPhone 6 for
example is less than half that at 70
pounds of force so a very durable device
from that perspective but can Samsung
keep it up with their latest the Galaxy
Note 4 let's go ahead and do this test
but before I do that I do want to
mention that of course don't do this
yourself do not attempt this at home
that is not smart and on top of that
this is by no means the critical test to
determine a phones durability it is a
benchmark it's just showing you that
under the force of my hands these things
are capable of bending or not and for
the people we're going to go crazy
suggesting that all phones will Bend
that is also not the case I have another
link in the description to a much larger
selection of devices that were all bent
in one video or attempted to be bent so
yes there's a benchmark it's up here the
note 3 is at the top of it with a
hundred and 50 pounds of force and let's
find out where the new Note 4 fits into
that scale through once again the power
the pressure of the
hands right here
all right so there you have it the note
4 does bend a little bit and funny
enough it's in the exact same spot as
the 6 plus it's nowhere near as severe I
have a tiny little warp here and I had
to put a lot of pressure into it to
achieve that but still at that same
amount of pressure the note 3 was
completely fine now this tiny little
warp might be able to be fixed just by
bending it back let me go ahead and try
that right now do it live so yeah you
can basically bend it back I think yeah
so there you go I guess in this
particular case whatever material
they're using is a little bit more
robust or maybe it's an internal frame
holding it together could be the battery
it will Bend but not nearly as severely
as the 6 plus so can you bend any phone
yes of course at a certain amount of
pressure every phone will Bend the
question here is how easily and how
often and of course time will tell as
people use these devices for more
extended periods the purpose of these
tests for all of you haters is to put
these phones in an extreme condition for
obvious reasons I can't test these
things for six months and then tell you
what happened in my pocket all I can do
is apply the force with the tools that I
have available to me to give you
potentially some insight into what it
takes to achieve a bend in any of these
phones and as you've seen in my previous
bend test which will be linked down in
the description each phone performs
differently and that's the key
characteristic I am really sick of these
reports coming out saying of course you
idiot why are you bending phones that's
not really the conversation here the
conversation here is why are other
devices engineered to a specification
higher than others why why do that if no
phones ever Bend why can the note 3
withstand 150 pounds of force whereas
other devices are less than half that oh
let me guess they just had extra money
to invest in durability no because every
these perception of what a durable phone
is is different and some manufacturers
have a specification here others have it
here and as we continue to miniaturize
our devices we're going to take hits on
durability so as mentioned before these
been tests are not the be-all and
end-all of durability testing on a phone
they are the far end of the spectrum the
extreme case but I can't possibly
replicate six months a year or two years
of ownership in a quick video or in a
review video that comes out two weeks
after the phone is out so in some
circumstances we have to push the
boundaries because you're going to be
the owner of this device for two years
maybe more and this is a significant
investment for you in some cases close
to $1,000 so I can't see why having
extra information to work with could
possibly be a bad thing so if you
appreciate this testing and me
essentially sacrificing personal devices
to get this info out to you then please
remember to leave a thumbs up down below
and also chill out on the fanboy stuff
in the comments okay this is all
positive information for everyone and if
anything it's going to lead to tougher
devices in the future so there you have
it another bend test video in the books
the note 4 it can be bent not very much
with a lot of force and then it can also
be bent back without any real issue
regarding the integrity at least that's
what I just found out right now alright
guys that wraps this up catch on the
