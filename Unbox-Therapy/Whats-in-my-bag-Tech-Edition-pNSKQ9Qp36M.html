another video and today I'm going to be
giving you a little bit of insight into
what I carry with me or what's in my bag
now obviously this varies depending on
where I'm going or what I'm doing but
what I have in front of me will be
coming with me on my next trip which is
actually happening tomorrow so this is
sort of a basic set up for myself going
to an airport going on an airplane
staying in a hotel
etc and if you guys have been watching
my videos lately you know I built a
contraption a battery contraption
exactly for this purpose so that's in
the setup as well if you haven't seen
that video you should go back and check
it out now obviously this setup will
change depending on what my mission is
and what I'm going to do so if it's a
more elaborate production I'll have more
camera gear like the camera that I'm
speaking into right now or the overhead
camera but since this is a more general
trip I don't have such a need for that
kind of an elaborate setup and this is
more of an everyday kind of carry not
every single day but every day that I'm
traveling that makes any sense so let's
get started with the bag before we talk
about all these different gadgets that
I've set up meticulously this is a
relatively new bag it's from encase and
you may have seen it before I'm not sure
it's been I think it's been around for a
little while but there's two different
versions there's a larger version and
then there's this version and it's a
sling pack which you can access from
your chest which I like so if you're
coming through an airport and you need
to very quickly access some documents or
your sunglasses or a battery charger or
another device etc your headphones it's
right here you can just sling this
around to the front and access it
immediately without the need to sit down
or put any of your gear down now this is
important because generally when you're
going through an airport you have
another luggage that you're taking with
you one of those things on wheels so
without the need to really stop what
you're doing you can get inside here and
get what you need very quickly it has
some compartments for DSLR type gear so
there are some dividers in there once
again if you're taking more elaborate
stuff with you cameras
etc you can go ahead and place those in
there for me it's going to be used for
this gear you see in front of me and
there's a zipper pocket for cables etc
though I don't like to carry too many
cables I find that they make a big mess
a padded strap here which you can clip
off so there's a little clip there and
that's good for when you actually get
onto the airplane you don't have very
much space sometimes
so rather than swing this thing over
your back like a backpack you just
remove the clip and sort of take it off
discreetly the main thing I like about
this too is since it's not huge it means
that I'm forced to pare down what I take
with me which believe it or not is kind
of hard to do when you have so many
different options for gadgets that's
really been my mission with this little
setup right here is to only take the
things I need and nothing extra because
it's those extras that make things
confusing and make it harder to get to
the things that you actually need so a
pretty small bag oh and it also has a
little slot for an 11 inch MacBook Air I
wish that maybe this slot was a little
bigger if you had a larger laptop but I
have an 11 inch MacBook Air so that's
perfect there you have it the in case
sling pack I believe it's the DSLR sling
pack one thing I want to mention right
now guys is since I've accumulated this
stuff over a long period of time I might
not necessarily remember every single
name for every single item so definitely
check out the description down below for
links to all of this stuff where at
least whatever it is that I can find
which I believe should be all of it and
I've made videos on some of it so you
could check those out too if you want
more information on any of these things
so we'll get started over here on the
right hand side this is my 11 inch
MacBook Air fully SPECT out I've been
using this for the last few months
specifically for travel obviously I've
got the Mac Pro for video editing but
I've been surprised that what this thing
can handle I've even edited 4k dual
camera 4k from 2gh 4s when you're
talking about small spaces on airplanes
little tray tables you really can't beat
the 11 inch MacBook Air in the middle
here are some new headphones I'm testing
out these have one of Sony's beautiful
product names MDR 10 RBT
these are wireless now you guys know I'm
a bit of a stickler for audio so
Wireless is a tough sell and since these
are new this will be my first trip
taking them with me and actually testing
them out in a number of different
listening conditions on an airplane etc
but so far I'm liking what I'm hearing
from these and they have an enormous
battery life I believe 17 hours on a
charge and they can of course work as a
wired headphone if you need them to as
well so the idea of travelling through
the airport without wires and keeping
wires out of my bag is something that's
very appealing but this trip will decide
if the sound quality is enough to
convince me to stick with wireless they
are also very lightweight which is
something that I don't feel is talked
about often enough when it comes to
headphones lightweight headphones are
amazing for extended listening sessions
very very comfortable and something to
take into consideration when you're
looking at headphones especially
expensive ones they tend to get heavy my
rabe and pea sunglasses you can see they
have the polarized lens is the little
engraving over there on the right hand
side next up we've got this my money
clip from Gerber which also has a built
in blade if you haven't seen this video
you should go check it out for more
details I did make a video on this
obviously this blade won't be travelling
with me through airport security so I'll
leave that part at home but you can put
your cards put cash in here and it's
very durable very sturdy I'm a big fan
of that money clip slash blade moving
over we have the LG G watch which I'll
be taking with me on this trip you can
see I'm also wearing a G Shock right now
but I'm gonna test out the G watch in a
more extended fashion on this trip and
of course the charging dock which is
magnetic is underneath and that is
plugged in right now to that contraption
I made a couple videos ago that charging
contraption for my iPhone 5s and Nexus 5
I actually made a little modification to
it I trimmed down the case portion I cut
it in half actually on the
recommendation of a commenter and
unfortunately I can't remember the name
of the commenter right now so I can just
slide the device out you see that well
you can see that beautiful slide action
right there so rather than have to peel
the velcro off this is even a little bit
smoother and I can just slide it in when
I want to charge slide it out when I'm
and want to use the device and the Nexus
will likely be in my pocket most of the
time when it's not charging so that's
the reason it's not attached to my
charge station thing anyways as you can
tell it's capable of charging another
device like I said in that video so
right now it's actually charging this
watch as we speak the watch was dead and
all of a sudden now it's charging
something you're going to notice in
between those two devices is this really
short microUSB cable I have a couple of
these huge fan of short little cables
for travel generally when you're
traveling the tangle of cables is more
of an interference than anything else
trying to get headphones little earbuds
out of there or get USB cables etc and
oftentimes you don't actually even need
the extended length because you're right
beside your device or right beside your
charging station etc so I like to carry
these little sort of stiff cables I will
try to find them on Amazon and link them
down in the description but I have a few
of these and I've sort of converted my
entire travel situation to short little
manageable cables instead of those big
huge ones that are destined to get
tangled next up we have one of my newest
cameras this is the WX 350 and it has a
crazy zoom range for a camera with that
form factor 20 times so that's one thing
I kind of dislike about the rx100
is the fact that it doesn't have much
reach now obviously you're giving up
reach for all kinds of other benefits
like better glass a bigger sensor so on
and so forth but when I'm traveling
sometimes especially if I'm shooting
off-the-cuff and I want to do a really
quick cut quick edit of my experience
having that reach means that I can get
images that I wouldn't otherwise
approach because it would mean getting
in somebody's face or walking right up
to a sign etc so 20 times optical zoom
gives you a little bit more flexibility
and in this case in an even smaller form
factor this thing goes in your pocket
incredibly easily you can tell my hand
just Dwarfs it there and you're still
getting that amazing Sony image
stabilization for both pictures and
video I might try out a little vlogging
on it to see how it works for that and
overall just really excited I've had
great experiences with all kinds of Sony
cameras
in fact my first point-and-shoot from
Sony probably not my first but in recent
memory was the hx9 V which was one of
the first have this new image
stabilisation system which is just
hands-down the best in my opinion so if
you're trying to shoot yourself or shoot
video on the go with a small camera
image stabilization is number one as far
as I'm concerned and Sony just kills it
up on the top here we have something
called the bolt and this is a little
tiny battery backup from flux mob with
built in prongs so you don't need a
separate cable you can sense a trend
here I'm kind of anti cable wherever I
can be and this is really cool because
it's it's about the size of your average
power brick for a phone or any other
kind of device that needs to be charged
up except in this case it also has a
built in battery 3000 milliamp hours so
something kind of cool here is I can
take my battery backup solution for the
phones this 5200 milliamp hour product
from tilt that I modified a couple of
videos ago and actually plug that
directly into the bolt
charge it from the wall and then
essentially have 8000 + milliamp hours
of backup battery life in both of the
two devices does that make sense
this power brick into this power brick
which then goes into the wall pretty
cool setup
the tilt goes into the bolt and then the
tilt goes into the iPhone 5s the Nexus 5
and even the Sony camera which charges
over microUSB so a very cool way of
limiting the number of things that you
need to take to get a bunch of different
devices charged next up we've got this
little tripod here from Joby this is
brand new I haven't used this at all yet
but I've always wanted to have one
because generally when you're traveling
with a small kit like this and a small
point in shoot you'll just leave the
tripod at home but in this case I'm
getting some stability at least if I can
place it on a tabletop or something like
that if I need to speak into the lens I
can do all that and the form factor is
amazing I mean this this is just right
in the palm of my hand really easy to
operate and better than nothing
obviously not as functional as a
full-sized tripod but a full-size tripod
is bigger than all of this stuff put
together so it's a question of for and
function here in this particular setup
so obviously you know the 5s
you know the Nexus 5 I think the only
thing left to talk about is this little
guy right here from SanDisk this is a
little mobile drive that has Wireless
built in and it also has a battery built
in it is called the SanDisk
connect once again I'll link it down in
the description it does some really cool
stuff
it's got 64 gigabytes of storage for all
your media files pictures video etc and
then you can take those files and share
them amongst all of your different
devices it'll work with Mac PC it'll
work with Android iOS and you
essentially have this little hub this
little portable Nazz that comes with you
wherever it is that you go and it has
another killer feature as well which is
an SD card slot unfortunately the 11
inch MacBook Air does not have an SD
card slot but think of this as a
wireless SD card slot so if I want to I
could take the SD out of my Sony camera
put it in here and then access those
files from any of my devices straight up
to Instagram on the iOS app which I like
a lot better than the Android one you
guys have heard me say that before or
straight on to my computer
many many options and I'm gonna load
this thing up with movies before I head
out on this trip it recharges over
microUSB so once again it plugs into my
crazy little system over here it could
take the place of this watch and all of
a sudden have even more battery life and
then it then the already amazing eight
hours and load load this up with movies
and watch them on whatever device I want
