grabbed his crotch people lost their
minds he did what he touched that I
think we had a cool one today this thing
here it's called the air bar
apparently this device right here
attaches to any laptop and turns the
screen into a touchscreen any laptop so
comes in a few different sizes this one
is for a 15.6 inch laptop something in
that neighborhood it looks like this one
available for 1413 as well as a Levin
plug in hard to miss check when you plug
in is it hard to miss touch just go
crazy is there innuendo happening here
there's something romantic about this
your finger or with gloves and even a
paintbrush
what enhanced user experience pinch
sweep zoom scroll it works with most
notebooks running Windows 10 Windows 8.1
and Chrome OS okay we have a King
MacBook here I think it'll work let's
give it a shot let's give it a shot
alright so line it up Oh
as he muted that oh whoa
the screen is a touchscreen now whoa
that's a touchscreen MacBook Pro now the
question is how precise is this gonna be
it's close but maybe you move it more
that way let's try this oh that's better
it's just a matter of lining it up
correctly for your display but that my
friends is a touchscreen let's try and
play a video there check it out okay the
removal tool ah the precision is not
exactly what I would call pin point get
it it's fine for hitting icons that are
huge but if you're trying to get in on a
something real small is quite
frustrating actually now keep in mind
the product officially on the back
states the compatibility Windows 10
Windows 8.1 and Chrome OS in my
experience the drivers that exists
generally speaking for items like this
accessories like this can function on
Mac OS sometimes maybe with a little bit
less polish I've got Pixelmator open
this will tell us how close it is to the
actual tap point what's going on here
whoa oh so that's not working does work
which is cool but this is the point of
video where you cut and you go okay I
got a PC laptop man let's see what the
differences okay I got a PC laptop now
let's see what the difference is I can
tell right away when I line up the air
bar that fit is precise so I'm gonna
remove the little sticky parts these
little white lines fit perfectly when
you lift this off you'll see the little
tiny magnets stay there
you put those magnets on fold this down
it works as you'd expect but then when
you want to use the air bar it just
drops on to the right position you want
to apparently have a little tiny gap
above the edge of the air bar Windows
found a driver this is windows 7 pro
they found the driver apparently oh this
is way better than on the MacBook way
way better oh it's it's bang on precise
it's super precise let's see if I can
grab the little scroll over here Wow
oh it's not even comparable to the other
one I don't think that has to do with
the software that's the thing I think if
this company made one that was the exact
form factor of the macbook display
something tells me where oh they just
launched youtube rewind you never know
you might see your uh your old pal Lou
in there oh look it even realizes I
might want touch input as well for the
text let's open up paint here Oh baby do
a little Jack Attack here there he is
mr. pixel Jack a lot of ear
he's also been working out so he's a
little more buff than usual those are
his muscles right there that that's a
hundred that's that's like a proper
touchscreen I hope you're getting that
that is very that's beyond my
expectations for precision not
functioning so well on a MacBook Pro but
that's not what it's designed for so who
cares
here in Windows bang on precision you
can see the size or trying to hit like
an X let's see this little X right here
boom and it's not like you're completely
committed to it I like the way they
designed it in the sense of you want to
get rid of it okay boom I think this
thing's pretty cool I can see a number
of different circumstances in which
touch could be a cool thing to
experiment with maybe for artistic
endeavors it's a touchscreen for any
laptop look at it that's all it takes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
