Bluetooth speakers now you hang it over
your neck it plays music near and around
you instead of directly into your ears I
guess you know this frees up your ears
maybe some people do want to wear
headphones for whatever reason I mean
there's got to be some downside it's a
bit obnoxious a safer way to listen see
they're going with the safety angle is
that enough to make you want to wear
Bluetooth speakers around your neck I
don't know we're gonna find out a
magnetic connection point for secure
clothing attachment Zulu audio I'm
skeptical
it comes in two different colors this is
the white version right here and this
one over here is in black it's as you
could tell that's that's a pretty tough
carrying case charge cable micro USB one
extra magnetic clasp this goes
underneath your shirt and then it
attaches to the other side of the
speaker so the thing doesn't move around
much is this cool Brad what do you think
I think you nailed it when you called it
I know is this running when you said
it's the boombox
of the future hmm and I like the idea of
having a party going mmm bit of a party
guy I like having people around me and
if this is gonna help get them there I'm
on board
so what music would you use to attract
them something upbeat
something poppy mm something with some
snares and a little bit of pizzazz let's
try them on okay here you go see if you
can figure those out I'm gonna look at
the instruction manual here the magnets
are strong
there you go there it is if you are
wearing a collared shirt you can go here
then you don't even box there was no
they weren't encouraging that there's
more of a fitness that's a Miss
marketing opportunity I don't know how
comfortable I feel with magnets that
close to vital organs in my heart how's
your heart these days my heart's strong
got the rest of my body and that is
strong this is style that you think it's
fashionable oh yeah yeah this is a good
look it's a head turner wait here we go
now I hope there we go perfect we have
40% battery life here any musical
requests
I like it you know what your around the
house your tidying up sweeping you can't
have headphones on someone could knock
at the door
you got to remain alert so many of those
headphones to earphones the buds they
don't fit in my ears this is a great
alternative who you don't even you don't
need ears
all right you don't need it to fit in
your ears you don't need an earphone
that fits in your ear you have a disk on
your chest
I think it's louder for you than it is
for me doing I try
I don't know man I don't know I know
and I approve of this product so it's
all it takes a Zulu audio alpha series I
sign off on it highly recommend two
colors the magnets they're strong
they're powerful the audio crisp clear
and the social element I really like
that I couldn't disagree more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
