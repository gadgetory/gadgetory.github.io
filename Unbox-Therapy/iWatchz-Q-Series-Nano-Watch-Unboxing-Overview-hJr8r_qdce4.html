and today we're taking a look at another
ipod nano watch strap this one is from a
company called I watches and it's part
of what's called the Q Collection I
suppose the reason it's called a
collection is because this strap is
available in many different colors you
can get it in blue green white red pink
gray etc so that can help you
personalize the watch into whatever
flavor suits you this is the plain-jane
black model it's got a traditional-style
clasp
unlike the Griffin model that I unboxed
a few weeks ago which I actually didn't
like that much you can go ahead and
watch that unboxing on the channel if
you're curious this one has a nice
silicone band it feels soft and it's got
this plastic locking mechanism in the
middle which is super thin so it's not
going to add too much depth to the Nano
which is important because it's already
pretty chunky as it is so here we are
we're gonna try and insert it it's a
little tough at first but once you get
it lined up it slides on real nice and I
suppose the nice thing here is that
you're not going to have to take it on
and off too much because all of the
ports are accessible you can charge it
while in the strap you've got access to
all your buttons so unlike that Griffin
model this one is going to be easier to
use as a watch all the time here's what
it looks like mounted on my wrist and
I'm actually kind of impressed with how
it looks I've got an average two large
sized wrist so it might not suit
everybody but it actually looks pretty
cool in my opinion anyway be sure to
check out our channel we got a lot more
to look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
