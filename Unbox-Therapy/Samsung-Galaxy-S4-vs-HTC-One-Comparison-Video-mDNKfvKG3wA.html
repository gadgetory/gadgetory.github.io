therapy and as the title implies this is
a comparison of versus video between the
two hottest phones on the planet right
now the Samsung Galaxy s4 and the HTC
One both flagship devices both
manufacturers looking to sell a ton of
these things and you guys have been very
very interested in the coverage on these
two devices up until this point so this
comparison makes a hell of a lot of
sense one thing I want to get out of the
way right now before the fanboy start
going crazy down in the comments section
is that these are both great devices and
they're a hell of a lot closer in terms
of speed and functionality and then a
lot of people want to believe so if you
feel strongly about one being lightyears
ahead of the other one trust me you're
wrong I've played with both extensively
and they are a lot more similar than
they are different of course there are a
couple of features and functions that
are slightly different and that's what
this video is for but it's not
light-years it's not this major major
gap between the two there is no major
Delta there all right enough with the
preamble let's get into the comparison
we're gonna start it out with the galaxy
s4 this large 5 inch 1080p screen for an
effective PPI of 441 it is Super AMOLED
but a lot of the story here with Samsung
has to do with software customization
software features that they've put into
TouchWiz that just aren't available
anywhere else from lockscreen
customization home screen customization
things like air gesture that got a lot
of press at the original event when this
was announced you've got things like
group play for sharing what you're
playing with other people who happen to
have the same device you've got a sensor
on the front of the phone that will take
a look at your face and your eyeballs
more specifically to tell if you're
looking at the phone the reason that
this is important is for their feature
called smart paws so if you look away
you have a little conversation and then
you look back to your device it'll pick
up playing where you left off it'll
pause in between you've got another
sensor on the top of the phone for
samsung watch on you have this remote
function to control your television
you've got something called s health
which is a fitness tracker anyways you
guys can tell where I'm going here they
have completely overhauled the software
to put in a bunch
of stuff that just isn't on other
Android devices so it's definitely worth
considering the camera here is top-notch
I do have to admit this is a 13
megapixel shooter producing some of the
best pictures of any smartphone ever
maybe the best ever
I mean it's arguable because what is the
best picture it's the one with the most
resolution the Crispus one or is it one
that performs well in low light I'll
talk more about that when we get to the
HTC One but trust me this thing produces
some beautiful images assuming that the
lighting is reasonable another feature
this one has that the HTC One simply
does not is a removable battery and
expandable storage now this is very
important if you're a traveler if you're
a person who's constantly on airplanes
or something like that having a
removable battery is a big deal plus
it's a relatively large one it's a 2600
milliamp hour battery and a microSD
expansion all right now the HTC One I'm
gonna give you some key points on the
HTC One first and foremost this thing is
elegant it's got top-notch build quality
I don't need to tell you guys you've
probably seen videos on it already
everybody appreciates what HTC has
engineered here this thing is almost a
piece of artwork you've got a more stock
experience closer to the way that
Android was intended to be used by
Google though there are some slight
customizations including blinkfeed this
is a live home screen which is gonna mix
your social news with other news from
around the web and give you a more
interactive home screen interface you
could disable this if you don't want to
use it the story gets more interesting
as you move to the back of the device
specifically when you talk about the
camera it has a four ultra pixel camera
what the hell does that mean it means
you're gonna get really great low-light
performance at the expense of a little
bit of resolution all the tests that
I've seen and personally taken basically
show that this thing is not as good as
the s4 in good lighting conditions but
it's better than the s4 in low-light
conditions so that's up to you to figure
out which of those aspects or elements
is more valuable to you do you want to
bring pictures to life at night or do
you want ultimate resolution in the day
the speakers are probably my favorite
feature on this phone final
we have forward-facing speakers with no
audio clipping with just fantastic sound
and it's facing you so when you happen
to be lying down on the couch and you
don't want to wear headphones you still
have great sound for watching your
multi-media now as we know everyone's
talking about build quality that seems
to be the biggest issue here in these
comparisons and you know personally
speaking build quality does matter but I
don't think you should necessarily
choose a phone only based on build
quality
so in conclusion for me what would be my
choice I would probably choose the HTC
one if I could only have one of these
two phones but it's not just because of
build quality it's because I'm such a
huge fan of the speakers now that might
not matter to some people to other
people you might be saying listen 99
percent of my usage is with headphones
if that's the case then things get a lot
harder in terms of deciding between the
two then I might move to the s4 and say
hey I want that expandable storage
I want that removable battery so that
when I'm in an on an airplane I can have
an extra one and boom I'm ready to go
some other things you know you might be
really interested in some of those
software features you do have to give
the edge to Samsung at least for
offering those things up I've always
been a fan of the more stock experience
because I've been using Nexus devices
for so long so the transition to the HTC
One for me is just a little bit easier
so that's why it would be my choice but
I'm gonna conclude with what I said
earlier in this video they are both
fantastic you cannot go wrong with
either of these devices my choice is the
HTC One but I could very easily get by
with the s4 as a daily driver I just
prefer the speakers and I'm an audio guy
speakers matter to me even on a phone
anyways that wraps up this video thanks
as always for watching guys leave a
thumbs up down below if you enjoyed it
and I'll catch you on the next one later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
