this thing this little guy right here
the NES classic edition it's a mini
little NES in the fashion of the
original but this time it's got some
games based into it people were all
fired up all fired
they loved make sense you know missed
algid sells it came out around Christmas
so I didn't have a chance to get my
hands on one until my good friends at
analogue email me said oh you think
Nintendo themselves are the only ones
who can do a mini edition we could do
one too I did a video for them a while
back actually - OH
comes with the gold legend Iselle the
cartridge am i yelling I'll put a link
in the description if you haven't seen
that yet but they shrunk down their
package as well and altering a couple of
other things and they're ready to take
on the classic mini and yes this is not
really a remake in the sense that you
can't put your old cartridges in here
but with the analog product you could
take any old NES cartridge throw it in
here and live it up like it's 1989 if
this thing is almost like a piece of art
if you haven't seen one of these before
you got analog on the top in gold oh
this makes the third color option I've
had from you guys and it is quite a bit
smaller the classic ports for your
controllers four ports one is for the
u.s. the NES cartridges that you're
familiar with and then the other one is
for check this guy out
right here they included this as well
some original Mario that never made it
over here I don't know I can't read
Japanese I believe these are called
Famicom games this is what I'm talking
about that guy right there originally
released in Japan as the family computer
there you go history lesson there's an
SD card slot
we've got analog port and then we've
also got HDMI so this is what gets
people excited all right cool
an HDMI cable in the Box the wireless
controller alright so that's one of the
criticisms of the NES classic Edition
the classic controller has
very short cable and just like this
wireless control capabilities when we
8-bit go any a 30 gamepad so as I
mentioned you can't go ahead and just
throw any cartridge into this but I've
got 30 games built right in if I want to
go I don't know to a friend's house or
something I just bring this thing and
we're all ready to play double dragon 2
is on here look at that that could be
you if you were basing this strictly on
side yeah that's that tinier and then on
the back you just have HDMI in DC and it
fit they also included an HDMI cable so
how about that how about that how about
that case me I saw how about day alright
let's go ahead and get this hooked up
let's give it a shot
world 1 1 3 live listen to that bangin
soundtrack right there oh these
mushrooms don't stand a chance over here
boom big time Mario now and the thing is
the pictures
super clean like Whitby foot you
were probably playing on listen to that
tune that's even better than the title
track doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo I just want it you want
to hang out down here just to keep
listening to this Wow is seeing Lou in
1991 is what I was doing 24/7 just
killing mushroom and taking named player
like
as far as getting now I get the whole
level within foam boom oh oh you don't
want to mess with me now now I got the
flower juice oh I just lost it how dare
you so that's fine a good but like
there's another cartridge here which is
near and dear to my heart and that of
course is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
and this is also the cartridge that
started and ended my dad's video game
career if he's watching this he knows
the level of frustration on here my mom
cut him off she said listen man you
can't get all fired up like this this is
uh not good for your health
so he put me put the controller down for
good right at that moment this is the
cartridge to fit it which is Mac oh oh
the sound push who was your guy who was
your ninja turtle this is my guy right
here Raphael you got the side and
there's shredder it's already got a
problem you I mean the things just
started you see they had the overhead
before grand theft auto even thought
about and listen to this playing in
music I need to shut up for a second
drink didn't tease me and then you go
down below and oh oh oh oh oh what plant
in the house a couple of spin moves you
think I'm scared brother ah
you're done God brother oh and when you
hit pause you can switch I forgot about
history other Ninja Turtles get extra
energy with pizza you can do it look at
the positive message magic will work
that way in real life maybe peace all
the time don't forget this right here is
the game that ended the video game
career of Papa unbox therapy RA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
