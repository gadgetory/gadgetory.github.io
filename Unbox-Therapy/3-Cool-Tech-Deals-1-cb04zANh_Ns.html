laptop here it's like where do the hands
go they go down here do I do i rest on
the chin like this cuz normally there's
like there's this action what's up guys
like a hello welcome fireworks that
usually happens jack what's up guys Lew
here back with another video and today
it's a little bit of a new concept a
revival of something I used to do back
in the day called deal therapy we're not
going to call that anymore
it's a little complicated essentially
it's a couple of cool deals that I find
on any given day on Amazon and I'm going
to share them with you guys real quick
content that is hopefully useful and
hopefully the products featured in the
video are useful as well I've selected
three different things along with an
honorable mention from the daily Amazon
deals so let's go ahead and get right
into it
alright so item number one is a wireless
extender this is not the most exciting
thing in the world obviously but useful
everybody has a spot in their house or
apartment that has terrible Wi-Fi
connectivity now there are plenty of
ways that you can fix this by spending a
lot of money but most people don't want
to spend a lot of money so you can get
something like this from tp-link which
is only 20 bucks and should hopefully
amplify the signal this is normally 40
bucks and it's $20 giving this current
deal on Amazon it also has a wall plug
built into it so you don't need to have
you know a table or any kind of
furniture near where you're going to
place this or have to put something on
the floor you just plug it straight in
which I thought was a pretty cool
function so the tp-link TL - wa8 50 R e
and 300 ah gotta love product things the
link will be down in the description so
you don't need to remember that next up
is something for iMac owners now
obviously not everybody owns an iMac but
I thought this would be useful to people
who do this is normally 20 bucks it's
only six here given this deal on Amazon
what it does is it brings one of your
USB ports to the front of your iMac from
the back sounds weird
essentially it's like remapping the
usb3 by connecting in the back and then
swinging around to the front for stuff
that you connect on a regular basis
whether that's a USB key or a cable to
charge your phone a simple device simple
functionality and a cheap price to go
along with it so if you have an Apple
iMac with USB 3 this little device could
be incredibly useful and it's only six
bucks regular 20 check that out - next
up we have the LG G watch which was one
of the very first smart watches on the
market and as Google i/o just wrapped up
its got me thinking about last year's
Google i/o which I was at and it was all
about smartwatches well it's a lot less
expensive now than it was all the way
back then it's 139 bucks and it's a
great way for you to get experimenting
with Android wear every so often you'll
see the Moto 360 around this price but
there's not a lot of stock right now the
Moto 360 I believe is 150 bucks on
Amazon as well but the shipping is one
to three months so this one is in stock
the cheapest way for you to get into
Android wear and start using a
SmartWatch that's something that you
want to do and look at this if I want it
tomorrow I just have to order in the
next four hours
gotta love Amazon gotta love Amazon
alright this next product is a little
bit weird it's not really one of my
picks because I don't know much about it
but I just had to put it in here as an
honorable mention because I didn't
realize how inexpensive some Android
tablets are this is a $36 and $0.99
tablet Android tablet with a 1.5
gigahertz quad core 7 inch screen it's
also got Google Play pre-loaded what $36
how can you even ship something for that
I mean this this is pretty wild anyhow
it got me excited I don't know how good
it is but even if even just for a simple
function maybe just want to set it up
put it on your wall or on your desk and
just have Twitter running on it I don't
know it just seems crazy that you could
get a tablet for thirty six dollars let
alone a separate LCD I mean it's just
pretty impressive so if you want to
check that out that link will be down in
the description as well that wraps up
and then
new episode of three cool tech deals how
about that maybe sometimes it won't even
be tech deals it'll be crazy shit that I
find on Amazon you know there's a lot of
that too if you guys enjoyed this
content make sure to leave a thumbs up
down below as I mentioned all the
relevant links are down in the
description leave a comment if you have
a question or suggestion and thanks for
watching as always catch guys on the
next episode later bigger fish to fry
you ever heard that saying before jack
bigger fish to fry what does it mean
thanks jack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
