you're probably wondering why it's there
because I've already unboxed the seven
pro fact I've been using it now for a
while so this video is gonna serve as
kind of like a combo video I'm gonna
tell you about my thoughts and whatnot
about this device considering I've been
using it now for a couple of weeks but
first things first I got this other
version so if you recall from the
original video I own bought this guy
right here the nebula blue they came out
with another color this one is almond I
believe is what they're calling it yeah
almond and I like almonds so yeah see
what is what an apple call this color
see that you could call that almond if
you want ooh
got a pearl essence to it look at that
Wow depending on the angle with which
you view it compared to the iPhone yeah
I'd say it's pretty similar what is
iPhone caught what do they call it just
go they just call that gold same as the
other one obviously triple camera setup
a bit more predominant on this unit
because it's up against the lighter
color you have to pop up camera you
already saw it you already know so I
guess you can pick between the two now
that it's out there nebula blue and
almond
let me know in the comments which is the
more popular what about my feelings
about the phone what about my feelings
about the device man I've been using a
lot of phones lately so I've got a lot
to reflect on compared to pretty much
all this stuff you'd be considering if
you were in the price territory of this
particular device the oneplus 7 pro but
I think that's kind of the comparison
you're making now this one has gone
upmarket
targeting those types of devices and
rightfully so to be honest the most
striking thing about this device and you
may have heard this already from others
it's just the speed of it this is one of
the rare cases in which the software on
the device I don't want to touch it like
I don't want to put a launcher I don't
want to do anything to it I just leave
it as is it's very close to stock
Android in the experience of it but it
feels even snappier because of their
optimizations and if you want to go a
step further you can actually turn off
animations complete
over on phone buffs channel he did a
one-to-one comparison of this device in
the s10 and he did his own speed testing
which is just like launching different
applications closing windows
multitasking to see which one is quicker
and it's surprising because your first
thought on quickness is just like okay
it's got a snapdragon 855 so it's gonna
be the same well no there's there's
little optimizations that affect your
day-to-day usage and can actually speed
up your behaviour and in the common
things that you do frequently like
relaunching apps now the snappiness it's
also in this display the fact that you
have this 90 Hertz display and this is
the hardest thing to really put across
to you in a video because you're not
you're not able to pick this up right in
the recording but it is just
unbelievably snappy now it's important
to note that not all applications
support the full refresh rate and also
you can toggle it down to save battery
life if you choose to back down to 60
Hertz but when you have these animations
toggled down in conjunction with a 90
Hertz display you essentially end up
with probably the speediest Senatus
smartphone experience that's out there
now a lot of that is perception to for
example like unlocking the screen see
how there's no animation there I turned
that off myself because they had that
little electrical function going on but
it makes it feel slower and I've
compared this device the fingerprint
unlock to other devices that use an N
display fingerprint this still feels
faster to me some of it is perception
some of it is reality now the other
thing about this display I think the
other story of this phone is of course
the pop-up camera or for me the lack of
any camera and the lack of any cut out
because I don't really use the front
facing camera frequently so all this
means for me is full display all the
time so if I pop open a video for
example so this just means like zero
distraction all display no notch
no hole punch just the video that you're
trying to watch and the trade-off is
what am
motorized camera where I never even used
the motor I just don't use the
front-facing camera that much
I understand the argument against it
moving parts I made that argument myself
because I'm always trying to pitch both
sides of the story now of course one
plus they come out they say hey man this
this camera unit can withstand all kinds
of forces you can lift up a cinder block
and all the rest of it so their claim is
that it's completely fine regardless
battery life has been really good on
this device it's a four thousand
milliamp hours of course it charges
really quickly though that does bring me
to one of my criticisms one thing I do
miss is the lack of wireless charging I
think one plus is at a price premium now
where it's like you kind of have to
throw it in just because the other
manufacturers have it it would just be
more convenient and it's one thing that
I'm missing so it's a criticism of mine
for me to camera is it's not it's not
like mind blowing but it's there's been
a consolidation of camera quality
recently I would say a lot of these
things sharing sensors in fact so I'll
be sitting here in this studio snapping
photos and analyzing pictures but
ultimately a lot of those end up on the
same back end with the same sensor so
that's a picture of the sensor right
there IMX 586 and it's on a surprising
number of devices I still haven't found
a device that for me is as pleasing
immediately out of the camera as
frequently as the pixel series but this
never left me it never left me feeling
like I was really truly missing out on
anything especially outdoors especially
in well-lit environments I have
mentioned in previous videos that you
can sometimes enhance the camera
performance simply by installing
Google's camera software which there
inevitably will be a port for that said
one plus his own software updates have
improved the performance of the camera
in the stock camera app that comes via
the device so yet the camera it's fine I
would say it's in the same territory
it's in the same neighborhood as the
Samsung stuff there are small attributes
and differences you may be able to
notice but for me for my money
it's a wash so here's the thing okay s10
you picked the s10 I think there's a
couple things that you're getting you're
getting the brand name you're getting
Samsung you're getting a really vibrant
rich display you're getting wireless
charging obviously you're getting a
front facing camera that doesn't require
a motor which could be advantageous to
you but what are you getting into one
plus four a little bit less money at
least based on the retail cost of the S
time you're getting this no notch
experience in conjunction with 90 Hertz
in conjunction with the software
optimizations that make this the fastest
smartphone experience probably you can
have right now for me that's a trade
worth making for me this is the device I
want to have in my pocket right now it's
probably gonna be there up until the
point there's another pixel to choose
from because I'm gonna want to
experiment with that camera
particularly what Google is doing with
their camera software right now the
absence of the knotch
the lack of distraction the true full
screen display the OLED the 90 Hertz and
the software is the reason why this will
be my pick it's no longer in the value
category which I think a lot of people
have a right to be upset with that was
kind of in the DNA of oneplus was like
what can we get for around 500 bucks
that was the idea and they've gone
upmarket with each generation of phone I
think that built those sort of marginal
improvements on this one are more
significant to me than whatever marginal
improvements exist on the Samsung there
it is one plus seven Pro Nebula blue
almond I'm gonna be on the smartphone
