probably wondering why you just watched
a very strange intro to this video right
here and what you saw was of course
Betty here that's what we're gonna call
her here on the channel Betty and she is
a headphone junkie as you can tell she's
rocking my Sony XP
and she can't even hear such let's
really love them but in all seriousness
she doesn't have years she doesn't have
eardrums for that matter and so what I'm
going to do is turn Betty the headphone
junkie here into an incredible utility
for the channel to determine how
headphone sound which one's block out
external noise better and which active
noise cancellation headphones do the
best job of blocking out a number of
different sounds that might be happening
externally so how am I gonna do this
well I'm gonna have to do some surgery
and I know right right about now you're
feeling pretty bad for poor Betty here
as am i because I ain't no surgeon but
what I'm gonna do is drill a cavity
right through her skull here it sounds
gruesome but she's fake come on out guys
and and then through that cavity I'm
gonna I'm gonna put a lav mic they laugh
mic I'm wearing right now as you
probably can't see because I'm wearing a
black shirt but I've got a high quality
very sensitive lav mic that I'm wearing
to speak through for this video and it's
going into this zoom h1 little portable
audio interface it does recording at a
high quality especially for such an
inexpensive device and what I'm gonna do
is install this lav mic as an artificial
eardrum into the cavity of Betty the
headphone junkie here and send that
signal into the zoom h1 and then play it
back for you guys as you watch the
videos headphone reviews comparisons etc
now the way I want to start it out is
with a noise cancellation comparison
where I'm gonna put two active noise
cancellation headphones on her make a
bunch of racket in the background while
she's wearing them over top of this
artificial cavity and then you guys can
no forced or for certain in scientific
terms which one actually blocks out
external noise better than the other so
it could be some very cool data that we
are able to harvest via this
Farra ma'am now let me know if you guys
want to see me move forward with this
project down in the comments hit up that
like button if you think it's cool is
how I do because people can say whatever
they want about headphones but if you
can't hear them or even get any kind of
idea of how they perform comparative to
others through whatever speakers you're
currently using then it's pretty tough
to make an informed purchasing decision
so we're gonna up our game here on unbox
therapy we're gonna get all all
Mythbusters on you guys and we're gonna
find out our beats by dre products for
example are they effective at active
noise cancellation will approp will a
Bose product outperform them you know
will an AKG product without even having
active noise cancellation do a better
job just from noise isolation all these
questions could be answered if I am able
to build this prototype so if you want
to see it happen make sure to hit up
that like button below and other than
that that's just been a quick update and
abnormal update but something that I'm
really excited about featuring here on
the channel so definitely stay tuned for
it if you haven't subscribed yet please
go ahead and do that and other than that
I'll catch you guys on the next video
thanks as always later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
