find out why I'm wearing this red hat
big good income don't Jax like four
beers deep right now oh man look at
those wobbles Jack can you walk a
straight line didn't think so
alright so I'm pumped up for this one
today I've got a very cool contraption
from a company called I extra now keep
in mind this product is a prototype the
thing I'm looking at right now it's on
Kickstarter as we speak there's a link
in the description if you want to find
out more but essentially what's
happening here is you've got a case that
adds a bunch of functionality to your
iPhone now in this case in this case
this case wiki with this particular
prototype is for the iPhone 6 and 6s but
the real juicy part of this scenario is
that they're making this one right now
for the iPhone 7 and that's part of the
Kickstarter is currently happening and
the reason that's important is because
of the type of functionality that this
case adds to your phone so in this
version the iPhone 6 and 6s you get
extra memory so either 64 or 128
gigabytes of extra storage in the case
itself 1700 milliamp hours of battery
almost a complete charge on the case
itself there's also some added
encryption some added security that you
could use if you'd like to think of this
as like an external hard drive for your
phone in the form of a case and then in
the event of the iPhone 7 when the
iPhone 7 version comes out it's also
going to give you a headphone jack a
traditional 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack at the bottom of the case
converting your lightning port into a
headphone jack while still having a
Lightning pass-through so essentially
knocking down those various deficiencies
on the iPhone I think you guys going to
be pumped up about this if it eventually
gets made keep in mind it's just a
prototype they gotta raise a bunch of
money on Kickstarter there's an app that
goes with it
called extra SD and that's where you're
going to be able to shift or sync files
even if you just want to backup say
photos that you've taken on your camera
app you can do that automatically or
manually if you just want to free up
space on your phone a lot of these cases
have a different connector it's a
lightning connector down here no micro
USB that's unusual you don't see a lot
of third-party
accessories actually going for Apple
certification in order to include that
lightning port but what it means is all
your accessories that use that port are
still available to you even when your
phone is in the case now your buttons
are mapped around the outside their
clicky there it's pretty straightforward
it's like a standardized case leather
ish type of material on there I don't
know lots of grip so this is the app
down here extra SD and there's a few
different ways you can set this up to
work the case is going to be interpreted
by your Mac or PC as a mass storage
device so this also means if you plug
into your laptop transfer a lot of movie
files music files you can drag them
straight on to the case without the need
to go through iTunes or something like
that you can also select the media
quality for more space versus higher
quality files you can select to sync
certain albums or the entire library so
now you've got them in a secondary place
as well I can launch the internal camera
app here so I can snap a photo like this
and that will go straight into the case
writing it to the case right now that
particular JPEG or I can pull files
directly over from my camera roll
independently so the other way I think
people are going to use this is just by
downloading certain pictures from their
library they're taking up too much space
certain videos and things like this so
there's me on the keyboard right there I
move that over and boom you'll see it'll
begin to write to the internal memory on
the case itself so you notice that the
transfers are a little bit slower than
you might like keep in mind this is a
prototype currently it is on Kickstarter
so take it for what it is I have one of
the very first versions of this on the
planet so the expectation is that
there's going to be more development and
the app is going to have more features
and potentially be a little bit more
robust at the time of launch and then
you can go ahead and lock it as well to
protect the stuff that lives on the case
and not on the phone or vice versa
also if I select the info section here
it'll show you how much of your total
storage you're using so remember the
case is available in 64 and 128
gigabytes you see I'm using a small
portion of the 64 gigs available you can
also see your battery charge located in
this section down here
percent battery life so I gotta say I
kind of like it I mean the iPhone is not
the most versatile phone on the planet
there's not going to be expansion for
storage anytime soon and they keep
making the thing thinner so battery life
is going to continue to be an issue as
well those two things solved in one
place is kind of nice and never mind the
iPhone 7 version which gives you back
your traditional headphone jack so you
can still use your favorite edie phones
with your new iPhone and then the last
part is having the native lightning port
rather than a microUSB so you'd have to
carry around two cables like you
normally do another battery cases so the
promise is big here but keep in mind
it's a Kickstarter currently so you're
going to have to approach it in such a
fashion chances are this is going to
take time to get to the place necessary
before they ship quality product check
out their Kickstarter page and decide
for yourself but right now I think
they're making some pretty cool moves so
finally the moment in the video where I
can reveal the reason I am wearing this
