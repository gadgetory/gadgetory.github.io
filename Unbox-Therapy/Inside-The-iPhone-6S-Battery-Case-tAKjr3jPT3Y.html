another video and today I've got
something special for you in front of me
is something you've probably seen it is
this controversial Apple battery case
for the iPhone 6s with this strange
design I decided to take it upon myself
to crack this baby open and to look
inside to see what it's made of
- maybe gather some insight as to why it
was designed in the way that it was what
do you need I've got a screwdriver Torx
t3 I've got a little spudger some
tweezers a couple of different knives
probably overkill to be completely
honest with you like many Apple products
this thing is not very easy to get into
we're gonna need a little bit of carnage
here I'm gonna start over on the edge
and prying up this cover here it's just
a little a little bit of adhesive I
guess that's holding it down appears to
just peel off some of you guys might not
know but my background before I ever got
into making YouTube videos was actually
working on laptops specifically Mac
books and whatnot so I've been inside a
lot of laptops and various gadgets so
I'm pretty comfy in here and if you guys
want to see tear downs of other gadgets
that you're interested in let me know
down in the comments what you want to
see next so this just comes right off
here wow that's actually a on there okay
so we've got the back cover off now
so the next part you're going to notice
is this metal plate which looks like
it's been scratched up probably
intentionally so that that material
could adhere to it with whatever
adhesive they're using now a bunch of
screws totally overkill on the screws
here let's go ahead and twist those
babies out in this particular case you'd
want to be super cognizant of where
you're putting these tiny little screws
it does look like they've made it
somewhat accessible here if you've got
the right equipment we can actually get
in here now let's see if this just comes
right
there you go so you've just got a plate
there as well as a little bit of padding
probably also has some kind of
anti-static type of treatment
potentially on it there now this is what
you guys are going to be interested in
we've got confirmation on the
specifications here three point eight
volt lithium-ion polymer battery 7.1 3
watt hours 1877 milliamp hours you can
also see where it came from
dynapac electronic technology SuJu co
limited bunch of chinese writing of
course and a potential for fire or
burning authorized service provider only
you're looking at him now what's
interesting here is you have some
different certifications from different
places you see Thailand listed here
Apple South Asia you also have Apple
Japan in this location here now there is
a tiny little logic board down on the
bottom that's kind of interesting
there's some feedback between the
battery and your phone the phone gets to
know what the the battery status is how
much charge remains and whether or not
it's discharging to the phone's battery
at any given time so you've got some
electronics there to support that the
next step I believe is to remove the
battery itself looks like a little yep
there we go okay so it's a little stick
on connector not soldered on which is
kind of interesting so maybe Apple does
intend on replacing these that baby is
glued in there my goodness
wooh there we go there is your battery
right there funny that's all the magic
right there there's your there's your
hundred dollars we can actually just
lift that right
there is the logic board tiny little
thing and that's essentially all the
electronics in this device that little
tiny thing right there simple
electronics really made this thing what
it is a pretty standard lithium polymer
battery so not necessarily any kind of
insight into why this would have been
the design a very utilitarian style
design they were just like get the
battery in there get a metal plate
around it and then put a standard case
on it this is your average everyday
rubber ish case with a backpack or as I
called it in the last video mount
kilimanjaro hope you guys found this
insightful potentially the start of a
very cool new series where I continue to
show you the insides of your favorite
gadgets let me know in the comments what
do you want to see next on inside out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
