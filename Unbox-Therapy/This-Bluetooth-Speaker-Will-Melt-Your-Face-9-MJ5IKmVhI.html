a minute I got some new products from
diamond box I featured this stuff in the
past tense we packed little boxes that
create a tremendous amount of sound if
you're looking for some real party
thumpers these are the ones you want in
most cases now they updated they got a
new version they claim it's louder than
before better than before has features
that the old ones didn't have so in
these two boxes is something called the
m3 I believe they're not cheap all right
let's get that out of the way straight
up 599 bucks but the idea is it replaces
your home stereo it does all your audio
you can even hook it up to your TV you
can hook it up to your video games and
you can take it on the go it comes in
two different models you choose your
battery size with a playtime of up to 20
hours on the little guy and a playtime
of up to 40 hours on the bigger battery
cell I assume that's probably gonna be a
bit heavier also I can speak from
personal experience I'll just say they
have sounded really good in the past and
this is supposedly better they're built
in the USA there is no plastic wireless
stereo pairing so maybe that's why they
sent two of them IP 44 not crazy weather
resistant but a little bit of weather
resistance on their battery charger
built-in so you could use these giant
batteries to charge up your external
devices anyhow let's get inside the box
let's find out for ourselves if it's
really that good let's see what's going
on so the way the design works here you
get just suitcase style handle on the
top it's all very solid and this is new
to me they include different colors of
little knobs so if you don't like the
blue that's pre-installed you can make a
black gold looks like this in orange
color there as well and then they also
include an auxiliary cable for a wired
connection it's actually a pretty
high-quality auxilary cable this is your
most densely packed little portable
speaker for sound reproduction you can
see you get the two woofers you've got
the base port in the center tweeters up
top it looks like a typical kind of
timeless speaker design there's an
auxilary in as well and we have a treble
and bass setting which i think is new
from the last time I tested a dime
so you can kind of tune your sound in
there and then most importantly volume
in the center and flip it around to the
back
auxiliary to so you could actually have
two inputs and then the auxiliary output
of course that's gonna be useful for
daisy chaining a couple of these let's
check it out okay so we have the
colorful knob
it's another black one okay so in the
past they used to get fancy with the
multiple colors on the faceplates they
don't do it anymore they're just like
look we're gonna make one we're gonna
simplify the product line we're gonna
make the black a brushed aluminum
faceplate but we're gonna let you
customize in the knob department as far
as I'm concerned the blue is fine with
me if you wanted it to be if you wanted
it to be more stealth you could go with
the the black ones and then if you
wanted to I don't know up the bling
meter and go with the gold but I'm gonna
leave the blue for the purpose of this
video let's get these hooked up let's
see what they do
alright so I think in fairness we should
probably go with one first before we try
to bring up any type of daisy chain
scenarios so we have a big power switch
on the front here and this is kind of
how they got their name you see this
little tiny diamond right there
it's a two carat cz diamond but anyway
it's what gives it a name it says we're
connected so I'm just gonna load up
Sound Cloud real quick
imma let it wait for the beat wait for a
year the drums
all right yeah
frequently
if you showed up to a party this was in
the Trump and the party was already
happening and everybody was on a small
little portable blue Jersey and you're
like I just give me give me one minute
I'll be right back
you show up with this how's it doing
gonna feel they had the little pocket
eunuch don't feel very good so where's
the Ox cave I got one here's a hot stove
okay unwrapped I'm gonna do it
old-school way push the output there
Hillary here yeah we got it
can I just say I mean could you need
more sound than that for what like and
not unless you want to get the noise
complaint or you're in a giant field or
something you're still probably alright
honestly you don't need to one of these
is fine Jack let's not get carried away
here he wants to when I came up my dad
had a big stereo in the house kind of
like this two big speakers and it would
we would blast creates an environment
and a lot of people don't have that
experience because the way music is
consumed now it's a personal mostly
personal thing but if you do this every
so often it reconfigures your
perspective to a degree anyway Jack
wants another track I don't tell you
whether you're having a good time or not
we leave with any hearing leftover it's
basically a household kind of permanent
speaker with a handle on it as far as as
far as the sound volume the caliber is
concerned a performance is concerned
I've been a fan of B speakers I'm still
a fan of these speakers that's the new
version an improvement a more
configurable version of the old one and
that's really what you want them to do
it works well it's a simple design no
need to overhaul tweak it a little bit
that's what they did I like the treble
and bass control it's a nice little
bonus plus the extra auxilary it's an
upgrade</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
