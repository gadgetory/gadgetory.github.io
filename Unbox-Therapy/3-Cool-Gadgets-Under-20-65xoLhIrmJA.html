on YouTube this is gadgets under a
particular price point and today it's 20
bucks and these are all very cool so
keep it locked no skipping ahead they're
gonna skip at it so let's get it started
with this thing right here so unassuming
vibrant color this is a Bluetooth
speaker now you know I've featured many
Bluetooth speakers in the past but very
few that are only 15 bucks and it has a
special feature this allows you to
listen to music wirelessly in the shower
you're relaxing you're zoning out you
has a suction cup on one side so it can
stick to the tile it has plenty of
battery life to deal with your shower
habits look at this thing nice and small
and with this suction cup Wow it sticks
on this is all this is just a table and
look at that pretty amazing over here we
have a little port a little micro USB
but it'll be covered by this flap to
keep the water out of there and then all
your controls you can maneuver those
even even in the shower the water and
everything else they made them easy you
can even answer phone calls you gotta be
multitasking right the age-old thing
with the guy you know the briefcase even
they forgot to take the suit I'll get
the suit on shaving in the car I might
have the record for total number of
Bluetooth connections ever I mean this
is it's getting out of hand here oh
there it is
mixed martial arts hours my point Ariel
in your life on an MMA may 8 2010 need
in your life if you're an MMA fan you
probably already know that is that max
volume I'm getting jacked there's a
package I love that I love when it gives
you when he tells you when you hit the
maximum we have some decent volume here
I'm happy that we're doing a show on May
8th by the way this is one of my
favorite days since the grow for the
speakers on the back I think it's going
to reflect off of the surface will
Street walked out wins out the NBA
Finals relive one day the history of
this world I think it would actually be
May 8th 1970 Metroid Vic Grimes oh this
might be the biggest no-brainer ever on
the show you have podcasts and music in
the shower simple you're even making
phone calls
well you're exfoliating alright next up
this this is a classic this is the
classic if you haven't seen this before
then you haven't been an unbox therapy
fan long enough this is the mighty mug
the unspell a bowl mug do I slap it
which comes in a few different
variations all the way from 15 bucks to
25 30 bucks stainless steel tall short
etc but the thing here is you can't
spill it there's nothing like this it's
it's incredible here's a custom unbox
therapy one look at that did you even
know we had these Jack look at this this
thing sits on the table and all of a
sudden magic happens actual magic
happens your laptop is here you're
working or not it's no problem you want
to take a sip you just lift it straight
up it only sticks when you want it to
but then when you want to drink it comes
straight up that's the magic that's the
mighty month there between 15 and 25
dogs I might have just saved your laptop
trust me I've seen it before actually
long before I did YouTube I used to
actually repair laptops phones and
things that liquid damage was the thing
2,000 bucks down the drain because of
your stinking mug
alright last item of the day it is a USB
mini portable humidifier this is a real
thing when I select items for this show
it's because I'm attracted to them I
ordered this because I have issues it
gets dry in there in the hotel room you
need to be hydrated moisturized
humidified so what this does it fits on
to the top of any water bottle and it
turns the water inside of there into
moisture in the air you put this beside
your bed when you're sleeping it's
powered by USB and all of a sudden it's
misty it's tropical Jack you know it's a
big deal to me this one is $19.99 seems
like a no-brainer here's the actual unit
pretty straightforward oh this is an
extra filter by the looks of it so I
have a water bottle here this rubber
material can fit to a number of
different sizes and then this guy just
dips right in fits on like this plug it
in like that this other end into a USB
power break a laptop and we should be
good to go
oh and straight away we are actually
humidifying miss the fuck oh wow that's
performing better than I even expected
oh the moisture Wow
I should have bought this thing a long
time ago look at this this goes in my in
my bag in my travel bag I go to Vegas
every year so dry you're in the casino
fill up the bathtub and just leave it to
kind of like evaporate into the room I
could just go with this right here look
at this I feel better already so who's
got your back in the line of fire
holding back what my people if you're
with me whether you at there is get
yourself humidified you're happier now
the humidifier of the future</div></body></html>
