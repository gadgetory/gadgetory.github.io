therapy and today we're taking a look at
the GoPro hero3 camera this was just
released and this is the Black Edition
it's available in a couple of different
editions if you guys want to know the
full spec list on the black edition of
this camera there's a link down in the
description which will take you to
pricing availability in full specs so
you can use that but I will go over some
of the specs here as detailed an outline
on the back of the box you can see some
of the resolutions available on this
camera starting with 4k which is an
incredible resolution for a camera this
size but that's only available at 12 fps
a more usable frame rate is available at
2.7 K there you can get 30 25 or 24 and
if you need to do something at 60 frames
or above you'll be looking at standard
HD which is 1080p if you need a super
high frame rate you can go down to 720p
and get 120 FPS for slow-motion stuff
that's going to work out well on the
back of the box you can see some more of
the core features and functions this
camera does have Wi-Fi built in as well
as a faster image processor than the
previous generation has a 12 megapixel
image sensor which is supposed to do
better now in low-light of course it has
the traditional wide-angle lens that
we're used to on the GoPro series of
cameras it has enhanced audio
performance so audio should be better on
the hero 3 the hero 2 was barely usable
in terms of audio there's a micro HDMI
port for outputting HD video coverage
that you film on the camera it's also
got support up to 64 gigabytes though it
does now use a micro SD rather than a
full size SD you can also see a picture
on the back of the new Wi-Fi remote
which is also included and as the video
moves forward I'll give you guys a
closer look at the remote and explain
the functionality this is an unboxing
video though so we do need to begin the
procedure of unboxing the brand new Hero
3 Black Edition
I have unboxed GoPro products in the
past and let me tell you they are
extensive there are a number of
different adapters cords etc included in
the box so this will be a fairly epic
unboxing as you can see even the box is
pretty unique you have the acrylic
portion on the top which is taped down
to the more traditional cardboard
portion on the bottom so there's a
little bit of work
done in order to get inside of course
the accessories that I mentioned just
second ago are included in the cardboard
portion down below so after removing
this tape and then the acrylic window
portion on the top you'll notice that
the remote as well as the GoPro are
secured to this top doorway so you will
need to remove those and you get a
traditional little twist tie which is
actually holding the remote down this
kind of reminds me of when you used to
get a toy for Christmas or something and
it was strapped down to the packaging so
you could see it well before you buy it
anyways
that's a quick look at the remote more
details on that real soon you've also
got a bunch of paperwork here from GoPro
explaining how to get your remote up and
running is a little bit of warranty
information etc so if you are a little
confused with the entire setup process
you do have a little paperwork to help
you get started in terms of other items
this is where you're going to see all
the extra cables adapters etc you've got
everything from USB charging cables for
both the camera and the remote then
you've got a bunch of different brackets
and arms this is because you can
position the GoPro in a number of
different ways you guys may have caught
a video I made a little while ago on the
Nissan GTR which we did some shots with
the previous hero too so if you want to
see what you can do mounting this kind
of camera you should check out that
video actually maybe I'll link it down
below or put it in the video responses
because we use a couple different hero
twos and we mounted them to the exterior
of the car to get some pretty crazy
angles now removing the camera is
actually pretty easy I didn't really
know how at first but if you pinch the
back portion here it will actually come
loose from the foot that it's attached
to within the packaging you also
probably noticed in this unboxing that
you're going to get a few stickers
included so you can become a product
evangelist if you happen to be a hero 3
owner so let's take a closer look at the
actual camera as well as the housing
that it lives in this of course is
shockproof waterproof etc this is really
what makes the GoPro famous is this
ruggedized housing so you can still use
the buttons through the case because
they have these built up portions where
you can push through to the official
button on the actual camera there's also
a double locking
clasp that make sure that the door on
the back is closed airtight so that it
can be used in wet environments on the
front you'll notice the power button a
couple of LEDs there's also a little LCD
screen and the lens on the top is where
you'll find the record button another
led by the looks of it as we move to the
back you'll see the battery door you
remove this door using this little
mechanism right here and then you insert
the battery in that location you can
also see this expansion port you can use
this for bigger batteries or the LCD
module depending on how you want to use
your Hero 3 on the side of the device is
where you'll notice this little door
which exposes your ports here you have a
micro HDMI a USB port and a micro SD
slot that microSD slot does support up
to 64 gigabytes of storage that being
said the hero3 does not include a micro
SD to get you started so you will need
to bring your own on the other side of
the device is where you'll find the
microphone which is said to be greatly
improved over the hero 2 so let's go
ahead and take a closer look at some of
the other accessories and cables
included in the box after all this is a
fairly extensive package I'm going to
try to do it as quickly and concisely as
possible so here we have the battery
followed by some mounting brackets these
are going to allow you to get some
interesting angles when mounting to the
GoPro feet that are included you've also
got a USB cable this is going to be used
to charge the camera these are feet that
have sticky pads on the bottom so you
can mount the camera in some unusual
locations you get a secondary door this
one can be used if you don't need the
waterproof functionality you can get a
little bit better audio using that door
on the housing lastly we have a cable to
charge this device right here which is
the wireless remote which actually has
some surprising functionality built in
you'll see the little hook on the top
that's because you can put this remote
on your keychain so you don't lose it
but assuming that you want to recharge
the remote you don't want to remove the
whole thing from your keychain so you
can extract this little portion here
leave it with your keys and then go
ahead and install this portion here and
all of a sudden you can recharge your
remote control so that's a pretty cool
function then when you're finished you
go ahead and extract the cable and put
it right back where it belongs
your keys this is actually pretty
ingenious and I haven't seen this used
before on a remote for an electronics
device it kind of actually reminds me of
a key fob itself that you'd use to
unlock your car door anyway guys that's
a quick look and unboxing of the GoPro
Hero 3 Black Edition as I said earlier
