another video and today I am checking
out two smartphones that are relatively
inexpensive for what they are and they
are also battery monsters they have huge
batteries this one on the right the
studio energy too has a five thousand
milliamp hour battery five thousand
there saying this can get you three days
of battery life or 30 days of standby
time a month of standby this one on the
left the energy X is a little bit
smaller it features a four thousand
milliamp hour battery it's still a
monster this guy on the left is just
over a hundred bucks and the studio
energy - with an AMOLED display is 179
that's pretty crazy I don't know how
blue does it it's pretty amazing what
you can get your hands on these days for
under 200 bucks or in this case almost a
hundred bucks
so specs let's talk specs energy X 5
inch IPS HD display energy - 5 inch
Super AMOLED eight megapixel cameras on
the back a 5 megapixel front on the
energy - a 2 megapixel front on the
energy X 1 gig versus 1.5 expandable
storage on the energy - and I was just
talking to Jack earlier about how
interesting expandable storage just
became to me a new use for extended
storage which is YouTube read you can
download YouTube videos and watch them
later on airplanes and whatnot you can
start to stockpile a lot of content and
that can wreak havoc on your internal
storage so being able to boost up your
storage easily pretty cool 4G LTE both
relatively recent versions of Android
5.0 lollipop on energy - and 5.1
lollipop on the energy X so let's jump
inside the box and take a closer look I
don't know if I usually do a double
unboxing like this look at this two
phones one video 2 for the price of one
you got everything plus the kitchen sink
in here not but the kitchen sink
everything and the kitchen sink
including a little case to protect your
device and get a look at it there power
brick here pretty standard stuff I know
for a
the energy to does feature quick charge
headset also included and a cool little
flat style micro USB look tangle-free
another thing that blue smartphones are
known for is dual SIM card slots I don't
know it's hard to hate on that feature
also a screen protector I told you they
include a lot of stuff in here this is
really cool this little adapter here is
going to allow you to use the energy
tube to charge up other devices since it
has such a big battery 5,000 milliamp
hours why not share and spread the love
I got 5,000 milliamp hours I got battery
for days so as you can tell slightly
different looks for each of these
devices while on the X you have a mostly
plastic build whereas on the studio two
you have this nice aluminum around the
edge still surprisingly thin devices
considering the fact that we're talking
about these giant batteries one thing I
will say is both are really comfortable
to hold button layout is similar volume
rocker as well as your power and unlock
switch on the top is where you'll see
your headphone jacks bottom microphone
and microUSB and the speaker for both of
these is on the back you can see them
laid out there here we can see those two
SIM card trays the micro SD slot and yes
we have officially verified 5,000
milliamp hour battery that's boss status
here you can also see the 8 megapixel
rear facing camera the main camera this
guy has a four thousand milliamp hour
battery micro sd over here dual SIM card
trays in this location ok so here you
can see the displays on the right we
have Super AMOLED as I mentioned earlier
IPs on the left now blue doesn't
normally mess around with the interface
too much you're pretty much looking at a
stock Android experience there are a few
little alterations here and there but
nothing too major everything you'd
expect to find me taking a picture of
you 5-megapixel selfie
looking pretty as I can for you guys not
bad I assume these cameras are pretty
much the same but go ahead and find out
mmm either now forward facing should be
different because this is a 5 megapixel
camera on here versus a 2 megapixel
forward facing so not too shabby either
if I were to tell you you get this thing
here for a hundred bucks on Amazon you
might call me crazy but I'm not crazy
they're not crazy this is this is just
where we're at in the world of
technology now you're looking at these
two devices you're a battery hog I don't
blame you I am too legitimately power to
spare with that little adapter cable
should we test that let's test that
what instantly charging you gotta like
that simple okay Jack needs a charge
this is worlds colliding right here the
day or Android fans and Apple fans came
together like this use it as a tip so
you know somebody does something nice
for you
take a little juice it's on the house
alright so there you have it
studio energy to the energy X both from
blue smartphones just over a hundred
bucks around one hundred and seventy
nine I'll have them both linked down in
the description so you can check out
pricing and availability that wraps it
up hope you guys enjoyed this content if
you did make sure to leave a thumbs up
down below and as always we'll catch you
on the next episode later games
