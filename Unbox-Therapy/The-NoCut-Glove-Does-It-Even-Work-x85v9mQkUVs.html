some gloves in front of me at first
glance they just look like regular
gloves with an unusual pattern on them
but I heard about these things I saw
them on Amazon and I was like the world
needs to know they need to know the
truth because these are called
no cry or no fat no cry apparently you
can't cut these gloves you could use
them in the kitchen and keep your
fingers look at this look at Tom went
and bought this knife the way he looks
say we're looking at him sideways
because you know they thought with that
shirt on they were worried oh oh these
are targeted at people you know in the
kitchen maybe in the workshop supposedly
the fibers that are in there won't allow
a blade to come through and cut your
skin that's the idea here
they're relatively inexpensive and hey
man I don't know a lot of people cutting
veggies whatever you're doing this could
this could save your day if they work
now cut proof men nothing's really cut
proof I mean I would bring a saw out
here we'll get a samurai sword well you
can put I'm sure you can find a way to
puncture it but the question is that it
worked well enough that if you
accidentally slip where you could keep
your blood in your system where it
belongs so anyway these are the gloves
they're lightweight they feel kind of
nice yeah no cry us what they're called
it says cut level five high performance
what's this paperwork say take the time
to read this carefully no cry gloves
greatly reduce the risk of injury from
sharp objects but are not guaranteed to
leave you completely unharmed in all
situations be careful not to cut
yourself even when you're wearing these
these aren't designed to be cut proof
but to offer protection against cut
related accidents okay we get it
this is the disclaimer right here
they're not cut proof but we're going to
kick it into high gear because I'm going
to test it on my hand but then of also
I'm gonna put some Veggie Tom this is a
helluva
that's a carrot if I ever saw one with
the hole with this going on is this
edible up here anyway we got a carrot
we're gonna stick that into one of the
fingers and really go after it and see
where the threshold is you guys are
clumsy you barely get the cereal box
into the bowl put these babies on you're
a master chef let me put this on here we
go I'm put on the left hand and wield
the knife with the right it is weird
you don't trust it you don't trust it
because at the end of the day all your
instincts are telling you to not do this
what you're about to do I'm just gonna
be light at first fibers appear to be
holding up here the thing is if it
slipped through it'd be too late
I'm putting pretty good pressure now
it's not really impacting that at all
this is weird saw at my own yeah it's uh
it's pretty legit guys if we go back to
the paper like I mean I mean look I'll
shut there barely touch that I barely
touched it super light and I make that
groove in that
that's gonna save your day got that done
woohoo a little more pressure big Tom
we're gonna test this out but we're
going to see what you're made up here
the man's been out of town getting the
whole Sun pan going on Shawn the Sun pan
can you see it it's up here there's a
whole thing going on where were you Tom
Cuba tell the people oh boy hey no need
to yell tom was in Cuba and he decided
to trade his shoes for booze that's
that's the kind of guy tom is yeah I
know what else here's the thing it'll
just start up in there brother are you
ready yeah are you sure it doesn't have
to be like yeah ready huh yeah
oh so weird man
that's weird all right let me know you
don't need you don't need those song
this that doesn't make any sense right
because you get the banana back and he's
instinct all right Tom thank you very
much now two people they believe me they
believe I was putting pressure right oh
yeah I put pressure yeah okay
that's for you so here we go now it's
carrot time here we go this represents
the human finger I'll slide in here
the carrot in there you can see whoa if
you want to get through this you can to
be clear it wouldn't be as severe but
this is more for life you know Little
Mix but alright that's your finger
brother all right if you manufactured
these products or if you're just a
sensitive viewer I'm not trying to claim
that that it's not meeting my criteria I
mean they're called no cry not no chop
not no cut and if you really
intentionally want to get through this
you can as you can as you can tell I
think these serve a purpose they're a
couple of bucks they're pretty cool but
don't go getting too crazy</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
