another exciting unboxing of the newly
released Nvidia shield I've been waiting
to get my hands on this thing since CES
it's finally here it's in the house
let's go ahead and unbox it so what
exactly is the Nvidia shield it's a
portable gaming device that is
incredibly unique in the gaming space
it's got an NVIDIA Tegra 4 quad core
mobile processor inside with 2 gigabytes
of RAM it's also got a flip-up 5-inch
1280 by 720 display which is going to
give you a pretty pixel dense 294 ppi
it's of course multi-touch as well since
this device runs Android in pretty much
any Android game that you want to throw
on it it's also got 16 gigabytes of
flash memory pre-installed but there is
a microSD slot if you want to expand
that memory further in terms of the
unboxing experience the first thing
you're greeted with is the actual device
and then underneath there you're gonna
find some paperwork that's going to help
you get up and running a few more specs
while we're waiting this thing is 579
grams so it's a little heavier than your
average gaming controller but that's
because you have a screen attached and a
built in battery and a number of other
things so that's to be expected
it also comes pre-installed with some
interesting software and I'll tell you
more about that as the video moves
forward here's a closer look at the
extras in terms of paperwork you have a
little manual as well as a QuickStart
guide and on the other side of this
guide is a pretty cool poster if you
want to put it up somewhere the other
items in the box are pretty
self-explanatory you have a micro USB
cable as well as a tiny little power
brick here these are obviously going to
be used to charge the device when you're
not using it or maybe you want to use it
while it's plugged in let's talk about
the main attraction here the Nvidia
shield this is the hardware that
everybody is so excited about on the
back in terms of inputs and outputs you
have HDMI USB a headset port and the
microSD port that I mentioned earlier
you've got a couple of shoulder buttons
as well as triggers on the back and
you've got quite an ergonomic package
especially coming from a company that's
sort of new to this space I guess
everybody's new to this
because this device hasn't really been
attempted before there's never really
been anything quite like this
you've got the fold down and flip up
screen so when you're not using it it's
in a protected kind of clamshell mode
and then you flip it up and booyah
you get to take a really nice glance at
this 5-inch 1280 by 720 display it also
has speakers in this location
forward-facing so you're actually going
to get a little bit of stereo separation
on the front and there's a microphone as
I said before that lives in the center
of the device above those menu buttons
there so in the center is an Nvidia logo
that acts as your power button and as
you can see here it displays the Nvidia
shield messaging which then floats away
and you see this green controller icon
I'll go ahead and set this thing up
off-camera rather than bore you with
that and then I'll boot back into the
actual OS and show you what you can
expect so in terms of software you've
got Android so if you want to jump into
a web browser that's totally fine it
works exactly as you'd expect but
pre-installed you've also got Tegra zone
Sonic 4 episode 2 T HD is pre-installed
to get you up and running with some
games there's also expendable rearmed
Hulu Plus is pre-installed and so is
twitch TV so you're going to have some
stuff to play with right out of the box
the screen is not only nice to look at
it's also very responsive to touch so if
you're wondering how it behaves just
think about your favorite smartphone and
it's basically comparable to that the
twitch TV app works as expected allowing
you to jump into live streams and catch
up on all your favorite gaming madness
as mentioned earlier there are a couple
of games pre-installed so you can start
to take advantage of those shield
controls right out of the box the first
one I want to show you is called
expendable rearm there's also a cool
Sonic game included but I'll show you
this one first the controls here are
similar to some other mobile games where
the left thumbstick controls your
location and then the right thumbstick
controls where you're shooting of course
the experience is much more immersive
here because of the fact that you get to
use analog thumbsticks instead of having
to use digital ones that are actually on
your mole
phone screen next is the sonic game you
do have to download that one after you
boot up the device but that doesn't take
too long and then you'll see this
classic title reimagined of course on
the Nvidia shield this was one of my
favorites growing up so I can't wait to
actually play through this one as you
can see it's powered by NVIDIA Tegra the
graphics are really nice and they take
advantage of this pixel dense screen but
it did take me a couple of minutes just
to get used to the controls so please no
harsh words about my gameplay in this
little sample clip right here so that
wraps up this unboxing and first look of
the Nvidia shield but I do want to make
a video series where I can test it out
try out some games etc if that's
something you want to see make sure to
leave a thumbs up down below thanks as
always for your viewership and I'll
catch you on the next episode later guys</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
