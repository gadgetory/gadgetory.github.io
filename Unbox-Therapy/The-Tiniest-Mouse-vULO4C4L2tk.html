another video and today I am checking
out something small this is the swift
Point GT mouse precision organ aam --ax
ultra portable apparently this thing is
a CES Innovation Award winner what does
it have okay so economic yeah scroll
wheel yeah ooh
magnetic palm rest Matt keeps your mouse
close at hand while typing Bluetooth 4
or USB windows Android Mac iOS Wow look
at it look how small it is unbelievable
do I need a knife yogi I don't like whoa
comes in a nice little case as well
what's this ah this is your magnetic
your magnetic deal sticky pad on the
back you put that on your laptop lid
that's a place for your swift point GT
ooh
that is what up tiny that is jack
actually more comfortable than I
expected
this is your scroll wheel click click
all right I get it
this is the receiver where does this go
ok stores right alongside magnets again
big magnet beam here I see you can go
parking spot as they call it you can go
with the palm rest mat put that on the
palm rest of your laptop and then you
get a little folding mouse mat probably
something peel off it interesting yeah
it is sticky but not let me see you it's
kind of like a friction stick ah so
there's a little stylus nib I guess that
helps with the tracking the tiny little
nib there let me ask you a question nibs
or regular licorice like Twizzlers
really something go like this ah that is
very strange
hahaha am I used to it no not yet
the little Swift point GT little Matt
I'm going to put it here whoa this is
the kind of thing where you're gonna
have to adapt essentially your standard
mouse-click what does the other one's
going to probably be right click yep
that's a right-click let's try out the
scroll wheel real quick oh yeah she
Scrolls my hand feels like it's cramping
already somebody with a smaller hand
than mine or maybe I'm holding it oh
maybe it's more oh maybe it's more like
how was that guy holding it oh you hold
it like a 10 you know what that feels
better okay yeah hmm not bad I don't
know what am I gonna say it's very hard
to adapt to something this miniscule I
don't know if you've got a nice trackpad
on your laptop you're probably doing
just fine that's my opinion
does it suck I mean does the job it's
not for me
it's cool that they were able to fit it
all in this tiny little package but what
can I say it's not for me oh oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
