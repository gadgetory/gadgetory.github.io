little update video because I haven't
been uploading very frequently in fact
it's been I think over two weeks since
the last upload and you're probably
wondering where the hell is Lew is he
dead no I'm not dead in fact I have a
good reason for the delay on videos and
that's the fact that I moved recently
I've also got a sore throat which is
kind of affecting the voice a little bit
but most importantly I moved to a new
office space and that's where I am
sitting right now I posted a couple
pictures on Instagram and a lot of you
were asking for a quick tour so even
though the space isn't set up yet I
figured I would show you guys around and
maybe get some of your feedback on how
you think it should be set up right
about now we have half of the equipment
from my old office sitting here
so once the rest of it comes over you'll
see a lot more in the video Department
I've got a lot of stuff coming up
including a new video on the new Moto X
that's a lot of news in that last
sentence so stick around for that but
anyways let's do this quick little tour
and I'll show you guys around new bigger
office space which should hopefully help
in the production of certain videos that
require more space that you don't know
about yet I'll probably put a couch or
something maybe over there or maybe
somewhere else because there's a lot of
space in here compared to my old space
the entrance is over here we are on the
second floor right now so yeah there are
some stairs to come up a little bit of
artwork on the walls some computer gear
some stuff that's still in boxes
unfortunately my little mini setup
that's happening right now on the far
side what's nice about this office is
there are windows that essentially go
across the entire space even throughout
those private offices that you see on
that side there so during the daytime
you get lots of natural light it's
nighttime right now and it's great to
work with natural light it's a little
bit more inspirational than fluorescents
these are cool though these lights are
LEDs and they give off a really nice
color temperature and they look way
cooler
than a drop ceiling with florescent
lights and there's some LED bulbs as
well in here is the first dedicated
office private office and this is the
smallest one over here you'll notice
some plywood on the wall I have a
feeling that the previous tenant had a
number of flat panels mounted because
these pieces of plywood exist in a
number of the different rooms so I will
probably do the same flat panels
everywhere we have a closet I guess one
cool thing is that they have wired up
the whole space for Ethernet so there's
a switch in there and if I want to do
wired connections I can in here is a
small kitchen not too exciting still
waiting for some minor appliances like a
microwave or a mini fridge I got to put
a couple things in there over here we
have the first bathroom which has a
shower that's kind of unusual for an
office space but why not and then we
have a another bathroom for some reason
which one should I use that's going to
be the daily debate there's another
entrance on this side and another office
this one's a little bit bigger than the
first one I showed you so there's this
one over here once again it has that
plywood on the wall and in this case
they even wired it up
electrically so electrically that makes
sense so you don't have to run power
down to the floor or closer to the floor
so definitely going to put a big flat
panel in there and really the objective
here with all this extra space guys is
to do some dedicated sets for the
different shows I want to do some of you
know about my new channel more top 5 and
in the past I've just been shooting it
in the same location as the unbox
therapy videos but I want it to have its
own character so maybe this becomes the
more top 5 studio maybe we do it a
different color different backdrop
something to give it its own unique
personality this is the office I'm using
right now for my computer I think it's
the biggest one actually in the space I
have a very basic setup happening right
now as you can see just my Mac Pro some
speakers some headphones very basic just
doing some editing
on there right now and hopefully I'll
fill out this space too with some of my
items that I want to have oh look you
have another flat panel mount so I'm
probably gonna put I don't know a big
screen they're running Google Trends all
day so I can see what's happening on the
web some news and then use it for gaming
or god knows what else one cool thing
here is that you can see from the desk
location out to the rest of the office
so if somebody comes in or someone's
shooting something out there you can see
what's going on I thought that was a
cool feature that's why I set up my desk
here at least for now
um that's about it so that's a quick
little tour of the new office space as I
said if you guys have any cool ideas for
how I should use it let me know down in
the comments but the main objective here
was to have a bigger space so that the
space itself doesn't dictate the kinds
of videos that I would make instead
whatever comes to my mind or in my
imagination or if I want to experiment
with certain things then I have the
space to do so and potentially to add a
couple more people too if there are
like-minded individuals who you know end
up helping out with the expansion the
growth of the unbox therapy / more
top-five Empire if you haven't checked
out my new channel go ahead and check it
out I'll link it down in the description
but like I said the objective is to set
up dedicated spaces for both channels so
that they have their own personality
alright back to my comfy chair now the
only spot where it's sitting in the
whole office currently thanks for
watching guys more content coming
shortly as I said before all right later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
