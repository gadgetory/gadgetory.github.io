less um unwieldy unwieldy difficult to
carry or move because of its size shape
or weight I'm recording this so now it's
going to end up in the damn thing what's
up guys Lew here back with another video
and today it's going to be three cool
tech deals it's been a little while
since we've recorded one of these it's
also been a little while since I've
uploaded a video feels good to be back
feels good to be in need the seat so
we're going to talk about tech deals and
I try to keep the price down on
everything so that it is easily
approachable for you the viewing public
my favorite people on the planet
for clicking on videos with your finger
like this kicking it off with a laptop
stand in amazonbasics
ventilated adjustable laptop stand to be
more specific I have used these things
in various iterations throughout all the
different setups I've had along the way
this one is actually adjustable so it
has a couple of different heights
depending on what works for you a little
bit of cable management on the back as
well very basic adjustable light
ventilated 15 bucks regular 25 and if
you're a heavy-duty laptop user then
getting the surface the bottom surface
of the laptop up off the desk can
actually increase the ventilation
keeping your temperatures down and I
think for 15 bucks it might be or the
try especially if you want to add that
second monitor like I said before and I
love monitors Jack's problem is not
monitors his problem is when I leave for
too long and he gets lonely
god knows what Jack might do if he's let
loose and expected to live amongst the
public Jack's a bit of a creep all right
next deal we have you're gonna think I'm
weird for loving this thing I am weird
for loving this thing 1/8 outlet pivot
surge protector
I am super into cable management in an
unhealthy way if you've seen pictures of
my setup you know that you can't see a
single damn cable and that's the way I
like it the outlets pivot and allow for
you to fit every single little strange
power brick that you have on to this one
solution it's a little bit expensive
it's 20 to 97
you might be thinking dude I'm gonna
head down to Walmart and get myself one
of those $8.00 joints and I'm gonna live
my life you can go for that you can live
your life you can use the extra money to
to get some of those goldfish crackers
but if you want the most efficient that
I have bumped into in terms of surge
protectors this is it right here this is
my favorite they also make a six port
version for 15 so if you don't need all
eight you can get that pivot version I'm
talking forever on this video apparently
I'm unfamiliar with the fact that these
are supposed to be short let's keep it
moving
next up this one's kind of cool and
different and that's why it's in here
this is called the Newmark DJ to go
ultra portable USB DJ controller and it
sort of does what you might think it
does it's like a basic entry-level way
to mess around with mixing your music
like as if you're some kind of Skrillex
this is 39 bucks and it gets you in the
door I think that's pretty cool it comes
with a little bit of software Virtual DJ
le lights but it'll also work with other
slightly more professional software if
you want to go that route but as you can
tell it's going to give you some tactile
control and this could be a cool way to
get into the DJ scene if I was new to
the game and I wanted to mess around
with something in the DJ world this
might be a place to start now
I have one last thing to mention even
though it's not part of the three deals
it's just something I want to mention
real quick on Amazon right now there are
a ton of iPhone 6's cases that are up
for grabs even before the release of the
device the dimensions have changed ever
so slightly as I told you
in the first video where I examined the
back casing it's a little bit wider a
little bit taller tiny little fraction
of a difference but for cases it matters
because all the little things have to
line up the buttons and whatnot so if
you want to put a case on it there are a
bunch of cases available from like eight
dollars to 20 dollars for the 6s
specifically the 6s and of course the 6s
plus so you can order something and have
it there in time for your iPhone 6s
shipment so I'll link that down in the
description as well actually everything
will be linked down in the description
that I talked about so you can go visit
those pages and check them out and if
you if you get anything if you buy
anything off this three cool tech deals
show tweet me tweet me a picture of it
I'll retweet people who pick up some of
this stuff hopefully enjoy it thanks
very much for watching I'm happy to be
back I'm happy to be in my green chair
this is where I live they bring me food
a bucket of fish heads and a milkshake
check chocolate vanilla or strawberry
instantly Vanilla's gone oh wow just no
love for the strawberry from Jack
question for the audience on the way out
milkshake what's it gonna be chocolate
vanilla or strawberry let me know down
in the comments that's it I'm out later
guys
that is so disrespectful to strawberries
everywhere your strawberry shaming right
