in front of me I'm told to hit this
button to unveil the brand new D brand
grip so here we go oh my here we have
the grip installed on an iPhone 10 so
the reason for this package is because
of the technology inside of the
nudibranch grip
it's called d3o and it's in this
container right over here this is a
patented material which is like nothing
I've seen and you're gonna understand
why in a moment here you probably also
can see that I've got a mallet and you
know I'm gonna be inflicting some damage
hopefully this material here can stop
the damage from happening it looks like
some kind of slime or goo but that's its
resting stage and that I mean that's
satisfying on its own I might just go
ahead and do that if you I mean the hole
up and down and well you know I have a
thing for that so this is the magic
right here and it is quite strange your
standard slime or goo but you'll notice
that as it kind of falls down under its
own weight there's something that's
that's satisfying right there it's
almost like liquid this allows this
stuff to be formed into various shapes
and be used in all types of different
equipment including hockey equipment
when force is applied to which the
molecules bunch up look at that they
bunch up and they become resistant so
it's soft to my touch
I can easily poke it but when force is
applied
look at that it completely changes its
behavior so the scientific term for this
type of behavior is called non-newtonian
now I know what you're saying I've seen
this stuff before
it's called Oobleck it's cornstarch and
water no no no no that's not what this
is that material it liquefies way faster
and because of that can't really be used
in commercial applications like a phone
case now you've seen this mallet sitting
over here and you know I'm not gonna
tease you like that I'm gonna need a
participant I'm gonna need a volunteer
and a volunteer we have ladies and
gentlemen it's been a while
say hello to your favorite guest here on
unbox therapy although Willie do will
dispute that his name is oh yeah Moe is
going to wrap his hand in the d3o and
I'm gonna get the old one-two cuz that's
what you wanted you're sick you're
twisted
so you want this stuff in your life it's
obviously very cool and you can get it
in the d-brane grip it's in the corners
here there it is
you're getting this same tech right here
but in grip form you probably also
noticed the new black camo and changes
depending on the angle that's kind of a
cool look so the grip is on IndieGoGo
right now it's got like two three days
left in the whole concept here is you
pick a skin you put a skin on your
device and then you put the grip around
the outside it's also super grippy as
the name implies it's not gonna slide
off of a surface it's easy to hold on to
and so on that's where it gets its name
from you're not giving up your click
there's no click sacrifice click four
days there oh baby all right I'll just
be this be here for a bit starting up my
new channel it's gonna be a slime
channel it's called a pivot alright
somebody's got to be thinking about the
future of unbox therapy No yeah alright
goodnight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
