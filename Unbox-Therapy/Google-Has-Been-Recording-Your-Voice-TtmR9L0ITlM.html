private conversation in the United
States according to Wikipedia states
that currently required that all parties
consent to the recording include
California Connecticut Florida Hawaii
Illinois Maryland Massachusetts Montana
Nevada New Hampshire Pennsylvania and
Washington what's up guys Lew here back
with another video this one is a bonus
clip for today I got a phone call from
Ryan he said dude you have to make this
video because apparently very few people
including myself know about the behavior
of their phones mostly on Android phones
essentially what's going on here is that
there are circumstances in which your
phone is recording your voice in your
conversations potentially without you
knowing it what launched into your
browser and simply open up history
google.com this is stuff you'd expect to
see like history for your searches
history for location data and all that
goodness but the new one an emerging one
is the voice related history over here
on the left hand side voice and audio
activity and as you can see here there's
all these different events that have
been recorded now in some cases it's
working completely as you would expect
as it's meant to function where it's
it's creating a record for a search that
you've done with voice to help with
future recognition of my voice on my
device but since you've got hot words
things to trigger Google itself and the
audio portion of it like okay Google you
might have recordings like I am here
that - what
the guy I don't remember triggering
those events I've gone through my
various accounts now I'm finding these
weird conversations I can't even recall
that are recorded here historically whoa
I don't know it makes me feel a little
weird if you like me might be partially
creeped out and want to remove some of
the things that you've said that may
have been recorded you can head over to
history what I say history google comm
what is a hundred years of this look
like I don't know
there you have it go check for yourself
let me know in the comments what you've
been saying that Google's been recording
you don't need anything else he's just
enjoying this goddamn french fries you
want to join too why am I getting more
quiet now you're pitched</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
