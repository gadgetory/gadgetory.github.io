[OPEN]</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2013-05-23</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykKuHaIXGuc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">what's up guys Lew here and this is just
a quick update video to remind you that
this Saturday we are capping off this
amazing month of giveaways with the
biggest one yet which is of course the
MacBook Air I really want to warn all
you guys I don't want anyone to miss out
it's happening in the same place at the
same time 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time over on
you now the link is down in the
description all you need to do is click
that link and you'll be ready to go you
do want to login though that makes sure
that you have less to do when the
giveaway actually occurs at 7:00 p.m. on
Saturday if you're not in the eastern
time zone then you can use a little tool
there's a link in the description to a
tool to convert the time for yourself
this is happening in under 48 hours at
the point that I'm filming this so
that's just why I'm saying it's your
final warning
other than that there's not much else
you need to do you just need to be there
for your shot at winning you probably
will want to follow me on the social
networks my social networks as well
that's a smart move because if anything
goes wrong I will be updating those
spaces with all the information you need
to make sure you don't miss out on the
giveaway so that's Facebook Twitter and
Google+ I will put those links down in
the description as well really all the
information you need is down in the
description now for some of you that are
constantly asking questions like why is
this giveaway not happening right on
YouTube why do I have to go to a
different site to participate and the
reason is because you now happens to be
the sponsor and for those of you that
don't know what that means it means
they're providing the prizes I couldn't
afford to give away this many major
prizes in one month it would just be
impossible without sponsorship and so in
order to you know for them to get their
end of it to show support etc people
need to go over to their site and
participate so it's pretty
straightforward the way this operation
works they're providing the prizes so
you got to come there to participate I
still think it's an awesome opportunity
and especially when we're talking about
a MacBook Air which is a huge prize in
terms of odds you're talking about you
know maybe one in three four or five
thousand people comparative to like a
YouTube giveaway where there might be
fifty thousand comments this is a much
better likelihood a much better chance
of winning so it's definitely worth
participating as I said earlier all the
links are down below everything you need
to know is down below and I'm excited to
just give away a gigantic prize a huge
rise to one lucky viewer so if you
haven't come out to a live show before
this is the time to do it you know just
booked off I don't know an hour on
Saturday and then get back to your daily
activities after that anyways thanks for
all your support thanks for watching
thanks to you now for making all these
amazing giveaways possible if you guys
appreciate these giveaways as well
please make sure to leave a thumbs up
down below other than that I will see
you guys at the livestream possibly
before that on another video but anyways
this is your final warning alright guys
thanks for watching later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
