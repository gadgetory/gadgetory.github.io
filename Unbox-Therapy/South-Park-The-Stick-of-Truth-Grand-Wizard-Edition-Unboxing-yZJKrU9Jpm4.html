here back with another unboxing video
today we have a video game heavily
requested you guys wanted me to get back
into collector's editions when they're
available I always want to jump on them
and get unboxing videos for you guys
because I do enjoy the collector's
editions of games when they're available
sometimes I forget to preorder if there
is anything that I have missed that you
guys think would be a good unboxing
video in terms of collector's editions
for games leave a comment down below
with your suggestions but today is
dedicated to this South Park long
awaited the stick of truth this is the
Grand Wizard edition so the top of the
line Edition and something I'm
specifically excited for is this figure
here which is manufactured by kid robot
who makes very high quality high end
figurines and this one of Cartman
obviously so let's go ahead and get
inside the box and take a closer look at
what is included so I'll go ahead and
just slice the bottom here you can see
on the top here we have South Park stick
of truth Grand Wizard edition on the
back I should show you that real quick
this is what's included so you obviously
have the kid robot Grand Wizard Cartman
six inch figure there's also a
hand-drawn map of the South Park Kingdom
and then there's some DLC some digital
stuff as well the ultimate Fellowship
pack which gives you the necromancer
sorcerer Ranger elf rogue assassin and
the holy defender all right let's get
inside I think that's all we have to see
on the outside of the package so the
first thing is obviously the figure
which is the largest I'll put that to
the side for just a moment and then we
have the game right here I'll put down
as well and then lastly the map should
be in here too so here is it's like a
kind of a rugged material maybe water
resistant or waterproof or something has
like a a coating on it so it's more
durable than just a standard piece of
paper so here
have the entire South Park Kingdom as it
were and you know you could get a better
look at what's going on here UFO rich
people are up in this section over here
hippie food if you're interested Church
anyways you get a better idea there of
what this map looks like one sided as I
said a durable material
I've come to sort of expect this type of
material in the collector's edition
unboxings you don't want to just get
like a standard little piece of paper
that could rip easily I guess let's get
inside the game next maybe I don't know
if there's anything extra in here
besides the game itself but we might as
well just open this baby up just to be
sure so here's a little bonus for you
guys you want the DLC be the first to
register this code right here there you
have it always getting extra little
bonuses on unbox therapy good luck go
now everyone's seeing it at the same
time also a little manual little booklet
here straightforward stuff not much in
there and of course the game disk check
it out alright so lastly we have the
most exciting aspect of this unboxing of
this edition and that is this guy right
here our Cartman figure and as I said he
is oh we gotta get it open
he's manufactured by Kidrobot
world-famous oh there's tape there's
tape of course this tape world famous I
don't want to say toy manufacturer
figure manufacturer I guess you could
say toy I don't know some people get
really specific about what you're
supposed to call these things toys
figures figurines action figures statues
everybody's got a special way of saying
it so there he is
wow he's pretty large
that's cool I don't know his hands do
articulate a little bit see that you can
move a little bit not much and then on
the bottom if you could see that
hopefully there you go kid robot logo so
you know it's legit 2013 Comedy Partners
and of course the staff which he holds
right here right like that so you have
it ready for battle
Cartman figure kid robot cool so that's
the first collector's edition unboxing
in a little while
hope you guys enjoyed it I'm gonna go
play this game now hopefully have some
laughs if you guys are interested in
checking out this edition or the game in
general I will drop a link down in the
description so you can see the pricing
