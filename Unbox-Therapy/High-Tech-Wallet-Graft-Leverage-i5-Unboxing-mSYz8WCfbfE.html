going to take a closer look at the
leverage from graft concepts first
glance it looks like your average
everyday iPhone 5 case but it actually
features a modular design so you can
swap out the backplate and install a
wallet accessory that's what I'm most
excited about so I can get rid of this
big bulky thing that I've been carrying
around for the last little while so
let's go ahead do the unboxing install
it and I'll show you guys how it
functions so the first thing you're
going to notice when you take a closer
look at the leverage case for iPhone 5
is this unique locking mechanism in the
top corner which will probably remind
you of a high-end watch clasp or
something along those lines it's really
unique and unlike anything I've seen on
previous iPhone 5 cases or phone cases
in general actually and that's part of
the reason you're watching this feature
video right now I don't normally do case
videos but this one is so different that
I thought it would be useful and
potentially valuable to you especially
the wallet portion I'm just so sick of
carrying around a wallet and a phone and
if this one can do both things for me
then hey I'm excited I'm a happy man so
we're starting out with the white
version of the case but it is also
available in black and the black version
actually has a slightly more matte
finish whereas the white one has a
slightly more glossy finish what you see
here is the basic shell of the case as
well as the basic backplate and then on
the far right is the wallet accessory
which I opted for for this particular
video but you don't need to get that if
you don't see yourself using that
particular portion the installation
process is incredibly simple you just
slide your phone in and then lock down
the clasp and you're ready to go now in
this case just for the sake of
instruction I'm showing you how to do it
a couple of different ways if you don't
want to use the backplate you don't need
to you could actually have your iPhone 5
still exposed like I've done right here
but more people will obviously use it
with the full protection by putting the
backplate in and then locking it down
that way with the case installed you've
still got access to all of your
important ports as well as your buttons
your speaker microphone etc the buttons
remain very tactile - which is nice some
cases when they go over top of your say
power switch or volume rocker
they don't respond as well but they've
done a great job here of making sure
they're just this tactile as if you
didn't have any case on at all let's get
to the most exciting part from my
perspective the wallet portion
installation so you lock it in just like
you would with the normal backplate but
then you've got access to four different
cards which for me is enough to carry
the daily important cards that I need to
have on me at any given time but since
its spring loaded that means you don't
necessarily need to carry four cards you
can get away with one two or three the
spring portion will push up against the
card keeping it locked in place so it
won't slide out accidentally here's a
closer look at the black version that I
mentioned earlier as you'll notice the
metal portion of the case is brushed
instead of polished like it was on the
white version and the finish on the
plastic is a little bit more matte in
finish as opposed to the more glossy
version on the white model regardless of
which color or combination you
personally prefer I've got some good
news for you
there is a limited-time promo code
available to you guys right now in the
description of this video
use code unbox 15 for 15% off your own
wallet style case so that wraps up this
unboxing and first look at the leverage
case for the iPhone 5 as you can see it
is functioning right now as my wallet
it's got four total cards in it and it
is a hell of a lot more slender than my
old bulky wallet thanks as always for
watching guys if you enjoyed this
