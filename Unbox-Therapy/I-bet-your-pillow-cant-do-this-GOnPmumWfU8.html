music I like listening to stuff podcasts
late at night if you ever caught me
relaxing or attempting to relax there
might be some audio involved you
probably also noticed that there's a
pillow in front of me
that's unusual this thing showed up I
looked at it I looked at Jack and I said
the people need to know about this it's
the I music pillow it's a pillow - plays
music with a built-in speaker listen
with comfort more comfortable than
headphones compatible with any music
player cuz it's got a headphone
connector powered by the connected
device so you don't even plug this thing
in you never knew you wanted this cuz
you never knew it existed I was onto
something
hello yeah like like right now like
you're it's recording you're you're a
part of it but but but but wait a minute
you're talking about my truck well you
can't fit you can't fit very much in my
truck this is now we're now 5 minutes
and 10 seconds into the video and most
of it is me talking to you and Jack
watching and tapping his wrist he is
really impatient these days
so what does this all mean I don't know
maybe now I'm lying down on a couch I
bring this little guy with me I'm more
relaxed than I ever was before I've
looked at all kinds of headphones
headphones you sleep with headphones go
inside your ears
maybe you're searching for some level of
relaxation that you've never hit before
nonetheless whatever it is that you're
into now it's your pillow that's
bringing it to you so let's find out
like where is the where does the sound
even cut how do I all right here we go
looks so far it looks like a pillow
there's nothing in here okay still put a
pillowcase on this I guess is a zipper
oh okay
pull this zipper up over here it only
goes partway there's a little pocket
oh my little fuzzy fibers on there so I
guess I don't know you could still be
using your device while you're lying
down how loud can this really be let's
be honest here how many speakers are in
here it's deep in there though like I
mean you would never you would never you
would never feel it it's somewhere in
the middle so no matter which side
you're on
there's plenty of padding the sound is
obviously going to have to come through
the fabric nonetheless
I think it's louder from this side I
just realized something though I think
the intent here is that you're you're I
mean you're on top of it obviously in
which case it gets a lot louder like you
gotta be you're not having a party with
this I'm gonna snap and the weird thing
is with your ear you kind of find the
spot for me I think it's probably I'm
actually gonna listen to podcast more on
something like this it's your boy Jack
so there's the craziness of the press
conference which I mean that's why he
put them on there right or for him to do
I wish it was a little bit louder yeah
sure but if you're laying on top of this
like you've done them in the morning and
you just want your day to be rests ya
know as a culture its crits it's a gift
we have nailed that by if you're laying
on top of it it's it's plenty loud
enough
oh is it for I don't know I'm not really
sure all right but most people I know
they use a pillow most pillows aren't
that cool they don't do very much so
here's one that does a little something
else it doesn't have to be plugged in or
charged and that audio is is being
powered strictly by the headphone jack
on your device that's kind of cool
actually I'm sensing the opportunity for
some high level relaxation here you fall
asleep listening to the audiobook maybe
you wake up with an elevated IQ I'm not
sure that's how it works right I don't
know is that how you study is that how
you get smarter this pillow is how you
get smarter you pass the test forget
about the textbook it's all in here I
will often listen to white noise to fall
asleep do you hear that Jack just a
little bit of white noise as a car
do it right in a pillow powered by the
cable you probably don't want to do this
if you're rocking a note 7 I will not be
held responsible I won't be held
responsible she fell in love in the
first place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
