therapy and today we're taking a look at
the beats by dr. dre tour edition
headphones they're an in-ear style
headphone available in both black and
white I paid only $99 for mine that's
obviously a sale price a little bit
below the MSRP and they do include the
control chock feature which is going to
give you the ability to you know
manipulate your volume stop play pause
music as well as answer phone calls via
an inline remote / microphone so a
pretty cool feature for smartphone
owners one thing to note there is
limited functionality for Android
devices at the moment you're going to
want to check Monster's website to find
out if your device is supported in terms
of control talk so anyways let's get
into the unboxing experience here as
with all Beats products you know you're
going to get a real nice box and a lot
of accessories included and the first
thing we're greeted with is a message on
the left-hand side that says sound
matters I sure hope so these are
earphones after all and then on the
right hand side where we've got the
actual earphones there's also a carrying
case and a little note telling you to
try out the different tips to find the
right size because this is an
interchangeable tip style earphone now
the first thing we're going to look at
is this little carrying case and it's
soft on the outside but then it's got
sort of this hard shell material that
feels like it's underneath it so it
should do a good job of protecting your
earphones when you're traveling in
transit etc and it's got a nice cuff
zipper on it as well now when you first
get the product open there's some items
that are hidden inside of this pouch
including these ear hooks here now these
can attach to the earphones if you can't
find a good fit just using the different
tips or if you just want a little bit
more support around the outside of the
ear maybe if you're using them for
exercise or something along those lines
so you know once again it's just a
matter of giving you as many options as
possible for getting the best fit you
can with these earphones these are
bendable and they do maintain their
shape once you bend them so you should
be able to find something that works for
you and below that we've got all the
different ear tips there's a number of
different sizes and styles and there's
even a little clip in there for
attaching the headset to your clothes
if you've got a lot of extra cable and
you want to sort of cut cut down or get
some extra slack something along those
lines so here's a better look at the
different tips you've got the little
tried dome style tip and then you've got
the normal ones so definitely something
to suit everybody's specific ear canal
now let's get to the headphones the main
attraction the main event that's what
you all came to see once I get them out
of this package here you get a closer
look at what the materials are that
they're using here as well as you know
an idea for the quality of construction
etc now the very first thing you're
going to notice is there are metallic
components on here that's always a good
sign not too much plastic on the actual
earphone and the other thing that's cool
is you've got this flat style cable and
that's going to mean that you're going
to see fewer tangles at least in theory
and so far I haven't seen very many at
all so it should help with that
you know most earphones have these
little puny cables and they're very easy
to get tangled up especially when you're
traveling with them here's a better look
at that inline remote slash microphone
once again it's going to function with
your iPhone or Blackberry straight out
of the box and then you've got monsters
right angle connector which I always
appreciate the right angle connectors
especially this one because it's super
slim and you've also got a little choke
in order to get a tighter fit around
your face if you don't want to have the
cables down there dangling now as with
any unboxing there's a lot of paperwork
included I saved the paperwork until
last you've got a little monster catalog
as well as the official manual here and
it basically explains how to get a good
fit get a good seal within your ear
canal and the reason that's important is
because that's what's delivering the
bass or the frequency response is
getting that that real nice seal
otherwise you're going to get sound
bleed leaving the ear canal and you're
not going to get that full range that
the earphone is capable of anyway guys
I'm enjoying these earphones right now
I'm using them actually to record this
audio I mean I haven't listened to all
kinds of music yet but at this point I
am impressed especially for 99 bucks if
you can find them at that price anyway
