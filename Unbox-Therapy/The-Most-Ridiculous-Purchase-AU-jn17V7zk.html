been waiting for something incredible
amazing outlandish
let's go check it out
so today is an unusual day because it's
not every day that you have a phone
sitting in front of you with a retail
price of $2,500 now you're probably
thinking for that price it's probably
got the latest specs it's probably got
the greatest camera the fastest
processor well if that's what you
thought you you're probably wrong the
device in front of me is expensive for
other reasons primarily to do with this
on the top of the box here Lamborghini
that's right it's the latest Lamborghini
phone the alpha one for the Alpha the
alpha male it might be you this thing is
being sold in two stores in the world
alright it's being sold in Harrods in
London and is being sold in some mall in
Dubai this is not for everyone wait a
second is that a leather ish texture it
is bit of a presentation Italian leather
it cannot be luxury without carbon fibre
a fingerprint sensor we have a 20
megapixel camera a badge on the bottom
Lamborghini alpha one because you
deserve it it's got a headphone jack on
the top I'm noticing something right in
there you see that little dot there is
that some kind of defect that I see
how mad are you here the alpha-1
speakers on the bottom capacitive
buttons USB type-c on the bottom there's
been a substantial price decrease in the
lamborghini series of phones here this
is $2,500 but the last version was 6000
a power brick probably Oh what's going
on here there's nothing in here there's
nothing in there it has the power icon
is that why they included that in the
box what a letdown okay fine they sent
this this one here that's not gonna that
wouldn't have fit in there
Jack please help me here man this is
incredible in the main box there's no
charger they send it separately okay
also in the box I'm hopeful another
empty box this is supposed to be the
cable so I guess the cable that you get
with that this is some kind of a rebrand
like they just panic and put the badge
on there the Lamborghini sim tool look
at that you can't have a luxury product
without a warranty card okay there it is
powered by Android is it possible to own
a phone like this without an actual
Lamborghini this boot-up is a little
slow by the way
oh the car sound there's a theme going
on here to tie it all together
of course the stock background looking
sort of like the dash in a Lamborghini
itself there you go
never forget the bull this here all
looks familiar
I mean the speakers are forward-facing
that's good I've been asking for that oh
can I say something real quick here
the Professor X thing a whole Lee mole
people lost their minds the Saint
Professor X is not telekinetic strictly
telepathic go back to the comic books I
went to the wiki the Marvel wiki a
marvel calm and yes there's evidence
there have been cases in which he has
moved things Lowell Apple telekinetic
but he's moved things before including
in some situations his wheelchair which
was hovering how do you think it was
every anybody who's ever owned a MacBook
you've seen it you've known about it
you've just connected your charger and
not even we got a 1440p display here is
the previous Lamborghini phone around
6,000 bucks there are some similarities
here to be honest I think that no one it
looks a little nicer so it's less shiny
the leather has a more matte finish to
it it's a little bit less bulky as well
not that I mind a little bit of bulk to
a phone but this one is overwhelming I
mean they're both obviously insane
optical image stabilization live photo a
manual mode slow motion and the magic
exposure modes okay very loud focus beep
there kaboom and a very loud shutter as
well you could probably get a phone with
these capabilities identically for like
a couple hundred bucks obviously it's
not about what's inside it's about the
logos and the leather you've had some
pretty high caliber selfies recently
including the unbelievable rear camera
selfie from the meizu pro 7 plus go
check that out I think it's the only
device on the market capable of that at
least in the way that they've
implemented it
oh hey nope
here we go front-facing camera hello
there Shaboom
it looks like the beauty moded me by
default there's a beauty thing happening
am i complaining of course not there you
have the real version this is a 5.5 inch
qHD display the camera on the back as I
mentioned before is 20 megapixels it's
got a Snapdragon 820 in it 64 gigs of
storage which is expandable
I should probably pop out the SIM tray
here just to show you okay so it's one
of those dual I mean this should be on
every phone you shouldn't have to spend
$2,500 and you don't many phones
shipping with this nowadays a relatively
large battery 30 to 50 milliamp hours
and some people that are trying to
defend the price point of this device
have stated that it's got a pretty
decent built-in DAC for headphone users
but there's other phones that do that
for a lot less money phones from LG
phones from ZTE with incredible DAX
built in so for me that's not a huge
differentiating factor the reason you
want a phone like this is because of
that guy right there that little guy
right there that word and probably the
brand name or something to do with it
the fact that it's the Alpha the fact
that you've got so much money boatloads
in fact the $2,500 for an under spec
phone doesn't even bother you alright
that's who it's for that's why it exists
you can choose to H or you can choose to
understand I don't know what more can I
say
what more can I say it's the Lamborghini
phone and to be honest I'm kind of glad
it exists I don't know why something for
everyone I guess it's a little bit of
fun it makes the noise of the car
starting up when you turn it on I mean
it's obviously ridiculous but why not
let somebody have it let them live a
little bit question time so here's one
from someone called Pro potato
do you think the real iPhone 8 is going
to have the same design as in the
mock-ups I think it's gonna be very
close if not identical some of the
latest leaks that we've seen I have
boxes full of cases sent to me by
companies that are incredibly confident
that that's what the iPhone is gonna
look like so much so that they've got
all the marketing material printed out
the cases themselves have been
manufactured and the packages that the
cases are in so because of that I have
to say I've got a pretty high level of
confidence that the iPhone is going to
look like those mock-ups at least for
that special version the iPhone Edition
or X or whatever it is that they end up
calling it unbox therapy what is your
dream car if you have not already gotten
it and you know to be honest I think
people they get a little bit crazy about
cars I am more of a simple guy which one
would you prefer a digital wash or a
mechanical watch here's the thing a lot
of people they've noticed I've had this
g-shock on my wrist for years and I love
it it's durable the battery never runs
out and I just I don't know it feels
good there it's it I don't feel I don't
feel like I have to be gentle with it I
can bang it against things and it's
light enough that I hardly notice it
I've also got kind of big wrists so I
like to have a chunky watch on there and
for as long as I can remember I've just
gotten comfortable with the g-shock
layout I just want the time we can do
some other things as well the many years
of testing all the different
smartwatches and even wearing some fancy
ones I always come back to the
familiarity of the casio g-shock like I
said I'm a simple guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
