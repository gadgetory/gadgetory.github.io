today four boxes of the hot new watch
SmartWatch called tick watch they were
on Kickstarter they raised a boatload of
money for a more affordable SmartWatch
okay that works on both Android and iOS
and it comes in a number of different
variations they're around 200 bucks
depending on variation to kick it off
onyx black that's good that's a good
start what else we got
oak charcoal and black and snow white
snow white the Seven Dwarfs what happens
in that story it's bad news right mirror
mirror on the wall who's the fairest of
them all ooh you can see you got a watch
face Illustrated on there with a sticker
so you can get an idea oh how about that
Jack it's been a while
silica gel that was fun we haven't done
in a while this is nice look at this
they got the little pillow in there kind
of rubberish it's a more sporty finish
there is also a heartrate monitor on the
bottom water-resistant pedometer sensor
yes proximity sensor heartrate tickle
touch tickle touch is kind of like a
main attraction here on the tick watch
microUSB charger a little charge bass
drops on top it's got a little magnet so
it finds the right spot and then over
here that's where your microUSB will
connect nice little watch experience we
got other options here a metallic top on
it brown leather band as well that
smells like real leather man this box is
a little bit different oh it's a little
bit fancier this one this one has a
metal band on it if you're like Jack you
put the suit on every so often you go
out you pretend you're on a date because
you can't get a real one you're just
slurping up your spaghetti it's the
single candle and the bed
you'll figure it out one day jack these
bands are actually interchangeable as
well
pinch yeah look at that now obviously if
this isn't the size of your wrist you
add or remove a couple of links a little
charge base you got a little bedside
clock it's time to get up yet no it's
not noon yet get to eight hours okay you
need it to grow up big and strong they
might tell you you have school and
homework listen to me instead you snooze
you lose that's the reverse of what I
was saying I think if you snooze you win
extra links and a tiny little
screwdriver this is black on black
what's it going to be for you which
style would you go for immediately it
tells you to tickle the side got a mint
that makes me feel a little bit
uncomfortable but it's actually it's
actually pretty cool over here this is a
touch sensitive area you can see how I'm
doing that it's very reactive as well
download the tick wear app this is
obviously gonna be for the fitness stuff
as well it's a little QR code there what
you want to do is just line up pair it
up set up new to see it's got a pretty
classic looking face on there right now
but I mean there's a ton here whatever
you want I don't know whether some
flowers if you won't get fancy there's
some modifications you can do right on
the watch but also within the app if I
click on watch face you can see I mean
here you can also download extra watch
faces if you want something different
than what Spri included there let me go
with the sport one okay cool so it's
been swapped out now you can set which
notifications you want to see on the
watch and how often you want to see them
can also block app notifications from
certain apps that keep pestering you
your battery indicator for not just the
watch but also the phone also in here
network settings it looks like this
thing can directly connect to Wi-Fi as
well Jack why don't you send me a text
or something okay so scrolling over to
the right is where your apps are going
to live dialer calendar hell is the one
I want to try right now click start my
test
telling me to keep still right now 48 I
mean I'm pretty relaxed right now let me
try this your voice is coming through on
the speaker of the SmartWatch so now the
entire world is hearing you go ahead and
say hi well I mean that was a real-world
test we had the phone call come through
the speaker on the SmartWatch I answered
that call and it works I'm getting
dinged up oh it's got a voice recorder
in it I think they put a little package
together here works on iOS works on
Android bunch of different designs to
choose from and most importantly
affordable more affordable that's the
game plan listen does it have the
prestige the prestige of your Golden
Apple watch maybe not but that's not the
game playing that's not the only game in
town and maybe you don't want to spend
that kind of dough do you deserve to get
your notifications on your wrist still
yes according to tick watch you do now
whatever's in those notifications I
can't help you with that
all right if your girlfriend's breaking
up with you on your watch I can't be
held accountable she's probably got a
good reason though all right step your
game up kids</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
