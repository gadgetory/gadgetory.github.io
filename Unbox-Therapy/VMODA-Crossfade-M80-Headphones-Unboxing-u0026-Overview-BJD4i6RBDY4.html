therapy and today we're taking a look at
the crossfade m80 headphones from v-moda
these are in on the ear style they're
noise isolating not noise canceling but
they do feature a metal construction
that looks fairly durable and the
reviews i've read so far and these
headphones have been incredibly positive
so I'm excited to actually try them out
myself if you're interested in pricing
and availability they are a lot less
expensive than what they originally
retailed for you can get about a hundred
bucks off right now on Amazon so I'll
drop that link down in the description
if you're interested one nice thing here
about these headphones is that they're
black and red those are two of my
favorite colors but you can also get
them in a number of customizable
personalized colors and you can even get
custom name plates to suit your tastes
but in this case these are the stock
ones speaking of durability v-moda
claims that you can bend the cable
one-plus million times
there is Kevlar in there seventy plus
six foot drops 10 plus flat head band
bends that just means bending the
headband as you'd imagine here you can
get a look at the frequency response as
well as the unit variance that's from
one set of headphones to another they
are 200 grams so they are a fairly light
headphone and they have a rugged
45-degree plug which is relatively
unusual you're more likely to find right
angle 90 degree connectors or straight
connectors so hopefully this one is the
best of both worlds as you guys can tell
this is a premium unboxing experience to
go with premium headphones there's no
tape holding this box together instead
you cut through this legit ribbon as
well as the button portion the clasp and
then you get access to the goods here
you can see a little bit of paperwork
from v-moda on the top outlining some
technical data as well as some warranty
info these actually have a two year
warranty and something via moto calls
the immortal life program they claim
that these are virtually indestructible
they have a steel flex headband which as
mentioned earlier in this video is rated
for a number of flexes and trust me they
do feel really high quality and durable
that's for sure as you can see here you
have a little bit more paperwork and
then
you have the case that the headphones
ship in now since they don't fold flat
the case is not the smallest that I've
seen but the headphones are not huge to
begin with so it's definitely portable
it's constructed out of a foam like
material that will protect your
headphones while you're traveling it'll
keep them safe from scratches dings dust
etc on the inside of the case you have a
carabiner this of course is gonna be
used to clip the headphones to the
outside of your bag if you don't have
room on the inside or maybe you just
want to show them off I don't know
that's up to you they've also gone ahead
and included two different cables this
is important because each one serves a
different function there's a three
button microphone cable which will be
used with Apple devices iOS devices and
then there is a one button mic cable
which will be used with Android devices
and other phones that support that input
method so you're fully covered whether
you're using an Android device or an
iPhone you can use the microphone input
as well as the remote to control your
device without pulling it out of your
pocket that's a big thing that's big
deal and surprisingly it's not something
that's supported on a lot of high-end
headphones you just end up with this
inline microphone and remote that won't
work with your Android device because
they were designed for say an iOS device
instead it's a pet peeve of mine and I'm
really happy that these V motors don't
have that problem so here's a quick look
at that secondary cable this one is
black and red braided same kevlar style
you have the remote once again in the
45-degree connector so these ship with a
standard two-year warranty in case
anything happens to them but that's not
the most interesting part of the motors
customer service they've also got this
thing called The Immortal Life program
and a 60-day test drive guarantee both
interesting features that I haven't
really seen from any other manufacturer
in this space first The Immortal Life
program allows for you to trade in these
headphones for 50% off of a replacement
pair for life so no matter what happens
to these things if you run over them
with your car if you get them wet if you
smash them with a tank it really does
not matter they are still gonna get you
50 percent off your next pair of V modus
that's really really cool also they've
got a 60-day test drive guarantee that
means if you're not happy with these
even beyond the normal 30 days
you can still get the opportunity to
trade them in and get your money back so
that's some pretty cool stuff from
v-moda and it really shows that they
believe in their products and that
they're probably a superior brand
backing it up that way anyway guys that
