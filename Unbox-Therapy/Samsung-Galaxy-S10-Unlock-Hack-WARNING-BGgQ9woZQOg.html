news not that surprising really because
I kind of speculated I knew that this
was a potential problem but still
nonetheless not so excited to find out
that it turns out face unlock on a new
s10 s10 plus not so secure and and
probably less secure than I had hoped
for now when you set up the face unlock
on this device it does tell you it warns
you hey this is not that secure you
should probably use the fingerprint the
fingerprint scanner on here it's a
little bit hit-and-miss it's not the
best I've ever tried it's in the display
so you kind of adjust your expectations
for that but it's nowhere it's not on
the level of confidence that you have
say for example with a capacitive
fingerprint scanner on the back of a
device it's not on that level in my
opinion so the face unlock then becomes
kind of a compelling option I use it on
the oneplus device I've used optical
based face unlock for a while but
analysts son will comes in and he's like
you know I'll just crack your face on
like I don't care what your face unlock
I'll go on your phone if I want to and
I'm like geez will first of all
aggressive not your typical character
that you bring to the table but okay
fine give it a shot so he opens up this
just happened he opens up an unbox
therapy video on YouTube holds it up to
my phone I did not reject or redo my
registration of my face and boom it
unlocks my phone way easier then I'm
happy with to the point where now I'm
questioning even having face unlock
enabled because obviously there are
videos of my face in particular all over
the internet so anyhow we're gonna try
and do the demonstration I'm gonna try
to show you here and replicate what just
happened downstairs and show you how
face unlock is less secure than you
might expect and how you can use a
simple video in fact I'll use one of my
own videos from YouTube on another phone
to unlock the s10 that I've been using
the current one that has my face
registered okay so this is the galaxy s
10 standard version right there I have
face unlock enabled fingerprint also
enabled and then this is wills phone
over here okay that depicts will three
nice little setup going on okay so I'm
gonna launch this particular video here
put it into full screen okay you can see
it's my face it's not even the great
image of my face actually because it's
kind of in shadow there's a hat involved
so I was surprised when he was telling
me he could just unlock my my device I'm
gonna make sure brightness is up yeah
it's up okay cool and then now I'm gonna
lock this phone I'm gonna hold the video
up to it hopefully Jack can capture
what's going on here so I'll hold a
video up like this and put them
relatively close together how close did
you have it well was around here there
you go you get that Jack okay look I'm
gonna spin this around real time a video
my face is Klinger prints on the display
for that matter and the phone is now
unlocked now if you follow that you saw
it went straight from the lock screen
we'll do it again
keep it on that angle okay
boom got it face unlocked now my face is
moving around a lot in there as well I
mean it's a simple video Jack wants to
do it one more time that's twice now
that it's done it here we go boom again
immediately off the video not very hard
to do and this is a video that's
publicly available online it's just on
the YouTube channel I mean obviously
there's plenty of people that have video
of their face that exists somewhere in
people's photos and video folders and on
YouTube and on Facebook and various
other places so I knew it was possible
of course I had read in the past that
this particular technology was not all
that secure definitely not as secure as
what Apple's doing with face ID and so
on but I suppose just seeing it in
action and watching a video of myself
unlock this device first of all as well
that video I have a longer beard in it
it was a long time ago weird lights
reflections shadow from the Hat you're
like wow man yeah that's a it almost
seems a bit too easy where you start to
get a bit concerned about using the
technology at all now some individuals
might not have that much video of
themselves out on the internet you may
not be as concerned about this potential
but for those of you that are kind of
exposed in that fashion there's a lot of
footage of yourself out there in public
you know maybe you're a bit concerned if
somebody got a hold of my phone knew
that where it came from and knew that it
was mine they could unlock it just by
launching a YouTube video on another
phone no matter who you are I think
that's a bit scary so I guess this is
just a warning this is a convenience
thing understand that if you go for the
convenience of the speedy face unlock
that you can get an s10 as 10 plus
phones like the 1 plus and so on there
is this downside that it's pretty easy
to crack it so if you use it be aware
otherwise go for the alternative
authentication in the form of the
fingerprint scanner in this case in
display it does work but it's a bit of a
bummer that the face unlock is so easily
cracked I knew it was possible but
seeing it in action
it's a bit rough I gotta be honest it's
a bit unfortunate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
