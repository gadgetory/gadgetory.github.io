it here's a super straightforward 3ds
review first let's look at the 3d
cameras on the backside of the unit as
you see you can just snap a quick
picture i can't portray the 3d to you
because you do not have 3d vision unless
you've got one of these but suffice to
say the results are cool unlike anything
I've really seen before because I
haven't really had any 3d devices before
the next is Nintendo 3ds sound and this
application allows you to sequence
samples either of your voice or sounds
around you and turn them into songs I
guess now I'm not sure how many people
are gonna use this it's probably not the
reason you buy the device but it's there
nonetheless so I thought I'd give you a
quick look at it the next thing is the
me maker and if you are familiar with
Nintendo Wii then you've probably seen
these before and you've probably made a
me before and this is basically your
Nintendo version of yourself you just
input a picture and it gets you started
on the right track to creating a digital
version of you the next thing is
StreetPass Mii Plaza and this is
something that you can leave on in your
pocket and opt into and then if you bump
into other people along the road or in
the subway that also have theirs
activated you will immediately exchange
identities at least virtual identities
and you can find out a little bit about
one another and eventually network if
that's what you want to do so that's a
cool feature next we've got the AR games
augmented reality games I'm going to get
to those in a bit here's face Raiders
which is included on everybody's 3ds
it's a game where you can input your
face and go around shooting it it's
tough to display without having another
cameraman because the augmented reality
forces you to move around in circles
next we've got a little stats counter
which tracks what you've played and on
which days and which records you've said
etc here is download play it's for
people to play multiplayer against one
another if
they have the same game and system
settings of course is pretty boring so
I'm not going to go into there
I've actually got Super Street Fighter
inserted so let's go ahead and take a
quick look at that as you can see the
graphics are pretty dope big improvement
over the previous generation let's see
if I can kick some ass here I'm not sure
I'm not very good but as you can see
you've got your lower screen which is
dedicated to some of your super moves I
guess you could call them special moves
and I can't portray the 3d as I said
before but these characters really jump
out of the screen and the depth of field
is something I've never seen before in
another video game or another platform
or anything like that now people have
asked does the 3d give me a headache and
the truth is not really I mean I guess
if I play for a really long period of
time it does but then again so does
playing on a tiny screen on any handheld
so I'm not sure that it's the 3d so much
is just playing extended periods
otherwise I can handle it you can adjust
the amount and I found the sweet spot
for me is just a little bit up not all
the way activated now I'm not sure why
that is I don't think it's a matter of
more or less 3d in total I think it's
just your eyes and how far apart they
are possibly that's just a guess but
anyway it was I was good enough to win
there so that's a plus the next thing I
want to show you are the augmented
reality games these have gotten a lot of
press a lot of coverage they're fun to
play but not really the reason why you
buy this system they're just an added
plus I guess you could say you just
point your camera at these cards and all
of a sudden objects start popping up on
top of it as you can see this game here
is a archery style game you shoot at
these targets and as you move the system
the environment reacts to your movement
so you can sort of bend around and shoot
the
you need to hit again a super simple
game just a cool introduction into
augmented reality and really for me a
glimpse into something that developers
are going to be able to put to use in
games that they come out with so this
could really be cool you could imagine
first-person shooters or I mean all
kinds of stuff that would be really cool
in an augmented reality version I'm not
going to spend too much time on the
exterior of the device because I did so
much of that in the unboxing video I do
want to mention that the games are tiny
and super easy to carry around I brought
a bunch to Mexico on my vacation and
they did not add any weight to my
luggage to say the least anyway guys I
want to recommend this device it's been
a ton of fun so far there's never really
been anything like it
Nintendo's included the dock as well
which is awesome most manufacturers want
you to buy this after the fact so they
can earn a little bit more money from
you but Nintendo just went ahead and
threw it in which is perfect I really
can't wait to see what developers can do
with this technology when we start
seeing third-party games really taking
advantage of this 3d and augmented
reality this could be really crazy I
really want to give you guys an idea of
how this 3d looks even though it's
really impossible so I went with a super
close up and as you twist the screen you
can see when the stereoscopic image is
shift you shift from the left one to the
right one now when you have two eyes to
receive the image that's what gives you
the 3d concept and as you can see the
slider on the right controls just how
much depth there is or how much
separation there is between each image
anyway I hope this has been informative
check out our Channel and subscribe I
should have more 3ds coverage coming up</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
