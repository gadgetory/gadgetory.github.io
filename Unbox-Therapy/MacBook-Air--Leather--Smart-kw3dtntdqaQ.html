therapy and today we're taking a look at
a very nice piece of leather this is the
real deal
cowhide if you know what I'm saying it's
the Nommo macbook air
a leather envelope which is basically a
fancier way of saying sleeve
it has a Velveteen interior don't ask me
what that is let me tell you it's soft
and it's also got a unique tracking
system in the event that you lose it and
I hope you don't lose it because you're
probably going to have a Macbook here on
the inside so here's that unique
tracking number and you got to register
that on their website and if some really
nice person happens to find your macbook
air they have a way of getting it back
to you the inside like I said before is
super soft it's got a velvet like touch
to it and the outside of course is soft
as well because it's got that leather
finish to it you got two clasps at the
top to keep it closed and the only other
thing included in the package is this
little flyer here that tells you how to
register online and it also tells you
how to care for your leather and
basically caring for leather is pretty
easy you don't do anything to it if you
get something on it you use a little bit
of water and that's about it it's also
got a 2 year warranty which is pretty
nice so they're going to stand by their
quality here we have a newer MacBook Air
and we're going to see how she fits
inside keep in mind this is the latest
model but all models should fit so as I
guessed as I thought would be the case
it's a very snug fit which is what I
hoped for and after you go and head and
put those buttons together you get a
real tight snug fit so you can either
carry this around as is or throw it in
another bag but you're probably going to
want to show it off after you check out
these details you've got the Nommo logo
embossed some real nice stitching this
thing is pretty sweet guys anyway click
