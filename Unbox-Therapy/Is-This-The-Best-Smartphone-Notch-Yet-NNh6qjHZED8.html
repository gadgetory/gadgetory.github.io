case lack thereof a not CH a more
beautiful presentable notch I think
they're calling it like a teardrop this
is the f9 Pro and it has a notch on it
reminiscent of the essential phone maybe
even a little prettier than the
essential phone that's right I said
pretty and of course the whole goal of
this is like every other notch to
increase the screen to body ratio while
maintaining a position for the forward
facing camera I actually at first glance
I kind of like this implementation it's
reminiscent of remember the movie
neverending story the princess she has
the crown that kind of comes down in the
center now this type of knotch
I think it's the first time I've seen it
outside of the essential phone it's
gonna start popping up on more devices I
think it's kind of a nice compromise if
we're gonna have a notch let's make it
as small as possible this is a kind of
mid-range device the price is gonna be
somewhere around 300 bucks when adjusted
for the US dollar this one is six gigs
of RAM 64 gigs of storage if I turn the
cameras 16 plus 2 megapixels and then 25
megapixels in the front it's a 6.3 inch
display LCD display no OLED love at this
price point 3500 milliamp hour battery
with voop
fast charge which they claim can give
you like 75 percent battery life in
about half an hour
there's no Snapdragon in here the
processor is from media tech so keep
that in mind
this one also happens to be made in
India we've included a case oh that's a
really different color set up there whoa
check that out whoa magenta to red that
is different fingerprint scanner is
where I like it on the back here the SIM
card tray which I believe is dual whoa
okay dual SIM and storage two Sims and
storage all at once oh that's really
weird it's still micro USB I'm gonna
boot this up I think this type of layout
should be adopted by other manufacturers
yes you have to have a forward facing
camera the motorized stuff is a little
iffy people are wondering if it's gonna
be reliable this might be
kind of compromise where we have a
knotch but it's not very big we have the
USB cable you see it has the Luke
identifier on there a headset
reminiscent of some other brand of
headset I'm hoping this is a speedy you
fingerprint scanner I'll put it in the
mid-range for speed it's not the fastest
I've ever tried but it's quick it's
quick enough that's for sure okay it has
face on lock as well we can give that a
shot boom boom boom it's pretty nice is
it as secure as some of the other face
unlock technologies probably not it's
just a forward facing camera as opposed
to infrared or something like that this
gives us our first glimpse at the
display it is LCD as I mentioned very
minimal in fact if you compare this to
like an iPhone 10 or something this is
almost non-existent can I get an iPhone
10 in fact so you tell me which one you
would prefer having the notch on the
iPhone has a lot more tech built in and
the face unlock should be more secure
because of that it's nice to see
something a little bit different even if
it doesn't pack all the identical
features of the iPhone knotch let's
launch a video so we can see what
happens with the knotch it bites into
your display a little bit kind of
elegant actually and of course if you
pinch out you get giant bezels but most
people are gonna watch like this the
whole phone actually feels pretty
high-quality and at this price point
that's kind of a big difference when
compared to something like the polka
phone the Oppo device here is gonna feel
a little bit more elegant and most
people I'd say if they pick them both up
would think this is the more expensive
device but if they know anything about
them they know we got snapdragon over
here mediatek over here you can't really
compare one to one I'm gonna play some
music
yeah I would say the polka phone has a
little more low-end possibly a little
more volume but there seems to be a
little more clarity on the f9 Pro
mid-to-high
sort of thing how about the camera unit
of course 16 megapixel plus 2 megapixels
so secondary lens there's gonna be used
for that bokeh effect there's some
filters and things built into the app as
well as a beauty mode now the thing is
for me
these portrait modes they're really
hidden mist there's so few of them that
I actually like to use or would even
consider using the original actually
looks a lot better to me than the
portrait version which just looks softer
in general it's not really something I'm
using on most of these phones so it's
really tough to evaluate I think it's
sort of a gimmick on most phones it's
got to be perfect or near perfect to be
usable in my mind so far there's just so
few phones that can do that on the front
facing side holy beard man yes
holy smokes all these cameras are
getting better if you so hard for me to
just grab one of these now and have it
absolutely sucked like that's not
happening anymore we used to have some
real crappy front-facing images and rear
facing for that matter blur you can't
get a good frame that's not the case
anymore men we are seeing some
improvements at all aspects it's a cool
device the story is of course the notch
here I know though it's gonna be tough
to pick this one up because the polka
phone exists with the snapdragon 84 5
and you're like what am i doing then I
get it it's a pretty phone loo it's all
looking good I get it loo but I need I
need the guts myself personally I'm not
using the infrared face unlock anyway I
don't need all those sensors up there
I'll take a nice fingerprint on the back
if you're heavy on the face unlock
you're gonna have an alternative point
of view nonetheless this is a nice
looking form-factor a nice screen to
body ratio and what is this color code
the sunrise red ladies and gentlemen
sunrise red that's a fingerprint e
sunrise the whole premium feel the whole
glass phone thing like oh but it feels
premium I don't know how
value can you put on that I've been
using this polka foam for how long now
it's like at no point of my like name I
missed the premium feel like that
doesn't cross my mind I'm just like I'm
using it I'm living I'm out here living
guys and in fact I gripped this one nice
how does it come back to this phone
follow up on this phone coming up very
shortly all right don't miss it
subscribe I got a lot to say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
