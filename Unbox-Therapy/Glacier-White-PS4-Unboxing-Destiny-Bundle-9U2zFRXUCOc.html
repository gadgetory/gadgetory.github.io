brand new unboxing video in front of me
I have the Destiny / glacier white ps4
combo bundle whatever you want to refer
to it as it's probably only gonna be
available for a limited time so if you
want to check out the availability I'll
have a link for it down in the
description but essentially we're
looking at a white ps4 along with
Destiny's included in one box I first
got a glimpse of this white ps4 at e3
actually I did a little clip on it
before we knew that it was gonna be
included in this destiny bundle and I
thought it looked pretty slick and who
knows you guys might think so as well
so let's get inside the box and find out
it's 500 gigabytes in terms of storage
and you know sony has released white
Playstations for a long time now I had
the white version of the PlayStation 3
the slim so first things first we have
the game then we have the console itself
let's go ahead get this baby pop open
that factory fresh smell I can't even
smell I got a stuff nose right now
apologize for that so here is the
controller that's kind of hmm a little
bit less white and a little bit more
gray than I expected which is cool
though I'm fine with that
very comfy and of course it's gonna
match the glacier white PlayStation 4
actually seeing this close-up now I can
really start to realize why they say
glacier it's like a slightly more
refined white not super in-your-face
bright and the contrast of the buttons
on here looks really cool in my opinion
we also have a little bit of paperwork
welcome to the world of PlayStation I've
been here before
Sony you've seen my videos or have you
we've also got our power as well as HDMI
they include HDMI now which you know I'm
a big fan of you gotta include the HDMI
cable so there it is
no more standard definition that makes
it a lot of sense you have a micro USB
cable for charging up this new
controller that I was talking about a
tiny little
to mentary headset nothing too flashy
here let's go ahead and throw this baby
in there you go my recommendation is to
get a slightly more robust gaming
headset but if you need to get chatting
you need to get online and you just
purchase this and you're on a limited
budget that headset will get you up and
running there's a power cable and this
is something that I always like to
mention on the playstation side of
things all you need is a power cable a
tiny little thing like this where has in
the xbox universe unfortunately you
still have a giant power brick and a
bigger console to begin with but it has
that tuner built in so there's a reason
for it
but I still like how sleek and small and
slim the PlayStation 4 is it's pretty
impressive so here is the glacier white
PlayStation 4 wrapped up again almost
like a grayish kind of cool a cool white
tone to it on the front you have your
USB ports ps4 logo and on the back is
where the majority of your connectivity
is of course you have your power port as
well as your digital audio HDMI you have
an Ethernet port and then a port for
your camera I might as well open this up
real quick
don't you agree see if there's any
special DLC that's my job as a
professional unboxer to make sure you
guys know exactly what you're gonna get
by this okay
expansion pass includes expansion 1 an
expansion to ok
Vanguard armory oh there we go there's a
promotion code it's not useful to you
guys first person to use it guess what
your gold a 30-day trial PlayStation
Plus who wants a 30-day trial
PlayStation Plus there you go there's
your code see I love to spread the love
that's what I do here on unbox therapy
for you guys well because you spread the
love to me by watching the videos right
that's what it's all about let me know
down in the comments if you're a fan of
the glacier white look right here or if
you prefer the black look and give me a
reason one if you've got one if you
