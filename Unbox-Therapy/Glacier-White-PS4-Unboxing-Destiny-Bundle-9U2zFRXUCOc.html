brand new unboxing video in front of me
I have the Destiny / glacier white ps4
combo bundle whatever you want to refer
to it as it's probably only going to be
available for a limited time so if you
want to check out the availability I'll
have a link for it down in the
description but essentially we're
looking at a white ps4 along with
Destiny's included in one box I first
got a glimpse of this white ps4 at e3
actually I did a little clip on it
before we knew that it was going to be
included in this destiny bundle and I
thought it looked pretty slick and who
knows you guys might think so as well
so let's get inside the box and find out
it's 500 gigabytes in terms of storage
and you know sony has released white
Playstations for a long time now I had
the white version of the PlayStation 3
the slim so first things first we have
the game then we have the console itself
let's go ahead get this baby popped open
mmm that factory-fresh
smell I can't even smell I got a stuff
nose right now apologize for that so
here is the controller that's kind of
hmm a little bit less white and a little
bit more gray than I expected
which is cool though I'm fine with that
very comfy and of course it's gonna
match the glacier white PlayStation 4
actually seeing this close-up now I can
really start to realize why they say
glacier it's like a slightly more
refined white not super in-your-face
bright and the contrast of the buttons
on here looks really cool in my opinion
we also have a little bit of paperwork
welcome to the world of PlayStation I've
been here before
Sony you've seen my videos or have you
we've also got our power as well as HDMI
they include HDMI now which you know I'm
a big fan of you gotta include the HDMI
cable so there it is no more standard
definition that makes it a lot of sense
you have a micro USB cable for charging
up this new controller that I was
talking about
a tiny little rudimentary headset
nothing too flashy here let's go ahead
and throw this baby in there you go my
recommendation is to get a slightly more
robust gaming headset but if you need to
get chatting you need to get online and
you just purchase this and you're on a
limited budget that headset will get you
up and running it's a power cable and
this is something that I always like to
mention on the playstation side of
things all you need is a power cable a
tiny little thing like this where has in
the xbox universe unfortunately you
still have a giant power brick and a
bigger console to begin with but it has
that tuner built in so there's a reason
for it but I still like how sleek and
small and slim the PlayStation 4 is it's
pretty impressive so here is the glacier
white PlayStation 4 wrapped up again
almost like a grayish kind of cool a
cool white tone to it on the front you
have your USB ports ps4 logo and on the
back is where the majority of your
connectivity is of course you have your
power port as well as your digital audio
HDMI you have an Ethernet port and then
a port for your camera I might as well
open this up real quick
don't you agree see if there's any
special DLC that's my job as a
professional unboxer to make sure you
guys know exactly what you're going to
get by this ok expansion pass includes
expansion 1 an expansion to ok
Vanguard armory oh there we go there's a
promotion code that useful to you guys
