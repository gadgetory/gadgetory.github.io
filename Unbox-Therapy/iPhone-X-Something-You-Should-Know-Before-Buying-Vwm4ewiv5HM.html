well aware there is a brand new iPhone
actually a few of them they're gonna be
hitting the streets real soon and you've
got a bunch of questions about them I
did too so I did a bit of research in
order to figure out some things that you
should probably know before you get
yourself either an iPhone 8 an 8 plus or
of course the iPhone 10 the fanciest of
the bunch now one of the things that I
discovered about those 3 devices is the
fact that they will support quick
charging hooray this of course is a
feature that many of you are familiar
with that are on other devices and what
it means is you can plug in for a very
short period of time and get a large
charge large and in charge now Apple
went ahead and quoted a 30 minute charge
time on the iPhone 10 would yield 50% of
overall battery life yes that is the
magic of quick charge plug-in and then
go but here's the thing it's not so
simple
if you've had various Android devices
you may have gotten used to the idea of
receiving the quick charger in the box
along with the phone so you could take
advantage of that feature straight away
that's not gonna be the case with the
iPhone 10 eight and eight plus they will
ship with the traditional tiny little
five watt Apple power brick this guy
here so you'll still be charging and
ultra slow speeds if you just use what's
in the box there is an advantage to this
and that happens to be the scale of it
it's absolutely tiny now you'll notice
that on the table I have a few different
products in front of me this here is a
MacBook Pro power brick USB type-c
connector on it if you connect the new
iPhones 8 8 plus or 10 to this power
brick you're gonna quick charge you have
plenty of juice here to enable quick
charging but the brick itself is not
enough because you probably know that
the iPhone features a lightning port not
a USB type-c port like this power brick
has all Apple high powered power bricks
are now type-c so you're also gonna need
this cable right here
if he USBC to lightning cable this will
take this port this output here and turn
it into something that your smartphone
that your iPhone can handle in the form
of a lightning connector now these two
boxes they look relatively simple you
might be thinking hey that's not gonna
cost me too much well it will of course
it's gonna cost you a minimum of $70 to
get the correct cable and the correct
power brick from Apple just to take
advantage of quick charging now you
don't need to get the MacBook Pro power
brick if you don't already have a
MacBook or a MacBook Pro you could get
the 29 watt power brick from Apple but
that's still 49 bucks thankfully there
are some other options on the market
like this one right here this just
arrived this is a brand new product from
a company called energy and this is a
USBC laptop adapter with 60 watts of
power plenty of power to take advantage
of quick charge on the next iPhone now
what I like about this one is it's crazy
compact so if you look on the back here
that's the entire power brick compare
that to the 87 watt macbook pro power
brick I don't have the 12-inch MacBook
power brick here it's a little smaller
than this but it's nowhere near as tiny
is this and that one supply 60 watts as
well this would be perfect for quick
charge as well for the iPhone because of
how compact it is the knife where's the
knife this is not the only high-powered
type-c power brick on the market I would
likely recommend getting the Apple
version though of the cable for
compatibility reasons I think when it
comes to the brick that's where you can
go with a third party to try to save a
few bucks look at that that's pretty
small for 60 watts
they say it can charge up a MacBook in
1.8 hours but of course it'll work with
other products 5 volt iPhone 9 volt
Android phone 12 volt USB see power bank
a gain system this looks like the
Nintendo switch a USB type-c laptop or
iPad pro another thing I like about this
the prongs they fold in what do you
think Jack is that genius or what and
then they go and then they go down they
go out they go in now I'm guessing they
probably include a Type C cable it
actually looks like - what is this
adapt for various types of laptops
alright so here's the thing obviously
you're stepping up to a bigger charger
even in this case then what's going to
be included in your box the five volt
charger if you compare the two it's
about twice as big but here's the thing
I think you're really gonna enjoy having
quick charge you know I'm a huge fan of
wireless charging but we all know
wireless charging is not the fastest so
having a quick charge option is the
perfect companion for wireless charging
I personally think it's worth it to
upgrade to a quick charge power brick
remember out of the box you are not
going to be taking advantage of that
feature so Chuck this thing to the side
get yourself one of these or use one of
these if you already have a MacBook
so you're charging your iPhone 8 8 + or
10 at the maximum capacity there's one
more thing Apple if you're listening to
me let's make this whole situation is
that much easier it's time to give up
the Lightning port alright let's just go
to USB type-c it's one power brick to
rule them all
Tim Cook I'm talking to you alright I
know we've had our differences but now
is the time to listen to one another in
peace and tranquility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
