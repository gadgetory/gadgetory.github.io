therapy today I get to live out sort of
a childhood dream better than that
because this is the new version of the
thing that I wanted when I was younger
so badly that is the original Sony AIBO
robotic dog there's a new version I'm
pumped up as you can tell it can go and
charge itself that knows when its
battery is low its nose is a camera it's
eyeballs or screens this is very
exciting okay all the way from Japan
look at the packaging first of all holy
we're about to give birth to the new
robotic pet ah this is the charging base
he's gonna walk over here and charge
himself when he's low on battery or you
can just tell him to go charge himself
if you want him to go home and lay down
over here this thing is called the eye
bone he'll go pick it up there's a
number of different instructions you can
tell him fetch it get it for you the eye
bone there's also this pink ball here
his favorite color is pink he will play
with this ball kick this ball there's
also gonna be an app available it's not
out right now but it will be out soon
that's where you're gonna be able to
reset his personality traits if you want
to or view what they happen to be you
can get photos that AIBO takes from his
nose I am excited so I'm gonna pull this
over here like this okay oh look how
cute he is already he's taking a nap I
just touch this spot on his neck here
there's a camera here as well above his
tail that's gonna be responsible for his
awareness of space the moment of truth
hopefully we have some battery in here
Oh
oh just stretch it out a little new
surroundings
ah hey over amen whoa
yeah hey he's still waking up hey Wow
his movement is crazy it is so cool it's
surprisingly animated there are so many
little actuators in here hey hey man
yeah
what's happening take a boil oh good boy
man this is weird this is good oh you
like that you like see what I did that I
both sit oh good boy
did you see that right there jack shake
hands oh hey bang bang
he's dead Oh can you get can you get
back up from there
Wow
he can get up from there I thought I was
gonna have to pick him up for sure this
is too cool this is so cool
find the bone maybe he does see it you
look in her eye the G sees you jack
yes good boy you did it yeah kick the
ball amazing there's something so cool
about watching him interact with the
real world you know a physical smart
device like that in real life it's like
you sense some kind of similarity or
connection to the actual to like an
actual pet whatever they've done here
how they developed it designed it the
number of motors involved and kind of
almost like a personality going on it's
just such an advancement on the previous
version so he responds to positive and
negative feedback things like good job
good nice good boy good girl and also
negative feedback bad I don't like it
and so on
if you touch on the head here under the
chin over here a while he likes that to
negative feedbacks on the tail here like
bad oh I have to check out whether
you're capable of getting on your
charged dog go to your charging station
hahaha man that's you cool
oh that is cool man
throughout the day I guess he goes on to
the charging station he comes off
depending on if he means battery or not
he goes back and forth just like a
regular dog taking some naps this thing
is just so cool to interact with I would
say at this point it has exceeded my
expectations the future it's all
happening look at this little guy under
the chin look at that even when he's
charging he's still happy think of the
best part
there's no no bathroom breaks
good job good boy good job good job good
job you did it man you did it you did it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
