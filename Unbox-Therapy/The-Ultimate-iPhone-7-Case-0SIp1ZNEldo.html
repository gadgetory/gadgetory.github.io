You already saw a teaser of this right here
This is an abundance of cases for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus
I'm going to try to break it down for you.
Show you what the landscape looks like...
In the world of cases for your new iPhone
One of the first things I noticed when I was handling these latest and greatest Apple products..
Is just how slippery they are!
This thing is whatever they did on the finish here,
just makes it incredibly slide-y.
There's a lot in front of me here.
Hopefully help you select the right case for your iPhone 7 or 7 Plus.
So first up the bumper case,
Drop protection from 11 feet,
What does that look like?
So it can fall from basketball heights supposedly...
That's... pretty amazing!
You've still got a physical button to press there,
the bottom has access as well.
Having given up the whole design aesthetic of the iPhone
And then it gives you that grip as well
We have the official Apple leather case
Now these aren't cheap
Made out of a real leather though
*Sniffs*
Yeah that's leather
Snaps right on pretty easily
With real leather especially this tan color..
There's gonna be some nuance, imperfections..
But this is how you know it's real leather
As nice as they look they are a little bit flimsy
So I don't know how much protection that offers up
Way more grippy than the... Stock naked iPhone
So there you have it
Holy smokes Lew are you crazy !?
Military strength protection
Like what a weird combination of worlds
Oh my...
Gadoosh!
That is... Solid
So it's like a soft shell interior which then goes into this hard exterior
Maybe you are a military minded bling type individual
What next ?
Presidio Clear
This to me looks like a - a basic clear case
So it won't yellow
It resists UV light
Have protection without completely covering up the design of your product
So you can still see you've got the matte black iPhone
And the extra protection
Look at this monster!
This is the Defender
Triple layer protection.. screen protector.. belt clip
Kind of bulks up the phone a little bit, but a ton of grip
I'm pretty confident that in a - in a case like this you are not gonna need to worry at all
You might have to worry about the case attacking you
This part clips on.. Nice and easy
And then.. Maneuver that around the outside
It's hard to say you can do better.. Than the defender
This one is a little bit different
It's from UAG and it's got a built in wallet
It's not like it got super fat because of it
On the back here.. You've got a spot for some cards
And it clips down
Hey if you are trying to eliminate your fat wallet and force yourself to only bring what you need
That's kind of cool!
Next up we've got the official Apple silicone cases
I'll open up the red one here.. Woah that - that was.. super satisfying well done
Oooooh
And on the big boy.. A ton more grip
Rep the red!
What's this one called?
Plasma.. A vibrant yellow for the boss players out there
You've got these bolts so you look tougher than you actually are
That's kinda of an interesting look right there
Now this guy is an even bigger boy
This has an armor frame
Top grain leather
2x against the military standard, and a 10 year warranty
Slides in super easy
Woooh!
I mean that's a kind of statement.. You gotta be up for that..
That's aggressive, That's rugged
But if you wanna go straight RoboCop/Terminator/Every action hero of all time
That might be your one right there
Next up we've got this product from Moshi which is kind of funny because they've labeled it as &amp;quot;Premium vegan leather&amp;quot;
Which to me is like a kind of hipster way of saying synthetic leather
This is military grade drop protection
But I bet you it doesn't smell like leather
*Sniffs*
No not at all
It actually feels kinda nice though
This one has a.. A harder shell to it
You know what..
I don't really mind that
This one is another bumper case but for the bigger 7 plus.. So same concept as the first
Another UAG one..
This is the Pathfinder
Plasma, Monarch and now Pathfinder
One.. solid piece of plastic
I mean that's just if you want a slightly more subdued version
Now maybe you want something that's a little bit less.. Kind of.. Obvious
Here's one from Spigen called &amp;quot;The crystal hybrid&amp;quot;
This is kinda cool
So that's very clear 
with a hard shell around the exterior
Phone goes in here first and then the next part kinda locks it all in
It's gonna give you some grip
This the only one we've got that can kinda have a little viewing stand to it
We got one more.. Competitor from Otterbox
This is called &amp;quot;Symmetry&amp;quot;
It's a hard shell, I'll tell you what
You drop it nothing happens.. You're not concerned
If you're kind of like a mid-range protection person and you still want that nice easy in and out
From your pocket that has you covered
The sides grip it a little bit, but not much
Let's - I wanna show you what I'm talking about with this one.. With the defender
A real breakdown of the craziness that is.. The case market
You might be able to repurpose a 6S case
But even on the 7 the camera cut out is slightly larger
What am I going to use?
Oh man this is - that's a tough one
I'm gonna go Robocop for a little bit..
Total recall.. Terminator..
Something about this one speaks to me so..
If you see me in the street you're gonna know what's up!
Pooororooobabbababa
