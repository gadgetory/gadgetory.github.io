therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Samsung Galaxy s4 the replacement
for the wildly popular s3 I know a lot
of you guys own that phone and you're
probably thinking about upgrading to
this s4 right here but before you go out
and buy anything I just want to let you
know right now I will be giving away a
galaxy s4 so if you're not subscribed
yet you might want to do that now and
also leave a thumbs up down below and we
will be giving away an s4 I'll have more
details in the next video that gets
published on the channel anyways this
video is dedicated to the unboxing this
is the 16 gigabyte model it isn't the
international version so you're getting
the quad core processor instead of that
crazy 8 core processor that part of the
world gets it features a massive 5-inch
screen with 1920 by 1080 in terms of
resolution so a full HD screen for an
effective PPI of 441 which is a crazy
figure when you think about it it's a
little bit lower than the PPI on the HTC
one but that's because the screen is a
little bit larger and really you
probably won't be able to discern the
difference that much because you're
talking about the difference between a
5-inch screen and a 4.7 inch screen in
terms of the unboxing get a little bit
of paperwork as well as a bag to recycle
your old phone courtesy of Rogers
wouldn't recommend recycling if you're
coming from an s3 but maybe you got some
really old non smartphone dumb phone in
that case do something positive with it
and recycle it you've got a USB cable
pretty self-explanatory as well as a
half decent headset from Samsung this
has interchangeable tips so you can find
the size that works best for you and
your personal ear canal it also has an
inline remote for adjusting things like
volume skipping tracks in your music etc
answering phone calls of course here are
the extra tips that I mentioned earlier
they're soft so you can easily remove
the old ones and put new ones on the
power brick is pretty much the same as
it's been for every galaxy model or at
least all the ones I can remember except
in this case it's white to match not
only the USB cable and headphones but of
course the device the s4 is also
available in a darker color it's not
quite black but almost black you've got
a fairly large battery included this is
a 2600 milliamp hour battery that's a
good thing because with a device that
has a screen this big you know it's
going to use up a lot of battery
power and that's usually the number one
battery consumer on a smartphone is the
screen so having a bigger battery and in
this case a replaceable battery is
definitely a positive thing the front of
the device also has all of your sensors
as well as your earpiece for phone calls
it has a forward facing camera and of
course that traditional physical button
that has been on Galaxy devices since
the beginning moving to the side the
left-hand side of the device is where
you'll see the volume rocker the top is
home to the headphone jack as well as an
array microphone on the back is where
you'll see the 13 megapixel camera and
LED flash this has autofocus as well
it's also capable of shooting 1080p
video at 30 frames per second on the
right-hand side of the device is where
your power slash hold switch is on the
bottom is where you'll plug in your USB
cable to charge the device and of course
your main microphone is there as well
the speaker is on the back and it's
really tiny I'm not a fan of these
backwards-facing tiny little speakers so
my recommendation if you're interested
in this device is to look for an
external solution I've actually featured
a number of them on my channel including
these two right here there's the micro
wireless and micro - these are tiny
little speakers one of them is bluetooth
and the other you plug into the mini
Jack if you don't want to use up
bluetooth for some reason these devices
will give you up to 5 hours of playback
on batteries so you actually don't even
have to plug them into the wall and the
experience is night and day having a
proper speaker instead of a little tiny
down firing solution really changes your
experience and improves the quality of
your media so if you guys want more
information on either of these devices I
will drop links down in the description
to my original feature videos so you can
go and get some more info I actually
have samples there as well so you can
see the difference between onboard
smartphone audio and a solution like
these next we'll take a closer look at
that 13 megapixel camera that I
mentioned earlier everybody is talking
about the great performance they're
getting out of this camera it is a lot
of megapixels for a smart phone so far
the samples I've seen have been quite
impressive
I actually am looking forward to
stacking this thing up against the HTC
One to get a better idea on the bottom
you have two capacitive buttons you
can't see them they're on on each side
of the physical button and here's a
closer look at the top of the device
where you can see the sensors as well as
the forward facing camera which is a 2
megapixel camera I'll give you some
closer visuals here
this of course is what unbox therapy is
famous for getting you up close and
personal with the devices that we
feature and I also want to mention one
more time before we head out from this
video that I am going to be giving away
one of these Galaxy S 4's for whichever
carrier you happen to be on so if you're
not subscribed yet now would be a very
smart time to do so if you are at all
interested in having one of these
devices for yourself I'm going to go
ahead here and open up the back of the
device as you guys know the galaxy
series means that you're going to be
able to replace things like the battery
if you have an extra one in this case
you've also got a microSD slot which is
capable of expanding your storage up to
64 gigabytes beside there is where
you'll see your SIM slot I'm going to go
ahead and install this Roger sim this is
a Rogers phone after all but it will be
available on most carriers in both
Canada in the u.s. you get it on AT&amp;amp;T on
Sprint you can also get it up here on
Telus as well as I believe it's going to
be on Fido so I mean it's available
probably on more carriers than any other
device that's currently on the market
Samsung has always been very good with
that making sure that their devices are
available at a number of different
carriers it'll also be at Verizon
eventually I don't think it's there yet
so booting up the device you go into the
setup menu I'm not going to bore you
guys with that I'll do the setup process
off-camera and then I'll give you a
quick look at the interface after all
this is just an unboxing you know
feature video we're not going to go too
in depth on this one this is just to
familiarize you guys with the device how
it operates what it looks like more than
anything and to give you guys those
visuals that you're looking for if
you're interested in pricing and
availability or more data on this device
technical specifications I'll put a link
in the description so you can check that
out here I'm using the stock browser to
take a look at the new unbox therapy
comm if you guys haven't checked out
that website yet you definitely should
we have a bunch of merchandise available
right now which is definitely worth
checking out so if you haven't seen our
new website you should definitely head
over there we've also got some deal
therapy stuff some deals that I don't
put into videos that I'm going to be
publishing on the site now I've got a
quick question for you guys if you're in
the market for a new smartphone which
one are you looking at specifically in
the Android space is it the s4 is it the
HTC One maybe you guys want to see a
comparison is it
the Nexus 4 I still think the Nexus 4 is
a great device I carry one around daily
and when you think about it the cost
performance is actually really good when
it's about half the price to buy
outright of the other two that being
said it's obviously not at the top tier
in terms of specifications everybody's
talking about the s4 and the HTC one
right now and I completely understand
why but let me know down in the comments
which one is the choice for you or maybe
you're going to hold out and you're
waiting for another iOS device maybe
you're waiting for the next iPhone I'm
not sure but I want to hear from you
guys in the comments anyways that wraps
up this unboxing video if you guys
enjoyed it please remember to leave a
thumbs up down below subscribe if you
haven't yet stay tuned for the galaxy s4
giveaway or maybe it should be an HTC
One giveaway I don't know you guys can
talk about that in the comments - all
right thanks as always for watching and
I'll catch you on the next one later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
