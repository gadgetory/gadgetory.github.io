got the latest device from one plus the
one plus 5p hmm never settle look at the
cut look at the pictures in here alright
here we go it's made out of anodized
aluminum oxygen OS based Android 7.1.1
Snapdragon 83 v adrenal 540 GPU 8 gigs
of RAM DDR 4x storage is 64 or 128
gigabytes 3300 milliamp hour battery
width the - charge quick charge
bluetooth 500 NFC enabled 6 inch 1080p
display with 18 by 9 aspect ratio and
it's also got 2.5 the Gorilla Glass 5
holy smokes
alright so it looks like I've got the
midnight black 128 gigabyte version not
complaining about that particular option
ooh
the first thing here's the device how
about that unboxing experience with the
little tray there very slick aluminum
build dual camera system up here NFC
sensor in this location moving around
the rest of the Vice we have a headphone
jack so if you want to protect that
high-end set of headphones you're still
golden USB type-c connector your power
and lock switch got your mute switch
there volume rocker up and down and I
like the minimal branding just the
subtle little one plus symbol there okay
also in this box we have Owen other--
case sim tool Quick Start Guide the good
old fashioned sim one sim - tray what
seems to be a very high quality charge
cable this plugs into the - charger so
oneplus claims that with this brick here
and a half hour charge you can get a
day's worth of battery who should we do
the face data move it a little closer
look at that so it gives you like a
little outline of where to put your face
ears and whatnot and then it just scans
it so unlike on iOS where you're kind of
doing this action you just line it up
and it grabs it ok let's try let's say
it's on the table it's locked
whoa that is that's quite quick I must
say let's try the fingerprint
and this is your usual setup here so
let's give that a shot now that might be
even faster than your face so you have a
lock device you pull it out of your
pocket the payment terminal is over
there and in one kind of motion you just
unlock it and kaboom now the display is
the next thing you probably noticed this
is AMOLED you just get a lot more
contrast it has this kind of appearance
of being super close to the surface the
OS here it has a few tweaks to it but
ultimately it's a very close to stock
Android experience though when you pull
over to the side it's a little bit
different over here on the Left pane by
default you have a memo option some
recent contacts recent apps and then a
dashboard which can show you some
details about your phone like available
storage battery life and data remaining
on a data plan now you probably have a
lot of questions about the camera
specifically the portrait mode and I
believe in order to enter the portrait
mode you swipe over shoot with portrait
to help the subject stand out so what
it's gonna attempt to do is isolate the
subject in the foreground from the
background and I can move him even a
little closer and it does so
automatically and identifies it with
this depth effect icon down on the
bottom it did kind of well with the
action figure that's kind of nice that
this is gonna probably be a better
example it did a pretty good job on the
edge now she obviously doesn't have ears
but it did a pretty decent job now if I
head back to the standard camera mode
this is where you can engage for the
secondary lens we can go ahead and zoom
in and we can drag the icon to continue
even further as you can see there I'll
give you guys a look there so you can
get a sense for the quality of our
favorite green plant oh and the
specialty coca-cola and then of course
the camera mode and we'll go all the way
up to 4k and we'll do a quick little
test the 4k 30fps setting on the 1 plus
5t little auto focus there shifted I'll
grab this guy
and as usual say hi to jab the camera
also features a pro mode if you really
want to dive in there let the ISO
readout shutter speed you can see if
it's a level shot or not
we can change is away from auto our
white balance shutter manual focus mode
and even the ability to shoot raw of
course it's also got a front-facing
camera
the selfie test kicks off in three two
one
that is a selfie whoa like specks of
dust on the sweatshirt alright cool so
far so good
now of course you know I gotta test his
speakers to protect you from laptop
hacking I think Jack needs one of these
they gave us a Canada one team USA holy
smokes thinner than I expected
it's a down firing speaker alright this
is kind of this status quo the upside
here is you have to have phone jack
now of course they've got the unique
slider for silencing this actually has
three stop points silent do not disturb
ring
do not disturb silent very nice all
right nice little touch something
special something unique since we have
all the cases here I thought might as
well do a case fashion show while we're
at it so let's go ahead and try some of
these out the Rosewood bumper case not
bad next up the sandstone protective
case this one has that kind of gritty
grippy feel to it the ebony wood bumper
case the construction will be like the
other one here we have the silicon
protective red and also the easiest to
get on and last up is the one I'm most
excited for the carbon bumper case
contains DuPont Kevlar fiber and that's
your look and this concludes the one
plus 5t impromptu case fashion show so
there you have it the five T the latest
device from oneplus let me know down in
the comments what do you guys think
about it
could this be your next phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
