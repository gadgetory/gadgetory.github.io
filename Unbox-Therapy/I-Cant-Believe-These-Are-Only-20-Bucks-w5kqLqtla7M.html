guess I'm unboxing what am i doing you
only start embarking this system I don't
like talking to a camera I want with you
so billion you can I help you sure -
uh-huh you're looking a little too comfy
there Jax did you let him did you put
him in here
just not he had what it takes to do all
this well you can at least tell them
what we're doing today huh oh we just do
the reason Tom is here today is not to
host the show I know many of you were
very afraid there for a moment I was -
if I saw him sitting over here with the
lights on and the crickets were chirping
you know this a little while back we did
a video $8 headphones versus $80 beats
now those $8 headphones I don't know
what happened to them it probably
disintegrated or something you could
hear something coming through them but
you would never tell anybody about your
$8 headphone experience but a lot of
people on that video said hey man that's
not fair like eight dollars versus 80 of
course the beats are gonna sound better
Oh
shortly after that video went up I got
some feedback and someone hit me up on
Twitter and specifically said hey Lou I
just got these headphones shortly after
having beat and I think these $20.00
headphones off Amazon can beat the beats
see what I did there with the beat the
beats
so I ordered these up right away they're
called sound in tone CX 0 5 they still
don't know why you're sitting here no no
we're not here to take part we're here
KABOOOM anyway Tom's here because he
took part in that original video and he
was kind of giving you the analysis of
like an everyday kind of person not not
somebody like me who's evaluating
products a couple thousand videos deep
but a guy who just usually sits on the
couch is this the $20 beats headphone
killer is this the end of the beats EP
will they our IP is Tom gonna lay the
beats to rest let's give him a shot look
around the box what do we have 40
millimeter drivers I think those are
exactly the same very nice these are 20
bucks for the record canvas kind of
headband the hinge is metal that folds
removable 3.5 millimeter cable no
removable cable so far I'm feeling kind
of good your braided cable I mean if I
had to guess I would guess these are 80
another point Wow
you're nice you're really shots fired I
just want to see if I put these on they
feel essentially similar whoo they do
actually feel have a really similar ear
Cup with the blindfold I'm not sure
you're gonna know the difference yeah
yeah keep it fair it was bright late
Gary Clark jr. because that's what we
listened to last time bright lights okay
here we go
you ready for round two he's on some
next-level right now you good yet let's
talk a little bit first about how you
would describe the first one versus the
second one they were pretty comparable
like yeah they're pretty equal so you
would say the sound attributes are more
similar than they are different
I felt so yeah yeah definitely if I had
to guess I would say into first but
again I don't know it was so comparable
that I could go either way did you find
the first to be more enjoyable to listen
to honestly I wouldn't be able to pick
they were both you're just putting on an
even playing field pretty much from an
enjoyment perspective yeah Wow
yeah so we may have found $20 beats
killer yeah the beats were the
first ones you heard my theory here if I
had to come up with one before listening
to them myself is I'm gonna guess that
these are probably accentuated maybe a
little more on the low end than those
are see it's funny because I felt like
on the second pairing Wow that the the
bass drum was was a little heavier and
more clear yeah I think I have to do it
myself
right yeah
can I try one more like genre I'm diving
in yeah yeah I'm kind of dive in right
now little still dre-dre sounds better
on beach I think these have a slightly
thicker sound to them I think they fit a
little bit tighter I find these to be
more comfortable I think unless you're
putting these things head-to-head like
this like a be testing them you'd be
hard-pressed to say oh that one sounds
way better than the other one a lot like
in the realm of smartphones headphones
on the cheaper side of things have
caught up a lot like once upon a time
you walk into a bet find get $20
headphones they're not very good all of
a sudden a $20 headphone has features
it's feels solidly built this is all
metal and it sounds pretty good I don't
know if these are gonna be Beats killers
but I will say this I I don't think
you're necessarily gonna get more
enjoyment out of these than these so Tom
in the last video as I said to you you
got $20 headphones you have $80
headphones they're both in the store you
can test out each one you can save the
60 do whatever it is you want with the
sixth link go out on a date get a stake
and stick with these or its these and
it's Pizza on goatees whoa for sure I'm
falling off my chair over here
personally I couldn't really tell the
difference yeah yeah you could slightly
I don't think that's $60 worth no you're
probably right you got no fancy branding
no does that bug you Tom I actually like
that a little bit you prefer that no
logo but I think I agree with Tom $20
beats killers maybe Hank palm for that
look at the dead honesty over here where
you can't you can't buy that you can
trust the guy who's on the couch most of
the time with the potato chips carrots
and bananas yeah sure bud listen if
those bags of leaves look like carrots
to you got a real problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
