amazing honestly when you see it happen
in real time it has a really magical
feeling to it so a while back I did a
video on what was the first generation
of this product right here that's your
boy Jack you switch the I with the Y and
you get print like that I was actually
blown away with the original version
what this thing did does turn your phone
essentially into a Polaroid camera
snapping a photo and printing out a
physical version of that image
instantaneously after shooting it a
memory of sorts well in fact that was
the only way once upon a time this is a
throwback this is a way of getting a
physical representation of the moment
why is it back in front of me now well
because it's a new version this is the
print pocket they shrunk it down
it works with a wide variety of iPhones
now so the 7 plus 7s e 6s plus 6s 6 plus
6 5s 5 magic bring your photo to life
with the print app that's where things
get really wild the app itself allows
you to look at an image do you remember
this jack and it plays a video clip it
can trigger a video clip from the
moments surrounding that actual image
chair print photos to your favorite
social network site you can still get
your Instagram fix because I know you
need every girl in the picture is locked
into her phone I believe that this zinc
technology is not using any ink it's
better than ink it's zinc I don't know
if it's ink free photo paper by zinc
technology whoo whoo I like unlock the
magic this is quite a bit different than
the previous version real nice pattern
and grip here this is rubbery now this
is where your phone is going to mount
you have a dedicated shutter button and
also a little wheel here now you insert
your cartridge up here on the top and
where does the print come from look at
that from the bottom and then there's a
microUSB port to charge this up oh oh
Wow check that out this is how you can
fit all those different iPhones very
nice a nice flat micro USB cable the
company orange looks like the place you
might insert your paper it looks like
the paper goes in there and here's your
starter paper ten stickers in here ah
see Zink it stands for zero ink oh I
remember this and so this you load your
barcode in put it on the bottom of the
pack when loading okay so that's where
it is we're gonna load these in it looks
like I have to line up this arrow would
be arrow on the top here like this seem
right to you Jack yeah I think so
make sure the print app is on here print
app downloaded I'm gonna launch it slide
the clamps I discovered that as well and
then get your phone in there all right
so where's our our phones right here
back clamp it down oh oh baby
this is top section which gives you
access to your library and your camera
and then there's also discover where you
can kind of look at stuff other people
are posting as well so I'll go to the
camera here look at that it looks a lot
like the iPhone camera so this wheel on
the top actually becomes digital zoom
Jack can probably pick that up can you
see here when I otherwise the app can
have a photo and a video mode
independently flip this around this to a
quick let me do I'll take this little my
little knife here and do a quick little
trick for you ready okay let's play this
back this is where I flipped the knife
out look at the clip there see that I'm
gonna print this but it will print the
still frame okay oh my goodness
oh my goodness look at this guy right
here there you go that's cool
it's a photo right it's a little
shareable photo it's a sticker on the
back the magic happens in this moment
here and I'll just hold it over top like
this and watch this you see that well
here's the crazy part if I pick this
image up it goes with me as I move this
around the image maintains the magic now
if I hit record I can actually record
this crazy moment so check this out now
I'm record
this movement this is mind boggling
stuff it's really amazing honestly when
you see it happen in real time it has a
really magical feeling to it a little
bit of old school in the sense of having
an instant photo but then a ton of new
school with the augmented reality and
the ability to look around and move the
object around you can imagine like a
fridge full of these things with all
your various memories I could just stand
it like this with the app and all of the
data is encoded into the frame go ahead
and experiment yourself old school meets
new it's all happening here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
