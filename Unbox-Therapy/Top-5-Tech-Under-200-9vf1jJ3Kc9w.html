here back with a brand new video and as
you can tell I am in beautiful and sunny
Santa Monica that's because I'm on an
extended trip out here in Los Angeles
filming a top-secret project Shh don't
tell anybody I got my man Austin Evans
running the camera rig do a little nod
Austin are you there he is he's alive
that's my man and I've also got Dom from
the very popular Mac mixing Channel he's
got a new video coming up go check it
out but the reason you're watching
today's video is because there's all
kinds of hoopla going on regarding Black
Friday the holidays gifts and shopping
and so on these two maniacs that I just
mentioned to you they decided to switch
the game a little bit on me to select
five different items at various price
points in the technology world that
could make good gifts so they did 25 50
75 100 and then $200 here's the catch I
don't know what the hell they've bought
so I am going to be as surprised as you
are watching this video and you can also
hold them accountable responsible for
these decisions here we go top 5 gifts
at various different price points let's
start low this one's under 25 let me see
it what do you got Dom oh we have the
s107 metal series RC mini helicopter so
inside the box we are greeted with a
number of different things we have a USB
cable that's gonna be used to charge it
up I'm sure first up we have the
controller two thumb sticks lots of grip
those teeth are biting into my thumbs
right now that's a good thing though
batteries in the back need a screwdriver
from that did we think this through we
do we think this through on how we're
actually gonna fly it doesn't matter we
don't need to fly it right now by the
way happy Thanksgiving everybody you're
probably eating turkey right now
turkey day get your turkey on the
helicopter is free you can be sure if I
put this baby up in the sky right now
we're going straight to the Pacific
Ocean I'm gonna I'm gonna take this back
and show this to will Will's gonna
really like this what's up well I miss
you be home soon okay next up we're
gonna do $50 am i right $50 oh that's a
smart move I've actually never used one
of these but as you can tell you're
essentially getting something in a
similar form factor to like the
chromecast but it's Roku so as opposed
to just being able to like stream from
some other device this has baked in
programming essentially you know Netflix
YouTube Amazon etc simple stuff plug it
into any HDMI port it's about the size
of a chromecast or a USB stick connected
to Wi-Fi and start streaming it looks
like we also get a remote control to go
with it so I guess that's another
incentive over going with a chromecast
for example can you ask her any more fun
than that
happy streaming wow this is small look
at that and light so all you have on
here is an HDMI connector and you've
also got a micro USB connector now let
me go ahead and check out the other
items inside the box it's funny the
remote is larger than the actual device
up here you have your d-pad home button
back button and then some quick buttons
to get to specific applications
blockbuster Netflix Amazon thanks for
that appreciate the audio and one of my
favorite things whenever I buy a device
Duracell batteries well not they're a
cell specific I mean I like dira cells
don't get me wrong but batteries so that
you can get started right out of the box
listen brand manufacturers please listen
to me now this is a very important
message from all the unbox therapy fans
in the world if your product takes
double-a batteries put them in the damn
box so we've done 25 we've done 50 and
now we're gonna step it up we are at $75
I'm very excited
let's see what we got whoa leap motion
the remarkably accurate incredibly
natural way to interact with your
computer I've seen videos of this but I
have never used one browse the web play
games make music and more all with the
wave of the hand or lift of a finger so
essentially this thing is able to track
motion just like in real life so it's
essentially capable of gesture
interaction let me go ahead and open
this up ah oh the anticipation welcome
to a whole new world
wow that's small it's kind of got you
know a Macbook vibe to it the design you
have this aluminum around the outside a
USB connector there obviously to
interface with your system
so all the sensing I believe correct me
if I'm wrong is gonna happen via this
panel here on the top okay so here's our
USB connector they give us - but why -
ah short one in a long one
whoa attention to detail much like the
batteries options baby that's about it
so this one the magic comes when we
connect it I'm gonna be doing that back
at the apartment very shortly but there
you have it seventy-five dollars the
leap motion controller look at that
little baby okay so now we've done 25 50
75 and I wanted to keep as many of the
items below 100 as possible because I
think that that's plenty of money to
spend to get somebody something cool but
now we're sitting at under 100 let's see
if this one can blow my mind domme what
do you got for me whoa under 100 extreme
7 HP tablet that's crazy I mean no you
could get this for under 100 so we're
really compact Windows tablet this is
gonna be a bit of a learning experience
for me because I have very little
Windows tablet past full windows we have
our set up screen here as you can see
I'm one handing it very easily volume
rocker power button forward facing
camera
headphone as well as USB port camera on
the back as well and it has Intel Inside
you're actually dealing with an Intel
Atom processor at one point three three
gigahertz this thing is a little bit fat
boys and girls
I mean comparatively speaking right
that's all subjective if you did this in
you know five years ago this was
paper-thin but ninety nine bucks that's
the key characteristic and a windows
experience for 99 bucks inside the box
micro USB standard stuff and then a
power brick to charge it up obviously as
you guys know this is a bit of a gift
guide and not a full-on review type
experience so I'm gonna have to go and
gather my first impressions but at 100
dollars we have the HP stream 7 alright
so we are now at the top of the list
we've done 25 50 75 100 and the next
product is the grand finale the gift
under $200 this is for the people that
you really love no I'm just I'm just
kidding these are all great gift ideas
and personally the most exciting part of
this is that I feel like we've unveiled
some great gifts at some some lower
price points to make it easy to give
back to those loved ones to those
friends so this should probably be the
most exciting at least I'm hoping so or
maybe it's not let's figure out what
we've got at the under 200 price point
whoa you guys bought a phone for under
200 bucks yes because it's the Moto G
and if you don't know much about this
phone this is one of the best values in
the world right now on the marketplace
I'm a big fan of the Motorola stuff for
example I've been using the new Moto X
for an extended period of time
I like the fact that they don't change
the OS too much you know they leave a
roughly stock experience and in this
particular case you're getting an
unlocked device so you can take it to
whichever carrier you like and you're
doing it for under 200 bucks you can see
on the back here you have a 5 inch HD
display stereo speakers which is
actually different than the new Moto X
which is only mono it's a good mono
speaker but stereo is always better and
eight megapixel camera and of course the
curve
design on the back very similar to the
new Moto X so inside the box we have the
device first some of the specs here
mm 70 milliamp power battery maybe you
want a slightly bigger one but come on
this is 200 bucks please stop
complaining Android of course
interesting thing here you can actually
run the latest 5.0 lollipop on this
device even though it's only a $200
device so while people with flagship
devices out there are still waiting for
an update you're there rocking 200 bucks
and you're on the latest that's a baller
status right there that's a big man move
motorola dimple which gives you
incredible confidence when holding it I
really like what they've done with the
construction and five inches is a really
good compromise in between the phablet
and the smaller smartphone world at
least from my hand
symmetrical design all the way through
camera flash and then on the bottom your
micro USB charge port other items in the
box we're looking at a power brick to
charge it up interesting thing here no
USB detachable power this is just a
straight up power brick in white that's
okay for most people a little bit of
paperwork but really the story is all
about the device itself one of the
devices that I think is is really a game
changer in the marketplace right now and
not not even just this marketplace here
but emerging markets you can now get a
device outright that you own that you
can take to your choice of carrier and
it's gonna perform very close to some of
those flagships 90% of the way at a
fraction of the cost so good choice boys
the new Moto G comes in as the epic gift
to the under 200 gift so there you have
it we've counted down or counted up for
the top 5 or at least 5 different gift
ideas from 25 all the way up to 200 to
show the people in your life that you
appreciate them with a cool piece of
technology I'll link everything down in
the description I think you guys did a
great job remember they were a big part
of it we have Austin Evans on the camera
link to his channel down in the
description we have Mr Mac makes a link
to his channel down
in the description definitely go and
check them out and also stay tuned for
this crazy project that we're shooting
while out here in Los Angeles you don't
know anything about it yet but I think
