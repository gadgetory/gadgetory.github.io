brand new video and today we've got
something that I consider to be exciting
what's in front of me is maybe the
greatest keyboard on the planet I'll of
course have to find out but I owned the
previous version of this this of course
is the Das Keyboard professional this is
the version number four on the previous
one you had a very similar look and feel
but this one has upgraded a few
components and they slimmed it down as
well so it looks a little bit slicker
and sleeker in fact I believe that they
say this is the thinnest mechanical
keyboard on the planet so if you don't
know about mechanical keyboards I'll
give you a quick little breakdown these
of course are keyboards that give you a
tactile feedback so when you click down
on a key you're getting a little bit of
a resistance and then in the case of
blue switches like this one has you're
going to get a little noise and audio
reference as well to let you know that
you have successfully hit a key in all
this together means you're going to
improve your typing hopefully not for
everybody but for the vast majority of
people they can improve their typing
their speed their accuracy etc and in
this case you could do it in a nice
little package I'll flip the box over
real quick so you can at least see the
back you can see german-engineered MX
blue mechanical key switches you can
actually purchase this with MX brown
switches as well they're still going to
be tactile of a little bit less clicky
so if noise is an issue for you
depending on what you do for work or
where you're working you may want to opt
for the brown switches I'll link both of
them down in the description you can see
cutting-edge design premium materials
this one adds a super speed USB 3.0 hub
along 6.6 foot cable it has media
controls but then again so did the last
one
and a detachable foot bar a ruler this
is kind of interesting the little stand
you know the part that puts your
keyboard on an incline in this
particular case can be pulled off and
can act as a ruler that's kind of
interesting so it'll work with Windows
Linux Chrome OS and Mac computers and
requires one USB port enough about the
let's go ahead and take a closer look
inside so the first thing I notice is
the ruler portion that is a legitimate
ruler right there reminds me of being
back in grade school so I guess you can
use this for drawing straight lines or
maybe you're into geometric artwork I
don't know what you're into that's
completely up to you for me it'll just
be a kickstand so I can get that healthy
ergonomic incline on my keyboard ooh
very very very silly so I have right
right now I'm using a keyboard with
super stealth looking keys and you can
actually order this das keyboard in a
stealth version as well it's called the
ultimate this one's called the
professional these are etched keys so of
course you have all the characters that
you might be looking for I'm
unfortunately not enough of a badass to
have the completely blank ultimate
version but the one that I'm using right
now it has a sort of close to stealth
look not a lot of contrast between the
letters and because it's not backlit
sometimes I don't know if I'm sitting
back from the keyboard a little bit I
really wish it had more defined
lettering as this one does here so
rather than have little feet that kick
down you have this ruler portion and I
assume it just fits in here
oh whoa it's magnets oh whoa
magnets love magnets anywhere you can
put magnets put magnets my that's my
theory on life no not at all
I'm sure there are some bad places for
magnets multimedia controls up on this
side first of all very very sturdy I
don't know what it's made out actually I
can't tell if that's plastic or aluminum
feels like aluminum actually so very
sturdy construction here yeah I mean
that baby's not twisting very much at
all up here you have a volume wheel
which has little miniscule clicks to it
you have a play/pause button back
forward a sound button to mute the sound
and what looks like a sleep button I'll
let you hear the
is really quick so you can distinguish
if this is too loud for you it is pretty
loud spacebar is the loudest anyways
those are blue key switches and they're
essentially going to be that loud no
matter which keyboard you order them on
now in my opinion these are great key
switches for accuracy because having
that audio feedback and that really
distinguishable click means that you're
not going to have mishaps quite as often
and type the wrong key then you need to
hit the backspace etc up so accuracy is
the name of the game here and you know
full-size keyboard as well a lot of
people are using slim little tiny ones
you don't have full size arrow keys
which are very useful for professional
applications editing applications like I
use so overall I look for a durable
robust keyboard it's got to hold up to
all of the tasks that I throw at it here
in the new studio so we also have a
couple of USB ports at the top and one
nice thing here is that their USB 3 well
that's of course nice but also the
location of them rather than having them
on the side over here where they might
interfere with your mouse they are on
the back of the device I won't use them
permanently but it's nice to have extra
USB s in this location or anywhere for
that matter more us be more happy people
there you have it the Dass keyboard
professional number for the - keyboard
for professional and I think it's a nice
upgrade the last one was glossy as well
which really attracted a lot of dust and
fingerprints this one has a more of a
matte finish which I'm happy to see a
lot of electronics manufacturers moving
in that direction the matte finish
generally speaking looks better longer
at least in my opinion also this
magnetic ruler kind of cool don't know
if I'll use it but I like magnets and
sometimes those little kickstands that
you see on the back of your keyboard are
pretty flimsy
so in this particular case since it's
one solid piece it's probably not going
to be as flimsy as those little kick
stands which sometimes can break off
when you're moving it etc what's this it
doesn't matter as I said before the -
keyboard for professional there is a
version of this with brown key switches
if that is more your cup of tea as I
mentioned those links will be down in
the description so you can check out
both these aren't cheap but then again
professional level top-tier stuff never
is and of course you're paying more
money for limited returns you can type
on any keyboard that's out there but if
you make a living using this baby right
here then it becomes a little bit easier
to justify the cost I'm gonna go test it
out now and it should will probably
likely become my daily driver if you
