another video and today it's gonna be a
hard video to make in front of me I have
the Punk'd phone this has been in the
studio for a while and I've talked about
it I talked to Jack to Joe Rogan on his
podcast about it I talked to people in
my personal life I talked to trusted
individuals spiritual leaders because
what's in front of me is an
intentionally dumb phone why have they
done this Lou I'm into technology I want
the latest I thought we were talking
about Android and Apple I'm gonna give
up my smart phone this guy right here
I've got a Nexus 6p
I love it think of what's closer to you
than your phone exactly not much what am
I gonna do a week I'm gonna use this
phone for a week not that phone a dumb
phone for a week now does this mean I'm
gonna be completely disconnected no
right I'm gonna be on my laptop and and
and my computer and so on but it's just
a way to see how it kind of curbs my
behavior when I'm out and about doing
human things being a human and it's this
phone right here this phone here was the
inspiration to give up my smartphone and
do this experiment it's a phone from the
future with features from the past
what am i doing I'm going on a whole
thing maybe I tell you that my life
became rosy sunshine and lollipops since
I gave up my smartphone I can breathe
better and colors are brighter and I
found my humanity or I just go off the
grid and you never see me again jack
would probably love that you're sick man
jack box is nice on this ooh
kind of nice good luck getting your work
emails on here when you're chilling out
on the weekend what do we got in here
okay so volume on the side over here it
looks like it's got a speakerphone on it
nice little buttons SIM card tray and
this interesting shape and texture on
the back micro USB alright easy enough
have lots of those tiny little power
brick here it's a 1,000 milliamp hour
battery which will give you almost 300
minutes of talk time or three weeks of
standby oh cool an adapter if you don't
have one of these you need one when you
switch when you switch phones a lot
essentially this lets you take a nano
SIM and turn it into a temporary micro
sim now I'm legitimately do is a week
guys I'm telling you I know it's scary
let's just do it right now let's bite
the bullet and do it I'm so stressed out
oh we did it and look my phone screamed
right there one last gasp um how do I
even turn
battery low oh we have an earpiece so
you can still you got a headset an audio
adapter if you want to use a different
set of headphones hey man relax dude
I have no contacts no anything do you
understand this level of sacrifice it's
like I'm getting grounded I'm grounding
myself my whole business like uploading
videos communicating with you guys the
whole process it happens online it
happens in apps it happens in email a
lot of people are going to be hitting up
my inbox expecting replies and if I'm
not sitting at a computer it ain't gonna
happen
wish me luck my friends I will report
back to you to wild world out there full
of cell towers and data connections that
I can't use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
