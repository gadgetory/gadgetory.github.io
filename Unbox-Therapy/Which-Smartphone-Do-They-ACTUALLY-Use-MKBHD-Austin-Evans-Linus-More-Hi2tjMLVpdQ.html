mr. Austin Evans I don't really know
what they say about Austin - why don't
you say something about Austin hey guys
we got mister who's the boss over here
what do you got you got something to
drink or something going on there
well done over here we have Marquez
here's the reason here's what we're
doing today we're gonna find out once
and for all which smartphone is in the
pocket of each of these very important
individuals so we're gonna start with
Dom which smartphone is in your pocket
right now
do I reveal it right now or not the
iPhone 10 oh there it is sometimes it's
hard to break away from that ecosystem
what is it about this ecosystem you're
talking about more specifically just
iMessage I guess I've heard this
argument I truly don't understand it
what is it is it is this a green bubble
a green bubble blue bubble type of
prejudice going on here it's a green
bubble blue bubble whore what do you
think about face ID though it works for
me though it's really if you with
sunglasses sometimes right there's no
Rhema resonant reason to rhyme for it
it's just a really rising rising reason
to Ryan Florida charted right here right
I hear Austin just cracking that bag
everyone over there is giggling and
covering their mouths what happened
what's going on no Nazi let's give a lap
to Austin because obviously he wants the
attention here
as about to do a hilarious joke about
how I love rechargeable batteries it's
not only funny
all right iPhone 10 why why is that your
choice I love the hardware on this phone
the speakers are great cameras great I
legitimately really do enjoy face ID
this is like the best hardware I've ever
tried on a smart phone like I love the
pixel too but I'm excited okay hey man
this is your moment like I'm not gonna
interrupt you you make your case but not
doesn't bother me there's so little I
don't like about this phone do you
consider yourself to just be an iOS guy
like it's gonna be hard to break away
from that's not it so what was the last
Android device you used extensively that
was it's like my main phone yeah okay so
that's your prayers your answer there's
your answer all right moving on who
wants to be next thrown in the fire and
the flames of the tech world
it's Linus tech tips hi how many videos
did you make us he is 45 one five videos
round of applause everybody who is this
man and what are they made up which
smartphone is in your pocket and why so
I'm on the pixel to excel my Galaxy s8
something I have installed on it is
making the battery drain really fast I
haven't had the time to deal with it are
you trying to say you preferred it is
that on my trip I actually have five
phones with me I can give you the
reasons for all of them this one I'm on
because I pop the sim out of the mate 10
Pro there was some software that wasn't
installed on it I needed to use so I put
my sim in here you sounded like the most
reluctant pixel user I've ever heard in
my life it's okay oh so you're not a big
fan of it
yeah robot
it's good it's really good I love them I
haven't used a phone for longer than a
month at a time in over half a year
part of my deal is I switch the eight I
was using the A+ the pixel to not the XL
this was the last one I was on before I
switched to the razor phone which I
frankly didn't like that much so the sim
went back in this one you could put any
one of them in your pocket not not the
most convenient at that moment which one
would it be I'm really happy with this
one okay so what is this one sort of
look at these hands
I can't handle this much phone so really
what I want is the s8 back but with not
my battery is about this in the form
factor of just the pixels yeah I'll be
fine yeah I like this watch better than
I like my phone once we fed to the lines
next if we're talking pixel then we're
talking me a pixel to excel and if you
guys have been following me in this
recent trip how about this view I've
taken pictures of this view and I truly
believe this is the best camera on a
smartphone right now period I am NOT
taking a bad picture with this phone
plus I like stock Android and all the
usual things that you know about this is
in my pocket for now there's no lies
here it either is or it isn't all right
who's next
Kutner your next man the pressures on
iPhone time wow it's just two phones so
far I'm gonna be straight out its
iMessage man in the ecosystem whoa
that's what it is for me I don't even
know what this means the scientist is
saying it's not about the blue and green
okay well is it about I'm always on my
computer always on the phone somebody
hits me up usually it's a family member
who's also on iMessage I get it wherever
I am I mean you could do the whole thing
but I don't want to make some other
messenger you know a lot of the world
that use watch that for example yeah
I've you know I've got that comment a
lot yeah but it's like okay I got to
tell you go download something what
would it take for you to switch over
iMessage on Android honestly I mean
that's not gonna happen obviously but
yeah what are we sitting at right now
three to two Oh can't wait
a hotly-anticipated take from the man
himself mkbhd what did you have you a
smartphone Awards
the best phone the best this the best
that it was a lot of bests but I think
what do people really want to know is
what's in the pocket what's in the
pocket and why which pocket first of all
because I do right now you have two
phones yes main SIM card the number you
have this phone number pixel to XL naked
pixel to XL panda a colored power button
stock Android great camera all the same
reasons you said thinking pro reader
isn't a good spot I have big hands so I
couldn't even use the smaller version of
the phone big phone person if there's an
XL that's where I'm going but the other
pocket I do carry an iPhone oh you
really believe this are you running for
president next there are things that
just work better on iOS I use the best
iPhone I can I use my favorite Android
phone Wow this diplomat right here came
prepared pick a damn phone right now if
you had to drop one is that it I'm
dropping the iPhone yes no it is darn it
no cop-outs in here no calm pouch in
here I don't like this whispering
collusion just two phones in the whole
room what are we sitting at now 3-3 tie
breaker happening now mister who's the
boss what's happening - no preamble no
banter I came from the note 8 I couldn't
stand it because of the battery a pixel
two batteries great the screen is not
fantastic but you kind of get used to it
just want to mean they might comment on
dislike blueness if it's not terrible
the pixel the pixels better in every way
4:3 pixel to XL to iPhone 10 I gotta be
honest I'm a little disappointed that it
broke down that simply there's a lot of
amazing phones out there maybe they said
something about us maybe we're a little
too predictable maybe we need to get out
there a little more often I'm not really
sure this has been incredible this is
unprecedented I don't know maybe you
want to see something like this next
year you people there in the audience if
you do I think you know what to do you
use your thumb to let Jack know that
that's the case I want to say thank you
to everybody that's been in this video I
hope to do it again that is the
smartphone that's in their pocket no
lies it's the real deal here in Las
Vegas CES 2018 yes
it's good
