another video and today we are checking
out the jumping sumo which immediately
wins for the best name of any product
ever featured here on unbox therapy
jumping sumo by the way I'm roasting
over here this is an unusual drone
because it doesn't fly there's no fast
spinning propellers no it jumps instead
I guess that could be dangerous in its
own right it jumps pretty aggressively
it has a camera on the front and it
rolls it rolls around it does these
quick spins what it has that the last
parrot mini-drone doesn't have is a live
video feed on your device so you can see
where it's going even when you're not
where it is indoor/outdoor seven
kilometers an hour slash 4.5 miles per
hour I can jump up to 80 centimeters or
31 inches way better battery life than
those other mini drones I really wish
these types of devices had that as like
a minimum course you can get extra
batteries we have batteries smart phone
control just like the other mini drone
but much different as I said here you
can get a better look at how it operates
giant spring in their adjustable wheels
stickers to make it look more aggressive
than it already is it's really nimble so
open it up here are those stickers I
talked that's stuck to the top there
look I mean that's just I like the look
of it look at it
harmless a USB cable to charge it up
obviously micro USB these are some kind
of replacement part I guess this is like
a pivot point that's sort of where he
jumps off of it's a little pad there
anyway to give you a couple extras I
guess maybe that can wear out there yeah
yeah okay battery is on cool red
eyeballs lights actually and the camera
lens is here as well
micro USB port for charging power button
on the top
oh hello there
all right let me get the app going whoa
r2d2 style should start trying to
connect right away from the app is this
launch the app oh that connects really
fast look can you guys see that right
there like he's looking at me right now
you can see we have some various
controls here this is how you can drive
him oh yes
smooth and I'm it can poop
oh she landed that keep just oh yeah
hands down I like this guy what are we
in do oh oh
boom you can do 90 degrees 180 90 sees
me now he sees you and me hey you it's
all pretty quick we have a high jump we
have a long jump a quick no look upside
down I guess a somersault half a
somersault
please into yoga you know now he can
drive upside down there's an animations
tab you have spin tap slow shake
metronome undulation and a spin jump
let's take it slow at first
oh my watch it whoo
what's a tap gonna do oh it's just a
little heat works that's the the Miley
Cyrus right here oh okay we got one more
oh okay alright we got one more which is
the spin jump now this could go well
this could go terribly wrong here we go
yep figured that would happen we're
gonna jump on to the table folks right
here all day
you saw it and now is it the jumping
sumo or the pilot oh look at him see
just perfect this drone is a lot of fun
bang for your buck this guy bangs your
buck
what you guys laughing it oh look the he
can be robot insect or monster for his
sound effects alright so you can record
video on this you can take photos which
will go straight to your to your phone
to record video also which is a hell of
a lot cooler but here's the but
apparently you need a micro USB key
that's the only way to get this thing to
record video oh yeah all day so there
you have it jumping sumo it's around 140
bucks and as you can tell it's a lot of
fun maybe you want to bug your siblings
follow them around jump on to them
you're probably not supposed to do that
lots of fun and much better battery life
than the flying counterpart the rolling
spider as it was called it's a pretty
cool package and I'm not sure I'm not
aware of anything else out there that's
quite like it so if you want to learn
