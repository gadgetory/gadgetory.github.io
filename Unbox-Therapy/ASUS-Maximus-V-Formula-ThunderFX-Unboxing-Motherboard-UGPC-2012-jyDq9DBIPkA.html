along in the unboxing videos and all of
you guys are anxious want to get me to
the official build video trust me I want
to get there too so I'm gonna have a
little bit of an unboxing spree
everything everything you see here is
going to be unboxed this week I'm going
to keep it moving right now get to a
major component in this ultimate gaming
PC project of course or any PC bill for
that matter that's the motherboard this
one here is the Maximus v formula with
thunder FX i'll tell you more about what
that thunder FX means in a quick second
this of course is from Zeus and it is
part of their rog republic of gamers
lineup you get a free diablo 3 mousepad
it'll support sli which is important for
us as i open up the front door here's a
little bit of velcro there you get a
closer look at the diablo 3 mousepad and
then some of the features that are on
the board including supreme FX for
absolutely awesome onboard audio for a
motherboard you've got something called
redline which is a physical PCB
separation and emi shield literally
there's a red line on the board that
separates the sound portion of the board
from the rest of it so you can sort of
not have any interference from other
components on that board it's also got
fusion thermo which is really awesome
it's this combo air cooling / water
cooling solution i'll show you more
about that when i get to the actual
board i'm not going to bore you guys
with just the box portion here so let's
go ahead and jump right inside and get a
closer look after all this is unbox
therapy and the unboxing is a big
component in the buying experience so
first and foremost let's pull out the
larger box inside of here if i can get
it out there we go so here's your
motherboard damn it looks pretty already
I can tell and here is the Thunderer FX
box which you guys probably recognize
the name from the front of the
motherboard box this is a very cool
component in this unboxing very unusual
for a motherboard unboxing as you see
over here you've got your power LED this
knob here explains a lot of what this
box can do so that left says PC in the
middle it says Xbox 360 and then to the
far right it says ps3 yes this is a full
fledge
external sound card that will work with
even your console so you can upgrade the
audio on your consoles as well you've
also got a nice volume knob here here
are some more LEDs master voice game you
got headphone out microphone input
xbox360 voice in and then there's also a
microphone built onto the unit which is
going to help with noise cancellation
for your chat it's going to listen to
ambient noise in the room and cancel
that out of your chat stream on the back
of this Thunder FX box you've got analog
inputs that's of course going to be used
with your console and then you've got
USB 2.0 to be used with your PC you can
also use this with a laptop if you want
to upgrade the audio on a gaming laptop
or any laptop for that matter so a very
very cool inclusion and something you
don't get to see too often with a
motherboard even a motherboard of this
magnitude so here's a closer look at the
actual Maximus 5 formula absolutely
beautiful in my estimation black and red
color scheme the the thing that catches
my attention right away is this fusion
thermo design right here as I said
before this can work with either air
cooling or water cooling I'm going to be
hooking up some custom water cooling to
the fusion thermo more information on
that later on I can't go too far into it
right now but trust me you're going to
see some absolutely awesome water
cooling in here if of course also got
your socket right here which is LGA 1155
perfect for my 3770k nice Republic of
gamers logo there you can also see your
RAM slots up here dual channel and then
of course your PCIe slots right along
here of course we're going to be
sticking these wonderful gtx 680 s up in
those slots right there so i'm going to
go ahead and open up this box as easy as
i can and show you guys a little bit
more detail on the ports etc so here's a
closer look at the back panel on the
motherboard you've of course got your
analog audio here as well as digital
audio you have your network ethernet
port two USB 3.0 s another digital audio
of course one of these is out one of
these is in you have an HDMI port
DisplayPort eSATA two more USB 3s your
regular standard USB 2.0 ports although
the bottom port here can be switched to
our
oh gee connect this is your ROG connect
on and off switch and then on the far
end up here you have a clear CMOS button
the sound portion that I talked about
earlier happens right down in this
region here and you might be able to
make out the line here that represents
that shield that I mentioned earlier in
the unboxing video on the other side of
the board I'll go ahead and try and move
it around here real quick you're going
to see an absolute bevy right here of
SATA connectors this is going to make
sure you can connect all your different
raids your SSDs whatever you want to do
with this board and then up along top
one more thing to mention in this
unboxing you've got some hardware
buttons a hardware start and a hardware
reset button now is obviously more
things included and there's a lot more
detail I could go into on this board and
how some of the features work I'll be
going more into that Doh as we lead up
to the build video I'm going to try and
keep the unboxing somewhat brief now
there's another box I've got to get to
which of course are going to be your
accessories and there's a lot to cover
in there as well I don't want to make
this a 20 minute video for obvious
reasons so here's a look at some of the
other things that are included all the
goodies that come with this particular
motherboard I'll try and go through them
as quickly as possible so you've got a
USB cable here that's a standard USB
you've got a bunch of SATA cables or
SATA cables depending on how you want to
mention those a thunder FX cable that's
a standard audio cable it looks like
actually looks like an Xbox chat cable
so they've even gone as far as including
Xbox specific cables yes here is another
Xbox specific cable so you can get the
thunder FX up and running with your
console straight away you've also got a
Republic of gamers SLI cable here is
your back shield
you've got your drivers disk along with
a fairly thick user guide you're
definitely going to want to read this in
the case of a motherboard unboxing for
obvious reasons
lastly you look at this here you've got
I'm night I'm gaming do not disturb a
little door hanger so you can let
everybody else know in the house to
leave you alone you have this antenna
here obviously this board features
onboard Wi-Fi you've got a card built
right in so this is going to be
incredibly useful for getting better
reception
you've also got eight
under FX USB so you're fully ready to go
with your Thunder FX card this is
actually a really really cool little
feature right here this thing is called
M PCIe combo card this is a unique
little interface that gives you some
expandability options you're going to
actually be able to put a little mini
PCIe SSD in here to help with boot times
etc to give you a little boost so that's
a really cool thing I'll go into more
detail on that like I said in the actual
build video see if I can actually put
that baby into operation in my build you
guys know I do want to do an SSD raid I
am doing an SSD raid in here I might
even put some really nice large
traditional hard drives I will put nice
traditional hard drives in there for
media etc the last thing in here you've
got of course are your little power
ground reset ground your little plugs
there so that pretty much wraps up all
the components in this unboxing I've
gone ahead and made a major mess on my
table here this is a very beautiful
motherboard I can't get over the
appearance of it the black and red color
scheme is it's probably one of my
favorite color schemes you can get as I
said earlier in this video I didn't
cover absolutely everything about the
board and the features it is a very
feature-rich board for gaming and I'll
be going into full detail when the build
comes along and I actually start to put
some of these amazing components and
features to good use anyway guys if you
enjoyed this unboxing if you enjoy the
ultimate gaming PC project please
remember to leave a like and a favorite
down below this video as it really does
help out a bunch and as I said earlier
I'm going to get moving on all this
stuff I'm gonna speed it up I'm gonna
get going as quick as I can because I
know you guys want to see everything get
unboxed as soon as possible trust me I
do too I want to get to that build video
alright guys thanks as always for
watching your support is greatly
