attention of the Internet probably you
as well I know the moment I saw it I was
like Willy do we have to get our hands
on it it's very important we've talked
so much about notches on the front of
displays and the different tactics that
manufacturers are taking to eliminate
that notch this device in front of me is
probably the craziest implementation
I've seen it's the Nubia X this one
shipped straight from Asia as a
snapdragon 845 I mean I first clash like
okay yeah it looks like a phone right
what about the back it's reflective it's
blue no big deal right well it is a big
deal that's a display hitting underneath
here dual camera setup Sony sensor this
looks like an IR blaster up on the top
your fingerprint scanner is right here
where your thumb rests and the screen
just lit up wool that's a look ladies
and gentlemen that's a pretty look six
point two six inches F HD plus you can
see that it is a steel frame the whole
thing feels solid
oh does it know what that's crazy
it knows based on the way you're holding
it I guess which screen you want to use
look at this for the selfie look at that
holy that is strange and just like that
you're taking a selfie on the back of
the device on the back of your
smartphone you're using the rear camera
for your selfie and there's a couple of
beard hairs there might I say wow this
is bizarre and then how do I get I
wonder how I get that one goes like goes
off and then and then I come back in
then I'm on the front it's the same
image but the higher resolution display
I'm squeezing it right now what is this
is that a function well that's a squeeze
function it's a lot of unusual things
going on with this device oh wow okay
press the fingerprints at both sides and
do not release so these dual fingerprint
scanners are used sort of like squeeze
on the pixel device they actually serve
a purpose you hold it
and then flip it and you flip back to
the other display it's a double-sided
fingerprint authentication that's pretty
well it's gotta get the thumb and the
index look at this pay with double sided
fingerprints verify with double sided
fingerprints at the same time to make
payments more safely but it looks like
you can also use it for various
functions including left side back right
side home left side home right side back
so you can use them as navigation
buttons also there's a lot of crazy
ideas going on inside of this phone
ideas that I have never seen before but
really what this whole thing is about is
this crazy display on the front possibly
the highest screen to body ratio I've
ever seen and no motorized functionality
necessary unlike the other devices that
are out there that rely on a camera to
pop up from the rear this is just a
solid slab if you need to take a selfie
or use a front-facing camera then you
simply flip it around and you're met
with that I think for most people
they're just they're not even going to
really use this backside that often it's
just gonna be for selfie purposes now
the major benefit of this type of setup
is you get the camera unit on the rear
of the device which typically in
smartphones like this is the better
camera of the bunch you can also use it
to showcase an always-on clock you can
have that power on on a schedule also so
it could be kind of your nighttime clock
or whatever on the bedside table alright
so here's the thing I mean this is
obviously incredibly over-engineered
they were trying to give you no
distraction I mean obviously with a
setup like this you're getting all
screen when you when you watch a video
that you know you're not gonna be cut
off by any type of obstruction it's like
bringing a gun to a knife fight or
something if you only use the rear of
the device when you need it then who
really cares if there's a display or
they can be useful for you whenever you
see fit and you don't want to be nervous
about some motorized functionality
potentially wearing out like you see on
some other devices that have attempted
to go notch lists I assume this thing is
going to be fairly expensive considering
the fact that they've got a house this
extra display in it now here's the thing
should I use it could I use
should I see if there if it bothers me
that much maybe I should as of right now
there's some some really interesting and
unusual things in here that I think
require a bit more attention the Nubia X
let me know in the comments is this the
next one I need to do a switch here soon
I think Otis is convinced over there
he's jumping around he likes the double
screen but the question is do you like
the double screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
