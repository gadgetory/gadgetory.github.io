therapy and today we're taking a look at
a set of headphones from cos these are
the Tony Bennett Signature Edition
headphones they're obviously going to be
added to the long list of celebrity
headphones currently available I'll give
you guys a look at the side of the
package here you can get a better idea
of the specifications of these
headphones and then on the back you
actually notice that this package here
also includes some downloadable content
you can get some duet songs from Tony
Bennett and some other popular recording
artists those are downloadable along
with the purchase of these headphones
now the first thing you're going to
notice in this unboxing is of course the
carrying case it has a hard shell and
then the exterior is covered in a nylon
material and the overall package is
actually pretty slim so I'm assuming
that the headphones are folded flat on
the inside making them you know
obviously more convenient for travel etc
and yes I was correct now the very first
thing I noticed is the materials in use
here the exterior of the ear cups are
done in a metallic a spun metallic
finish very impressive at first glance
and then the other item on the inside of
this case is actually a velcro pouch
it's velcroed to the interior and I
assume that's where the cable and other
accessories might live yes I am correct
about that so you have the 8 foot long
coiled cable it'll be 8 feet at full
extension of the coil get some extra
flexibility there you have a 3.5
millimeter termination point on this end
and then a quarter inch termination
pre-installed on the other end but that
is an adapter you can remove it so that
you get mini jack on both sides that's
obviously the way most people are going
to use these with their portable audio
devices iPhones etc but you do have the
adaptor for interfacing with more
professional equipment if need be the
cable inserts into one ear cup so you're
not gonna get any tangling under your
neck or anything like that that's always
convenient and as I mentioned earlier
the construction is really what struck
me at first I actually haven't
personally held any headphones that are
completely metallic in terms of the
actual earcup these ones are they are
round as well which is a little bit more
unusual well I shouldn't say more
unusual but I've seen more that have
more of an oval shape at least
internally in the year cut portion these
ones are round but they do fit around my
entire ear they're also adjustable
meaning that they could fit a large head
or an abnormally small head as well if
that happens to be you but as I
mentioned before the round ear Cup at
first worried me but after wearing them
it does go around my entire ear so I do
get a good seal and good bass response
after using them so the most impressive
aspect as I touched on earlier is the
construction after all I haven't
listened to these for a long period of
time I just completed the unboxing but
they will swivel turn in any direction
and everything in terms of construction
materials are done in high quality I
mean most of it is metallic I can't
actually find anything plastic at least
not without investigating further well I
I do assume there's some plastic on the
headband etc but the swiveling function
is all metallic the back of the ear cups
as I mentioned earlier you've got a
terry cloth finish on the top side of
the headband and then you've also got
this embossed Tony Bennett signature on
the exterior portion of the headband and
I do appreciate this touch here because
a lot of manufacturers will just put you
know the decal of the paint on there in
this case you're actually getting it
embossed right into the material you've
got a stereo / mono switch on one of the
ear cups I'm not really sure why maybe
for old-school mono material I'm not
really sure why that's which is there
but it is anyway guys if you enjoyed
