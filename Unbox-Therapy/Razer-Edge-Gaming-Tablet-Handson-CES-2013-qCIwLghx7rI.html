go further what's up guys Lew here and
we had a chance to check out the razor
booth always an exciting place to check
out for CES and for 2013 they've got a
brand new gaming tablet it's called the
edge and there are a number of
peripherals available to really improve
your experience using it as you can see
here there's a keyboard dock available
that dock also features one USB port so
if you prefer to game with a mouse as
opposed to using the touch interface
that's an option for you there's another
dock as well this one here is called the
multi media dock this features three USB
ports an HDMI port for outputting video
to a larger display there's also a
headphone output and a microphone input
for attaching a gaming headset now if
you do choose to use this dock here and
output over HDMI because you want to
play on a bigger TV and then you're
probably gonna want to interface with
the device using a controller well I've
got good news for you they also launched
a brand new controller it's called the
sabre-tooth it's got a bunch of special
features and functions I've got a
separate video dedicated to that
controller coming up right after this
one so definitely stick around for that
hit subscribe if you haven't yet but
this video is dedicated to the tablet
and as you can see here this is probably
the most interesting accessory this is a
device that Clips around the outside of
the tablet and gives you a traditional
gaming input style for what is a
touchscreen interface so you've got two
analog thumb sticks as well as a number
of other tactile buttons so you can get
that classic gaming experience on
essentially a Windows 8 PC now you can
get this thing configured either with a
core i5 or Core i7 it's not cheap but it
is very powerful compared with other
mobile gaming solutions anyway guys if
you enjoyed this video please remember
to leave a thumbs up down below as it
does help out a bunch and as I said
before make sure to subscribe for full
CES 2013 coverage thanks as always for
watching catch guys on the next one
later powered by the 2013 C max the
official car of CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
