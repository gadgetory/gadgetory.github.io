another video and this is a bonus upload
for your weekend pleasure today I'm
going to be showing you a little tip a
little trick on how to speed up your
Android phone so what you want to do is
go into your settings and then scroll
down to about device in here you'll
notice software info now this might look
a little bit different depending on your
phone but software info should be
somewhere in there click there and then
look for build number and you want to
tap that seven times watch this
developer mode has now been turned on
alright so I'll go back out now and then
back out one more time and now I have a
new option here above the about device
icon which is called developer option
you want to click down on that button
and now there's all kinds of amazing
features that you can mess with wouldn't
recommend getting too crazy in here but
what you're looking for specifically for
speed is to scroll down until you find
window animation scale okay now this is
that kind of fancy thing that happens
when you open and close an application
or a window and you might not even
notice it but it's just kind of like
floating in and out that occurs but
unfortunately it takes a little bit of
extra time so we're going to go in here
and turn this off so now the animation
is off for the windows the transitions
and the animator duration so just shut
those all off but what you're going to
notice right away is this nothing flashy
just none of that anymore when you go to
open something up it's instant you see
that there's no delay now in order to
give you a reference point on this
without the animations turned off so
galaxy s7 and s7 edge if I go ahead and
launch at the same time Prohm you will
see that every single time this thing
opens faster now some of you might be
saying hey Lou
that's insignificant but hey if you're
doing this all the time throughout the
day look a calculator and you're
constantly opening and closing things
you cannot let's do clock
you can understand that that's gonna
save you time listen I guess the
animation looks kind of cool but in
reality I'd rather have the snappiness I
mean that just feels so rewarding to
just see it happen so quickly three two
one I mean you just it just comes up and
this is something you can do on any
Android phone if you're not into the
animation that happens that you don't
need it you just want alcaman efficiency
this is the way to achieve it now this
has been out for a little while this is
not a new thing
thought that it would be an interesting
thing to share you should definitely
tell your friends leave a thumbs up down
below if you think this is gonna speed
your life up just the little touch look
at that every time boom comes up right
away even when you back out of it it's a
little bit faster so it's actually on
each end I don't know why I love these
little kinds of hacks and tweaks and
Android just got a little bit a little
bit snappier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
