another video and today I have something
that I am very excited for I think you
might be too this is well it definitely
fits into the weird zone the weird zone
keeps expanding but this is this is
really in that neighborhood it's called
the sub pack look at that this here is
wearable base tactile base what it's
like a backpack the sub pack m2 and this
is supposed to enhance your experience
of sound in like a physical way I could
see that being interesting specifically
for gaming if you could imagine some
warzone type game you're getting shot at
you can actually feel the feel the
rumble if this doesn't get you excited
as a tech head I don't know what would
you're gonna wear your sound bro let the
title of the video where your sound bro
now this thing isn't cheap I'm gonna
warn you
so before you click the link just
realize that oh this thing looks like
some kind of body armor Wow a little
sound card kind of deal intensity
Bluetooth aligning and a headphone out a
little power brick for that unit what is
this it's a strap there's what I'm gonna
look like in a minute when I strap this
baby on you can hook on the little sound
unit to the belt strap so you can
actually be completely mobile oh there
it is right there all the international
connectors holy this is a this is some
Terminator type stuff right here
pick that up there jack
very slim gray toes here from a previous
video now these are very highly regarded
but they're not well known for having
the most base so the headphone out then
go to my headphones ooh
they thumped me a little bit plug this
guy in Oh
huh the audio is coming out his iPad
into the box out to the headphones I'm
excited what
ah then I didn't buy you you don't even
think about music that way it is so
weird to feel the bass not to hear it I
can't even imagine you got the headset
on people shooting machine guns at you
and bah
oh it's that kind of like you know what
we were having a bad day I'm alive again
it's a date juice if you can try to
think try something I don't know maybe
you can send it back if you don't have
this weird experience that I do but I'm
a different guy now
it's a stop offer are you wearing I feel
like I'm 12 years old</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
