therapy and today we're taking a look at
Apple's newest product the iPad air now
before we get into today's unboxing I do
want to mention that next week I will be
doing a giveaway of another iPad air so
if you're interested in your shot at
potentially getting a free factory-fresh
iPad air make sure to hit the subscribe
button and then you'll be notified when
that giveaway goes live but let's go
ahead and talk about the actual unboxing
that is what you're here for as you can
tell the new iPad air slimmer lighter
than the previous generation I'll put it
to the side for a moment and talk about
the other components in the box don't
worry we'll get back to it here we've
got the standard apple power brick this
of course is the North American version
with the flip-down prongs easy to travel
with you've also got some paperwork from
Apple a couple of little QuickStart
guides in different languages as well as
the famous Apple stickers that appear to
be included in a number of different
Apple products I think everything over a
certain price point not 100% sure you've
also got the USB to lightning cable this
will be used to charge and sync your
device a pretty simple USB into your
power brick and then lightning into your
actual iPad as mentioned the new iPad
air is significantly smaller thinner
lighter than the previous generation
while maintaining the same screen size
the same retina resolution so they've
made some improvements here without
really pulling back on too much I've got
the Space Gray version in 16 gigabytes
that's really all I need one thing that
comes up whenever you get a brand new
device brand new iPad or phone you start
to think about protecting it especially
if you're the kind of person that might
be a little bit clumsy or if you do a
lot of traveling I've actually got a
suggestion for you I've been a big fan
of the product from Zoo GU especially
the case prodigy I use it on my iPad
Mini currently and they've actually had
a special deal for you guys if you're
interested in pre-ordering their new
product for the iPad air there's 20% off
for unbox therapy viewers the details
and coupon code will be down in the
description as you can tell they've got
a unique approach to cases for your iPad
using magnets the case prodigy is
capable of standing upright in a number
of different positions whether that be
for content creation
or content consumption you can type on
it you can stand it upright to watch
movies in bed in fact I watched the
entire last season of Game of Thrones on
the train using the case prodigy for the
iPad Mini so as you can tell I'm a fan
of their products and they're giving you
guys a special deal if you use the link
and the code down in the description
alright let's go ahead and boot up the
brand new iPad air I'm not going to make
you guys sit through the entire setup
process as you can tell you've got the
new iOS 7 setup interface that I am
slamming through here real quickly and
now you can of course appreciate the
front of the device and that beautiful
display you've probably seen this
display at an Apple Store or on your own
device it's pretty much the same as the
previous generation of course this time
in the smaller form factor as mentioned
I went for the Space Gray model but it's
also available in a white and silver
model very similar to the last
generation if you go for the lighter
version the headphone jack is on the top
of the device and your controls are
pretty much exclusively on the top right
corner when you're facing the device
you've got two speaker grilles down on
the bottom that's also where your
lightning port is for charging and
syncing the device you have a microphone
on the top a forward facing camera rear
facing camera and the power switch is in
the exact same location on the top as
well alright guys that wraps up the
unboxing portion of my iPad air coverage
but definitely stick around for the
speed test and the comparison videos
which are coming up shortly and as
mentioned earlier I will be giving away
a brand new iPad air next week so if
