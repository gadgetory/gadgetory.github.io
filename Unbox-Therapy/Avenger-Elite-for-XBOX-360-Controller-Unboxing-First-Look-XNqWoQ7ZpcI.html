my sweater a little bit better than it
was today we have another unboxing video
this is going to be a lot of fun this in
front of me is the Avenger Elite
increase your Xbox gaming skills without
cheating with the Avenger Lee even
further reduced trigger travel and
unbelievable lever sensitivity Avenger
Lee remaps buttons so they are closer to
your fingers provides better situational
awareness and greater accuracy alright
so we know now what the manufacturer has
to say I've got an Xbox controller here
as well this is just a standard regular
Xbox 360 controller that the Avenger is
designed for so we'll open up the box
and then we'll fit it on here see how it
works believe we just slide it open like
this it's very light very lightweight
but it's a shell you know it's just a
shell that fits on to your controller so
you wouldn't expect it to be too heavy
it opens up on this side new on Avengers
only the side lever bends so there is
what looks like some elastic bands so
likely those are replacements for things
that already exist on the Avenger we've
also got two cushiony looking pads this
one looks a little bit bigger than the
PlayStation version not sure if I
remember 100% but wow this thing looks
crazy every time I see it look at that
that's nuts
alright so let's go ahead and attempt to
install the controller
okay so Xbox controller here we've got
the Avenger here is a little clip here
down at the bottom there we go
the hook just comes up like that and I
believe you're just going to place place
it down in there the battery yep appears
to fit just fine
and then use this little clasp click it
back down
wow that's easy everything lines up okay
cool
the whole mission here is to allow your
thumbs to stay in the thumbstick
location for maximum dexterity so you
never have a need to remove your right
thumb from what would likely be your
vision where you're where you're looking
in a first-person shooter for example
instead of using this thumb for the core
functionality of the controller now you
can use your right hand near your
knuckle here and your index finger to
control multiple functionality and then
of course the X button is mapped over to
the index finger on your left hand but I
think the main value proposition here is
just these triggers these quick triggers
they allow for you to hold the trigger
on the right and left hand side in that
position very close to actuation so
there's a lot less lag between you know
essentially shooting a bullet and not
shooting a bullet so if you're going to
use these straps below in order to
trigger that or just use this trigger
extension you're going to be able to
fire off a lot quicker than you
otherwise would so that's going to pay
off when you're trying to you know
you're in a firefight you're trying to
respond very very quickly to something
that's going on the rest of this stuff
is going to take a little while to get
used to so you're going to need to
practice obviously in some people will
have better results than others you
won't know until you try everybody's a
little bit different
everyone games a little bit differently
and some people are more stubborn than
other people some people are going to
say I'm too used to and too good at just
using the regular buttons with my right
thumb so this thing is crazy and I don't
want to do it but for others you might
see something really innovative here and
saying hey why does it have to be the
other way maybe things could be
different in the gaming world to my
understanding wow this is it was
originally developed for individuals
with some kinds of disabilities
individuals who didn't have complete
control or use of every digit every
finger on their hand and since this
thing allows for you to have stationary
positions for each of your two hands and
you can get more use out of you know
specifically just a couple of digits so
definitely a cool thing worth check
the material is like a soft kind of
plastic black plastic this is standard
stuff and it comes on and off really
easily so it's not like just because you
have it on your controller it's going to
be there forever or if someone else
comes over and wants to use the
controller normally no big deal no big
issue there so a very cool and strange
looking contraption and you know
depending on the game you're playing
you'll have varying results for some
games it's going to be ridiculous for
other games it may actually help you a
little bit so if you're interested in
potentially improving your gameplay or
checking out just something unusual that
you haven't seen in the gaming world
before then maybe it's worthwhile to
check out anyway guys that wraps up this
video on the Avenger from end control I
will link the product down in the
description so you can check out pricing
and availability it is available for the
PlayStation as well so that link will
also be down there if you guys enjoy
this content please remember to leave a
thumbs up down below thanks as always

next episode very shortly
