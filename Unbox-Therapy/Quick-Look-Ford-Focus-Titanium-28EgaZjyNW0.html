another video but this one is special as
you can see this items a little bit
larger than what I usually cover here on
unbox therapy but I think is exciting
today we are gonna unbox a car and so
this is it the 2015 Ford Focus titanium
I think it's pretty good-looking to be
honest with you I don't know if these
rims are stock on this titanium model
but they're pretty slick-looking check
out the cargo I put my hockey equipment
in there look at this - we got a big
speaker that looks like a subwoofer it's
part of the Sony stereo system so you're
gonna get a little thump in the base
this also has a smart key to go with it
so hope that's not the right key I have
the key don't worry all you have to do
is walk up to the door it's gonna unlock
this is not too bad at all this is a
really comfy spot definitely you can see
it's outfitted there's a USB port I know
you guys care about that so some
expandability for your device is a place
to charge oh this is where it gets
interesting right in here we got a spot
for the key fob we have a line in an SD
card slot another USB and a 12 volt
power not have cup holders and good cup
holders are a big deal if you've had any
of those flimsy ones and you know what
I'm talking about looks like we got some
nice rubber inserts that's what you
deserve in life so we got a sunroof as
well in this model and the controls here
for operating it a little spot for your
sunglasses this is a must push button
start to a tap to put the car on or you
can hold it a little longer with your
foot on the brake to start up the entire
system and that's when it really comes
to life you see here you have you know
this electronic dash as well as this big
monitor in the center this is where your
Navs gonna come up is very gonna control
your multimedia
now the steering wheel is where you're
going to control a lot of stuff from in
the cockpit different controls for
volume media so let's go ahead and step
back out
one more thing I almost forgot this one
has blind spot monitoring which is
pretty cool so there's a little light
year in the side mirror which is going
to let you know if there's a vehicle in
your blind spot and warn you so that
you're not departing your lane when you
shouldn't be
so there you have it we just unboxed
possibly the biggest thing I've ever
covered on unbox therapy I don't know am
I right about that
anyways that wraps it up thanks very
much for watching if you enjoyed this
content make sure to leave a thumbs up
down below also leave a comment what do
you want to see unbox next maybe
something different than usual I had a
lot of fun doing this
big thanks to Ford for letting me check
out the brand new focus and other than
that I'm all done I'll catch you on the
next episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
