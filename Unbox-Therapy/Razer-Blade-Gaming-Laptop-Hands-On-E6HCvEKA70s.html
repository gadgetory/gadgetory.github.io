right now and we're looking at their
brand-new blade laptop this is a 17.3
inch laptop but the difference between
it and other gaming laptops is first and
foremost it's very thin and light it's
under an inch thick and it's nice
aluminum finish here and about 6.6
pounds which isn't too heavy for a
gaming laptop it's got a core i7 inside
at 3 gigahertz here and it's also got
this really funky trackpad over here
multi-touch trackpad if that's
configurable it can either be a trackpad
like the default but you can also get it
to do some other things like obviously
you know you can have a nice little
number pad here this one note gets you
back out of it they've even built in a
little YouTube app but this thing is
going to be programmable so you can set
it up for you know in-game functions
things in the future that we can't
really explain right now or we don't
know exactly how they're going to
function but this thing's supposed to be
out in about a month as I understand it
the hardware is pretty much set
it's a 1920 by 1200 screen a real nice
screen if you look at the back of the
lid here you've got the nice Razer logo
glowing on the back and it's all done up
in this aluminum here this real cool
aluminum finish if you have to believe a
backlit keyboard in that Razer green
color and as I said very exciting
product all around I know a lot of
people a lot of you guys out there are
big Razer fans and they teased a
touchscreen gaming platform last year at
CES now there's actually a product
that's going to hit the market that has
some of those features integrated so
it'll be very interesting to see how
game developers use this multi-touch
trackpad and also how people use it
or play whatever anyway guys that's just
been a quick update from the Razr booth
once again this is razors new blade
laptop should be available in about a
month's time retail price $27.99 stay
tuned for us later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
