I mean we all know this
we've been watching and probably the
thing I'm getting asked about the most
in the smartphone universe is folding
phones is this a thing should I wait for
these for a while there it was strictly
the galaxy fold that people were talking
about and rightfully so it looked like a
finished product like a real product and
we hadn't seen that before
it was obviously expensive nineteen
hundred and eighty dollars but then
things got even more interesting even
more spicy because this device right
here came out the huawei mate X well it
didn't come out it was announced showed
off and handled in fact and this is a
totally different take on the concept of
a folding phone so in the case of the
galaxy fold we have this clamshell type
design which puts another display a
supplementary display on the outside of
the clamshell which allows you to
interact with the phone when it's in its
folded position now that's different
from the way that Huawei approached
their folding design with the mate X so
of course the purpose of this video and
the question that everybody has is which
implementation do I think is better and
which phone should you be waiting for if
in fact you are waiting for a folding
phone so what while we did here they
took the giant display and they folded
it over in the opposite direction so the
whole thing's a display and then the
backside just shuts off when you have it
in smartphone mode what this means is
you end up with a bigger display that
you can utilize in a more typical
smartphone fashion but on the front of
the device I must say I saw some clips
of the device because of this folding
style it seems that along the hinge
portion you can see some wrinkles in the
OLED now of course you're when you're
flexing or bending anything you're gonna
have to leave some room for these kinds
of small variances but the promising
part is that when the phone is folded
out completely or in completely it looks
like it's not an issue now the next
thing to talk
about his price the huawei mate X is
like the most expensive smartphone at
least mass-market smartphone that I've
seen probably with the exception of all
you know those luxury things and whatnot
the mate axis said to be priced at 20 to
99 euros which converts to about $2,600
USD that's a very expensive smartphone
even if it so happens to fold but you
got 512 gigs of internal storage 8 gigs
of ram and you get a bigger display
especially in the folded mode when
compared to the galaxy fold now
price-wise it's about 600 more but when
it comes to both of these devices I sort
of look at them as these lost leader
type phones I'm not saying they're gonna
lose money on it but I don't think
margins are the most important aspect of
these products profits instead they need
to act like the f1 car for each of these
2 brands in order to send the message to
the smartphone marketplace that the
cutting edge exists well for huawei with
Huawei or for Samsung with Samsung and
it seems to be working because the
conversations that I'm having in public
are following along these lines
I think the Samsung product at this
point right now looks a little more
robust for some reason I have slightly
more confidence in their approach to the
design and the hinge in with the
mechanical components that they showed
off during the presentation but at a
distance not having handled either of
the two devices which of course I'd love
to Samsung
let's talk huawei ascend it over let's
get this ball rolling you can bring it
you can accompany it you could it can be
a briefcase with the with the head
handcuffed on there if it needs to be
but at a distance right now there's
something for me that's just a bit more
compelling about the Huawei product the
mate X and I'll tell you what it is I
don't think anybody in the folded mode
in the slab smartphone mode really wants
to to downgrade to a smaller display
than what they're currently used to and
with the Huawei device you don't have to
make that compromise you still have a
big you have a giant smartphone with a
slim bezel and when you're
using it in that mode it looks like a
legitimate substitute for whatever
flagship people are familiar with that's
a bit different than what Samsung is
doing obviously that said from a
manufacturing standpoint I got a give I
got to give a little bit more confidence
to Samsung just because of the hinge
design that they showed off it looked
robust it looked strong but if I had to
pick one right now if I had to have my
hands on one if I had to experiment with
one I think the Huawei product just
seems a little bit more advanced
nonetheless it's all good news because
at first when I first heard about these
things I didn't see legitimacy at all I
was like you know maybe I lacked the
imagination at the time but I saw so
many holes in these potential
implementations but these are both I
mean this has got me excited in the tech
realm in a way that hasn't happened in a
long time and you know when these
products launch there's gonna be a lot
of videos a lot of interests and those
questions that are happening for me
already in the real world I'm gonna be
able to address them in video format so
you can make a decision for yourself and
you could possibly move into the folding
future that looks to be inevitable at
this point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
