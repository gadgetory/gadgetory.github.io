with another video today's videos a lot
different than usual though I have no
idea what's inside this box
this thing has been hand-delivered by
the folks at Intel what have they told
me almost nothing
they said it's a box the anticipation
it's elevated my heart ring I got Dave
on the camera today shoutout to Dave
what do I do we is this some sort of
joke right now oh my what hey Louis do
you know where the materials used to
make your devices come from sin Wow
there are minerals in almost every piece
of technology you own oh I think we're
going deep today tantalum am I looking
at the real stuff right now the real
mineral how do you think these four
minerals ended up in your device
someone had gold legit gold pick that up
date right there tungsten Tim I don't
even know tin look like that you got
that whoa some of these minerals came
from mines in the Congo where innocent
people are being threatened by warlords
that's true
you get this nice shiny fancy device you
feel all special but it's true you don't
really think about all the stuff that
goes into it and where it comes from but
now this this feels more familiar hmm
how can I help
Wow
we just figured out the CF it's
conflict-free it's a movement here to
know more about where the materials that
go into the gadgets you love are coming
from and to make sure that you're not
sort of upholding these warlords and
enabling them to oppress individuals in
the process of you enjoying your phone
laptop tablet or otherwise our demand
for this is having an effect and impact
outside the realm of of the space that
you're living in and if anybody would
know it would be me and now I'm starting
to understand why Intel brought this
here okay I've been told is one more
thing in a box you can be certain that
my mining experience here personally
it's been completely conflict-free right
oh oh okay ed missed something look for
CF when you buy device ooh
proud to say that Intel processors are
now conflict-free tin often uses a
replacement for lead in printed circuit
boards and processors and used to solder
pieces together within devices gold pins
and processors are often made out of
gold because it's conductive but non
corrosive tantalum the key ingredient in
tantalum capacitors which can be used in
devices that require high performance in
a small amount of space like laptops and
tungsten my favorite of the bunch
because of its chemical properties it's
used to conduct electricity in
integrated circuits and metallic films
check it out your favorite little chip
now you don't need to feel guilty about
it look for the badge conflict free
and be proud of your gadgets and where
they came from</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
