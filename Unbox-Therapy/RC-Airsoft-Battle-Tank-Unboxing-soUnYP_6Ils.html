therapy and I got a different kind of
boxing for you guys right now this is an
RC battle tank type 90 but it shoots
airsoft bullets up to 25 meters now
normally you guys know I unbox tech and
I unbox gaming stuff this sort of got my
attention with the holiday season coming
up I had a little bit of nostalgia I
guess I pick it up from thinkgeek.com
for only 39 bucks and this thing is no
joke this thing is not for children it
can fire some serious bullets and it can
do so with some serious power so let's
get a closer look this this baby is
straight out of Japan so I don't intend
to get too much information out of this
manual here but as you can see it's
fairly complicated you've got the RC
battle tank target you can set this up
up to 25 metres away in attempt to nail
them I can think of more interesting
things to set up and try and shoot and
here is the official manual the RC
battle tank type 91 twenty-fourth scale
Ground self-defense system haha so it'll
be like your security system for your
house but as you can see in the
instruction manual here it's Japanese
through and through that looks
complicated as hell let's go ahead and
get a look at the battle tank so we've
got a battery pack of course to power up
the device this is a big tank of a
battery pack to go with your tank and
you're gonna charge that up with an AC
adapter you've also got a nine volt
battery and this is gonna power up your
remote control as you see up on the top
of the package a fairly complicated
looking remote control you're going to
get some ammunition
the Powerball bullet and you gotta read
what it says on the back it's got
cautions of body hurt you gotta love
those cheap Asian translations I do not
want body hurt please no more body hurt
so I'm gonna fire this thing away from
the body here is the remote control and
again it's got like a dozen or more
buttons on here you can pick your
different frequencies I think there's
ABC frequencies and of course you've got
different
for firing the cannon the turret on this
baby here I'm gonna put the tank to the
side for a second and get some of this
crap out of the way so we can get a
better look at it but first there's
actually a few more things included in
the box here first of all there is an
accessory box and I'm gonna go ahead and
look at what we get inside of here you
have some nice graphics on the outside
get you ready for this household warfare
if you will
oh so we've got some accessories for
adding even more detail to the tank some
stickers or decals as well as some just
some extra details like little things
you can apply to the outside of the tank
including a driver if you so need one if
you if you want to make it look more
legit you can throw a driver on there so
that's what that guy is there for and
then lastly you've got your AC power
adapter and that's for charging up that
battery pack although it did come with a
little bit of a charge so I'm gonna go
ahead and power this thing up in a
second you've got to screw your antenna
in to your remote control obviously to
get the best range possible now this
thing extends out pretty far so I'm not
sure what the distance will be like but
we'll have to wait and try that out you
want to insert your 9-volt battery of
course in here as well so you can get up
and running and to take a look at just
how this thing operates now here's a
closer look at the ammunition that
you're gonna get and it's like I think
it's like all other airsoft ammunition
so it's pretty hard little pellets
you're not gonna want to shoot these
things at each other for fun although
I'm sure a lot of you would want to but
I'm thinking more like a toy warfare
like you know set up some unassuming
characters to take some of this
ammunition some of this fire so here's
the control scheme you can again rotate
the turret you can lift the turret up
and down the gun portion and then you've
got forward forward right etc you're
you're firing the triggers are on the
back side of the pistol style remote and
I got this thing up and running and it's
it's actually a beast I mean it's pretty
quick and you get full articulation of
the turret the gun even moves up and
down so you can get rid of you know
precise with your targeting and
actually a lot of fun for 39 bucks I'm
not gonna lie I'm probably gonna take
this thing up against some of my kids
toys and uh see and see how they stand
up to it but that's really what this is
about this is just a fun sort of gadget
it you could get for somebody as a gift
I mean 39 bucks is not a huge investment
and there you can see that gun lifting
up and down
I assume this thing's gonna be real hard
to target I'm not gonna lie but it'll be
fun to try and do it anyways your
ammunition actually goes up top in this
portion here and there's a switch for
turning the gun on and off I suppose if
you want to let kids play with it you
can turn the gun off or if you don't
want to fire by accident you also get a
red LED to indicate when you're about to
fire now firing is not super easy it
takes two buttons to do so almost like a
safety again so it doesn't happen by
accident so you hold the first red
button on the front followed by the one
underneath and and you'll be firing
airsoft bullets like nobody's business
now in this particular demo I didn't
really have the space to be to be firing
these bullets I was worried about my
camera but if you guys want to see me do
that in the future then I'll load this
baby up here and switch that gun on and
I'll probably take on some dudes that
look like these guys right here so
thumbs up if you want to see me demolish
a little city full of these guys on
video these happy unassuming characters
thumbs up and let me know in the
comments anyway guys this is being the
unboxing of this RC battle tank this
baby is from thinkgeek.com for 39 bucks
you can pick one up in time for the
holiday season if you think this thing
looks like fun and believe me it is
anyway guys if you enjoyed this unboxing
then hopefully you can like and favorite
this video as it does help me out a
bunch and if you guys haven't heard I'm
