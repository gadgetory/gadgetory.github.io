pocket right now or maybe it's not in
fact you shouldn't be sitting on it you
end up with a back problem like my
friend monopoly over here that you over
there he's in terrible shape
I switched wallets a while ago to
something a lot more modern and I
switched from the back pocket to the
front pocket especially since I've been
carrying cash around less and less
companies have attempted to innovate in
the space and create new concepts new
ideas around the wallet scenario since
for now we all still carry them so this
one belongs to my brother it's what is
it leather actually smells like
something we've been doing with this
then maybe a little more slim than some
of those maybe the wallet your dad
carried those classic you know that
george costanza wall a little more
slimming than that this one belongs to
AJ you see this is another step in that
direction even more slim but you still
if you put a card in here you're still
kinda there's a little bit of extra work
involved compared to the wallet that
I've been carrying it's called this
secret and I did a video on this a
little while ago you tell looking
beat-up now because I've been carrying
it and it has this cool release
mechanism on the bottom see I hit that
button boom everything look at that it's
addictive on its own even when you're
not paying for things for those of you
that must carry cash you could remove a
couple of cards take a pile of cash
slide it in there it'll pop up along
with everything else that brings me to
today alright because I'm always I've
always got my ear to the street when it
comes to new gadgets I got an email from
a company called phantom now these guys
claim that they have solved the wallet
problem I'll link the relevant details
in the description they said we're gonna
send something over I said let's do it
and you could tell we have this very
fancy unbox therapy package in front of
me now there you have it look at that
guy right there
carbon fiber as you can tell now I
believe this is available in a couple of
different materials so this one isn't to
your taste you could switch that up you
can also get it with this clip installed
of course that's going to be for cash
that you can carry on the outside
probably one of the few issues with this
particular well if I do this they fall
out that's one of the things that this
phantom wallet is a me
to Seoul by having it fit in under this
Ridge here see that
so now much of the card is supported by
this overlap so nothing's coming out I
can do it with one hand or I could do it
with two like this you see how it
exposes the corner here so I can then
grab that one even if it's in the middle
these are obviously not the cards that
are normally in my wallet for privacy
purposes don't chuckle monopoly where
are you put your pants back on I would
put the most frequent card the credit
card on the top because then you can
skip the mechanism all together with
this cut out here you just slide it
straight out if you've got a J solution
here stack a bunch of cards in here
because you have the space to do so
which tightens the whole thing up and
then you're doing this you try to get
under it when you overstuffed these
things the cards get tight in there
it'll stretch over time but that's my
issue with that style they make a bigger
one to this guy over here and you can
see more space to work with more real
estate so in this case you could
probably have five six cards and then a
little bit of cash you can keep some
cash on the outside and that's what it
looks like all stacked up this is a bit
of a good move can I convince the owners
of those other wallets to make a change
so let's bring them in AJ VIN AJ VIN
let's go we're gonna have to settle for
AJ here where you want the seeds yeah
all right there we go intimate phantom
wallet my old secret wallet your wallet
Vin's wallet okay I got to confess
what's going on I don't love my wallet
so I had a bellboy for a long time more
like this one or more like this more
like this one with the hole where you
could slide did it look as cool as this
though no and that's any that's one of
the reasons I got rid of it I switched
to this I don't love it
I like these hard shells I've seen you
carry yours around awhile yeah if you
like to put your wallet in your back
pocket which I do it can be a little
rough sitting on it on a metal piece of
metal another thing people say is it's
gonna that maybe the the metal will chew
up the inside of their pocket and you
might have tighter jeans than I do
be impressive if it was the case yours
have gotten tighter that's like listen
this cliff could it also be one of those
clips that sit out on your pocket I
think it could give them that ACMA Jack
stay away from the groin though I'm
gonna Vanna White it all right let's not
a the family show here
your eyes are trailing off this ain't
Brokeback Mountain Jack alright so there
you have it the future of wallets we
just covered it all for you AJ was on
this show today
so it's not Tom so that's a bonus me and
Tom we what is that you guys do there a
little bit of it oh my goodness family
show AJ huh monopoly just come say hello
for a second a walk by just do your
zipper up first what's your what's this
flap a leather doing for you huh
not much save a cow I don't care
leave them with something they can carry
with them from this point forward in
their lives Wow a lot of on-the-spot
pressure yeah I got nothing if the world
ends zombie apocalypse or EMP do not I
repeat do not look for a boat ok that's
your worst option apparently and that
leaves the boats available for me thank
you I thought telling them not to use
the boat so we have the boats Jack turn
the camera that way yeah
[Laughter]
