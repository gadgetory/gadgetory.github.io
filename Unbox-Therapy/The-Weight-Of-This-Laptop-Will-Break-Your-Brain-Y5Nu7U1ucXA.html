extreme x1 extreme x1 carbon it's so
much fun I'm exploring the universe of
Windows laptop that's what brought me
here today this is the 17 inch gram 2.9
5 pounds in a 17 inch laptop now to put
that in perspective that says heavy as a
13 inch MacBook Air or as light I should
say granted it's not like a crazy
powerhouse or anything like that it's
got the Intel graphics inside of it so
keep that in mind if you're a gamer
the display is qHD so it's 2560 by 1600
an IPS display also let's see how it
stacks up I'm curious about the keyboard
I'm trying a lot of them and I'm curious
oh my goodness gracious that is crazy
light weight wow it feels like a dummy
laptop you know you're walking through
IKEA and in the setup there feels like a
dummy like a fake that's how light this
thing is not a huge power brick either
that's pretty portable Type C 2 wired
Ethernet it doesn't even make sense
how light this laptop is boom
I thought 17 inch laptops were dead I
had a 17 inch MacBook Pro once upon a
time that thing was a tank Toshiba
laptop before any of this all started I
thought it was the coolest guy fans were
going off I had an external monitor I
thought it was the coolest guy I wasn't
it there was nothing cool about it look
at us now look at today things have
changed SD card slot headphone jack to
traditional USB ports as a Kensington
lock your power port I wish it was Type
C though there is a Type C port and HDMI
out and another USB port under three
pounds still got a wide array of poor
availability okay we crack it open the
cover and there it is look how slim the
bezel is a pretty typical layout on the
deck chiclet style keyboard it opens to
this extent go ahead and boot this up
okay little bit of flex in the deck I
notice that right away you see that
jacked off the deck he's not like a
solid piece of aluminum so you're
starting to figure out
they're getting the weight of this thing
down so much you know you're carrying
this thing around frequently the
difference between three and five or six
pounds even that's substantial the key
travel is probably somewhere above the
low profile butterfly switch on the
MacBook Pro you get a little bit of
travel but it ain't much it ain't
ThinkPad territory
they've also squished in the number pad
over here now I don't use that at all
typing you're kind of you're off-center
now the trackpad is glass taking my
first glance at to display and I have to
say it's probably the best part it's
just a lot of screen I don't feel like
the hardware experience is on par with
some of the stuff I've been using let's
go ahead and load up some video here on
YouTube and see what we're working with
sound wise this trackpad it's so you see
that jacket travels maybe in this case
too much but this one is more
supercharged it's called the Thunder
puck they're firing down onto the desk
you get a certain harshness to the sound
sometimes we get some speakers on the
deck like facing me resonates the sound
and depending on there's just a pretty
harsh experience but it's a bit of a
shame because that's a good-looking
video right there look at this Jack it's
a great place to watch something if you
want to call the thing the Gramm you got
to get down sub three pounds that's what
this laptop is right here and it's like
can you really do that and maintain the
caliber of the various components at the
same time another thing I just noticed
is that because of the number pad the
trackpad has to be offset a little bit
to the left so that's one thing I would
definitely change it's really about the
display with this unit in the lightest
package possible we'll get in here for a
second oh he brought his MacBook Pro
which is definitely heavier than this
check it out oh yeah this almost feels
like plastic you don't with the gray
sweatshirt today yeah in a black hat yes
yeah I don't like this oh my god this
feels heavy now I mean I can barely fit
this thang
man it's hard to be super lightweight
and give the impression of quality this
kind of
brings back memories of like the iPhone
4 when I first came out it was just so
different from the Samsung Galaxy line
because the Samsung phones were plastic
at the time the iPhone just had like a
premium feel you know and it's because
of the wait are you having a moment
right now ladies and gentlemen will he
do it's gonna be in a backpack all day
there's a student
yo there's a DJ the difference between
three pounds and four pounds and five
pounds and six pounds it's not the
laptop for me though but it's pretty
amazing I agree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
