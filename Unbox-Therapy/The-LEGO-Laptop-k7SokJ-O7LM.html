another video and today I'm going to
combine two of your favorite things a
MacBook and Lego you've never expected
to have those two words combined in such
a fashion but that's what this thing is
about the brick book build whatever you
want and it can live on the lid of your
laptop let's see some examples donut
who doesn't like a donut penguin another
fan favorite or you could just write a
message you can mix it up you could be
in class get really bored flip your
laptop over and build something
do I have Lego to go that was louder
than I expected it to be yes I've got
Lego the classic that's it simple now
currently you're wondering why does my
MacBook Pro look like some black leather
that's from D brand okay just clip it on
there yes yes if you've got that baby
out and about people are going can I say
a word or two about Lego might be the
greatest toy on the planet the
capabilities of Lego are truly endless
if you can think of it you can build it
and now you can take that with you as a
point of pride there might be a pretty
girl having a latte caramel macchiato
and you just like real quick you
rearrange your Lego you drop a little
caramel macchiato maybe you put a heart
beside it the rest is history because of
who I want to first do a quick little
unbox therapy logo on here now this is
not going to be easy especially with
this selection of bricks not a huge
selection you is an easy letter I can
get behind you or can maybe literally
whoa there we go you will do a chunkier
n that n is too big look at this Lego
heads when they started coming out with
this that was a game changer right there
check it out okay the removal tool ah
yes sir
there
they're just looking modern right now
yeah
the ezo hat now the ex so special sound
they're here whoo unbox doo doo yeah I
like that okay H is really easy right
think I like that
whoo that's a new didn't you didn't
think I kid you didn't think I had it in
me
small R here yeah looks like that what
do you think a little weird like little
ramps guy he would be it for green I
think yeah oh you didn't believe it you
didn't think I had it in me I'm at the
coffee shop you're like whoa I think if
you really wanted to like write a
message and have it there permanently
the move would be to go with like the
thinner style of brick maybe it's for a
kid maybe it's for yourself because
you're a kid at heart I think we should
do one more creation we do need to do a
face reveal of Jax to be able to
encompass all that is Jack in the form
of Lego bricks
well you could probably put that on the
same level as a the Sistine Chapel look
at the tool unbelievable now the thing
to remember about Jack you get the ears
are quite large makes them great for the
job it's always listening they resembled
that of an elephant you can tell here
that's starting to look like him now
unlike his ears his arms are very short
there's your jet face reveal aren't you
guys happy now you know what he looks
like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
