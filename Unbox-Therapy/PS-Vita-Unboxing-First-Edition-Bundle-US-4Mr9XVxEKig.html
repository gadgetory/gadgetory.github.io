and today we're taking a look at the
PlayStation Vita first edition bundle
now for those of you that follow the
channel you know I already unbox the
Japanese version of the Vita long before
this one came out but I still wanted to
unbox this one on the channel to show
you what you get if you're going to buy
this bundle in the US or even just a
regular PS Vita in the US or Canada for
that matter so here is the PS Vita box
and the only difference I noticed
between this and the Japanese box is the
identification in the bottom right
corner stating that you're going to get
a 4 gigabyte memory card included in the
kit and that is what I have right here
we'll take a closer look at that memory
card near the end of the video
now also included in the box that
weren't included in the Japanese version
are the AR cards and for those of you
unfamiliar with AR cards it stands for
augmented reality similar to the cards
that shipped with the Nintendo 3ds these
are going to allow you to play augmented
reality style games the next thing
included in this package is a carrying
case the official PS Vita carrying case
from Sony it has a soft texture on the
exterior but also sort of a hard shell
underneath should be plenty protective
for your PS Vita we'll take a closer
look inside to see exactly how its
configured you have a mesh pocket along
top a couple of little sleeves here for
your games a place to keep your games
etc and then underneath there there's
sort of a hard plastic insert that
covers where your PS Vita will live so
you should know that the screen should
have ample protection once it's inserted
in the case give you a way of traveling
with your Vita without worrying about
that big huge screen getting scratched
or anything along those lines
so the next thing included is a copy of
little deviance and as you guys know the
PS Vita games are tiny about the same
size as an SD card and I'll show you in
a quick second here I'll do an actual
comparison between this PS Vita game and
an SD card they're almost identical and
it almost makes you wonder why it isn't
just in SDR anyways little deviance is a
one-player game it does utilize the rear
camera as well as the motion sensor and
as I said before here's a closer look at
the physical characteristics of the game
and its really uncanny how similar it is
to a standard SD card as I mentioned
earlier here I've got a King Max and old
King Max 8 gigabyte that I don't really
use anymore but as you can see they're
almost identical in size now in terms of
the boxes as you can see here my
Japanese box is identical - a little bit
of Japanese literature that I can read
of course but inside they are identical
as far as what ships with them you've
got the actual PS Vita unit I'm going to
do a quick little mini comparison here
between the u.s. model and the Japanese
model but let me tell you something they
are identical there is no difference and
since they're not region-locked
it doesn't matter where your PS Vita
came from in the world it'll play any
games no matter where you are and you
can set the language to your local
region now if you want to see the PS
Vita in more detail definitely check out
my original Japanese version unboxing
I'll put a link in the description as
well as up in the annotations so lastly
we've got the 4 gigabyte card which is
only good enough for one two full games
three movies thousand songs etc I
actually upgraded to a 32 gigabyte card
but let me tell you something they
aren't cheap anyway guys if you enjoyed
this content hopefully you can like and
favorite this video as it does help me
out a bunch and one more thing I want to
mention is if you haven't friended me on
Facebook yet you should definitely go
ahead and do so it gives me a chance to
talk to you guys about things that I
don't normally get to talk about on
unbox therapy or on the Beast feed so
definitely go ahead and friend me there
any unbox therapy fan is a friend of
mine I'll put a link down in the
description
it's facebook.com slash my name but
anyway links right down below friend me
alright guys until next time I'll see
you around later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
