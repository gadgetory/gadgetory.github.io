is something I've been waiting on for a
very long time it's something it's kind
of crazy it's hard to believe it
actually exists and that it's shown up
inside this box is a flamethrower or
sorry not a flamethrower it's from the
boring company Elon Musk's little side
project mine just showed up an actual
not a flamethrower which is a
flamethrower
well you hook this guy up and it shoots
flames so you tell me is that a
flamethrower
we got the propane we got the
marshmallows
thanks to Willie dude so let's crack
this guy open and see if we can make
some flames not not a flamethrower now
apparently they decided to call it this
because of shipping restrictions on
actual flamethrowers so instead just
come right out and say it it's not a
flamethrower it sort of looks like a
Super Soaker
oh boy dear not so boring customer the
lawyers have spoken and due to shipping
restrictions we can't mail your glorious
propane fuel to make it up to you we've
included some cold hard cash stroll down
to your local stores stock up on some
nice c3h8 you'll be looking for a 14
point 1 ounce propane cylinder that's
what we have sweet okay they cover the
cost of the propane because I guess
originally they hope to ship it with the
propane and they couldn't but then they
also gave you the regional cash that's
pretty wild
adjust the regulator just a flame only
operate the not a flamethrower in a
well-ventilated area review the warnings
look it might not be a flamethrower but
there's a flame coming out of it so all
right let's check it out
oh oh man it's it's heavier than I
expected it's substantial and a
collector's item cause there's only so
many of these you see my serial number
here 1 3 9 15 and it says flamethrower
below up but then not up above that but
that my friends looks like a really cool
video game esque type of weaponry
that's okay just like so you won't make
sure you get the right tank this is the
14 point 1 ounce tank that's the one you
want available at your local hardware
store rotate the regulator knob
counterclockwise until it stops then the
fuel will come out you'll hear and smell
gas well good lord
press the red ignition until the flame
is lit ready turning the knob Jack you
ready
Oh oh my god oh my god you are there
sprinklers in here Oh moly that's bigger
flame than I expected
how close is it to over there can
someone tell me
that thing is real
there's a sprinkler right up there right
there
ha
oh my god know what weapons are scary
holy moose burning quick disclaimer it's
let's say use this thing in like an open
environment as much as possible if you
bought one of these I hope you're not a
child that thing that is serious it's
more power and flame than I expected I
watched a couple videos when you're in
the presence of the flame and the
burning it's also real I mean obviously
I should have known that but holy smokes
that thing is cool this centre valve
here you turn that to open up the gas
and then this regulator controls how
much of it makes it to the end so when
this is turned on more the idle flame
before you hit the trigger it's smaller
it's shorter and then you hit the
trigger and it jumps out the whole thing
feels sturdier than I expected as well
it's made out of some sort of a plastic
but like a really solid weighty plastic
so when you're holding it it feels
surprisingly substantial more than I
expected it to
I can be kind of controlled with it to
be honest like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
