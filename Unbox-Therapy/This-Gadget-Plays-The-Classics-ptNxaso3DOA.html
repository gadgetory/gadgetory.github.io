another video and today we're going to
take a trip down memory lane but we're
going to do so in a new product this is
the Sega Mega Drive ultimate portable
game player please explain for us Lou
this is a portable unit that you hold in
your hands you travel with and it
carries with it 80 classic titles from
the Sega universe you know Sega yeah so
what does that mean that means Mortal
Kombat but there's a lot of other games
too if you look on the back here look at
all those titles
I saw where Streets of Rage you kidding
me right now you remember Ecco the
Dolphin you can be a dolphin as I
understand it looking at the package
here there's also an SD card slot so
look Internet games download feature via
SD card slot it looks like you can
install games after the fact well 5
hours of battery life cut this baby open
the fake screen protector that makes it
look like it's on a mini USB cable to
charge it up oh wow you can play this on
the TV by using an AV cable
where's AV go oh there's an AV out the
control layout is similar to an actual
sega controller on the top here that's
where we have the SD card slot that I
mentioned a volume control mini USB for
charging it up and the a/v out and then
if I flip it over on the bottom that's
the headphone jack and the on/off switch
see if we have juice we do alright we
are booted up and does this menu that
pops up and check out these sound
effects right now listen to this
I mean they don't make sounds like that
anymore what am I gonna do first okay
let me try echo get to be a dolphin okay
guys not messing around right now
holy I mean it's just a game with a
dolphin and we're going deep on the
soundtrack Oh with the speed and the
quickness can I eat these fish right now
I got the dolphin communication
there's something about tactile controls
I know a lot of you kids are gonna be
like Lou why are you so pumped about
this dolphin right now it looks like an
iPhone game first of all how dare you
second of all listen to the soundtrack
third of all I got buttons to press like
real like buttons I have no idea what
I'm doing in this game I'm gonna go I'm
heading out I'm gonna pick something
else oh okay okay easy Sonya Blade
come on I was way ahead there you go go
with the low with the low kick oh she
hit me with duh why do I feel like I was
better at that game I'm gonna try
scorpion there you go with the low
how're you gonna come back hello it's so
cheap I was all I threw was the low kick
with the sweep oh there's another round
oh man it's hard not to do sonic but can
I do Streets of Rage how emotional are
you right now
Oh Lu I don't I don't get it what's the
big deal here I could just get some
emulators on my phone I could do this I
could be sure you could what this is
kind of like a novelty it's nostalgia if
you're gonna play these games you might
as well have tactile buttons the way
that they were programmed to be played
and maybe you don't want some external
controller maybe you want to waste the
battery on your phone this is a fun
little way keeping the dream alive
Streets of Rage style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
