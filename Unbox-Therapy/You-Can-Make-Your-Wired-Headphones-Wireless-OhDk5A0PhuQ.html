Technica a cult favorite that then
became one of the bestsellers one of the
most popular headphones on all of Amazon
okay fine so it's a great headphone it's
a popular headphone why are you talking
about it right now Lou what's happening
what has developed something very
exciting in fact so many of you have
gone out and bought this headphone but
you've been stuck you're sitting at home
with the wired connection or you have
the wire heading out from this port here
to your mobile device or wherever it is
that your audio source lives but today I
got this product over here from a
company called East Brooklyn labs the be
Al - m50x this is a Bluetooth adapter
specifically for the m50x this little
guy will plug in to where your cord
normally would plug in and you will pair
up to the adapter it's modular it's
beautiful now this isn't the first
solution I have found for taking a wired
headphone and making it Wireless there
in fact other ways to do that as well
from various brands so here's an adapter
from a company called air mod and
they're focusing on the Bose products so
the qc25 in the QC 15 here are a couple
products to turn those headphones into
Wireless and they fit in there perfectly
as well and then we've got this company
here EXO audio they make similar
adapters but for Beats headphones so
here's one for the Beats Studio here's
one for the beats solo2 and then the
last one is this one here it's called
air link now to me these are the two
most exciting why because I've got some
m50x already and because the air link
takes any headphone and makes it
Wireless so this little guy this little
module would you look at that how pretty
is that little thing so this will clip
on to your shirt your sweater pocket
coat something like that and not only
does it give you control over volume
your microphone for answering phone
calls and even what looks like a shutter
button for a camera right there this
clips here the ear pods go up and into
your ears and now you're not tethered to
your pocket I know before you say it I
know what you want to say you want to
see but that's not actually Wireless
because there's a wire going to this
module but it is a lot more can
then having the wire go all the way down
to the pocket so with a product like
this you're able to shorten the distance
from the cord to your ears okay so
that's cool
the air link the other adapters that I
mentioned earlier exciting stuff if you
have one of those pairs of headphones or
if you want the universal one but the
one that I'm most pumped up for is this
one here from East Brooklyn labs because
like I said the iconic m50x now gets the
Bluetooth treatment it now turns into a
bluetooth headphone and best of both
worlds here you can still use it with a
wire if you want to so let's crack this
open see what it's all about
so it has a similar shape to those beats
adapters that I showed you earlier also
in the package is a tiny little micro
USB cable to keep this thing charged up
and then the adapter itself it's got a
matte finish on it which I like so it
shouldn't get too many fingerprints your
power switch is over here and let's see
how it fits in so this is the design of
the m50x if you've never seen it it has
this channel which moves downloaded oh
you might be wondering as well Lou
what's up with your m50x why you have
the cool color on there so this is a D
brand skin actually allowing you to
customize the look of the m50x I told
you it's that popular they even made a
skin for this how many people have this
headphone and worth mentioning before I
insert this the m50x doesn't allow for a
3.5 millimeter connection on the
headphone side it's actually smaller
it's 2.5 millimeter right there okay so
let's go ahead and check out this fit
here ooh I like that
so the way that they've built this this
is cool design here this section of the
headphone sinks into this section of the
adapter right here so it doesn't hang
down too low it's not it's not much of
an obstruction at all in fact it only
increases the length of the ear cup by
not even half an inch and that's what it
looks like when you're wearing it so
well here I mean it's really not a big
deal it has hardly any weight to it and
all of a sudden my favorite headphones
are now Wireless I mean that's cool so
there you can see see that little blue
light it might be tough to see because
it's lit up in here but the blue light
starts flashing immediately when you
have the power switch flipped on I
mentioned that this charges up over
microUSB and then on the front you have
your controls the Bluetooth button
volume up and down I think it's
impairing mode immediately
though because it is flashing blue right
now see that there so let's check if
it's available m50x bao m50x
it's now I'm gonna put these on and
let's see how this sounds through the
adapter so as far as the button in the
middle goes I think you might hold it to
re-establish a Bluetooth connection but
if you tap it it pauses what you're
listening to so you need to have a
conversation and tap it again and then
it picks up again they've done a serious
job here I am beyond impressed that is a
package the m50x is already a great
headphone one of the minor drawbacks you
can't use it wirelessly now you can
without giving up the wired capabilities
the sound quality though is probably the
most impressive part lots of juice which
I didn't expect on a large / ear
headphone and just overall punchy it
sounds good
I would recommend this if you have an
m50x or you're thinking of getting an
m50x this is probably the best companion
piece that you could add to it I'll link
it down below in the description they've
done a great job just remember this
isn't your only Avenue as I mentioned
earlier in the video there are solutions
to essentially turn any wired headphone
into a wireless headphone including
earbuds and so on with the universal
adapter I showed you called the air link
and then of course the separate products
for the beats headphones and the Bose
headphones I just think this is probably
my favorite of the bunch so check these
guys out oh and also worth mentioning
the company that makes this adapt their
East Brooklyn labs they're claiming a 5
hour runtime so 5 hours of listening on
a single charge and I also just noticed
not only is it available on Amazon but
you can get it bundled so you get the
headphones and the adapter all in one
package either way I'll link it down
below
