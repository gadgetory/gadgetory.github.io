for the next cool thing on Amazon
something that I find interesting and
this is one of those things it's from a
company called urban armor gear it's a
case for your MacBook they make it for a
few different models that gives it some
extra shock protection in this
particular case drop tested it passes
some sort of military standard to the
reason this stood out to me is because
as a kid I can remember looking at those
like police laptops those Panasonic
Toughbook why was I when was I was I in
the cruiser like how was I looking at
police laptops what am I really saying
right now the Panasonic Toughbook I
thought that it was really cool I always
liked this idea of a super rugged laptop
you don't see those around too much
anymore you know you see a lot of mac
books but they're so delicate and dainty
look this is the new MacBook look at
that thing it's nice that it's slender
and whatnot but it just it doesn't give
you the feel of durability this thing
aims to change that and turn your
MacBook into some kind of Robocop let's
crack it open and see do I have a knife
do mmm
laptop not included yeah well you didn't
pay laptop prices did you my assumption
is that this thing is always to remain
on Wow when you open and close your
laptop it stays on via this hinge right
here so let's give this a shot slide
this baby in
that was unintentional all right so I
thought that just kind of clips on like
that pretty easy and then the top part
oh did I do that right there we go let's
see here use English whoa hello there
okay now something interesting I'm
noticing is when you open it up that
little hinge kind of elevates the deck
of the keyboard see what I mean so you
get this kind of ergonomic angle here
and then when you close it comes down
like this whoa and it actually snaps
shut it looks it even looks like those
old-school Panasonic Toughbook whoo I
like it
I mean this couldn't be further from the
Apple aesthetic but that's kind of the
point isn't it you're a rugged type of
dude maybe you're a student and you just
chuck this thing in your bag and you
don't want to think about it
toss it across the room play a little
frisbee why don'tcha the corners have
this thick rubber on them which extends
past to the edge of the actual laptop so
if this baby goes down you could be a
road warrior type you're on an airplane
crack it open somebody bumps it you know
the guy next to you nobody likes the guy
next to you he's too big the shoulders
are this might be the move three two one
oh you want to see more let me know I
don't know maybe I'll blast it with a
bazooka or something I'm not gonna if
you're like me and you had the Robocop
poster on the wall as a kid I think this
might speak to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
