quite honest because keyboard quality
keyboard experience has been suffering
lately it's an epidemic in fact it's all
about butterflies and low profile and
where's my clocks at you're sacrificing
a large amount of tactile feedback in
exchange for thinness in most cases on
laptops but even in some cases like the
keyboard that ships for example with an
iMac the Apple magic keyboard very
magical membrane style keyboard very
little feedback super slim for what
reason I mean kind of just for looks
really look how thin it is so pretty
I've been on a mission some call it a
red ring to promote or at least look at
and talk about the wonders of mechanical
keyboards today I'm on the fence a
little bit this product in front of me
it is a mechanical keyboard but it
claims to be the world's thinnest so you
have these worlds colliding thinness
mechanical key switches can they coexist
can it all work or are we compromising
too much to trying to do it all now the
one in front of me here it's called key
Kron but I don't know that's a name
change or what cuz underneath this
thicker you see it says key Tron key
Tron key Kron look it's like a
Kickstarter campaign right now they
raised a few bucks they're aiming to
manufacture this for the masses the
world's thinnest mechanical keyboard now
this one in front me is actually from
Mac it's got the Mac key layout but
they're making a Windows version as well
that's also available it's a hundred and
twenty bucks so it will cost you a few
of your dollars but if we get this
mechanical feedback and you're enjoying
yourself and your life is improving
maybe it's worth the money
I don't know so this one has a white
backlight but I think they've also got
an RGB version that's your cup of tea
let's crack this baby open it may have
solved all keyboard problems that have
ever existed
the mashup
mechanical thin all together now
so this keyboard has bluetooth so it's
wireless of course you have a wired
connection as well it also comes with a
key cap remover and some extra key caps
okay so it's very thin so this is what
it looks like this is the black version
so the deck here is made out of metal
you can see the key switches look a lot
like Apple's own keyboard but they're
elevated you can see the mechanical
switch underneath there and in this case
it's colored blue now these aren't
cherry switches I'm guessing from the
blue coloring they're probably some sort
of MX blue knockoff now because this is
the Mac version you have some Mac
specific keys including the command key
and of course some of the
multifunctional F keys up here yeah we
have brightness for the keyboard
backlight we have volume up and down and
so on I mean in this case it looks like
this even a microphone button and I
think that's like a Siri button it is a
Syria but until very Mac specific on
this particular unit the controls are on
the back side of the unit here you can
see you have a switch for Bluetooth off
and cable connection so obviously you
can use it Wireless or with the cable
windows and Android or Mac and iOS you
can flick that switch in either
direction so this will still work with
Windows obviously your key layout will
just be a bit different and then also we
have the wired connection USB type-c
let's boot this thing up see if we have
any juice on here I'm gonna go into
Bluetooth mode oh you see it lighting up
right away should we kill the lights for
a quick second okay that is a bright
backlight I'm happy with that
very well that's a backlit keyboard
ladies and gentlemen stop fiddling the
quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
it's
it's not the most satisfying I've ever
felt but it is not a little Chiclets
membrane situation there is an actuation
point there's a clock it's got I mean
that's what you want it's what you're
looking for in life
now obviously the volume level goes up
people that are nearby in your
environment may get irritated but as we
all know if you're the type of person
who's into mechanical keyboards there's
no one that wants to be near you anyways
it's true now this is kind of a hybrid
as I look at it like yes it's a
mechanical keyboard but it doesn't have
some of the things that I love about
mechanical keyboards like the big sort
of weighted keys themselves with the you
know the ones that kind of have the wood
is that concave they got a little
curvature to them these are very flat
keys more in line with what you might be
used to on something like a MacBook but
then just with the extra key travel to
go with it it's still not gonna be on
the same level as like a nice beefy kind
of mechanical keyboard it's in between
two - it's the style and the substance
it's the form and the function trying
they're merging together in this
particular product alright let's hook it
up first of all for a thinness scale
like this is a very thin laptop that is
the Microsoft Surface laptop - and as
you can tell I mean these things are
pretty much the same thickness so that's
pretty impressive
it's so thin in fact you could pop it
into a bag like if you have a strictly
mobile setup with like an iPad or
something like that
this could go into a laptop bag quite
easily unlike some other mechanical
keyboards and to be honest there are so
few mechanical keyboards to choose from
that are wireless to begin with anyhow
these two things would go together quite
nicely even though this is the Mac
version of the keyboard
hey what can I say I mean it's getting
the job done that's for certain the
quick brown how dare you he's sick of
the brown fox jack he's jumping over the
dog
someone especially posting on the
internet who uses shocking and
nihilistic speech and opinions that they
themselves may or may not actually
believe to gain attention and come
across as more dangerous and unique
person most edge most edge words are
teenagers trying to seem overly cool or
over casually apathetic that has a
thousand thumbs up and only 89 down so
I'm going with that
so then definitely edge lords like
mechanical keyboards like 100% you're
gonna be able to hack out like a lot
more in terms of edgy remarks with fewer
errors which let's be honest if you're a
lord of anything spelling errors are not
gonna cut it
you know if life is meaningless
you better not spell something you know
you better get the spelling right anyhow
so there you have it it is a wonderful
little device it does what it says it's
gonna do it's a mechanical keyboard
which is slim and portable it's not
cheap you've got to really be into this
thing if you're gonna go out of your way
to pick this up nonetheless it's on
Kickstarter if you're into it myself you
know to be honest if I'm gonna go
mechanical I'm going all the way I'm
getting big keys switches that clack I'm
doing the whole dance because this
keyboard here to be honest even though
it is mechanical it's just once you've
got the flat keys it's like you kind of
lose some of the points of a mechanical
keyboard in the first place
this only gets you partway there but if
you want something that's just a slight
upgrade on the Apple keyboard for
example the magic keyboard this is kind
of in-between it too maybe it I don't
know maybe it's more attractive to you
nonetheless there it is key Tron key
Chron edge Lord special unbox therapy
Jack do you like it yes or no
not for Jack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
