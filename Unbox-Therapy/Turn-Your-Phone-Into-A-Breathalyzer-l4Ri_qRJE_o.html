another video and today I've got
something you probably never expected to
see here that is a portable breathalyzer
excuse me Lou what exactly are you
talking about this little guy in front
of me you blow into it if you've been
drinking and it will give you an
accurate read out of how intoxicated you
are now this one is not just portable
but it also uses your Android device so
that's kind of where the tech component
comes in it plugs into the micro USB
port and allows for you to get that
reading why would you want something
like this if you don't know drinking and
driving terrible thing to do you don't
want to be doing it so with the little
guy like this in your pocket you can
turn it into a bit of a game you'd be
like uh-uh what's your blood alcohol
content oh oh you shouldn't be driving
okay cool have a nap on a couch it's
tech with a purpose step 1 download the
Android app it's free
step 2 plug this baby in step 3 follow
the instructions your Android device
must support USB hosting Android 4.0 and
up no battery required to keep charged
no mouthpieces free app and a miniature
size and quick results listen now you
got no excuse alright don't be I'm good
I'll be driving myself home right now
you know many times I just stop Jack
over here guys a wall animal let's open
this baby up now you're probably
wondering how are you accurately gonna
test this little breathalyzer here well
I have a some emergency beers on hand
here's a Wow
loaf the little carrying case goes on
your keychain as well that's smart man I
like it when tech solves a problem
especially when it could save some lives
no seriously I'm taking a serious note
right now and here it is look at that
little guy Wow
little cap for a tiny this just slides
right in there just like this blowing
that end usb on that end install the
Android drink mate app okay ah this is
important this tells you when you're
impaired 0.162 0.20 nausea likely
dysphoria predominates you're in trouble
man
nausea
not good okay let's grab the app I got
the Batman phone here of course look at
me
styling profiling drink mate is what I'm
looking for I'm gonna get some beer
that's going to be important oh man the
anticipation is real here wait 15
minutes since your last drink before
taking the reading
don't put your mouth on it I got it
right okay cool I can do that below
softly like you are whistling plug in
the drink me this is just I want to get
a baseline with no alcohol in my system
here whoa
feel like a police officer right now Wow
got it quickly calculating zero point
zero zero yes zero point zero zero and
it keeps a record of it there's even an
area to take a picture of what you look
like
Oh
should I just have to
alright I'm reading through the little
booklet here and I'm noticing that it's
probably a better idea so I I make sure
to at least get some kind of reading to
have two beers rather than one two beers
deep and ruffle
and roughly a 10-minute wait no 12 now
we'll see how much it affects me am i
capable of operating a motor vehicle
calculating Oh point zero five
I am currently experiencing relaxation
loss of judgment I can hardly keep it
together
exaggerated behavior but out of that
slowing of I focus decreased alertness
increased euphoric feeling I feel
fantastic
um and impaired reasoning hi our guy
like Jack terrible idea technically
speaking I'm still capable of operating
a motor vehicle that thing is quick its
effective its tiny I'll probably put it
in my glove box somewhere around there
get one of these things for your friends
I'm not even exaggerating when I say
could save a life something like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
