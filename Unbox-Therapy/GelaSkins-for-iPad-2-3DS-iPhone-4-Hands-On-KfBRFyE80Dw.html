therapy calm I just received this order
from the guys at jealous kins
and what they are are basically vinyl
skins for all your different electronic
devices with some kickass artwork on
there and they got a ton of selection on
their website but I picked up a few of
my favorites and let's get it started
with the 3ds jealousy and I got that you
can see it's got a blade runner-esque
kind of artwork on there now something
to mention is that these actually do
offer a little bit of protection for
your device better than having nothing
on there here's how it looks installed
on the 3ds but of course they don't add
any bulk right cuz they're just a vinyl
skin so here's one called War of the
monsters this is for the iPhone 4
there's a look at that piece of artwork
and here's how it looks installed on the
iPhone 4 the next one I got was for my
Nexus S and it's the same as the 3ds
artwork I showed you before I went ahead
and installed it to give you guys a
better look at just how it fits it's
actually pretty easy to install and
they're removable they don't leave any
residue so each piece of artwork comes
along with a companion piece of
background wallpaper for your subsequent
device here you can see the version I
got with my Nexus S the last jealous
scan I got was for my iPad 2 and it's
that same battle scene that I showed
from the iPhone 4 anyway guys another
part of this is that I'm gonna be giving
away two of these I'm gonna be giving
away the iPhone 4 jealous skin as well
as the Nintendo 3ds jela skin so stay
tuned for that giveaway video coming up
real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
