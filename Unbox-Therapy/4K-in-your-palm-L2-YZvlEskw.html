brand new video and today we're taking a
look at something that is exciting and I
know I say that every single time but
this one is really exciting to me I've
been waiting for it for a little while
and by that I mean not like waiting in
the mail not like there's been a package
in the mail for far too long but I just
never got around to picking one up this
is a GoPro and it's the hero4 black
edition it is 4k in the palm of your
hand like the title of this video
implies it's a tiny little camera that
can shoot 4k at 30fps or it can shoot
higher frame rates for slow-motion at
1080p it really has a huge number of
different recording formats and like all
other GoPro products you have a huge
number of accessories and mounts so that
you can use it in a number of different
environments including harsh ones this
thing is tough its rugged and the reason
I picked one up it's a bit of a
long-winded introduction is because I'm
going to be shooting some hockey stuff
many of you don't know I'm actually a
hockey player myself I still play twice
a week even though I'm an old man so I'm
going to take a couple of these on the
ice along with some other equipment to
see if I can get some cool shots so
anyways here we have it the hero4 black
edition you have the camera that
standard housing a rechargeable battery
a couple of mounts skeleton backdoor USB
cable quick-release buckles and a pivot
arm also it requires class 10 memory or
uhs-1 and that's micro sd so there's not
a huge selection on the market but I'm
gonna try to link some popular choices
that are approved by GoPro down in the
description because as you know with 4k
video it's going to require a fairly
fast card what am I talking about this
isn't hard to get into I feel like an
old bird
was a lot more difficult to open up and
this one is either that or I'm just a
pro now this is the top-of-the-line
version so there is a silver version as
well which doesn't shoot 4k but it
actually has a feature that this Black
Edition doesn't have and that is an LCD
a touchscreen LCD on the back of it
that's not a huge deal for me these
things are so wide when they shoot video
that you don't really need to see what
you're shooting point-and-shoot
literally just aim this thing and it's
probably in the frame plus if you
absolutely need an LCD you can always
add the optional accessory to the black
edition and of course I wanted the 4k
recording so you can see it's in a basic
housing here which I'll open up real
quick I know a thing or two about GoPros
I just haven't got this version yet look
how tiny these are that gets me every
single time just how tiny the GoPro is
but that's a huge selling feature of the
GoPro it's the reason these cameras are
so popular or one of the reasons you can
stick them anywhere anywhere also inside
the package we have the remaining
accessories and these are what really
puts the GoPro into action there is the
skeleton backdoor a couple of 3m mounts
some different mounting arms over here
the little battery which of course you
can get an extra one and keep that on
hand so you don't run out in the old
days replacing the batteries and GoPros
was a little bit harder to do and then
you have a mini USB cable obviously
that's going to be used to charge up the
device now this mount on the top looks
to be sort of part of the plate so
you're not getting that off you have no
extra mount with you see the thing is
here you can get like Motorsports
accessories you can get diving
accessories helmet mounts and so most
people get these will sort of expand on
their GoPro package as time goes on but
this is your very basic housing here so
taking a closer look at the tiny little
GoPro Hero 4 black
addition you'll notice it has fairly
simple input you just have this power
slash mode button a little LCD above
there with some indicator lights you've
also got a button on the top of the
device that's going to be your record
button along with another light
indicator on this side of the device you
have a Settings button and then on the
back you have this expansion port as I
mentioned before that port can be used
for expanding to either an LCD BacPac if
you want to see what you're recording or
interface with the device that way or it
can be used for a battery backup for
example if you want to get extended
battery life on the bottom you have a
little door where your battery is going
to live your internal battery and then
the remainder of your i/o happens over
here on the side here you have an HDMI
output as well as a USB output and then
a micro SD card slot as I mentioned
before you're going to need a fairly
high speed micro SD to take advantage of
those high bitrate recording modes that
the black edition hero4 supports so that
wraps up this unboxing and overview the
gopro hero4 black edition if you guys
are interested in pricing and
availability and you want to shoot 4k in
the palm of your hand I will drop a link
to this down in the description and
since it is a camera it only makes sense
to show you guys some sample footage so
I will layer some in at the very end of
this video but before we get there I
want to give a shout out to the AT&amp;amp;T
YouTube channel because I did a couple
of videos for them that's right yours
truly featured on the official AT&amp;amp;T
YouTube channel you see how far we've
come me you all of us together so I did
a couple of unboxings for them and they
wanted to get the unbox therapy
treatment so I unboxed the note for AT&amp;amp;T
version as well as the LG G watch R
which I don't believe that video is up
yet but anyways I'll link whatever's
available down in the description so go
show some support and some love that
wraps this one up thanks as always for
watching
and now let's roll into

edition check this out
