Lew here back with another video and as
you probably know this bendgate Fiasco
is spreading like wildfire all over the
internet and regular traditional media
as well I've been doing interviews for
various news organizations and the same
questions keep coming up so I am here
with the final installment to put all of
those questions to rest the first and
probably most obvious one is what about
the iPhone 6 so I have the standard
iPhone 6 here because the original bend
test tackled the 6 plus and apparently
some users are having bending issues
with the 6 as well that's something that
I have heard today and then the next
most requested device this one right
here the HTC One m8 which also has an
aluminum construction like the iPhone
and a lot of people think it will have a
similar result in the bend test
I don't know feels pretty sturdy to me
so the HTC One m8 similar construction
I've also got the new Moto X right here
this just came out on the market
relatively new lastly we have a Nokia
Lumia device for a long time
Nokia has been known as a very durable
brand of phone it's like an ongoing joke
on the internet especially their old
candy bar style phones but anyway this
one feels relatively durable so let's
bend it as well let's get started
with the iPhone 6 because that's
probably the one that's been requested
the most so I'll move these phones out
of the way so here we have the standard
iPhone 6 and I am going to bend it in
the exact same fashion as I did with the
6 plus so hold it in this location here
and I'm going to push on the center and
pull back as hard as I can
and we shall see what the results are a
Rigo
okay so I can put I've put a small dent
in there no so this one is far more
durable I can put a small dent in I
heard a little bit of sort of the glue
from the screen peeling away I can
easily push that back in and the device
is fine nothing wrong with the screen
that's completely usable right there
yeah
this is a brand new phone there's not
even a SIM card in here but you just
have a smaller form factor here so the
material isn't spanning such a large
footprint I think the result of that is
its integrity is significantly more can
you still bend this probably but under
it does have a small bend in it from
where I pushed but under normal usage
and I can probably bend it back yeah
there we go oh you can hear it click a
little bit there where I bent it here
that any make regardless I don't see
this bang gate issue affecting six
regular iPhone 6 users in the same way
that it has affected six plus users just
based on that preliminary test right
there same amount of force next up the
second most requested phone after the
initial test went live people said what
about the HTC One m8 and I was curious
too but I didn't have one so I actually
had to go out and get one and big fan of
this phone big fan of the design very
similar in fact in design to the iPhone
6 as you can see they're aluminum finish
on the back you've got the antenna bands
so let's go ahead and attempt to bend
the HTC One m8 same fashion
I'll have the screen facing out and I'll
push from the back of the device here we
go three two one
hmm I heard some glue come loose so the
screen popped out a little bit but no it
did the screen popped out a little bit
and I heard a nasty noise does this
phone have battery let's try to boot it
up now that's fine it's completely fine
screen is fine the phone is fine so you
will hear like a little bit of glue
there comes loose near the screen you
can hear that but it's nothing it's just
the glass lifting a little bit and then
it goes right back into place okay
same amount of force not an issue on the
HTC One m8 next up we have the new Moto
X materials here feel very robust but of
course the ultimate test the bend test
let's go three two one
woohoo that baby is solid I can't get
anything out of that Wow no noises no
movement that is a robust device right
there whatever they have done with this
metallic frame here okay Moto X the new
Moto X is legit as of right now that's
the device to beat for current devices
and the bend test lastly of course we
had to throw something from Nokia in
there just because of the legendary
feedback on nokia durability this one's
interesting because I got a big camera
there I guess I'll push towards the
center that's probably better okay here
we go three two one woo heard a crack
right away
no nothing so the the top of the screen
moves off the base a little bit and then
it clicks back in nothing that's robust
to biggest surprise for me the Moto X
the new Moto X that baby is solid and
listen i phone six users regular iPhone
6 users don't panic this thing is not
going to bend easily not nearly as
easily as the 6 plus so there you have
it all the questions have now been
answered and you can share this video if
anybody is continuing to ask questions a
lot of people were saying if you if you
bend it of course it bends you know
there was a lot of that feedback coming
in well these devices here are proof
that that's not necessarily the case I
put the same amount of force and had
very little result with any of them in
fact even the regular iPhone 6 compared
to the 6 plus so here you have it
actually look at this I have a 5s here
as well shall we okay real quick no
nothing you can tell right away if
you're getting movement if you're
getting flex when you apply that force
so regardless
nothing nothing here has surprised me
this is what I expected to happen maybe
with the exception of the Moto X making
no creaking or flex at all but I
expected the 6 to do much better than
the 6 plus just because of the fact that
you're you've got a much smaller panel
of aluminum on the back with the chassis
and so therefore it's going to be
slightly more robust it doesn't have to
cover quite as big of a footprint there
you have it iPhone 6 less likely to bend
when compared to the 6 plus and the
other thing I'd like to mention HTC One
m8 made some creaky noises no lasting
impact no significant bends and the Moto
X big surprise here I mean one more time
just for good measure
ah oh that baby not gonna do it with
human hands Wow
very surprising okay that wraps this up
thanks as always for watching if you
guys enjoyed this content if you
appreciate these tests which are painful
to do sometimes I'm gonna have to go ice
my thumbs right now I didn't mean
physically painful but to seek bones
break that's not my intention
honestly I saw the reports coming in
that morning I was like man I gotta see
if this is even true I didn't even
believe it at first so that's why I did
the original six plus video so
appreciate the thumbs up down below
appreciate the shares and new
subscribers etc as I said thanks as
always for watching and I will catch you
on the next episode later guys
