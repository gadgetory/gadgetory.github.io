one
what's up guys Lew here back with
another video and today I've got an
unboxing for you of a very fast portable
Drive in fact it's been called the
fastest portable drive on the planet and
of course uses Thunderbolt 2 is one
terabyte but it's not your average hard
drive in fact it is 2 SSDs in raid 0
inside of this tiny little package it's
about getting blistering fast speeds of
up to 1375 megabytes per second if you
want to be editing 4k video like we
shoot here then you're going to need a
lot of speed on your scratch disk and
that's what this will be it will be a
portable scratch disk essentially this
speed is going to allow you to do things
that slower drives wouldn't so let's
take a look at the side here at some of
the specifications to pci-e gen 2 SSDs 2
thunderbolt ports 20 gigabit per second
is of course the Headroom available on
thunderbolt 2 now its pre-configured in
a striped raid 0 but the other thing you
can do with a software raid is you can
daisy-chain a couple of these together
if you want to but that's not really the
intended use here this is the fastest
portable storage on the back of the box
you can see the performance readout for
thunderbolt 2 vs. other interface
options standard Thunderbolt USB 3 and
you see here that this drive pairs well
with the newer MacBook Pros which
supports under Bowl 2 or of course the
Mac Pro which if you've seen my recent
video then you know it's out of
commission mine is out of commission
right now but I'm getting it back soon
and in this case they've daisy chained 5
of them together that's going to be a
lot of speed for editing 4k alright
let's go ahead and open this baby up I'm
pretty excited about this it's amazingly
small that's crazy
to think that you can get that much
speed out of a box like this where you
would normally have to have a gigantic
raid set up with traditional hard disks
you're going to need to put together
like 8 hard disks to get something
capable of this speed now one thing to
mention at this point
this is not cheap as you'd imagine if
you want to have something called the
fastest portable drive on the planet
it's probably going to cost you and this
one probably the most expensive portable
drive appointment as well if you want to
check out pricing and availability I'll
put a link in the description but be
warned it's pricey accessories we have a
power brick I know I was hoping that it
could be bus powered as well but sucks a
lot of juice so he needs a straw in
order to do that and this is that straw
here you go extension cable for that
power brick and every different
connection you can imagine here we have
the UK not as the UK this one's a little
funkier what are we looking at here all
right first one to tell me in the
comments what this is for wins a prize
thousand Internet points also a
Thunderbolt cable that is a win right
there I like when they give you
everything you need to get set up lastly
we have this stand I think it's useful
I'll put it on installation it's fairly
straightforward you just slide this baby
in real quick come on Lou you've got
this backwards try this one nope Lou
Jack you see apparently I should be
reading the user manual here it feels
like it wants to go in there maybe I'm
see I didn't read the manual I promise
you just figure that out all my own guys
alright so the back is where all of the
i/o is two thunderbolt ports as I
mentioned that's for daisy-chaining
as you can see here boom stick another
Drive or a monitor on the other end of
this any Thunderbolt peripheral and
power right here bingo now in the front
you have the lesea blue eye ball this
will glow and flash when you're using it
it looks kind of like this exterior is
gonna pull some of the heat away from
those SSDs which might get a little bit
hot the other benefit of using SSDs on a
portable device like this fewer moving
parts so hopefully it'll be a little bit
more durable especially at this very
expensive price point so
anyways there you have it the reason I'm
unboxing this right now is actually
because I'm about to go on a trip and I
need to take a bunch of footage with me
so that I can do some editing on the
road and this is the perfect thing to do
so so this box has been sitting here
it's like oh I need to unbox this right
now I leave tomorrow morning I need to
use this thing so this is one of those
rare occasions where I am literally
going to go and immediately put this
thing to work that I have just unboxed
on the world's fastest portable drive
SSD raid PCIe raid in a box that size
that's pretty damn impressive alright
guys thanks very much for watching if
you enjoyed this content make sure to
leave a thumbs up down below and other
than that I will catch you on the next
episode hopefully very shortly later
guys
don't over-tighten never over-tighten
guys that's like that's a rule to live
