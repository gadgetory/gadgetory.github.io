probably heard about this you might even
recall a video from 2014 in which
Samsung first teased the idea of a
folding smartphone all the way back then
and it's something people have been
talking about ever since and the reason
people are interested in the idea of
folding smartphones in the first place
is because of the technological
advancement that has taken place in
displays allowing them to be flexible
OLED panels that can spin and turn and
fold and so on without being busted like
a traditional rigid material now if you
watch the original video in which
Samsung showcased the idea it was shown
in a format form factor sort of like a
passport or a wallet it folded in half
with an image on the outside a screen on
the outside that you could interact with
and then you could fold it open for a
larger image sort of more tablet like
it's kind of like having a phone and a
tablet at the same time now we have a
new development in which the CEO of
Samsung has said they're doing it for
real and it's happening this year
happening in the sense that they're
gonna announce it I guess
because he said they're targeting the
Samsung Developers Conference in
November that means come November we may
be able to set our eyes on the world's
first folding smartphone now granted
there was a folding smartphone
previously but it was a bit different
than what we're talking about here so I
made a video a little while ago on the
ZTE axon M that's sort of more like two
phones sandwiched together with a hinge
here it is kind of a cool thing
messenger on the top display watch a
video on the bottom display or vice
versa and in the case of this device it
was incredibly low volume it wasn't
super popular so many people have
transitioned to their smartphone as
their main computing device and are
lying there in bed you know cranked up
got looking at it like this typing and
so on and so having the extra real
estate there for like extended usage
scenarios it could it could be
a valuable thing or a thing that people
are interested in the biggest player in
the smartphone space right now Samsung
says they're gonna take it serious not
like this but instead a single panel
that's capable of folding into itself or
away from itself one screen no hinge no
break not to be clear in the statement
of Samsung CEO he said that the device
has to be capable of being used in its
folded State as well as its unfolded
state so some of the prototypes i've
seen floating around in which it shows a
clamshell almost flip style device which
then folds out to a larger display with
no display on the outside I don't think
that's how they're gonna go about it at
least based on the language that he's
currently using here now at this point
you're probably wondering like what is
the big deal here why is there so much
focus or hype around the idea of a
folding display of course I gave you the
reasoning previously that it could be
about multitasking or it could be about
having one single device instead of many
devices for your computing needs but I
don't honestly think that's what's going
on here I think that there's a technical
a technological capability here from
Samsung to be able to do this so they're
sort of more in the camp of why not if
we can do this right now and compel
people to move on from the current
smartphone form factor we can sell a lot
more devices if we can put something in
someone's hand that looks tangibly
different from all of the slabs that are
out there in in people's pockets it's
become harder and harder to compel
people to purchase smartphones around
that premium price tag that price tag
that Samsung has lived in for so long
with their Galaxy products now speaking
of price the rumor for this potentially
folding smartphone is somewhere between
1,500 and 2,000 bucks so they want the
premium sticker they're gonna have to
deliver something significantly
different from what's happening at the
lower end of the market now the reason
for this speculation on my part has to
do with sales figures and the fact that
many competitors at the lower end of the
market have been climbing up the ranks
and getting closer to Samsung in terms
of market share companies like Huawei
and others Oppo and so on the CEO of
Samsung also say
that they are going to have a greater
focus in the upcoming year on more
mid-range competitive devices devices
with a lower sticker price that can
deliver value to compete with all these
upstarts including the phone that's in
my pocket right now from Xiaomi in the
form of the Polka phone f1 now another
area of interest for me with this
particular story is the idea that
Samsung is the perfect company to do
this and the reason is and I'm sure many
of you are aware they're sort of the top
dogs in the OLED display space when it
comes to smartphones many other
manufacturers that they compete with
rely on them for the screens that will
then go into their smartphones Apple and
others if we all go out and adopt this
bendable display smartphone now not only
as an end-product company selling
smartphones directly to customers also
as a vendor to other companies they
become more important because these
panels are very difficult to make and
it's the reason they don't have a ton of
competition in the smartphone OLED space
and so many manufacturers have to show
up purchasing in volume these screens
from them already this type of
technology if they can bring it to scale
and deliver it in an end product means
that they don't only corner the market
from a customer perspective but they
also have the potential to corner the
market from a vendor perspective which
can have a huge impact on their bottom
line just imagine this the bendable
wallet like potentially trifold
smartphone becomes ubiquitous everybody
wants one they want Apple to make one
they want Huawei to make one and so on
where do those companies end up who has
the text that they need it ends up back
in Samsung's pocket so maybe this is a
bit of a bet with a farther or a longer
or a bigger forecast a bigger puzzle in
mind where they're like if we can do
this we must do this even if the
immediate use case scenario is not there
even if the volume at the start might
not be enough to justify the investment
in R&amp;amp;D so they can kind of stake their
claim as the leader in that particular
technology OLED panel technology
are already there right now it would
make sense to go ahead and extend that
lead as a customer as a guy who uses
smartphones all these prototypes that
I've seen of this bending phone it does
seem a little
it doesn't seem fully fleshed out right
now you feel like you may end up with a
bigger form factor you may end up with
something fatter with a huge display
like that I mean generally in terms of a
tablet you need a huge battery to power
it up for any reasonable amount of time
I can see all kinds of potential
pitfalls with this type of design my
intuition at this time is pointing in
the direction of some strong compromises
in exchange to just have this think both
so from an end-user perspective I'm
having a hard time believing that people
are necessarily clamoring for this but
from a vendor perspective if I'm Samsung
I'm like I got to put this thing out we
got to get to the moon first we got to
build some stuff that isn't being built
and we have to be the first ones to
announce it and that's what they're
aiming for in November keep an eye out
the question now goes to you will you be
compelled to purchase a bending
smartphone like the one we're
speculating is coming from Samsung will
you pay somewhere in the neighborhood of
fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars
for something like that or do you think
the fire in this industry is at the
lower end of the marketplace with the
devices delivering value under $500
where should Samsung be putting their
focus and are you a future owner of a
bending smartphone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
