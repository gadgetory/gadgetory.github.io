got a chance to sit down and announce
the winner to this right here new Zelda
Skyward Sword package with the game and
the golden Wii mote the contest has been
going on for a little while almost a
month actually via the website and also
via Twitter and the reason that I've
been delayed on announcing the winner is
just because I've been trying to get
everything ready for CES that's a
consumer electronics show which is
coming up in Las Vegas I'm going to be
there reporting live blogging showing
you guys all the cool stuff and products
that are getting announced and even
stuff that I can get my hands on I'm
going to be leaving on Saturday so I'm
getting everything ready in preparation
and it kind of been holding up my
content a little bit but it's definitely
going to be exciting and I think you
guys are going to enjoy coming along for
the trip as best as I can do for you but
anyways without further ado let's
announce the winner I wanted to get this
out of the way before I leave so the
winner of the zelda package is actually
an unbox therapy com user for people who
left a comment underneath the giveaway
post there they've got a bonus entry and
a bonus entry actually ended up winning
this contest completely random via
random.org so the winner without further
ado is let me give it a quick second
here just to get it right alan parker
and so anyways alan parker i'll be
sending you an email if you're watching
this video leave a comment down below
but i'll be in touch with you your email
address that you used to register on
unbox therapy com that's going to be the
easiest way and hopefully they can get
your shipping details before i leave for
vegas so i can get this thing out to you
this week so definitely get at me real
soon everybody congratulate Alan it's a
completely fair contest you know just
completely random and I got plenty more
plan thumbs up for the epic giveaway
coming up it's way way bigger than this
one so it's definitely stay tuned for
that and before i leave i do want to
mention one more thing you probably
noticed this cool graphic up behind me
and slightly different graphic then you
might be used to this was actually put
together by a fan and unbox therapy fan
his name is Jake and he's obviously
really talented this is the unbox bot
you can see it's a robot made out of
boxes but some really cool illustrations
that he's put together and sent to me
and I him and I are actually discussing
the concept right now putting together
some
parel some limited edition unbox therapy
t-shirts and limited edition beast feed
t-shirts potentially so if you guys are
interested in getting some limited
edition swag you know you know I'm going
to get get it to you guys as cheap as
possible you'll probably only pay the
shipping or whatever I can do to get
this limited edition gear out to you

be interested in that and also
definitely make sure to thumbs up and
favorite if that's something you want to
see happen I'd love to make some
