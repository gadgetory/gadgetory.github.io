Lew here back with another video and
today I've got something special this is
not a very common device it's the HTC
One m9 plus hope this is lined up I
messed it up a little bit now some of
you might not have even heard about this
thing because the m9 just came out and
the m9 plus is it set to be released
here in North America at least not as of
right now looks good though
it's essentially a slightly larger
slightly different m9 with some
additional features this one is from
Hong Kong now they share a lot of
similarities but we're gonna talk mostly
about the differences so I have the m9
plus and over here I have the regular m9
so let's check out the differences so
jumping inside the box of the m9 plus
you'll see the device first and
something you'll probably notice right
away is that you have a button a
dedicated button here it can be used as
a home button also as a fingerprint
scanner forward facing camera is
identical on the back you have a
slightly different camera setup so you
are dealing with a dual camera 20
megapixels similar to the m8 you have
the dual tone flash in that location a
noise cancelling microphone right here
you have your power switch hold switch
volume up and down does have a micro SD
card slot which I've been told can be
expanded to up to 2 terabytes no idea
what that media would cost you know
removable battery here and the battery
is the same size as it is on the m9 this
screen is the biggest difference this
device is a little bit taller the screen
is larger here 5.2 inches and maybe even
more importantly it's higher resolution
this is a 2560 by 1440 panel also inside
the box before we get too carried away
we have some Chinese paperwork told you
this thing came from Hong Kong it has
the sim card tool there you have some
headphones similar to what you would get
with any HTC flagship device multiple
tips so you can get the right fit
got to get the right fit power brick and
then of course USB cable now one other
different
is the processor the regular m9 has a
Snapdragon chip whereas the m9 plus is
using an octa-core processor from a
company called mediatek there you have
it the m9 and the m9 plus and as you can
tell the form factor is different you
might as well take a closer look at
these two displays so this button on the
+ is not tactile it works for
fingerprint sensing similar to the home
button on the galaxy s6 or the iPhone
don't want to update you right now get
out you don't want to update you ok so
this is what the two devices look like
on max brightness you look pretty
similar like I said the main difference
that I'm noticing is the color
temperature which appears to be quite
different
on each of them this one looking a lot
cooler obviously you're dealing with
much better pixel density or much
tighter pixel density on this 1440p
screen it makes you wonder which is the
actual HTC flagship in this situation
there are a lot of things featured on
the + that point in the direction of
flagship especially features that are
just non-existent on the regular m9 like
the fingerprint scanner
which will probably show up in the next
version now build quality on these HTC
phones is very nice you've got a mostly
metallic enclosure I wish they had a
slightly larger battery especially when
you're sealed in you can't replace a
battery like you can on say the LG g4
for example then also you can notice
here that the camera layout is a
different shape so not only do you have
dual cameras here on the m9 plus well
you have a circular camera for the main
unit compared to a square one the bottom
of the two devices is identical you have
your headphone jack as well as your
microUSB port for charging it up and the
same can be said for the top of the
devices where you have your IR blaster
for controlling various devices if you
choose to use your HTC as a remote are
you an HTC m9 owner or a hardcore HTC
fanboy HTC lover that is now pissed off
that this m9 plus exists in a cunt
three that isn't yours I might be at the
end of the day they're very comparable
devices though something to mention real
quick about these phones audio is
incredible you have these awesome
forward-facing speakers and still to
this day we do not have forward-facing
speakers on most devices so for
multimedia these are great choices
anyway I've said enough about these two
devices thank you very much for watching
and also big shout out to D brand for
importing this m9 plus and getting it
into my hands if you guys want to check
out some of their skins I will drop a
link down in the description they make
some very cool stuff in fact I just got
a brand new skin on the iPhone 6 look at
this it's like some cool wooden design
I'm always changing it up and customize
your device and get a little bit of
protection at the same time so check
them out link down below alright that
really wraps it up thumbs up if you
liked this video I'll catch on the next
one later Jack why can't you be more
like imaginary Jack he's so cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
