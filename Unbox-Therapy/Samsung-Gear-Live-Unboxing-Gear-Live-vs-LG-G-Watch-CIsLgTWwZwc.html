another exciting video this is the
Samsung gear live in front of me now
earlier you saw me unbox the LG G watch
this of course is the competitor a
similar device it is running the
brand-new Android wear as well a little
bit different in terms of design so
actually before we jump inside the box
and you want to show you the bottom it's
got a 1.6 3 inch Super AMOLED display
Bluetooth 400 which is kind of
interesting because the LG G watch is
rocking Bluetooth 4.1 dust and water
resistant IP 67 just like G watch 1.2
gigahertz processor heartrate compass
gyro and accelerometer and of course a
microphone for your voice inputs now
something that's also quite interesting
down on the bottom here is it says that
it requires a Galaxy smartphone running
Android 4.3 in order to operate we're
about to find out because as soon as
I've done unboxing this I'm gonna try
and connect it to my Nexus 5 it has a
similar look and feel to the Galaxy gear
so you have this metallic bezel on the
outside actually feels kind of premium
in my hands and here's an interesting
thing that isn't on the G watch that is
of course the heart rate monitor that
lives on the underside that will give
you real-time data on your heart rate
obviously there's also the exposure
there for charging a single button as
well as a microphone so now you've got
the opening screen here and something
has changed since my G watch unboxing
that is of course the fact that we now
have the Android wear app in the App
Store and I have it set up I was using
it earlier today and so now we're going
to attempt to pair this to the Nexus 5
to make sure that this doesn't just work
with Galaxy phones but first let's go
ahead and check out the other components
inside the box so it's a microUSB
charger and here is the charging
contraption wow this is a tiny little
dock the upside here is the fact that
you can keep it attached so if you're
traveling it can be one complete package
downside you got to make sure you've got
that clip in so it's not just like
dropping it on your nightstand which is
what I was hoping for really wish they
went with a magnetic clasp or something
along those lines
instead of this so now I'm going to go
ahead and pair these two devices here
using the Android wear application click
up in the corner here and pair with a
new wearable so now we've hit the
downloading stage and this is probably
the longest part of the setup so both
devices have a number of different watch
faces that you can choose from we have
obviously determined that the gear live
will function with a non galaxy device
so lastly let's just do a physical
comparison of both watches a little bit
different in terms of design you have a
completely black surface here on the G
watch and on the gear live you have this
metallic ring on the outside but to be
honest with you there's probably fewer
differences than there are similarities
with these two devices after all the OS
is identical at the moment a few
different watch faces and of course a
slightly larger battery on the G watch
and a slightly different display
technology one of them is old ad the
other is IPS a one thing I will say is I
definitely prefer the charging cradle
for the G watch and that's a big deal to
me especially if it's late at night
you're taking your watch off you have
this beside your bed I don't know I just
like a seamless sort of solution so
magnets work better in my opinion
alright guys that wraps up this unboxing
and quick comparison video if you
