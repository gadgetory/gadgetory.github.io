therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Z 6 to 3 speaker system from
Logitech now I picked these up for a
hundred and nineteen bucks
a steal of a deal you're getting lots of
power for your money these are 200 watts
with the THX certification so you know
they are going to bang out your music
your games or whatever else you want to
throw at them now the reason I say your
music and your games is because these
have three inputs you can have them
hooked up to a game system a computer
and one other audio source all at once
most computer speakers only connect to
one audio source so that's special the
right speaker is going to control your
bass volume it's also got your power
switch on it an input and output for
audio as well I'll show you that in a
minute whereas the left speaker on the
other hand is just going to be a speaker
but that's cool it's necessary for that
stereo effect of course it's got a
regular RCA style connector whereas the
right unit has a more elaborate
connector that's because of that power
switch and those volume knobs of course
and the last thing in a box besides the
subwoofer is a mini jack cable as going
to be used to connect your audio source
to this system this system also has RCA
inputs if you prefer to connect that way
the last thing we got are the manuals
here you guys know how I feel about
manuals get rid of them we don't need
them now here on unbox therapy now we
know what we're doing sometimes so the
last thing is the subwoofer and this is
obviously the biggest item it was tough
to get out of the box not because it's
so heavy or anything but just because it
was like suctioned in there now it's
special about this is it's an
omnidirectional subwoofer meaning if you
got to hide it in a corner it's still
going to sound great so the right
speaker connects right in this section
here it's the only place it can go
pretty damn obvious whereas the left
speaker goes below now you'll notice the
auxiliary input at the top it's the same
style cable as the left speaker but you
don't want to use those those are inputs
the bottom one is an output of course so
you've got the two inputs up there and
you've got another input on the right
speaker here as well as a headphone
output so that you can bypass the system
if you want to use headphones cool stuff
so lastly you guys are probably saying
do how powerful is this is it worth 120
bucks I don't think you can get more
power or better power for 120 bucks like
I really I really believe in these
things I'm telling you guys there's not
many things that I like as much as I
like these that's true
I had the old version so what you're
looking at now is some base I got some
base playing back on the subwoofer and
as you can see it has no problem pushing
around this paperwork here that has no
other use it's being pushed around how
about how about the zoom h1 box oh my
goodness look at that it's throwing it
around like a rag doll you see that's
power that's the air and the suction
coming in and out of the subwoofer what
else can we throw on there Oh how about
Matt Damon let's see if Matt Damon and
Edward Norton can get their groove on oh
yes they want to dance too I guess
they're liking their feeling is dubstep
music how about Will Ferrell is he into
it he's into it too look at this guy's
got moves so you know as you guys can
tell this is this is some good power for
us for you know a speaker system that
comes in at this price point it's no
joke and the last thing I want to throw
on here is my canon 60 millimeter macro
lens no I'm just kidding I'm just
kidding a lens ain't in it this is just
a box but it does have the foam in the
manuals inside there's some weight there
you know so so like I said before if you
got you know around 100 bucks to spend
on a speaker system I do not believe you
can beat this one save your money stay
away from those huge huge name brands
because this logitech setup is for real
you know they don't have that THX
certification for nothing just don't be
like this guy when you buy them the
logitech got this guy sitting on a couch
with drumsticks and no drums that ain't
cool you know you ain't you ain't in the
band dude so don't be like him anyway
