folding screens it's cool it's sci-fi
it's the future now up until this point
I've only showcased the idea of a
folding screen in a smartphone in the
form of the Galaxy fold which well who
knows where that thing is right now it's
it's who can find it I don't know
where's the Galaxy cool it ain't here it
doesn't mean it's not the future it
doesn't mean it's gonna it's not gonna
be an eventual reality because this tech
the hardware appears to be here to stay
and in trickling in to other devices
including this one in front of me now
this thing is a prototype but I am very
excited to have it here to be one of the
first people to look at this in studio
this is the Lenovo folding PC now you
may have seen clips floating around the
internet it's a totally different form
factor forget about a smartphone this is
a way bigger folding display aimed at
kind of replacing maybe your tablet
maybe your laptop that remains to be
seen it's a clear indication into what a
futuristic laptop replacement tablet
replacement type of computing platform
can be I'm gonna bring in Willy do
because he's been briefed he's like he's
the expert look at this he made notes
and everything we got to be prepared on
this one because the eventual
commercially available product may
change a little bit but in this showcase
the proof-of-concept really nicely whoa
okay at first it just it kind of looks
like the x1 tablet you have the screen
comes off from the key it kind of seems
like that's what it might be but of
course I'm guessing like that's not the
magic part well the magic part is what
like this whoa now it's kind of like a
notebook like a leather it's kind of
like a leather nope like something you
would write with a pen in it's got a
similar vibe like look at the size of
its tiny yeah now keep in mind I mean
like we're looking at this you see the
hinges here you're not really sure how
it operates prototype we just need to be
clear prototype very focus now obviously
this is an OLED as well because it been
so Samsung has like a snap hinge this
one is parently torque torque hinge yeah
it sounds very powerful yeah apparently
you can fold it many many times they did
a lot of testing on obviously you could
prop it up like this and there's some
sort of a stand right am I right about
this yep
okay so you could prop it up like this
and then have what like a little
keyboard module in front of it
so 13.3 inch display kind of a
surprising aspect ratio a little taller
the more interesting version of that
would be like this right like you would
have it like that with like a keyboard
down here yeah and you could show it off
so tap on that and it should reorient
its hey and then you could check out a
video here whoa you can start searching
it's so magical so sure look at that
okay well so why don't you break down
the specs for us here you know you got a
list there so for the display it's using
a LG display here
it's a obviously old LED 2k display with
the 4 by 3 ratio each screen is 9.6
inches each of these 2 yes so if if it
was two separate displays it would be
nine point six on each side yeah look at
this what I it's like I got a cookbook
or something here we'll and it's also
uses a Wacom pen that could be attached
right here so apparently it's also got
an all-day battery in it I mean we don't
how can we really break down what that
means at this point very early stages
it's also gonna be available in 2020
so it's still a ways out let's keep that
in mind early days for a package this
scale imagine you're at the coffee shop
well oh this is super poor guy like you
yeah lot tape okay let me try typing on
this I'm real curious I'm a big keyboard
guy it's the reason I'm even using the
x1 carbon now can you hold it like this
and start typing I wonder if like the
keys can split and then you could start
to type I guess I can take like this I
could reach to the middle go
let's see unbox therapy yeah I mean like
yeah
day so weird when you're scrolling on
the bank on the bent display look at
this jack that's magic right there okay
that's technology that's why we do this
it's why we're in this business it's
crazy man it's science fiction what are
we doing what are we doing in technology
well it's like when I used to watch you
know in the old days Blade Runner type
stuff this is what they couldn't put in
the movie because they didn't have it at
the time but this is sort of what you
imagined I'm having an experience right
now yeah cuz it's us it doesn't in your
brain it doesn't really fully you don't
fully receive it for the and just
knowing that the keyboard is digitized
it could be removed at any time it's
like oh it could be more screen real
estate changing its form to meet the
criteria whatever it is that you're
asking it for exactly that's the
exciting part this one demonstrates that
possibly even better than the phone
because the phone there's a lot of
conversation about well when do you use
the phone when it's folded up and when
do you fold it out and do you have the
time because with a phone there's still
a lot of one-handed use that goes on
throughout our day a casual kind of like
pop in and pop out type of thing try to
figure it out still trying to figure it
and from a form-factor perspective to
think roughly the same scale this one
has some key advantages that the phone
can't say that it has to the same extent
if it's a replacement for a laptop let's
say it ends up in a way smaller package
in a laptop with a similar specification
a lot of people speculated that this was
the true implementation for this tech
because laptops are big look at that
thing that you're using and you're
missing out a lot of screen real estate
if the keyboard said you kind of have to
think the opposite where like the screen
is first and then you know you add
haptic feedback or something it becomes
like a full fledge keyboard that you
feel mmm and that's easy all you need
feel though that's the thing it's for me
I'm always talking feel will I know
there's gonna be some external module
but like am i carrying it everywhere
probably not flip side though you pull
that out at a coffee shop holiness of
him you're gonna get some serious
attention
whoa look I don't know man I'm into
laptops I'm a laptop guy I'm typing
tactile that's my thing so is the form
factor exchange significant enough for
me to imagine a universe in which this
is it the most compelling part is the
scale of it you walk around with this
you don't even it's nothing and then of
course the fact that you get OLED which
is a difficult thing you don't see it in
a lot of laptops to begin with this is
not the finished product I expect this
to improve yes there are going to be
some drawbacks there are always
drawbacks well but in this case the
question is do you get more then you got
to give up and maybe so like what if I
told you that's a 13-inch display right
there
you'd be like nice fat like a sketchbook
you be I guess a sketchbook I'd be like
oh yeah tough guy huh like I just
explored yeah exactly
tough guy I'm excited to get to check
stuff like this out to be honest I've
said it in the past with stuff that's
super science fiction like this
ambitious like this is the kind of stuff
that makes me appreciate this job
specifically to get to examine this
right as it's kind of on the cutting
edge the bleeding edge as they say in
tech so I'm excited for moments like
this
and there you have it it's the folding
