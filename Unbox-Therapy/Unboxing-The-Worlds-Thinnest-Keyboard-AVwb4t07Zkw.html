sir see man you me we've done
professionally oh good for you would you
look at this little guy this might be
the slimmest lightest smallest keyboard
that I've ever featured here on unbox
therapy yes that in there is a keyboard
that fits in your pocket now you're
probably wondering why like what is so
compelling about that I'm hoping to find
out I'm formulating an idea of who this
might be interesting to somebody well
somebody has to type obviously but you
want to travel light you don't want to
bring a whole laptop maybe write a book
on your phone on the beach some I'm not
really sure okay light and thin fits
easily in the pocket compact easy typing
one keyboard for all devices obviously
it's wireless
we keep akut maybe you're tapping out
some rap lyrics somewhere discreet it's
a full keyboard smartphone phablet
tablet laptop Android iOS Windows FN + P
- peridot peridot over Bluetooth and
it's rechargeable as well let's dive
right in here
whoo that is very small micro USB cable
look at this thing that is tiny whoa
keep in mind this is folded in half
right now it's light - it's much lighter
than a smartphone power switch it looks
like on this end there's your micro USB
port to charge it up ooh just like that
oh my goodness that is super duper slim
look at that so these keys
they don't depress at all touch
activated completely I noticed we've got
the lights on I wonder if it's
immediately in pairing mode when you
flip it open you can see the different
function keys up here including
multimedia keys for volume and things
like that
compared to my hands look compared to a
smart phone you could have a little
novelist set up here you know your
memoirs between this and this look at
that
there's my writing package I take a trip
down to Havana I'm on the street corner
just taking it all in
alright so to get this thing paired up
you just hit F N and P at the same time
that'll turn on bluetooth pairing mode
there it is we key pocket my little
mobile setup here on
box therapy huh it makes a little baby
when you hit it so that's that's the
only feedback you're really gonna get
you too
but it's actually I mean it's better
than typing on the screen I think it's
nice there are also these keys for
Android Windows and iOS in which you can
select the OS that you'll be using with
it
let's see caps lock yeah no problem it
works like a regular keyboard that just
happens to be impossibly thin and
portable now I've seen some people type
on their screens incredibly quickly but
after a while I mean you're trying to
write down your lyrics or your life
story
you're gonna get cramped up potentially
so that's really where this thing comes
in the beeping is controlled up here you
can see that little indicator in the top
corner there the old FN in that key you
can turn that off you can have more con
there I mean that's I'm not even looking
at the screen and that that actually
worked
turn the screen brightness all the way
down and you just sit there and you're
Grove in writing your novel or your
article or whatever it is that you
happen to be into you're going to have
battery forever on this thing right you
could just be there for days typing away
the two of these things together in the
pocket
oh good for you
best part here is just how portable it
is that's crazy it's super duper thin
between the tool bum there it is that's
your little novelist kit right there
you're like my hunter s Thompson in the
breast pocket there you're ready to go
you're going on your business trip it's
all you need it's pretty amazing
actually look at that slender I don't
know how you could possibly get any
thinner oh my</div></body></html>
