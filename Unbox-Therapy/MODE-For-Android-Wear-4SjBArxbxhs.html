another video and as you can tell I've
got an abundance of goods here on the
table this is a good chunk of what's
available in the Android wear universe a
lot of these I haven't even looked at
yet the real purpose of this video in
experimenting with all of these
different smartwatches is these guys
right here recently launched the mode
system for interchangeable watch bands
Google actually sent out all this
Android wear goodness so that I could
swap out some bands and see how their
mode system operates we've got the Moto
360 the Huawei what is the name of
things just watch Huawei watch the LG
watch urbane the fossil SmartWatch
yeah the Q founder and the Asus Zen
watch to that one asus would rather be
pronounced a sous but i feel much more
comfortable saying asus and then a bunch
of bands it's a whole universal program
interchangeable with a lot of different
watches whatever your style is and
different styles of bands to i'm gonna
unbox
this would be a cool little time
holy Djem Oh Leo's SmartWatch universe
practically for some reason I'm
gravitating towards this 360 I like the
design since I first saw it I can also
see the interchangeable system there too
the band that they've got on this one's
got this nice leather band on it but you
might want to switch out to a silicon
band like this one you know you might be
at the gym sweating it out doing uh
doing the body pump
okay so moto 360 now set up as you could
tell objective here is to show off some
new looks
this Italian leather over here in this
tan color in blue as well and on the
side of the packaging a little
measurement tool for just how large your
device is in this case I'm looking at a
twenty two millimeter device there's
also an 18 so you've got support for
multiple sizes of watchbands these are
pretty standard measurements in the
watchband world if you're unfamiliar
with them this is very smooth the sporty
vibes indeed this is the clasp this is
how it operates and as I push over
you'll see it just kind of locks it in
place like that yeah good there's this
little nub here on this one slide it
over loosens up one side and you just go
ahead and pull out the other side look
at this a little tool is included in the
pack if you need it some pins for best
fit and just place it in there get it
lined out you can really use your
fingernail for this you don't have to
use the little tool actually find it
just find my hand and just like that you
are now ready for the mode system lock
that on there that's too easy on the
other side so now we have a moto 360
custom perfect for sport I will try this
on that's a comfy kind of fit there just
line it up like this lock it down and
now it's a completely different look
honestly I mean it looks like a
different watch will all pick something
like the Huawei watch here two little
pulls and that guy comes out this is
actually
in eighteen millimeter system we go
boom-boom
now you've got a leather Huawei watch
life is better with options simple
interchangeable modular mode you can use
the system like this to take the
personalization even one step further so
if you guys want to check out mode I
will have a link in the description you
can see even more options than all the
ones I've shown you here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
