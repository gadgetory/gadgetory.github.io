use a very expensive computer mouse this
one
the MX master I love it now this one is
the latest and greatest it retails for
around 70 bucks which I think for a lot
of people trying to justify spending
that kind of money
on a mouse and I thinking what's the big
deal here I'm mousing around I'm doing
completely fine with my stock mouse
beside the MX master I have the Amazon
basics wireless mouse with nano receiver
here's a wireless mouse that cost how
much Jack ten bucks seventy bucks
versus ten bucks what's the difference
is it worth the upgrade this is the $70
Mouse versus the $10 Mouse now it
wouldn't be a versus video unless we had
our resident expert when it comes to
value how you should spend your gadget
dollars I introduced the one and only
value Tom I think what am I suppose it's
gotta be why I'm like why that song that
he just wanted that entrance hope I
didn't it's like it's basically it's
like you know a boxer or like a UFC
fighter they want to have music that
represents them I can't spin it guy take
that part out right there you haven't
tried either of these computer mice as
it is what computer rings that's what
they pose let's give you your mouse yeah
but it's plural nice
Tom you fit right in with that crowd hey
that's what Tom looks like on weekends
what do you know about computer mice
nothing I never use them so he's a
touchpad kind of guy real pervert I want
an outsider somebody coming into the
game without any kind of preconception
let's get it started with the expensive
one can be connected to more than one
Bluetooth device at a time
speed adaptive scroll wheel and holds
power up to 40 days on a chart dual
connectivity if you use a receiver or
bluetooth a microUSB cable here is the
mouse itself the receiver which is
optional it's time you know what I'm
saying this entire service here that's a
button look at that you can map that
whatever you want whatever you do
frequently back and forward for your web
browser to go with the vertical scroll
now here's a special feature on this guy
can either give you that but you can hit
this button here how smooth that it is
freewheeling this is when you're on
whatever you're always on when you're on
TMZ and all that stuff we're home and
you're when you're busy on TMZ you get
to the bottom of the page faster give
that a little handle this would be a
learning process no yes
there's no learning going back and forth
man I'd have to be like one of these
like no no no and then if you hit both
buttons at the same time what happened
no no you'll get it you're getting
everything it depends on what you're
doing let's open the cheap one now here
we go
unboxing experience not the best that
little guy not terrible ten bucks
now it does take double-a batteries oh
look at this there's the receiver hmm
the receivers stores in the mouse that's
you kind of like that you know fancy
stuff with the wheel
no not 500 buttons on it yeah this is
much more comfortable for sure let's
test these out we have Tom's laptop here
he's ready to go the cheap Mouse first
all right do a little mouse in go to
your favorite website do a little
scrolling it's very quick there's no
delay whatsoever
yeah no it's it's not too bad it's a
little awkward is it so small let's try
the other one now Jack you have this
mouse too don't you you love it right
that means something Oh Oh Tom I think
tom has made a decision here you're not
spending the 70 are you no different
Wow he's not feeling the upgrade now of
course myself Jack and every single one
of you watching knows that this is well
worth the money why weighs it in certain
applications it can really speed up your
process if you're doing something that
really requires like extensive clicking
scrolling that kind of thing and then
for flex for sure I would get I'd
probably be licking and clacking yeah
I'd probably pay the 70 but if it comes
down to I need a quick Mouse when I'm
really doing work even the trackpad the
hand is cramping and here and with the
claw I will say this is my favorite
Mouse it's on my desk it's on Jack's
desk it's not perfect in terms of
tracking on certain surfaces so if you
do get this I would recommend a mousepad
is this seven times better for this one
I think Tom's right it really does
depend on what you're doing you're in a
video editing software if you're in a
Photoshop type of software and so on you
can probably see certain benefits
through a more precision tool like this
one and believe it right this used to be
like a hundred bucks it's down to like
70 now I think for the right user it's a
good investment if you don't use any of
those applications if you're like Tom
and all it is is TMZ and YMCA ten bucks
it'll get the job done I'm actually kind
of surprised at the caliber of this 410
think about 10 think about ten dollars
for a second I'm pleasantly surprised
I'm still spending the seventy but I'm
pleasantly surprised you let us know in
the comments what
for you the $10.00 Mouse of the $70
Mouse are you team Lu or team Tom don't
let me down
