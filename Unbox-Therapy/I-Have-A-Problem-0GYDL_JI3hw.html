listen I told you earlier I was going to
update you alright and that's exactly
what this is and to be quite honest it's
what you deserve now the reason that
they haven't been quite so many videos
all right you haven't seen as many
unboxing videos here on unbox therapy
recently is not because I don't want to
make them but it's because as you know
I've been moving into this new place
alright and that means a lot more setup
than most people think I got people on
Twitter to telling me oh dude I don't
get it you could you could do this job
in a closet all you need to do is set up
a table and you'll be all set and that's
it and it's like listen I'm going to
show you behind this curtain in a moment
look behind this curtain real quick look
at it I mean that's more that's more
than a curtain that is a fort that is a
fort built by grown men very unusual but
I'm going to show you what's on the
other side of that to give you a better
idea of the struggle the struggle to get
into a new space and get it up to the
standard you want for the videos you
want to make and like I know you watch
it you watching I'm like Sarah P video
and say oh it's flowing
we got angles it's nice it's beautiful
and what you don't realize that behind
the scenes is that that takes a little
bit a little bit of legwork to get it
the way you want so I think that today
we may have finally got something filmed
something in that set there is that
we're happy with at least partially
happy with you'll see the video that we
shot today tomorrow but the reason I
think this week maybe I only uploaded
once and and of course I want to get
back to uploading daily how about beyond
daily I mean you guys got to be
satisfied by the unbox therapist you
need your therapy alright to get through
the day so anyway I'm going to show you
around real quick upstairs we kind of
made upstairs a little bit more of a
a slightly homier environment that's
where I'm working right now I mean the
place is in a little bit of disarray but
maybe it's a little bit better than it
was so there's a little hangout spot
over here and on the other side as I
told you before on the other side of
this curtain is where this will air the
magic that is unbox therapy kind of
lives and you can see from the boxes
over there that some stuff has been
changed some some cameras have been
changed out I was shooting on what we're
called gh 4s from Panasonic for the
longest time I finally got some
professional gear some C 500 s which
give us a lot of options for running SDI
cables and recording the way we want oh
maybe you get a little bit little peek
in there now if you're wondering hey oh
you can see one of the cameras the
overhead which I'm still not completely
convinced is safe to be sitting under
but anyway uh what was I saying what was
I saying
your paw oh you're probably wondering
why there's a need for all these
blankets and foam and sheets and
whatever that is that's like a makeshift
way of dealing with echoes which as you
can probably tell are an issue in a
gigantic space so that makes a big
difference when you're in there is it's
not a hundred percent perfect yet I
still want to make some changes to that
and and I'm going to continue do you
keep tweaking that's how it works in the
YouTube gamer I suppose for a lot of
different a lot of different things that
you're you're aiming to perfect is you
it's it's small little tweaks that get
you to where you want to go you can't do
it all at once I mean some people can
they could try but that's it's tough to
it's tough to get things the way that
you want without actively doing them you
got to be in the game so for us we set
things up good enough now that we can
start to film things but nobody's happy
nobody's finished you're always trying
to find efficiencies make better stuff
make stuff more often and so on anyway
I'm going to take you in there right now
I talked a lot I'm going to take you in
behind the curtain it's exclusive live I
see you know what just before we go over
there let me just show you my my
mini setup that I'm using right now this
is a this is the 38 inch ultra wide
monitor and it has USB type-c so it
means I could take the new MacBook and
look at all those cables down there ha
what a mess it means you could take the
single cable off the new MacBook and
then have all your peripherals connected
directly to the monitor so you end up
with kind of what acts like a hub so
this is at least better than working
just off the laptop screen before
everything else gets set up and these
speakers what these speakers are
unbelievable I'm gonna give you a quick
listen I mean yeah they're they're
pretty special so that's the mini set up
right now but the purpose here of this
live stream and of this update is to
show you guys what's behind here what
have been built the sticks are clipped
up it kind of looks like a disaster but
I'm telling you it's necessary to get
even half decent audio into into the
videos the way I want them so you've
been holding up you've been waiting to
see unbox therapy videos you've been
waiting a few days and it's the new
studio now and behind here is the key
this is the key to the setup all right
so now you're thinking okay Lou you
could just be in a closet somewhere and
you could film but it really doesn't
work that way because we got to be
monitoring everything that's going on I
got to see everything I got to see every
angle while I'm doing it
I gotta be able to hit one button and go
so I'm gonna you know what let me power
it on real quick let me power this up
all right so you'll see those lights
will come to life and then there's
another power switch just over here so
give me one more second power that one
up and this is what I look at like when
you guys watch a video this is what I
see when I'm sitting here I see you guys
that's you guys right there unbelievable
and audio has been an issue now I can
see the overhead in that monitor over
there as you can tell that's where the
overhead comes in and then we got this
other camera over there is another
camera over there and then the overhead
which I've been most nervous
about as you can tell why there's this
threaded piece this threaded rail which
is holding oh I don't know at least 20
pounds over my head while I'm filming so
that's a little bit nerve-wracking but
these cameras have so many potential
outputs that you can send one of the SD
eyes into a recorder over there then a
separate one into the overhead shot so
that I can see what I'm doing while I'm
doing it and keep everything in frame I
got a bigger table now alright so bigger
objects just more space in general in
this region now the the agenda is not to
be in here permanently but for now it
makes a difference from an audio
perspective before the entire place is
treated for sound so it's this the
forward facing camera that's how you
look at me there's this beautiful side
angle over here that we all know as Jack
Jack say what's up to the people there's
a couple of Shogun's over here these are
the recording interfaces the other one
over there and then these beautiful LED
lights that that light it all up so
that's what's been happening back here I
still want to add more to this space in
terms of of sound absorption which seems
crazy oh I just already back here but
it's tough man I'm telling you when you
are when you're in a space like this a
space that's this big it's very
difficult to cut down watches oh oh hey
oh you hear that I'm sure you I'm pretty
sure you hear that coming back yeah Jack
the camera back there yeah say what's up
- Jack Jack oh say what's that back but
let me flip this around and what you're
going to see is I mean this is a giant
space from up here
look at this thing I'm gonna put a
basketball net over there right over
there it's going to be a basketball net
we'll have some challenges so on I'll
invite some other youtubers over play
one-on-one right over there who should I
invite over which youtuber should I show
how to shoot threes do it right over
there but anyway with the big space like
this you get a huge echo
boom you heard it so this is what's
necessary for the time being to bring
you unbox therapy videos that are going
to hurt your ears and then after that
we'll move out of that space and into
the open area of the studio for now this
is going to work and I hope you
appreciate this update thank you for
everybody who is here live right now
again like I said I think I've uploaded
one video in the past week which is like
the slowest unbox therapy has been in a
while
and it is truly not the way it's
intended to be because you need your
therapy far more often than that and so
do I I mean I gotta keep looking at
what's new and what's cool that's the
agenda and I'm going to keep it moving
so once everything is set up properly in
here we start to have this efficient
workflow it's going to be at least a
video per day you can hold me to that
you can come and yell at me on Twitter
or here in the comments when you don't
see a video a day you're like Lou you
said a video per day man I heard you say
it was on that stream you can hold me to
that look at that I put my hand here
that must mean something right I don't
really know anyways thank you very much
for joining I'll answer one question
before I take off one question
give me one question before I take off
what you got anything hit me up real
quick one question before I bounce what
do you got those are not questions those
are terrible things to say where is Jack
why I told you I told you where Jack was
Jack's in there
right now that's true a video per day I
told you that yeah oh yeah I'm gonna
have more music gear set up - I should
do that as well before I take off look
at this I got well this is not all my
music year but there's some of it is
over here some of it I can get I'm gonna
get back to that most definitely
look at that I might hop on the
microphone I might hop on this
microphone maybe I'll hop on this
microphone you guys might be surprised
boom there it is yes it's true the
comments are moving fast
okay oh there so so I just got one
comment I think you're so stupid I think
it's so stupid to get a space like that
why would you need a space like that I
don't understand I shoot YouTube videos
in my bedroom it's beautiful
I have everything I could possibly need
let me tell you something my experience
in life if you don't step out if you
don't make moves in the direction that
you're trying to go
you will be stunted you will be limited
you will be stuck in the location that
you're in all right you have to you have
to take steps this thing this game the
YouTube game and the things we're
working on this is this is entertainment
this is the future of everything
everybody's going to watch I know it is
for me I'm not turning on cable TV I
mean I watch sports here and there and
that's about it
so if this thing is going to expand to
that level if this is going to replace
that aspect of of the entertainment
business it's going to take you people
to start to look at this differently for
everybody who says all you need to do is
shoot in your bedroom Walt it's true
that's how I started but if if all we
ever do is talk about all you need not
what it can be and where you can take it
then you're automatically limiting
yourself from the get-go so this this
right here is an expansion of something
that I love it gives me opportunities
and potential beyond what that kind of
limited perspective could so if I want
to work with more people if I want to
build a separate set for a different TV
show not TV show but internet show
because I told you already I don't watch
TV I can do that
this think of this space as a canvas you
know if you're like a painter or
something this is a bigger canvas now
this face will not be the limitation on
what I can or can't do or want to or
don't want to do or or feel like it's
too intimidating or or so on the space
won't be the dictating factor it'll just
be me and whether or not I want to do it
or not and that's that's the beauty of
being in control and that's the
potential of the new media business and
YouTube and gotten people like you who
supported and uphold it and make this
kind of stuff possible so I've heard a
lot of people say those comments like
you want me you only
you know listen listen if the world were
about need it would be a much different
place that's not how the game works all
right from uncle Lou to you it's not how
it works if you're not willing to take
risks do not expect rewards that's my
experience all right and on that note
I'm out see you guys tomorrow there's a
new video tomorrow from that face in
there you guys can come and be critical
and say it's it's good or terrible or
whatever just remember I'm working on it
it's going to get better I promise you
daily uploads daily beyond daily uploads
and let's get a little look at yours for
the outro Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
