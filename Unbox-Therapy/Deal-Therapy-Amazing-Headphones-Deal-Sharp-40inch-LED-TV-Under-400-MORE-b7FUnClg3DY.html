the second episode of deal therapy we
started this last week and the response
was amazing so we're gonna make it a
regular thing here on the channel I'm
constantly browsing the web for the best
deals in tech electronics and other
things in general and so I decided hey
let's put this show together and share
some of those deals with you guys you
guys don't need to hear it though you
heard all about the explanation on the
last episode
today's deals are amazing probably
better than last week's so pay attention
something to note
most of these deals are available for a
limited time so make sure to click on
the links down below to check if that
deal is still available while you're
watching this most of them are one or
two days only so hurry up and click on
the description and check out those
links so the first deal of the day is
the sony MDR xb 600 headphones you guys
know i'm a huge fan of the XB series
from sony these ones are the new
incarnation of my model that i use which
is the XP 500 so this is the newer
version and they're on sale today for
$39.99 the regular price is a hundred
bucks so a major savings this is one of
those deals that is one day only this
will be over tomorrow so if you're
watching this hurry up and click the
link down below to get in on this deal
on the XB 600 s from sony the next deal
is a gaming deal actually there's a few
gaming deals today this one is from Best
Buy and it is a twelvemonth gold
membership to Xbox Live now this
normally retails for $59.99 but in this
case you can pick it up for $34.99 so a
great deal for anybody looking to get
their xbox live membership renewed the
next is also another gaming deal this is
call of duty black ops 2 most you guys
know about a lot you guys already have
it but for those of you that don't or
need another copy it's on sale for ps3
and xbox360 right now for 39.99 of
course the retail price the regular
price like any other game is 60 bucks so
pretty good savings there as well halo 4
is also on sale but it's even a little
bit less it's gonna be third
$4.99 down from the retail of 60 bucks
so some great gaming deals today that
are definitely worth checking out as I
mentioned a few minutes ago all the
links that you need are down below the
next deal is on a TV it would be a
perfect little gaming TV for that matter
it's a sharp 40 inch LED with 1080p
available this is a 2-day deal at Best
Buy and it's available for 370 $9.99
that is down from 450 so 40 inch TVs
have come way down in price and it's a
good size for gaming on because you know
really big screens you have to look
around a lot move your head a lot also
something I've noticed in the past sharp
screens have been good in terms of input
lag so that makes them pretty good
gaming panels so definitely check this
one out it once again is 370 999 the
next deal or it's actually not a deal
just a cool product that I found on
think geek calm it's the mini brew
coffee mug and it is a French press
single cup brewing device so you can
actually you know put your fresh grounds
into this cup press them down and drink
directly from the same device so you
don't have to be cleaning you know a
French press as well as a mug so if you
like fresh coffee but you want to make
it one cup at a time you should
definitely check out this mini brew on
think heat that link is down below as
well the last deal of the day is
actually on this lens that I'm speaking
into that you're watching me on right
now it is of course the canon ef-s 10 to
22 millimeter lens we shoot a ton of
stuff here in the unbox therapy studio
on this particular lens and it's
available today and probably for a
little bit longer than just today on
amazon for a whopping 678 dollars that's
way down from retail it's it's listed as
high as $1400 I paid around a thousand
but you can get it today for six hundred
and seventy-eight bucks it's a super
wide angle perspective which I'm a big
fan of so if you're into making videos
or you want some wide-angle photography
capability this is definitely a good
lens to look at and of course like
everything else that link is down below
thank you very much for joining me on
the second episode of deal therapy I
hope you guys find these deals useful if
you like the series make sure to leave a
thumbs up down below and I'll catch you
guys
the next one later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
