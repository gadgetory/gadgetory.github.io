you can tell right away you're dealing
with a special edition of a smartphone
because you have a special box in fact
in this case it's kind of a
collaboration between honor and Audi as
you can see what the logos there this is
the honor play player edition special
edition crazy fast crazy smart kind of
like genic - the smart and fast part
anyhow the reason I have two boxes here
is because each one has a different
color in it this is the honor play
smartphone player edition
now since honor sent over two player
Edition play X's I feel like the right
thing to do will be to give one back to
you guys so why not do a giveaway I'll
have a link in the description this
video it'll be super simple make sure to
subscribe check the link for the details
and yeah one of you guys will be lucky
enough to own not just this device but
the special edition with the cool box
and whatnot I think that's a good idea
what would you look at would you look at
that little model car here that is a
pretty serious looking out II ready for
anything this is the red color let me
peel this off real quick slick and you
can see all this etched in detail of
course this device puts a strong
emphasis on the gaming with the GPU
turbo the whole idea here is enhanced
gaming performance and possibly battery
life improvements this is a 6.3 inch
display and it's also got a pretty big
battery 3750 milliamp hours gotta have
battery life got to have a big display
quick charge power brick USB type-c
cable to charge it up let's check out
the black version the red accent around
the camera as well as the fingerprint
scanner
who doesn't like a cool accent color
button which one would you go for that's
a tough choice I will probably go for
the black and red myself so the camera
unit here is 16 megapixels plus 2
megapixels is a 2 megapixel camera used
for that bokeh portrait effect and the
front-facing camera 16 megapixels f/2 so
the honor play comes with either four
or six gigabytes of RAM it's got the
Kieran 970 processor here you can see
the display its LCD F HD it does have
expandable storage which is kind of a
nice thing in a phone focused on gaming
there you can see on the trade yes it
has a notch on the top but the cool
thing is for those of you that may not
be a fan of the notch like myself is you
can just black it out so this GPU turbo
mode that the device is capable of it's
some kind of hardware and software
integration that honor claims can boost
your GPU performance by 60% while
reducing energy consumption by 30%
now this 4d gaming experience has
something to do with how the device is
analyzing images and audio in real time
as well as providing a level of
vibration feedback now another feature
that exists on these phones as well as
other honor devices I've shown this off
in the past but I think it's pretty cool
the ability to combine devices into a
party a party mode in which they'll sync
up and play the same audio track
amplified across both speakers
quick camera test drink it everyday
Perrier
so this camera unit much like other
honor devices has an AI mode enabled by
default just to you you can keep that on
you can turn it off it's gonna aim to
guess what you're looking at boom whoa
well you're gonna want this photo
brother on or play player edition i'm
boston a channel and you have a chance
to win one good luck thank you very much
see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
