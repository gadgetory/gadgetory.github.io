therapy and today we're taking a look at
a very interesting device this is the
Berlin boom box from the outside it
looks kind of old-school like those boom
boxes you saw in the 80s and 90s but
this thing is different it's for an
iPhone or mp3 player and it's made out
of cardboard this is a do-it-yourself
kit that ships in this box right here
you actually build this thing so it's
all folded up inside of here it's very
interesting very unique it was actually
a Kickstarter project originally so
people actually crowdfunded the
production of this device if you guys
are interested in more information on
this boom box if you think about
purchasing one yourself I'm gonna drop a
link down in the description so
definitely go check that out to learn
everything there is to know about the
Berlin boom box which is a really cool
piece of technology as well as art sort
of all-in-one so here's the instructions
and rather than bore you guys with the
entire procedure of me building it all
do like a flash forward like a speed
build towards the end of this video but
first we're going to talk about the
components so what you're looking at
here is some really sturdy cardboard
that's made up to look like a boom box
and it's all kind of folded up in a
specific way we're gonna unfold it you
know as the video progresses and do the
actual construction you've also got some
batteries as well as a little battery
holding module that plugs in to the
board to actually give you sound through
this device you've also got a mini jack
cable for connecting to your mp3 player
smartphone iPhone etc there's a volume
knob which also I believe has the
amplifier board on it and then there are
some small little speakers here these
are the heaviest components and maybe
the most important components after all
this is a boombox and the whole
intention here is to play some music the
boombox ships with three double A
batteries to get you up and running
straight out of the box but you can
replace these with rechargeable ones if
you need a more sustainable solution
here's a closer look at the speakers the
two are identical of course and they're
sort of standard what you'd expect to
see in a speaker as I mentioned before
the volume knob is sort of where all the
technology is this is where your
amplifier board is this is where you
control the volume and this is where
everything plugs into once you begin on
the construction let's see if I can
build this thing without screwing it up
so here it is the completed Berlin boom
box constructed by me the instructions
are actually pretty easy to follow you
just kind of have to try things a couple
of times but it's really no big deal and
you do get that sense of accomplishment
having built the thing yourself but
after all it is a boom box so we have to
check it out with some audio I've gone
ahead and used my Nexus 4 but you can
use any audio device that uses a mini
jack connectors so that could be an
iPhone that could be an mp3 player it
really doesn't matter and then you can
go ahead and turn the device on just
simply by turning the volume knob i've
got my trusty h2n here which i use for
all my audio recordings so let's go
ahead hit the record button and give you
guys a quick taste of what the Berlin
boombox can do
so as expected the Berlin boombox can
actually play some sound and look good
doing it I'm definitely impressed with
what it's able to do especially
considering the fact that I put it
together anyway guys as I said earlier
definitely check out the link in the
description for all the info you need on
this device see you guys on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
