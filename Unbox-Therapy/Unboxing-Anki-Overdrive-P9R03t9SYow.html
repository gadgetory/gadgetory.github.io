another video and today we are checking
out something that I'm sure is going to
be quite fun to test out this is the
Anki overdrive which is an incredibly
sophisticated racing game which includes
these little guys here these little
little cars which move around a track
very intelligently and there's an app
that goes along with it so you can
control various things within the game
I've actually looked at the previous
version this one looks a lot more
interesting now added the ability to
build your own track use these various
accessories to send the track up over
obstacles I've got the starter kit over
here and then I've got some accessories
let's jump inside get a brief overview
and go from there the starter kit
features ten Anki overdrive flex track
pieces that allow you to build and
rebuild up to eight epic battlefields so
here you can see this this is stuff you
can build right out of the box without
any accessories different game modes
race battle time trial tournament
multiplayer and team and as you can see
here it's installed on these two devices
it'll work on iOS and Android of course
you can use it on a phone or tablet I'm
moving these are the two cars that are
included in the starter kit you have the
ground shock as well as skull as you
move through the game you're gonna also
unlock new things upgrades and so on so
let's go ahead and crack this baby open
skull red gray there's also a new
charger you can now charge for vehicles
on one little dock 20 minutes of play
from around an 8 minute charge mmm this
little guy is actually for the tires
I believe you sort of run them over like
this get the junk off and get yourself
some some fresh traction a power brick
here USB on one end power on the other
here a couple little risers again if you
want to build up the track in a section
and want to give it a little incline
that's cool here are some track
components what's cool about these is
they're fairly durable flexible look at
this they attach magnetically you don't
have to be worried about clips breaking
or anything like that just kind of like
this just line them up
I mean that's brilliant magnets make
everything better you're encouraged to
continue to change around your track and
change around a situation you might just
do that
and never actually get to the game a
couple more vehicles this guy's called
nuke and this guy's called thermo Wow
the old-school version of that which is
like a zip tie around the thing into the
thing nightmare what kind of dude is
getting amped up about packaging Jack
that's who hey Jack how about this
packaging that makes four total
look at that squadron I'm gonna go with
this guy ground shock let's go ahead and
set it up and and test it out do a
little bit of look the gameplay
okay so we are messing around with a
couple different construction scenarios
couple things to note real quick on your
first build don't build anything super
complicated because there is a
qualifying round in that round you can't
use one of these which is this
intersection piece here another thing I
noticed on the jumps you want to line up
your lifter pieces on these white
sections here to get nice clean jumps
and also you want to have a straightaway
before the jump happens so the cars can
build up some speed they've been
charging let me give you guys a little
bit of a demo you can see here I've
defeated some people already here's the
qualifying round battle and so on and
you keep moving through the game this
way the vehicles are on a track and
essentially the way this works this is
where they will scan the track and
understand all of the turns the
intersection over here the start point
and what not so you can see they just
did the jump and see in the scanning
they now know that there's a jump there
if you want to go up on a couch for
example or attempt some kind of steep
incline at a higher speed you can see
they scan at a relatively slow speed so
do the scanning down here and this is
sort of the intelligence of the game and
the vehicles is that they can
essentially go around this track a
couple times and then figure out exactly
what they're working with
so I'm gonna get moving now he's gonna
try to disable me because we do have
weapons and I have a couple of upgrades
but he hasn't shot me yet and you can
switch lanes just by nudging the
controller in this case a phone in one
direction or the other see he just shot
me I'm gonna slow down let him pass and
now I'm going to try to disable him with
my weapons I just remember if you do use
your weapons in this case it can
decrease your power and make it easier
for you to be disabled so you got to be
kind of careful about when you use your
weapons now you also want to try to get
to the inside of turns if you can oh no
both guys off now if they do fall
completely off the track you can just
place them back on like this give them a
little push now as you play and continue
to progress the weapons available to you
change as well as the upgrades for them
you can also pause the game so I've just
done right now kind of like a video game
in fact and then pick it up where you
left off what you're going to want to do
every so often as well is wipe down a
track so the other thing you're gonna
want to do is use that little sticky pad
to clean off the tires every so often
it's sort of like it makes oh we did a
little twist and still landed it hit
that oh you jumped over no no I've been
disabled and I assume he's about to win
now he may have just won yeah there you
go I'm impressed with this thing I think
the ability to construct your own track
to design your own track is a huge deal
the enjoyment only gets amplified when
you involve other people locally because
then when you beat them you can laughs
right in their face as they are present
my guy just missed his jump I think it's
going to be cool to experiment with this
and send it in different directions here
around the office and also share it with
people in my family who I think are
really going to appreciate this they
have it Anki overdrive if you guys want
to know any more information about it
check out pricing and availability I'll
have links down in the description and
that's about it that wraps it up thanks
very much for watching and I'll catch
you guys on the next episode later
normally if I cared about my opponent
I'd let him back on the track but in
this case I'm happy to let him sit there
as my wonderful blue car succeeds in
victory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
