right now but as usual a package arrived
it's a big box and as usual Jack
couldn't wait to get into it
all right spoiling the unboxing
experience he cracked it open I waltzed
over I said what do we have today there
Jack I peeked inside this box and I was
like whoa should I give you a little
preamble here you may or may not know I
recently I had a birthday I celebrated a
birthday what is it yesterday happy
birthday to Lou I'm not a huge birthday
guy but but this box begs to differ
let's turning this thing into a
celebration it's a happy birthday
celebration Tom you got any candles
brother Tom's got nothing there he is
big Tom who's here
just to focus we have we've got a guest
Oh baby
right on time are those leopard print
shoes then come on over here man
no so in this box I took one peek at it
but I knew I knew what was going on
first of all it smells good Oh baby you
know what I'm not gonna try to lift this
out instead I'm gonna cut the box around
it look at this this is a birthday cake
my good friends at LG have just created
something unbelievable here this is a
replica of my studio I don't know if you
guys can tell this properly here this is
the green chair I'm sitting in the white
desk the camera set up of course Jack
over here or is this Jack who knows this
couch right over here is that couch over
there same with that copy of this chair
this is all stuff that's in the actual
studio it's really incredible you can
see they've actually upgraded this set
with their new OLED display here super
thin mounted on the wall this is all
edible this is made out of cake I didn't
even know you could make something like
this out of cake look at Jack right
there he's got a similar outfit to me
kind of but of course his face is
nothing but a question mark well which
obviously makes sense this is me over
here and then there's like this cake
which is also cake it's a cake and a
cake this is unbelievable G has sent me
some crazy stuff in the past but this is
another level because this is edible and
we're gonna we're gonna eat it we're
gonna taste it Tom come on over here
happy birthday to me
it's big Tom that's uncomfortable
the smell okay it's alright I'm really
good apparently Jack too old is he well
he has no face sir
so Tom what good is a what good is all
this if you can't eat it Tom you you I
could cut Jack's head off oh you came
loose we'll pull him out he's kind of
cold to the touch you asked for this all
right go for it Tom give her a bite
sugar fix a little ball is the girl his
body looks like he's made out of
chocolate
that's chocolate good for them I don't
want a bigger fight yeah that's not too
bad this is insane it's really act is
actually insane
look at that right happy birthday or
what huh

day I'm 26
here you go mmm
try got a piece for jak 2 since you ate
his head in front of millions

what do we learn here today Tom why do
you ask questions like that it's so
weird
okay good you go yeah not bad at all the
cake is really good what we learned
today was go ahead I have to admit I'm
feeling more festive do I come off the
couch oh look at the butt crack cuz that
little guy still little guy
mmm-hmm try the head you're done bud
definitely strong play-doh vibes but a
slight bit of vagenis a qua stop
shout-out to LG they're always coming up
