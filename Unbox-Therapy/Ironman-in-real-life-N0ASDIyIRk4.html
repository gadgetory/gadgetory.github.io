do it in the process this is what the
internet was invented for this moment
right now what's up guys Lew here and
I'm out in California about to show you
how to become iron man in real life
while on a tank all right so today we
are taking a first look possibly the
world's first unboxing of the metal one
developer kit as I said in the intro to
this video these glasses are going to
bring you as close as possible to Iron
Man in real life so inside the kit we
are greeted with this beautiful velvet
looking cover and beneath there is
everything you need to get up and
running with the metal one developer kit
what you're looking at here is the
future of augmented reality in glasses
form you have a multitude of sensors on
the top so that that experience can
happen as well as lenses but this is not
like VR in the sense that it completely
closes you off from the rest of the
world this is an interactive device
where you can wear this and have digital
elements overlaid on what you're seeing
in real life you don't just have the
glasses you have this connection box in
the center and this is how you're going
to interface with your PC which is going
to drive the experience so these cables
fit into here there's a power button as
well as a 3d button to actually begin
the experience there's software of
course that comes along with the
developer kit inside we also have a
cleaning cloth we've also got an HDMI
cable a power cable and a USB cable so
everything that you need to get up and
running with the future of augmented
reality let's go test these out so the
metal one developer kit comes with two
separate lenses this one is going to
increase your peripheral vision allow
you to see more of the space around you
whereas the preinstalled lens has an
increased field of view which should
also increase your immersion or your
immersion experience so let's go ahead
and get this mounted up on my face and
see what it's capable of
you
you
so basically guys what I've been playing
with is this augmented overlay I have
Windows browser windows different
experiences etc yet I can still see
what's going on in reality that's my
good pal mr. Austen not Duncan you know
him of course
essentially you have an immersion in
this digital space which is tied
together with the physical space like as
I look around like I see that light over
there you know I see the the end of the
wall on that side over there of course I
see the beautiful c100 in this location
here tripod over there so in unlike the
oculus experience in which you're
totally cut off from your surroundings
this allows you to engage with a an
augmented medium while at the same time
still having access visual access to
your physical actual surroundings so
this is the meta Pro this is the most
advanced wearable computer in the world
certainly the most advanced see-through
wearable computer it has the largest
augmented reality screens commercially
available 16 times larger than Google
glass six times thinner about 10 sensors
onboard all there to lend for a really
good tracking experience and so what
we're gonna do right now is kind of
experience the user interface elements
that that chase the creator of Ironman
told you about earlier whenever you're
ready you see one image I love it it's
awesome all right try and shake off the
the glove the augmented reality glove
you see just to test the latency right
it's a trick there is no latency okay so
extremely minimal that's true throw and
now move your hand out of the way and
you see it stays there and then if you
look towards me we can make eye contact
and you can look back at the augmented
content
exactly where I left it perfect now grab
that with your right hand grab one of
the Holograms with your right hand by
the way guys where where you see Iron
Man right now people right here Tony
Stark no big deal and I could swivel the
chair around and kind of stick that
towards the wall well right there open
your hand and I grabbed it again all
right now move your hand quickly out of
the way now look back towards the desk
yeah and back over there old Chan
because we're tracking the room it's
still there that's a magic trick thanks
very much so the next thing we'll do is
press the input so you know it's not all
about output here right raise your index
finger up right take it slowly towards
this keyboard this is the first
holographic keyboard in the world move
forward until you intersect there you go
you just intersect it with the U and it
registered the click perfect now you got
your Tesla car can you tell me every one
of these part of the deal right right
sit go ahead and reach out and grab it
and now swivel your chair around just so
you can see every part of the hologram
noteworthy is the next cheapest hologram
viewers $100,000 so I just want to show
you the quality of the hologram here I
don't want to let go now I can put that
car anywhere yeah yeah I just move your
hand quickly out of the way and it's
going to start see you later see you
later well you guys on the camera you
can't really see what I'm going through
right now but this is next level 100%
next level you heard it here 50 multi
monitors on my desk no longer and it's
just it's just a web browser basically
oh yeah perfect
well I miss that one and now if you look
to the right kind of login to Pinterest
go ahead and click on that play button
and now you're actually you
the video that sold the glasses that
you're wearing direct from our website
oh I'm clicking on your monitors oh whoa
