front of me and I've been waiting for
this one ever since the last one because
this is the second version of the device
it does not look like a smart phone I
mean technically it's not a smart phone
I think in the last video I called it a
dumb phone but this one is an upgrade
over the previous one but it's a phone
called pumped and the model is the MP Oh
two previous one the oh one the whole
concept with this phone is to give up
detox your smartphone although in the
paperwork that they sent here it's not a
detox phone it's a new kind of everyday
phone for people who have realised that
smart phones can get in the way of life
you've seen it you've been in
restaurants you even see it on the
highway sometimes people are so addicted
they're trying to drive and look at
their phones at the same time the
concept that they're going for is that
you'll still have a laptop or a tablet
and you can use this as your modem just
keep that device connected to this one
if you do need an internet connection
for the utility purposes BlackBerry
secured icon so I assume a bit of a
collaboration there on the security now
I really like the way the old one looks
so simple so small look at that thing
that's it that's the phone how crazy is
imagine your friend pulls this thing out
of their pocket you are gonna be blown
away surprised amazed all of the above
the material feels different than the
previous version it's a bit grippier
grittier I think this could be exciting
as a backup phone as an emergency phone
as a vacation phone Palme was trying to
do something similar with the palm phone
made a video recently what else comes in
the box is a little sim tool there paper
were a tiny little headset single earbud
in ear headset using the type-c USB
connector slim little power brick type-c
USB cable to charge it up standby
battery life of twelve and a half days
is what they're suggesting 4.2 hours of
talk times that's a lot of talk time as
well it's the type of you know an
executive maybe it's a luxury device you
don't even need a smart phone you're so
rich you don't even need to do stuff on
a smart phone emails later you need me
you call feels cool holding it I have to
say here
vibration Pumped you know you got the
cool name very tactile inputs found a
way to create a pretty intuitive
interface All Things Considered just
with the old nav silent mode airplane
mode bluetooth so you can connect the
Bluetooth headset to it that's kind of
important I guess as a communication
device if you want to try to type a text
message you're stuck with the t9 now for
those of you that don't remember that
that means hitting the key three times
each key representing three letters like
I said to see it's three times and then
let go like the kids don't even remember
this t9 stuff but this was our life all
right very short text messages if I'm
using a phone like this I'm like call me
I'm not texted back maybe your social
skills are not up to snuff at a point
where you can interface that way I don't
care we're having a call we're having a
chat cuz I'm not t9 in your back here
now what should we do I guess we should
have a phone call here I guess will give
me a call hello we're going back in time
dude this is it now is how we
communicate
I don't want your texts I don't want
your memes
I don't want your fancy time I don't
want pictures of Otis I don't want to
see what you're eating for breakfast we
just talk now you have to explain you
have to describe what you're eating for
breakfast we're gonna get real
descriptive we're gonna have to become
linguists so that our words can better
describe situations event images and
memes and gifts and we have to become
modern-day poets yeah it's a
speakerphone it brings me back to an old
time there's some kind of warm feeling
about the fact that it's so different
and weird and unusual you you just can't
help the angsty feeling you have when
your SIM card lives in something like
this but what if I'm hungry but if I
need to see something but if I want to
be somewhere but I don't actually want
to go I want to see somebody else go
there
we're a physical device a phone feels
like an appendage like an arm why you
little
what happened to that that's that that's
not around anymore you IATA guy ought a
sake Owen are we cyborgs
probably we are moving in that direction
when this little guy here makes you feel
fearful because you need that fix you
know what I mean hey it's not just you
it's me it's definitely hilly dude is
connected in all the wrong ways he's
wired up right now top to bottom
it's disturbing they don't want you to
call the phone digital detox but that's
really kind of the only way I see a
person using it no more of this action
it's dis action you know maybe that
person is out there maybe that person is
you I know it ain't gonna be many it
ain't gonna be me these guys obviously
know the feeling they made this thing
they manufactured this they know the
feeling and they're searching for a
different one and you might be too so if
that's you you might want to have an
experiment with this but this thing is
not cheap not that it feels cheap I mean
I like the design it's pretty cool one
of those things where you could take a
step backwards but still kind of feel
cool about it I don't know like a vinyl
record or something like that or a fancy
mustache or a coffee that takes a lot
longer to make it has that appearance to
it so you can still be cool even though
your phone does less than your Grandpa's
there it is it's the new MP 0-2 it's all
in good fun I think it serves a cool
kind of purpose I think all of us should
untangle ourselves every so often see
what we're made of see if there's some
human left in there and keep our eyes on
the prize you know what I mean okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
