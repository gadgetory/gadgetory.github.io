limited edition arcade machine which is
handmade by a company or a guy a guy
named love Holton
it's like $2,700 and there's 50 in
existence so this should be interesting
let's put it that way
hopefully we'll play a couple of games
here certificate of authenticity with
the pen mark love halton does hereby
affirm the authenticity of this
statement this is number 43 out of 50
completed in 2018 arcade rw1
edition don't you feel special already
man holy the inlay on top is genuine
mother-of-pearl the joystick and buttons
are custom made from solid brass eight
thousand milliamp hour battery which is
capable of three hours of play time on
the run on the run I'm not sure what
you're running from and a game library
of 32 gigabytes up to 10,000 emulated
games sweet oh look at the pac-man miss
pac-man that's miss pac-man right with
the boat
wow that's wood
oh you start by unscrewing this piece
and then that guy flips open strong
retro vibes happening here inside
there's an LCD but then you've got this
overlay which gives you the appearance
of like a retro television set and then
this piece it just screws into this
location over here okay let's go through
the systems real quick nine games on
Atari 2600 game boy name nine games
available Master System that's a
throwback three games available Mega
Drive Neo Geo Nintendo 35 games
available retro pie
so obviously the guts of this thing are
raspberry pie and it's got the emulator
loaded on top of that Super Nintendo 19
games and that we're back to Atari who's
excited all right let's uh where can i
play here Jack that you can get a good
view let us play it's got the vibe of
like a a high-end watch might come in a
case like this or some really fancy con
yak it's got a luxury hand made feel to
it it's a bespoke product let's try Game
Boy I'm wondering if there's like a
classic Tetris on there what what do you
want can can I just do a classic Tetris
real quiz' Tunes are unbelievable look
how we they have it so it looks like a
tube TV that is too cool
yes sir
we're gonna get at least one Tetris
before we start the next game there how
are you doing this to us right now okay
we're just go here and then we're gonna
get this Tetris see what it is without
that you'll have fortnight Epic Games
that was me on the Gameboy young Lou I
don't I might not even be here without
Tetris on the Gameboy bringing order to
chaos will wants me to play a color game
Bluetooth so you could hook up you can
hook up a controller to this if you
wanted I guess a Bluetooth controller
yeah to player they got Mortal Kombat
NBA Jam Street Fighter 2 Castlevania
Super Mario or should I go to Genesis
and see what they have there
yeah they got Sonic and Streets of Rage
are you hearing these tunes right now
though Jack listen to that right here to
break down
let's go get some of these dudes your
dad oh I called in the I did not need to
use that right now accidental
I called in the air strike
unnecessarily this dude refuses to die
over here it's crazy that this was like
the cutting edge like if I had to pick
this up at the right time in my life
like this was a life-changing experience
Oh
upgrade to a pipe that guy's got a
karate kid' stance though okay what can
I say it's a it's a boutique item if you
brought this thing to a party that's
kind of a hit with these old school
games you don't really have to know too
much to get into them it's not like the
prerequisite is is incredible game or
skill anyone can pick this up and start
throwing some punches you order pizza
you have a couple snacks you play some
old-school games you chat a little bit
the thing is it's $2,700 so you're kind
of almost afraid to bring it out of the
house it's a boutique item you know what
I mean it's a limited-edition Willie do
let's get you in here let's hear your
opinion on this you're the reason that
this product is here to begin with yeah
I'm a really big fan of artisanal
artisanal that's a word I did not use
yet I used a boutique bespoke yep a lot
of prime materials that pretty expensive
this is not coming from a giant factory
where they're gonna make a million of
these there's 50 and a guy made them all
by hand and you could tell the passion
that goes into it so I respect a lot of
that give us a rundown young Willie do
young Willie do Mississauga Ontario yeah
I would rock the game boy game boy yeah
okay which title Tetris for sure you
just copy beam in Pokemon Pokemon
was that when it was the different
colors like you had to get the yellow
cartridge or no even back in the day it
was red and blue red and blue okay those
are the straight-up legit first Pokemon
games all right but those games were
super hard you know a side-scrolling
games yes oh no it's true and we talked
about this on the retro gaming hardware
in the past we talked about how these
old games it's not like you have save
points no if you beat the game that was
meaningful because most of your friends
didn't beat it obviously today gaming
exists in a whole different universe in
which you never beat it like nothing is
neat about you just play video end game
no you just play forever yeah you get is
keep grinding addicted to the mechanics
yeah it's such a different mindset than
the type of games that we were exposed
to as a youngster exactly now I'm not
trying to say that this is a solution to
all of today's gaming problems not for
everybody but it's a nice I get some
museum piece like if you had this thing
on a coffee table in a way it's almost
as nice to look at as it is to use yeah
the fact that you can interact with it
you know and play some old-school games
nothing wrong with that it's interactive
art yeah and you can smell it I guess so
yes
can you well just well I suppose that's
nice smelling as well how dare you you
know it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
