sweet taste of honeycomb cereal but no
this video is not about cereal I was
just inspired to bring this in because
of today's subject matter apparently the
honeycomb design is not only important
in nature and cereal apparently it's
also very important in the world of
Bluetooth speakers BAM innovative
honeycomb design for clean sound this is
something that I was unaware of
apparently the shape that makes
honeycomb taste so great can also be
utilized for Bluetooth sound now they
claim outstanding bass outstanding bass
if anybody knows bass I know bass so
we'll find out if they're telling the
truth in it because if the honeycomb
shape has anything to do with it I can
tell just from the form factor of this
if it's thumbs I'll be surprised because
it's you know I've had bigger boom boxes
here but then that said not everyone has
the space so maybe that's where this
fits in they're all a bit different one
thing I can say for sure is none of them
have cleaned to this point that their
honeycomb shape is the reason they sound
good let's find out what this thing is
all about the HD one bloomin speaker all
right
no they we're not lying that thing is
reminiscent of a honeycomb actually kind
of looks cool
never mind the sound it looks like a
piece of art or something it says
honeycomb on the top power volume mute
Bluetooth play pause these nice big
rubber feet on the bottom so it's not
going to vibrate too much on the surface
a micro SD card slot so you can play
music straight off of an SD card micro
USB and then USB out so you can charge
up another device also in the box micro
USB auxiliary cable power cable and
paperwork that I probably will never
read
and a power brick okay let's see if it's
got juice remember the activities we
gotta plug it in so I just noticed an
orange LED oh maybe it did have power
that whole time but I wasn't holding it
long enough flashing blue right above
Jack there you can see honeycomb listed
okay sweet
here it is moment of truth let's play
some tunes as we normally do but you all
have been waiting for which you all have
been waiting for what you have all been
waiting for
EQ beats by the way check them out
oh now let's see volume all my device is
maxed now let's do it on the speaker as
well what did I just do oh my skipping
tracks instead of volume oh I am but
that skipping tracks is not controlling
volume might be one neat situation where
the volume is just controlled by outside
the honeycomb how they all know what you
do how to work together if you just kind
of action I mean never might be never
mind in what's going on there kind of
frequency are they operating on to bring
in food to the queen who's the queen
happening here you have to hold it to
increase boss see oh there you go down
it for you
what can I say I mean I don't know I
doubt you're picking this thing strictly
based on sound quality it's obviously
bringing something else to the table in
terms of design you're either going to
like it or you're going to think it
looks strange I think it looks unusual
which is good like you know could be a
conversation starter like hey man what's
that Bluetooth speaker for what it is it
sounds pretty decent now the question is
how much does it cost I need to look
this up alright 129 bucks I might be
able to recommend that at 129 this is a
very directional sound you're not
wasting any sound in an alternative
direction but straight at where people
might be but if you want to place it in
the middle of the room it's going to be
far more directional than some of those
other products plus maybe you're a mega
honeycomb fan like the cereal I know
lion it's always a benefit drawback type
scenario portability sound bass volume
and so on but really what this is about
is you honeycomb lovers out there
those that want to match their Bluetooth
speaker to their favorite cereal I see
you</div></body></html>
