introduce you to a new concept for those
of you that follow me on Twitter and on
Facebook you know I'm constantly looking
for the best deals in tech electronics
and really just cool stuff online in
general that's sort of my job to do some
shopping and to find those deals so I
wanted to take all that effort that I'm
putting into that and share it with you
guys i've been doing that like i said
before already on twitter and facebook
but for those of you that only watch me
here on youtube you guys are kind of
missing out on some of the cool stuff
that i'm tracking down so I want to do
these shows every so often where I give
you guys an idea of some of the deals
that i found on the web on any given day
so this is sort of the pilot for a
larger project hopefully you guys like
it definitely leave a thumbs up down
below if this is something you're
interested in seeing more often if
you're interested in any of the deals
that i talked about on these episodes
the links are always down in the
description so you can check out pricing
availability more respects for yourself
so other than that let's get straight
into it let's run down some of the deals
that i found interesting today on the
internet so deal number one is a pair of
headphones these are the audio technica
ath em 30s and they are sixty-five
percent off right now on amazon that
gives you a total price of 4129 so major
savings on this set of headphones for
those of you that are unfamiliar with
audio technica if they are a brand
that's been in the headphone business
for a long long time based out of japan
and they make incredibly high quality
stuff so getting a pair of their
headphones for 40 bucks or right around
40 bucks is definitely a very good deal
I know a number of other youtubers
already use their products whether it be
the M 50s or in this case the am 30s now
the next deal is about the gopro hero3
the Black Edition i recently unbox this
on the channel i know a lot of you guys
caught that video best buy is having a
deal right now where if you purchase the
black edition of the hero 3 then you're
also going to get a 32 gigabyte microSD
card included for free so a free SD card
with the gopro hero3 black edition the
Black Edition has some features that the
other editions don't so check out that
link down below for full specs on that
particular device the next item is not
actually a
but something interesting that showed up
on Amazon they've created a product page
for the ps4 the PlayStation 4 that was
recently announced or not quite
announced if you didn't get to see very
much of it but anyways they've created a
product page so you can actually sign up
to be notified the moment that it goes
on sale over on amazon now that's
probably going to be useful for some
people that are worried about stock you
know being available when the new
console launches its supposed to be
around Christmas times if you want to
get a head start and everyone else you
can sign up over there you can also
pre-order some of the games that are
going to be available at launch for the
ps4 like my favorite watchdogs although
right now there's a ninety nine dollar
price point so that's leading me to
believe that we're going to see
hundred-dollar titles on the ps4 the
next deal is actually a winter sale
happening over on thinkgeek com if
you've never visited the site before
it's definitely worth checking out I'm
sure a number of you guys that have
visited can vouch for that they've got
all kinds of interesting items
everything from little gadgets to just
interesting geek / third gear so
t-shirts some clothing stuff it's
definitely worth checking out that link
is down below especially when you can
get stuff on sale so up to fifty percent
off on a number of different items as
part of the thinkgeek winter sale now to
the world of video games the best deal I
can find today is going to be good for
you wrestling fans WWE 12 is available
right now for only 2099 so a significant
savings off the MSRP that's happening
over on Amazon so as I said before if
you're a wrestling fan this is a good
opportunity to jump on a heavily
discounted title now as you guys know
I'm a big fan of t-shirts I pretty much
wear t-shirts every day nothing too
fancy I will here at the unbox therapy
headquarters and one of my favorite
sites the buy shirts from called busted
tees is having a promotion right now
where they've got 24 different versions
different types of t-shirts that they're
retailing for ten dollars so they're
having a little bit of a discount they
normally retail between 15 and 20 but
there are 24 selections that are
available for ten dollars I believe this
is only for the remainder of the weekend
so this one you probably have to hurry
up on that link is down below as well
last but not least we have a deal from
B&amp;amp;H photo another one of my favorite
sites to shop went online
these guys actually shipped to a number
of countries in the world so you
international viewers can take advantage
of this one it's an unusual device
because it's a little bit older it'll
probably be discontinued soon but it
originally retailed a lot higher than
what you can get it for right now I'm
talking about the tascam IM two stereo
microphone for iOS products now this
uses the 30-pin dock connector so
obviously you're going to have to have
an older iphone or ipod touch in order
to take advantage of this but what
you're getting is an incredibly high
quality audio recorder that can hook up
to an iOS device for only twenty-nine
ninety-nine that's over fifty dollars
off the retail price or what it
originally retailed for obviously
because now you've got the iphone 5 and
the new ipod touch that features the
lightning connector but if you're
rocking an older device you need a high
quality you know audio recording
probably can't beat the price here at
twenty-nine ninety-nine it might even be
worthwhile picking up in older ipod
touch or something along those lines to
pair with this audio interface because
of how high quality it is and the price
you can get it at so anyway guys 2999
one more time for the tascam IM to
stereo microphone so that wraps up the
very first episode of deal therapy at
least that's what i'm calling it right
now i hope you guys find some of these
deals useful and i want to also make a
suggestion if you guys find deals on
your own that i haven't mentioned or you
have heard me talk about please tweet
them to me on twitter because that's the
only place you can tweet or let me know
on facebook wherever you can get in
touch with me or in the comments down
below although you can't post links
there so that will be tough to do and
then i'll try and get those into future
episodes and if you give me the tip on
the deal then i'll give you a shout out
in the video too so anyways as I said
before hopefully you'll find these deals
useful and if you do and if you enjoy
this content please remember to leave a
thumbs up down below and hopefully we
can continue to do these shows in the
future anyway guys thanks as always for
watching it'll catch you on the next
episode and i'll catch you tomorrow for
the big iPad 128 gigabyte model giveaway
don't miss it alright later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
