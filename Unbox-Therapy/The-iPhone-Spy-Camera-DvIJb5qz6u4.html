another video and today I'm continuing
to bring the heat with stuff you
probably never knew existed this is
called cover photo a kind of like spy
case I guess for your iPhone 6 or as
they say the best iPhone lens case for
one-handed candid photography now don't
get any strange ideas people this was
sent to me from somebody over at bite my
Apple dot CEO Chris Johnson was his name
all right cool
could it be a gimmick quite possibly
does that make it any less interesting
probably not so let's go ahead and check
this thing out and they're using it in a
pool seems like an odd choice for candid
photography you know what I'm saying
haha how does this work okay there we go
Khai uses a mirror to take the image
reflect it onto your camera lens little
bit of a weird design here what else is
in here that's it it looks like there's
an app to go with it maybe they're just
not allowed to show oh yeah
Jesus right there there's a QR code for
the app do I need it let's find out
maybe I don't so there's a little
internal sleeve that just fits on real
easy and then it goes into this part of
the case so obviously you're not gonna
want to leave the secondary part of the
case on all the time it's got like this
mirror jumping out of it here probably
gonna stab you in the pocket Jackie you
see what happens here watch when I slide
over it focus on that part right there
see that so now you see the lens in the
mirror so it's obviously functioning at
that point whoa that is weird
it's also upside down so I guess what do
you have to flip it after so I suppose
in this moment nobody knows I'm snapping
a spy photo I guess if you get the app
it automatically flips it back okay yes
so the app actually does the flip for
you
boom spy photo and you never even knew
it I'm just kind of like I'm just
chilling my oh hey how's it going nice
to meet you I just took your photo it's
a fun novelty to be honest with you I
think it's more like maybe you catch a
friend picking his nose or something
then he probably deserves it how about
like some hidden cameras stuff for you
getting
the terrible customer service at a place
someone's yelling at you because it
works for video 2 there are a lot of
lose you're seeing loo then reflected
loo then monitor version of loo it's too
much loo and you can also flip to your
selfie camera because maybe during your
spy camming you just need to I don't
know I mean you don't have to be a
pervert do you like I said before maybe
you're an investigative reporter there's
a lot of reasons you might need to be
sneaky even if you're doing the right
thing so let's consider that you heard
it here first
unbox therapy no pervert zone unless of
course you're perverted for technology
and gadgets then full pervert zone all
the time I don't know let's pour a
little water in here now what happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
