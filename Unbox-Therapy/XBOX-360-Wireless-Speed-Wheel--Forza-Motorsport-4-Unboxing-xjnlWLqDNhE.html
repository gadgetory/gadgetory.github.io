therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Xbox 360 wireless speed wheel now
this package that I've got in front of
me also includes Forza Motorsport 4 and
to me this represents a better value
than just getting the speed wheel on its
own the package is 99 bucks and the
speed wheel I believe on its own retails
for 69 so they throw the game in for 30
bucks and let's be honest if you're
going to buy this speed will you're
probably going to use it with Forza so
why not get the two of them together a
perfect little bundle for the holiday
season am i right but let's talk about
the unboxing after all this is unbox
therapy where products get naked you
guys know how it goes on this channel
and as you'll notice the biggest item in
the box is obviously the speed wheel I'm
not going to talk about that right away
instead I'll make you wait and build the
suspense just going to put it down for a
second and talk about the other
inclusions to the left you'll notice the
accessories box now I'm not really sure
what's in here it's kind of like Fort
Knox this thing is fortified it seems
like too much box for what might be
included inside of here but let's go
ahead get inside and take a look at
everything else you need to get this
baby up and running and once you get
inside here you'll notice it's just a
couple of batteries kind of
anticlimactic but you need the batteries
to get up and running and I do
appreciate Microsoft including them
because you know what it would be like
on Christmas morning to have this baby
sitting under the tree then you got to
go track down some dira cells and you
can't use it you're going to be upset so
we got a little bit of paperwork in a
number of different languages you're
probably not going to need to read this
it's a matter of just inserting the
batteries and stick in a game in the
drive here's the game a regular copy of
Forza Motorsport 4 although it does say
not for resale of course it says that
you can use this wheel without Kinect
although the game will apparently be
improved with Kinect so out the way you
can see how that pans out and just how
important it is to use Kinect or not or
if there is really any difference now I
do have to say this thing feels nice and
solid I do appreciate Microsoft hardware
I think they always find that right wait
you know it's not too heavy not too
light you got the nice chrome accents
all over the place here nice fat
triggers on the backside so let's go
ahead and get you
up close and personal with the device so
you can find out you know what it's all
about the centered little ring here has
a circular design to it you've got of
course your Xbox button in the center
you've got your back button start button
etc and everything else is sort of
regular Xbox style you know and then on
the front side you've got your what I
think our sensors I'm pretty sure those
are the sensors that determine the
location of the controller in space and
time and as I mentioned before nice fat
triggers a cool Xbox 360 insignia
they're what I believe is a connect
button there and below that the last
button here controls your battery drive
battery bay here and you'll notice it
pops up real cool a nice cool mechanism
there for inserting your doublea's
hopefully you don't have to be inserting
new ones too often you know I hope they
last a little while who knows how much
you juice this baby's gonna suck so
anyways as I mentioned I'm really
impressed with this I think Microsoft
does a great job on hardware and once
again they pulled it off in this case
gotta wait and see how it pans out as
far as play is concerned anyway guys if
you enjoyed this unboxing then hopefully
you can like and favorite this video as
it does help me out a bunch I got a lot
of unboxings planned including that gift
guide that you guys requested big demand
for that kind of video so I'm going to
get to that as soon as I can and if you
