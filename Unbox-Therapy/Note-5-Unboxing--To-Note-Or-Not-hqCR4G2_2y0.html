Jack even you guys doing it makes me
feel better what's up guys Lew here back
with another video and today we're going
to be checking out the newly released
samsung galaxy note 5 the latest
incarnation of the note is that is that
a word incarnation that right jack the
latest incarnation my phone just went
off good the new note obviously a lot of
changes here from the previous version
just like the s6 we now have glass and
aluminum and prettiness in general as
well as improved specs as you would
expect specs that you would expect so
let's go ahead jump inside the box and
see what this baby is all about this is
the 32 gigabyte model in the black
sapphire color it's all wrapped up and
protected as you can tell I'm gonna put
that to the side for a moment Quick
Start Guide a sim tool pretty
self-explanatory headphones these
headphones appear to be an in-ear style
with adjustable tips a microUSB cable of
course for recharging the device and
you're going to have the fast adaptive
charging and then lastly because this is
a note we have this little tool for
swapping out the tips of the s-pen if
you wear down that little nub you've got
some extra nubs little gentle curve
around the edge now I think the curve on
the back actually makes more sense than
the curve on the front because well
that's sort of the way the human hand
works a little bit slippery of course it
has a glass back so you could expect
that you could put a skin on here from
my good friends at D brand skins you
know about them if you don't check them
out I'll drop a link in the description
in the back here you have the 16
megapixel camera one of the best in the
business as you know you've probably
seen samples your flashes in this
location here and the forward facing
camera is a 5 megapixel shooter on the
front of the device we have their new
fingerprint scanner sensor sensor or
scanner your choice fingerprint scanner
sensor course capacitive buttons as well
you
back button and your menu button over on
this side here aluminum around the
entire frame I really want to peel this
sticker off on the back let me do that
there how much better is that so this
black sapphire in certain light it
almost looks blue and then you flip it a
little more and it looks black so it's
got a color-changing characteristic to
it but it does come in other colors as
well you can get it in white silver and
a new shimmery gold type look those of
you out there that are all about the
bling so let's go ahead and boot up the
device why not this screen that's really
one of the major things to consider it's
what you look at we have a giant 5.7
inch display you have qHD resolution
Super AMOLED so you know what that does
for your screen it essentially gives you
the deepest blacks in the business let's
set it up tap and go
I'm not going to tap and go right now
but tap and go pretty cool you know what
let's try the fingerprint sensor real
quick day so there success it has a
hundred percent of my fingerprint and
now you need a backup password in case
you lose your finger no smirk so we are
now in the operating system here and you
can start to appreciate that display we
have an experience very similar to the
s6 we're adding of course the s-pen in
this situation there's some new software
features as well in the camera something
I was excited for the live broadcast
mode which I'm going to be messing
around with pretty soon this is a
one-click live broadcast to your YouTube
channel
the idea of quickly broadcasting
something live breaking news that's kind
of interesting so I'm going to be
messing around with that feature
specifically also the video collage mode
is new you could do for separate clips
which is pretty cool I'll show you that
real quick hit the button now that's
going to record for three seconds that
frame okay cool focus over here on AJ
and we're going to do three sex you know
it's a video right yeah you could be
more exciting though I'll have to spin
this baby around like that and now you
get my face in the video collage and
then for the last frame why don't we
zoom in on this wonderful monitor right
here and do three seconds of that you
end up with this cool little collage of
all four video frames the cool thing
here is that you can actually mix the
audio so you can either choose the video
sound partially completely or not at all
and you can insert background music we
also have a couple new features for the
s-pen as well customized air command put
your favorite shortcuts here in this
location there's a new type of screen
capture I'll do a demo of that really
quickly and you know something typing
with this pen there's something
satisfying about it the precision I mean
your finger just can't really do that
things really do change with the pen and
you heard it here first I'm going to
commit to the pen for a little bit and
see if it can become a part of my daily
phone lifestyle is this
obsessive-compulsive for me to be so
satisfied by this I hope not rather than
a standard screen capture you can see
that it snaps the original screen cap
but then you have options so this page
happens to be scrollable so I can click
on scroll capture and then booyah it
moves down the page and continues to
capture what I'm looking at another new
feature extract the pen without
unlocking the phone and I can write a
memo immediately right here
now let's go ahead and finish off with
the physical device we have our microUSB
on the bottom the speakers in that
location as well your headphone jack is
there to the s-pen lives in this corner
you can see the antenna cutouts around
the outside of the aluminum frame volume
buttons are on the left hand side of the
device power switch is sort of right
where your thumb in your prominent hand
will live then on the top you have SIM
card slot you'll need to use that tool
of course and on the front of the device
you have your sensors in this location
the earpiece the forward facing camera
which I mentioned before so there you
have it in unboxing an overview of the
new note 5 I think the big thing here
for me the big question is going to be
whether I can make the s-pen a part of
my daily routine it's time for a new
daily driver and let's find out how I
feel about that thanks very much for
