therapy and today we've got Dead Island
this is a one player game but it's also
got network multiplayer and a 1080p
native resolution real excited to jump
in here and kick some zombie rear end if
you know what I'm saying now this is a
special edition because it was
pre-ordered from Game Stop I believe it
was the only way to get it and it didn't
cost anything extra besides your
pre-order now there aren't any external
extras all the extras are DLC now as you
look at the disc here you can see some
nice artwork with a real pretty looking
dude on there and there's that DLC
pamphlet you can see a weapon that's
gonna be part of it
baseball bat with a buzzsaw attached
ready for some bloodshed so to speak so
the only other thing that's inside of
here is the user manual and as you guys
can see on front of there it's a 17 plus
and it's distributed by Deep Silver and
the reason it's 17 plus is because it
dudes like this once you let the blood
fly children anal laughs anyway he's on
the inside we can get a better idea some
of the other dudes you might face we got
the RAM the butcher and the suicide are
real pretty fellas so as I said this is
about the DLC you get the bloodbath
arena which is a $10 value is gonna be
on sale later to everyone else you can
play in there either multiplayer or buy
yourself a number of different scenarios
and you also get the Ripper which is the
extra weapon it's a baseball bat
combined with a buzzsaw and let me tell
you that equals a deadly and bloody
combination anyways this was a quick
unboxing if you enjoyed it hopefully you
can like and favorite this video
it helps me do what I do and until next
time guys thanks for watching oh one
more thing I'm gonna announce the winner
to that giveaway a little bit later
today so stay tuned to the channel
thanks again guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
