MacBook Pro for a while the
controversial USB type-c only MacBook
Pro and there's been a number of
remedies for the situation products that
have emerged
Hubbs docks dongles there I say dongles
but today I've got something different
maybe the best solution today maybe not
I mean that's the point of this video
I'm gonna try this thing out it's called
the dock case for the 15-inch MacBook
Pro pack your MacBook and all the
missing ports into the dock case so it's
a case and a dock in one as you can see
from the package it's gonna give you an
Ethernet port an HDMI a couple of type-c
connectors including what looks like the
thunderbolt connection pass-through then
you have three traditional USB 3.0 ports
an SD card slot and a micro SD card so I
mean that's pretty cool if that's what
that is and you can kind of tell from
the side of the box here it's a very
slender case now you're gonna have to
have a case for your laptop anyways so
why not get some ports along with it
after all you're probably missing them
on the new macbook pro or maybe you're
not maybe you're a one cable kind of guy
who knows maybe this device here can
convince you to take the dive into the
new MacBook I know a lot of people are
hesitant if you came from the old
generation MacBook Pro you had access to
pretty much all of this ooh alright so
far so good this is the dock case whoa
is this little fake leather was hoping
for genuine but you know you could tell
from that smell this is probably an
artificial leather no big deal the
vegans in the crowd can rejoice in fact
oh look at that it's a beta version we
sincerely invite you to review this
product constructive feedback will be
delivered to our product team and
reflected to the next upgraded version
thank you Wow okay so they're looking
for the for the feedback a nice texture
this part flips open magnets and then
the laptop will go inside of here this
is just a placeholder and then on this
side look at all the ports Ethernet HDMI
type-c USB 3 and yes
that is a microSD card slot and a full
size SD card slot cool also in the box
it looks like we have a type seat table
it's important you use the right one
here because I've been using my macbook
pro with various accessories and
monitors and realizing that not all of
these cables are created equal so when
you go out to like an HDMI for example
to to certain displays some type C
cables are just not functioning the way
that I expected other's work seamlessly
I'm assuming this one is in the same
boat since they've included it along
with this hub so what you're gonna do is
remove your laptop from the case and
then plug it in to the hub like this now
you have access to all of these extra
ports right here let's just make sure
I'm doing this right
that makes sense okay so so that is a
USB type-c input the HDMI output is
capable of 4k and the 3.1 data speed up
to five gigabits per second I see how
they've done this so the MacBook Pro
sits on top of the case when it's not in
use that's what it's gonna look like
there when it's fully functional and
using all the ports I'm starting to
really like this thing this guy sits on
top I put the lid up I'm using the
laptop plug in my USB type-c pull it
around like this and then check that out
now my laptop has been expanded with an
object the size of something I'd be
carrying around to begin with I really
like the touch of micro sd because you
don't see that even on the old-school
MacBook you would need the adapter and
you can also see an indicator light here
so that shows you that you have power
going to the hub itself so just like
this it's like a portfolio pull it out
spin it around kaboom there's gonna be
people in the audience saying why don't
we just have all those ports on on the
laptop to begin with we'll listen we're
not going back to that world whether you
like it or not that ship has sailed and
of course as you know if you head to the
Apple store you're you're spending like
$30 per dongle on my desk up until this
point I've been using a little device
from a company called hutu I had to go
out and get it almost immediately after
getting the new MacBook just because of
the other peripherals that were lying
around the office that I still had to
you
let me tell you about a little story
something that happened to me on one of
my previous trips to CES in Las Vegas
it's just a barrel of excitement this
one here I'm out there I'm hanging out
I've got a great hotel but the Wi-Fi its
shoddy it's terrible I want to connect
directly to the wired connection to
avoid the Wi-Fi that everybody in the
entire hotel is on this is all a bunch
of tech savvy people and journalists
from all over the world so I have to
head out to the Apple Store even with
the previous generation MacBook to look
for a dongle just to get Ethernet
ethernet that's this one right here so a
lot of times you don't necessarily know
when or why you're gonna need one of
these ports that's two worlds colliding
that makes me feel very warm and fuzzy
inside so let's just do a quick little
test make sure this thing is working
correctly I'm gonna insert a micro SD it
clicks in with a spring we also have a
USB thumb drive ooh this is that fancy
one that came with the $20,000
smartphone jack if these people haven't
seen that video now that's a video a
twenty thousand dollar Android smart
alone this came with that go check that
out
Conor McGregor he needs one of these
okay so I'll slide this one in there
look at that we have a thumb drive we
have a micro SD and if I okay so it's
connected up so I just want to be clear
on something here if you want to charge
the macbook while you're using it
there's a specific power delivery port
as you can see there it's the first of
the two type-c connectors and that will
still connect to your power brick and
that will act as a pass-through
for power to your laptops all right so I
have the USB thumb drive connected and
the micro SD plugged in as well the two
devices are both mounted they open up
perfectly fine it works oh by the way in
case you're wondering what I've got on
top of my macbook pro here that is a
skin from D brand it's got the leather
look maybe the MacBook it makes a
comeback right here maybe you're
interested now maybe not something worth
noting is the fact that the device gets
longer right so this entire portion down
here is the
Electronics associated with the dock
your laptop in the sleeve is about an
inch taller than it would have been
without that also it feels like this is
mostly made of plastic have a little bit
of a tinny kind of sound to it either
way I think this is a very cool device I
think it's gonna solve some problems for
new MacBook Pro users it's unusual that
I bump into something like this it's
simple but so obviously functional I
think this one is a win right here</div></body></html>
