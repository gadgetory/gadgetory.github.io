how deep was it what's up guys Lew here
back with another video and today I've
got something I'm very excited for and I
know
you are very excited for too because
this is probably the most the single
most requested item in unbox therapy
history this is the four dollar
smartphone Android smartphones running
Android has a touchscreen it's four
dollars all right let that sink in for a
minute when this thing got announced I
had my twitter blowing up it's probably
still blowing up people are saying Lou
get the $4 oh we want to see the four
dollar phone is it real is it vapor does
it exist this four dollar phone
situation is a little bit complicated
because it turns out that the group's
selling the four dollar phone was
actually just rebranding a phone from
somebody else and in some cases
reportedly using wite-out to switch the
brand name are you kidding me this is
the original this is the knockoff that
got knocked off anyways these things are
fresh in from India and we're about to
find out what the hell of four dollar
phone does I have two of them maybe win
one of these I guess I'll give one away
I guess I don't know Twitter follow me
on Twitter I'll let you know more there
addcom more than expect not expected
expect and it starts with an X do not
accept it the rest is sticker this cover
Izu it says if it's damaged or something
well anyhow advantage computers India
Kirti Nagar industrial area New Delhi
well done runs android 5.1 lollipop
four-inch touchscreen gig of ram 5
megapixel rear camera
it all seems too good to be true dual
SIM card slot alright enough about the
box let's
do the damn thing oh I don't even know
how you get how you get a box like a box
like this on its own for four dollars
them here is the phone okay I mean it
kind of feels like a toy
we kind of feels like a maybe like a
small iPhone sort of one thing I kind of
like right now is the texture on the
back of the device let's see if it has
any battery life or is the battery even
inside of it hold up
probably have to install it you do ships
with no battery inside look at this
extra screen protector some headphones
micro USB European power brick how about
the accessories so the battery not huge
1500 milliamp hours ready there we go
okay the dual SIM card tray is now
you're probably wondering why would
there be dual SIM card trays I'm not
complaining about it but in certain
places
typically emerging markets this is a
feature that's in high demand for
various reasons you can actually keep
two phone numbers in here so that's a
feature we don't even see on a lot of
premium phones also micro SD card slot
for storage expansion pretty surprising
how's it brought so I'm guessing this is
not a fingerprint scanner down here I
think there's a pen market like somebody
drew with pen on the inside of there
look at that fairly quick it's got a bit
of an iOS type of vibe skin to it you
see the browser looks like a safari logo
the touch screen it's got this weird
vibe where it's recessed quite a bit
from from the actual surface that would
be good
Wow you know what pretty snappy there I
say for something that is the cost of a
toy I mean I've heard probably worse
speakers on phones that cost a hundred
times more than this it'd be true if you
can find this thing for $4 I just don't
understand how you can compare it to
what else is out there because I mean
you could you could drop this thing in a
lake and not even be bothered
I mean you paid more for your lunch but
could I ask for more I don't know I mean
it's not a galaxy s7 screen that's for
damn sure but it's getting the job done
I'm watching unbox therapy right now
this is where things are gonna get a
little sketchy though in the camera
probably I'll say once again better than
I expected
so that looks more like a painting than
a phone than a photograph I know it's
more complicated because you got this
wacko rebranding whiteout on the name
addcom for the company that's selling
this exact phone for four dollars so who
knows what kind of sketchy business is
going on I mean I'm not saying that
there is but I'm not saying that there's
not how they're able to actually offer
something like this for four dollars
because Jack can't even have a good time
for four dollars trust me he's tried I
gotta say if you need a phone and you're
short for cash I'm gonna recommend it go
get yourself a four dollar phone it's
amazing you're on your phone and you're
shooting 4k I remember
when 4k was just a dream and I used to
