another video and today we're going to
be talking in depth about the Google
cardboard VR headset or VR cardboard
cut-out
that uses your phone to create a headset
does that make any sense
anyways I recently made a reaction video
in which I gave this contraption to a
number of individuals who you might
recognize and I got some amazing
reactions so if you haven't seen that
video yet you should definitely go and
check it out but this one is dedicated
to telling you and showing you how this
seemingly boring piece of cardboard can
turn your phone into a state-of-the-art
virtual reality headset so it all starts
with this cutout this cardboard cutout
that you construct into what you see
here now you can actually make this on
your own using plans via the cardboard
website so you don't need to purchase
one of these just get your hands on some
cardboard use the plans and you can make
it yourself or you can buy a
pre-configured cutout via Amazon if you
want something that's a little bit more
streamlined and closer to a finished
product it's about ten dollars and I'll
link that down in the description this
is an interesting portion here it's NFC
and it will act as a launch point for
the official cardboard application which
has a bunch of demos in it that allow
for you to actually enjoy a virtual
reality experience not a hundred percent
necessary because you can always launch
the cardboard app yourself place your
phone down in this section right here
you'll notice that the lenses are set
back from where your phone is going to
sit on this surface that of course is
measured perfectly so that you can
absorb each of the two frames that are
created on your smartphone the virtual
reality effect is then achieved through
head tracking and since your phone is
strapped to your face essentially
through this design the phone becomes
part of your head and the consequence of
that is that the accelerometer and gyro
dthat exist in the phone already we'll
do all of the head tracking necessary so
that you can interact with your
environment and subsequently have that
you'll reality experience so this metal
ring here has a corresponding magnet on
the other side and as you'll notice I
can pull it away but then it springs
back to its original location after I
let go that's of course where the magnet
exists on the other side now at first I
was scratching my head trying to figure
out exactly how this would equate to a
click or a press your traditional
smartphone it turns out it's actually a
pretty nifty piece of technology the
phone is able to sense magnetic changes
caused by the ring magnet combo using
the phone's magnetometer which is
generally used for compass functionality
so that's a cool implementation of some
old-school technology in some brand new
tech not only does this thing have
cardboard it's also got magnets which
are super old tech and in this case
being used in a way that you wouldn't
normally expect so in order to use this
device you will obviously need a smart
phone as I mentioned earlier that's not
such a big deal though at this point
many people almost everyone has a smart
phone already so it makes a lot of sense
to harness the processing capabilities
that already exist in your phone and
then attach them to a headset like this
so that you can have this VR experience
with a limited investment using it is
dead simple you just drop your phone
down here flip this up and then on the
inside here is where you will then see
each of the two frames which are going
to give you that VR experience so what
does this all result in how about the
ability to tour cities and spaces in
near real life capacity you can play
interactive games have immersive viewing
experiences of video content or like in
the cardboard app YouTube videos where
you have independent videos placed in
different locations relative to your
head and you can select videos just by
moving your neck a little bit a plus you
have this really immersive experience as
a result in which you feel like you're
looking at a hundred inch display or
bigger feels like you're in a movie
theater to be honest with you even
though you're viewing on a five inch
device at this point cardboard to me
looks like a very big
in the world of VR not because it's any
better or different than the core of
other VR headsets but because of the
cost and simplicity the near zero dollar
upfront cost of experimenting with
cardboard means bringing plenty of
development and new imagination into the
VR space at this point cardboard looks
to me like an accelerant gasoline to the
virtual reality bonfire which is set to
burn down convention in both
entertainment information consumption
and quite frankly the way that we
interact with the world as a whole so it
looks like we're finally going to get
that sci-fi future that we were all
promised or maybe on a deeper level this
is proof that we're already there if VR
experiences are already this good where
will they be in a hundred years is all
of this potentially a very beautiful
rendering of some virtual reality
remember that whole red pill blue pill
