hotel room right now I wanted to give
you guys a quick breakdown on all the
different tech and gadgets that got
brought on the trip in order to help us
cover CES so I'm going to give you a
quick look also a look at the hotel room
that I have somewhat managed to destroy
already or at least make a mess of
there's a couple of cameras on the trip
the one that I'm shooting with right now
which is the HX 9v the Sony you can also
see the s100 down here took some photos
with that yesterday the 60d that I
normally shoot my unboxing videos with
and there's also an older d200 up along
the top for still photos etc we got a
couple of zoom h1 s for audio stuff
these little zag what is this called the
spark to point o their battery backups
but they're huge here's this one
yesterday I had this thing basically
running the verizon hotspot for most of
the day pretty crazy stuff but as you
can see lots of stuff over here we got
some Pelican cases for the point and
shoots you can see I brought my Marshall
headphones also got the tenba camera bag
over here actually really liked it
because it can also fit a laptop in as
well as all your camera gear so put the
macbook pro up in their Trek pod is a
cool magnetic system for it's like a
monopod that can also sort of behave
like a tripod pretty cool product and
then yesterday actually at the unveiled
show they were handing out some of these
case-mate cases we picked up three of
them they're kind of like an otterbox
style give you guys a better look at
those pretty soon this is a look around
the hotel room you can see we got a mic
over here he's surfing the couch right
now and he's got his macbook pro go and
he's doing lots of research look at all
this paperwork here all the different
products to check out that are going to
be checked out at CES the convention
doesn't officially open up until
tomorrow so we're kind of just getting
ready and whatnot we also got AJ over
here doing some work pretending he's
doing work and you can see we got the
view we got the desert view it says I
believe this is looking southwest we
thought you can see some some hills or
all those mountains I guess their
mountains often off in the distance
there and that's the Palms Hotel over
there we're staying in the Rio it's
actually a pretty big room I think it's
like maybe 600 square feet or something
like that but you can see to get the
uh what are those two queen-size beds
and then over here this area over here
you got a fairly big washroom area I'm
not gonna meet I'm not gonna take you
too much further than that but but
anyways yes so we're just getting
everything covered and you know I wanted
to get some content out to you guys some
more content and we were at CES unveiled
yesterday which is like sort of like a
press preview and in a quick second here
I'm gonna go back on my computer and
give you guys some of the pictures and
stuff I'm going to cut away to it and
then I'll continue speaking over top of
them tell you some of the stuff that we
saw give me a quick second all right so
yesterday was obviously crazy at this
CES unveiled show there were thousands
of people there may be two three
thousand people not as crazy as the real
show but this one's got free drinks and
free food I was sticking to heineken all
night but you could get anything mix
drinks it was crazy and people were all
over the food like scavengers free food
I mean people go nuts for it there's
actually this cool device though there
were obviously gadgets there this was a
phone that you can hook your iPhone and
iPad up to which it turns it into a
traditional phone / speaker phone we
also got to look at the parrot ar.drone
the new version which has an HD camera
built-in Android compatibility of course
some real cool stuff let me know if you
guys want to see me fly one of these
babies around on the channel and unbox
it we also looked at the power bag and
this is kind of like a battery backup
built into a bag which can charge all
your different devices has a number of
adapters and whatnot built in the guy
from ion audio was also really cool he
had a number of devices to interface
with either your iPad or iPhone he had a
guitar an iPad guitar that happened to
be getting a lot of attention yesterday
and then of course you had the nest
thermostat which is sold out everywhere
it's a really intuitive thermostat hard
to be excited about a thermostat but it
was designed by the original ipod
designer so a really cool kind of
interface on it and supposed to be
intelligent energy efficient etc so
anyway guys this was just been a quick
overview of what CES unveiled was all
about it's just kind of like a little
taste of what's to come at the proper
CES event at the convention center which
will be coming up next and starting
tomorrow so stay tuned for all of the
other gadgets and probably many more
that you'll be
interested in anyone guys I want to
thank you for watching as always and
I'll catch you on the next one later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
