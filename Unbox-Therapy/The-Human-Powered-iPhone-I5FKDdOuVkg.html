another video but before we jump into it
I want to mention a project that I
worked on an unboxing video which is the
biggest unboxing I've ever done it took
place on another channel so click the
link in the description to go check that
out kind of mysterious very exciting
after you're done watching this video go
watch that one this is a cool
contraption called amp where what it
does is it gives you emergency backup
power but the twist here is it's not in
the way you would expect it this case
instead of just being rechargeable like
any other battery case has a crank in it
a hand crank look at that look at that
human power human generated power two
minutes of cranking will allow for an
emergency call from a dead battery
according to them and ten minutes of
cranking up to two hours of regular use
I wonder why the cables removable oh
it's probably interchangeable you could
probably do a micro USB or a lightning
connector depending on your device
anyway what was I saying I was saying uh
one thing that you can be fairly certain
you're always going to have access to is
your body and your movements the
apocalypse could happen zombies
everywhere jack could turn into some
kind of savage you've always got power
as long as you got your little crank in
your arm that's cool there is the chance
that cell towers could go down as well
in this event but you're just trying to
have as many options as possible so
hopefully they stay up on board
generator one thousand milliamp output
crank arm which doubles as a kickstand
that's cool all right how does that work
oh right of course I have an iPhone 6s
here with you guessed it a dead battery
slide this guy in
pull this out let's get going whoo
there's something kind of satisfying
about that whoo okay that's two minutes
hmm maybe you got to be real speedy like
this
it's like charging a little bit
triggering the like boot sequence and
then once it's plugged in he tries to
boot but then it's not getting
consistent power because I'm so this is
a predicament right now oh look there's
a green light yes do you see that if
you're spinning fast enough I think that
green light illuminates see it bit of a
workout here
I'm so funny it's like the least
high-tech thing interacting with the
most high high tech thing I'm getting
messages now I think I got it five
percent I got to keep it going
this should be powered off because the
screens going to be keep flipping on and
using juice as you're spinning I gotta
just like bear down and spin this
goddamn thing for ten minutes
still at 5% tries to boot up right away
because it thinks it's connected to the
wall
holy hand cramping I think I'm getting a
bit of a rhythm oh man my hands are sore
holy four percent up to five again 4 to
5 5 y is 5 the peak like it goes
straight to 5 and then nothing else it's
not like a frequent rate of improvement
if you're in prison you know these guys
who escaped from Alcatraz or what like
they they were just for months carving
away at the wall with a spoon now I'm
down to 4% I gotta just get into like
some kind of Zen mode for
3% 3% listen as the last second backup
to get from nothing to something to make
a phone call single phone call okay fine
but like as a way to get your phone up
and running or getting it to a hundred
percent you can get out of my face with
that idea please not you jack whoa it's
not even fair</div></body></html>
