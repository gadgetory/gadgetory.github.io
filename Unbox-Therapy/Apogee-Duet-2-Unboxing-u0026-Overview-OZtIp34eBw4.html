therapy and today we're taking a look at
the duet 2 from Apogee if you're
unfamiliar with that brand or this
product what you're looking at is a two
in four out USB audio interface but this
is a very high quality one it will take
your microphone signal like the one I'm
talking into right now or an instrument
signal and turn it into a high quality
professional digital recording that you
can use for music or for voiceovers or
for pretty much anything you would use
audio on the internet or on your
computer for it's also very portable you
can take your studio with you and part
of that reason is because it uses a
breakout cable for all your connectivity
the breakout cable features XLR inputs
as well as traditional quarter-inch
inputs for things like electric guitars
or other instruments so it's actually
quite flexible most of your ports are on
the back of the device but there is a
headphone port on the front I'll give
you a closer look at those as we move
forward in this unboxing the very first
thing you'll notice when you open up
your duet 2 is just how substantial the
device is it's nice and hefty and it
feels very very sturdy underneath the
duet 2 is where you'll find all of the
other important components starting with
as mentioned earlier this breakout cable
this is what's going to allow you to
input all of your different devices you
have two XLR ports on your balanced
connectors as well as to traditional
quarter-inch connectors as well so
there's a little bit of flexibility
there you can in put microphones guitars
and a number of different devices that
output analog audio of course the
intention here is to turn that analog
audio into a very high quality recording
I've been a fan of Apogee devices for a
long long time in fact right now I'm
speaking into the Apogee one which
Believe It or Not was my very first
unboxing video but trust me you don't
want to go back and listen to that or
watch that video right now because it is
nowhere near the quality of my videos
right now at least in my opinion you've
also got this proprietary connector this
is what is going to connect this cable
to the actual duet 2 device if you're
interested in pricing and availability
on this interface make sure to check out
the description I will have a link down
there in terms of the unboxing you've
also got a USB cable that's important
that's how the inter
face talks to your laptop or desktop or
whatever computer you're going to be
using and the last item inside of the
box is your power adapter this is pretty
obvious what this is for although it
does include some international tips so
depending on where you are in the world
you're still going to be operational I'm
going to go ahead and install the North
American tip you've also got this little
velcro strap I assume this is for cable
management if you're not using some of
those other connectors you could
probably use this to keep it from
tangling here you can see an ad for an
accessory this is the breakout box for
this device I'm not going to go into too
much detail about that but it
essentially allows for you to have a
more permanent installation if you're
not using this thing portably lastly you
have the user manual and that's about it
besides the main device which I'll get
into right here one thing I do want to
mention at this point guys is I started
up a second channel it's called uncut
therapy kind of like unbox therapy but a
little bit different so if you want to
check it out and you want to check out
videos in there uncut unboxing format I
don't really know another way to
describe it then you can head over there
right now put a link down in the
description and you can take a look at
that it's really just for people who
want to see the raw footage the raw
unboxing footage as it is you have that
option now checking out my second
channel uncut therapy so there's a link
down below you can subscribe if you're
into that kind of stuff otherwise you
just keep watching over here no big deal
so anyways here's the device and as I
said earlier it's like this solid slab
of aluminum so it's really really sturdy
and it feels like a very high quality
component right at home beside a macbook
pro or something like that on the back
you could see your port for power the
proprietary IO port as well as the USB
port for transmitting data between of
course your device and your laptop or
desktop and then on the other side is
where you'll find your headphone
connector this is a quarter-inch
connector so if you've got a standard
set of headphones with a 3.5 million II
Dan adapter in order to take advantage
of that but if you've got like pro gear
Pro headphones and they very well might
have a quarter inch connector natively
anyway guys that wraps up this unboxing
video if you enjoyed it please remember
to leave a thumbs up down below thanks
as always for watching and I'll catch
you on the next one later</div></body></html>
