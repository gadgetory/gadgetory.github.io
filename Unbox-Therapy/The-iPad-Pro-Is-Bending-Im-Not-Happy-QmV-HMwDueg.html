because this is a serious show you know
that is it though really so I pretty
much just read an article on Macworld
thing that iPads are bending yes I've
heard about this I got the tweets the
people they reached out you may or may
not know the whole bending of Apple
products bendgate people want me to
weigh in a lot of people requesting that
I talk about this yeah it's a touchy
subject do you have any thoughts well no
one wants bent anything no I don't know
if that's true and maybe there's some
things that it always comes back to this
conversation of like how big of a deal
is it mm-hmm
is it catastrophic how many devices does
it affect it's the same kind of
conversation that happened back in a day
when your original iPhone bent the
iPhone 6 the thing I like to talk about
from this end of the spectrum I'm not a
brand I am NOT Apple so I'm always gonna
advocate for the people if you are
someone who's affected by this I think
you have a point it should be fixed it's
not an ideal scenario and in the case of
the original iPhone that bent Apple went
back to the drawing board and switched
their materials because they knew
something was wrong even though they
didn't necessarily admit to it publicly
can they do that in this case I don't
actually know the makeup of the alloy
being used in the iPad what I do know is
that it's impossibly slim like that
thing is crazy thin is mine bent I don't
think so maybe I don't know yeah you
would probably have to use like a level
yeah you probably have to use a level
that oh how durable is anything that's
this thin like the of course there's a
common sense component and that's always
what the Apple fans get angry about
they're like who's bending your bending
why are you bending your stuff you're
just not taking care of it kind of thing
what I've been reading online is the
biggest culprit
to these types of bends in the case of
the iPad is putting it in a backpack so
some of the individuals apparently they
put the devices into a backpack in the
textbooks another weight that you would
typically have in a backpack was leaning
up against it and then they end up with
a bent iPad that's a regular use case
scenario you should be able to do that
without having a pen
I got it I don't know about you would
you agree yeah I can imagine you know
being late for class or something and
then you just stuff your textbooks and
iPads and your in your bag it's pretty
normal but the fact that they you know
are bending just like that it's it
doesn't make you feel comfy with your
new product your new thousand dollars
absolutely not the other point to make
is I was reading some of the responses
some of the follow-up from Apple it's a
bit confusing because I know the verge
reported that they had an official Apple
response but then Apple was like that's
not our official response anyhow there
was this guy in engineer or whoever he
was he was responding to some email
requests regarding the bending from
customers and he stated that this is
that this device is designed to their
specification if it's a little bit bent
no big deal keep using it it's a
manufacturing thing it'll stay as bent
as it is now that's weird
that response is probably more weird
than the actual bending because here you
have the biggest consumer electronics
company coming out and saying a little
bit of a bend no big deal
even if it's out of the box when you buy
it that's unusual yeah I mean in their
unofficial statement saying you know
these iPads are either a not bent or B
supposed to be bent yeah by design
yarder the cooling process it's hard to
figure out where to land on it of course
when I made that original video it was a
big it's still the most popular video
that I posted I think it has 70 million
views on it a follow-up to that story
that many people didn't necessarily
catch up on was the fact that further
problems on the iPhone 6 this touch
disease problem that crept up later was
a consequence of these slight bends so
for people who were thinking that it was
strictly aesthetic at the time it went
on to have this further issue with these
phantom touches taking place on the
display because it screwed up the
digitizer when it had that slight bend
in it yeah but that didn't happen for
like a year or two afterwards so people
that thought they were they were safe
out of the woodwork went went on to
acquire different problems eventually
from that issue and Apple went on to
replace many devices under a repair
program B
Casas said touch disease in the case of
the iPad it might not even be a thing
where you realize the extent of the
damage immediately but there may be
other issues that creep up because of
these slight bends in in the frame over
time mm-hmm it might not be strictly
aesthetic but like a lot of these things
that generate a ton of hype and as you
know new Apple product comes out it's a
whole experience it's a whole thing cuz
Apple is already doing a good job of
telling you why you need it so you're
trying to find out well okay that's cool
but maybe why not show me the why not
and that's what people depend on this
type of content for so when I saw the
video online where the iPad was bent in
half really easily of course I'm not
bending things anymore mm-hmm you can
attest to that
yeah I've moved on look take a look
around I moved on but I think we're at a
point now where these devices are
shrinking down so much that it's kind of
inevitable they're not going to be as
tough because we demand thinness
we demand lightweight lightweight mm
thin powerful yeah beautiful we want it
all and we never want to pay the price
with a bent anything yeah but with this
iPad I mean it's 800 bucks it's
expensive the problem is that a lot of
people are seeing iPads that are bent
when they just first open it yeah yeah I
mean out of the box it's no fun that
that part of the experience and
relationship that you have with a
product is so important so it's
obviously no fun especially an Apple
product especially an Apple product
fresh box sleek design and so on I'm
actually gonna be a little bit
optimistic on this one I know right now
some people are having issues getting
their units replaced
I think Apple's gonna do the right thing
I think if that's your iPad the one in
that picture yeah I think they're
probably gonna replace it for you I
think they should Apple if you're
watching just just replace the bent one
yeah at least hundreds of unofficial
replace something do something about it
because that's that's no fun that's not
a happy customer obviously and your
Apple you have a few bucks laying around
there you go huh you know offshore
offshore cache and possibly go back to
the drawing board like they did with the
iPhone 6 maybe change some materials put
some reinforcements and hopefully we get
a better product that's the main thing
that's the main point
with these types of topics it's like
you're not just talking about it for the
for strictly the purpose of hype that's
helpful of course you want people to
watch the content that you make in the
stories that you're right but also
because uncovering things like this
actually leads to further development
and improvement of physical products the
ones that end up in your pocket like
happened with the 6s as a response to
the iPhone 6 so it's all good if you
like Apple it's good if you don't like
Apple it's good it's good to have this
kind of stuff out in the open
better iPads in the future regardless of
the bending and stuff and the fact that
it didn't replace a laptop for me it's
still an incredible achievement in this
product in a sense of how powerful it is
how wonderful the screen is in in a form
factor like this they did strive for a
good iPad I think that's what they did
here you know you know minus the bending
I don't think there's any other issues
with it right and I think a lot of
people maybe would use this maybe the
price yeah that's for sure but you know
if you're a college student and you know
it's either that or the laptop maybe
that's a good option does it in any way
stop you from recommending this device
possibly to a loved one a family member
a friend I would totally recommend it
for anyone who doesn't want to use a
laptop I think that's the best right
tablet that's out there right now well
let's be clear for a thousand bucks you
can tell people to get a laptop still I
know I am sure sure
it's a lot of money for a tablet for it
for an iPad yeah but it's the best
tablet I would have to say I'll say the
same for sure how does this end this
