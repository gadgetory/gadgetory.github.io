buy the iPhone 10 that was my conclusion
given the price but here's the thing
okay the iPhone in general crazy popular
far as like a single model of phone is
concerned it gets a lot of attention
from an accessory perspective so I
thought it'd be cool to sit down with a
few of the more unique accessories for
iPhone first things first I have
Olek SAR ex-ranger premium smartphone
case they make this one for the iPhone 7
8 7 plus 8 plus even the iPhone 10 this
is a 26 in one tool it includes side
knife a hex wrench a knife blade a cable
bender a letter opener a screwdriver
ruler cell phone stand bottle opener
screwdriver keyring old cable peel or
saw blade peel or can opener butterfly
wrench hex wrench that's 26 different
things you've probably seen these before
but the problem with putting a card tool
into your wallet is it's gonna chew it
up because of that they designed a case
that could house it this is the one for
the iPhone 7 and 8 to the version for
the 10 here also so there's this little
door on the back which flips open your
card tool slides in there like that and
then this closes down it also acts as a
stand if you're the kind of guy you want
to have a tool on you at all times
they've done it in such a fashion where
it just feels like a normal case this
will be the top link down below in the
description next up we have this year
meme now this one they don't just make
for iPhone there's an Android version of
this as well what this is is a charge
cable that actually backs up your device
you don't have to have your iCloud
turned on or any other type of cloud
backup service maybe you have some
pictures on your device that should
rather keep local you can see all your
saved data on the meme app contacts
calendar documents photos and videos all
your important stuff it's a quick type
of backup because it's local let's crack
this baby open
that's the cable right there this is
where all the important storage is gonna
be plugs in like that and all your data
is right in there this end will then
plug into your charger and you're good
to go
no it's 32 gigs of course which isn't a
ton you might have a phone that has more
storage than a so you could buy the
bigger version okay next up is a similar
concept but a little bit different this
is called the
leaf bridge if 64 gigabytes it does come
in other capacities as well and this is
just marketed as external storage for
your iPhone as you can see here it's
this little tiny device on one end
lightning connector and the other is a
USB connector this will pop into your
smartphone or into your computer or
other device with a USB port and allow
you to quickly transfer information
between the two it also comes with this
little keychain holder so you can always
have it with you you can capture photos
and videos directly to the bridge so
that's different than the previous cable
that I showed you so this one for me is
for people who just need some extra
storage in the first place aren't
necessarily worried about backing up to
the cloud or whatever but instead just
want another place for multimedia and
also who might want to avoid iTunes drop
some movies for example onto here
quickly and all of a sudden your iPad
and your iPhone has all that media
accessible to you in the fastest way
possible a couple of different solutions
storage is an issue for iPhone users
whether you have a new one or an old one
so there's a way around it alright last
up we have something called the stick
box this is obviously quite ambitious
the original patented mobile phone case
with a built-in selfie stick oh my
goodness drop protection 20 inch
extension panoramic rotation Bluetooth
enabled charging cable included cool
alright so you can activate the camera
from this end of the selfie stick and
charge this up in order to do so alright
let's check this thing out it's got some
weight to it let me tell you so the way
this works it seems is you reach here
and pull oh you pull out this door like
this oh okay
BAM holy rapid-fire selfie extravaganza
now how quickly can you let's see here
what happens you go oh that's pretty
quick here we are we got the iPhone 8
here it has connected to the Bluetooth
of the selfie case oh my goodness Hilley
do there is you see this moments like
this this is what this is for
in 382
look at that moment Willy do doesn't
that image just say it all there you go
a couple of different accessories for
your iPhone depending on which version
you're using as I said before some of
those accessories also available for
Android phones pretty unique some of
them are cool some more utilitarian
whereas others are a little bit more
ambitious we got the multi-tool the
backup cable we got the extra storage
and then don't forget the memory creator
the stick box I'm just gonna think about
this for a while you know this episode
of unboxing has been brought to you by
Cano this is the company that allows you
to build your very own computer or even
a laptop now this thing here is for ages
6 and up believe it or not a child can
do it it can be their entry point into
the realm of building their own tag
check this out it's got all your
different components the case the memory
card you put the light ring on line it
up on the pins we've got the USB ports
so there it is you're basically
encouraging the inquisitive mind how do
things work it's a set of components I
can build it I can put together the
hardware and I can start to play around
with the software as you can see here
this is what the interface looks like
there's various applications here to get
your child started with coding making
our simple games like pong you could
even have Minecraft on this thing if
there's somebody in your life that sort
of been showing an interest in the tech
space this could be an interesting gift
idea you can see we have this kit right
here it's been built it's got an HDMI
port on it so you can hook up to any
display it could be a monitor it could
be a television and the coolest part is
this little keyboard trackpad combo all
ready to go straight out of the box so
