another video and today I'm checking out
you know something that quite frankly I
like this of course is the idea of
adding buttons physical buttons to your
smartphone this is called press e the
almighty Android button now I did a
video a little while back about a
different kind of button I can't
remember the name right now but I'll
link it in the description you can go
check it out it's actually three buttons
that use NFC and stick to the back of
your device so you can quickly launch
into whatever you want with a physical
button this one takes a slightly
different approach it goes into the
headphone jack of your device it uses
the the data portion of that port to
trigger various things look at the
packaging very straightforward here but
the promise is so extravagant keep your
press e safe so there you go they even
thought about when you're not using the
press E you just have this little
adapter on your headphone cable that you
put it in that's it that's the little
guy Jack look at that look how cute is
that I don't use that word cute often
when I do it's very important that's
cute and then you pull out the button
itself and that's it it's like the end
of your headphones without the
headphones now there is an app there you
go I put the code in now take a look at
that jack it's ready to go
sit here so we're activated now practice
clicking short press to short presses
right three short presses oh my goodness
now it's telling me to add an action for
example tagging your flashlight all
right here we go give your action a name
choose a trigger and go for one press ok
and then I'm done by default it has
three actions baked in including
flashlight launch camera and toggle mute
flashlight is one press oh there we go
whoa that just happened it's actually a
satisfying little click there as well it
does take a second but there you have it
now camera is a double tap so let's do a
double tap real quick
hmm you have to be how fast you have to
be had to be pretty fast it's a quick
double tap Oh flashlight that time it's
a fast double tap like you've got to get
used to it this is gonna be the toughest
one a triple tap let's see here there
you go I got it now I feel like I'm
getting the hang of it you can see
toggle mute up there and then to get it
off getting a phone call here cheese
hello hello the toggle sound press he
requires access I see okay I got to give
it access here okay let's try this again
so let's say I'm watching a video real
quick okay medias all the way up so
we're muted right now do the old triple
tap oh that's interesting that's pausing
the video so if I'm in YouTube it's got
a different set of rules it's gonna
actually pause the video what the hell
is going on here I can't hear any
YouTube look so you can hear that you
know why because it thinks I have
headphones plugged in wait a second
you can't use your speakers that's what
happened with the phone call it thought
I had a headset plugged in wait a second
here it's like hacking the play/pause
button on your headphones we can do a
lot of cool stuff toggle a lot of cool
stuff here lock the screen rotation
toggle your your vibrator your bluetooth
I'm gonna try unplugging it okay
audio is working pause it plug this back
in is that press it yeah pressing press
II was pressed while being plugged in
please disconnect and connect it again
without pressing holy thing is
temperamental cool
still no audio SoundCloud nothing maybe
there'd be a setting for it to still
output the audio via speakers because
for me that's kind of a deal-breaker I
really feel it's a little bit half-baked
especially considering the other buttons
that I used again I can't remember the
name dimple I'm gonna link the video go
watch this video that stuff was seamless
seamless and it didn't hijack your
headphone jack hijack again the whole
like double triple press on this thing
yeah yeah I'm over it I'm over it it's
cool to use the headphone jack in that
way
appreciate the ambition but I think the
NFC buttons are actually the way to go
let's go check that out
there you have it there are a lot of
lose you're seeing Lou then reflected
Lou then monitor version of Lou it's too
much Lou</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
