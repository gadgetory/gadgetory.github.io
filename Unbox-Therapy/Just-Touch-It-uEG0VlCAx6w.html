another video and today I'm checking out
something that I've been looking for in
life for a very long time a simple easy
fast way to get quality images and video
off of one of these guys a DSLR and I
got on this camera gear here get like
got these kind of things lying around
and yet I'm like sizing it up with my
phone why just because it's easier to
share from there only thing holding back
snapping a quick frame with something of
a completely different caliber is
getting that data off well that is what
the cs100 from canon is meant to do they
got in touch with me they're like hey
Lou we got this thing called the connect
station it has the ability to send and
receive images it can do photos or
videos as NFC built in that's what I am
most excited for plus it's got one
terabyte of storage inside of it and
then at the same time this guy hooks up
to your television so you can actually
show people drop the camera on transfer
starts up booyah so power cable power
brick camera related unboxing videos
these are classic this is I came up on
this stuff little nighttime reading a
remote as well a little photo video DJ
jack you ever have anybody over you're
all invited Jack's house you've got this
directional pad button in the center
back menu home and power where you at oh
well then here's the NFC spot that's
where we're gonna tap and go see there's
a little door an SD card slot and even a
CF card slot on the back is all your i/o
you've got power HDMI there is a network
connector if you want to go hardwired
and then a USB port look at that the
device is now set up it's time for the
magic that I'm looking for NFC
touch to transfer just a little touch
magic moment when your lips close to man
oh whoa cool look at this just instantly
I didn't press anything I just enabled
Wi-Fi on the camera and then tapped it
well we're shooting a video backing it
up is step one like get it somewhere
else but people don't look at their own
photos that way you think that they're
safe because they're on this single SD
card
not even close that's the quickest
easiest way I've seen to just get them
get them off your camera okay look it's
done now new images received our images
folder over here and again you just be
sitting on the couch showing people
what's been going on with your life look
at that you're taking pictures of remote
controls this is what Jack looks like
you guys have been wondering what he
looks like that's what he looks like
he's a happy guy what can I say you can
play slideshows you can put music to
those slideshows you can go ahead and
and send these to social media directly
from the device this is the ability to
attach any social media platform or at
least this list right here and I can
share directly from the unit now I have
registered a few different services now
share images online and from here I can
pick my service of choice I'm gonna do
Google Drive and send it up I go to my
drive I see folder I see a picture of
Jack Attack
all of a sudden is a little workflow
forming so you snap a photo with the
real camera but it ends up in a foam
world which is something I've wanted for
a very long time you get a lot more
creative with your photos but still
share them that is the idea DSLR cs100
you might just become an Instagram
champion this is not boring luggage this
is the next level this is for the tech
heads this is for you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
