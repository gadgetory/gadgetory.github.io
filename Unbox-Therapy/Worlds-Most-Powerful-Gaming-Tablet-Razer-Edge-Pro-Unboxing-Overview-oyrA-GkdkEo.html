therapy and today we're taking a look at
a really interesting device for those of
you that follow me on Instagram Twitter
or Facebook you've already seen these
boxes you probably know what's in here
so that's all kinds of incentive for
those of you that don't follow me in
those places I will link them down in
the description so you can conveniently
do that but anyways this of course is
the Razer edge which is a full-fledged
gaming tablet this is the pro version
you've got a dedicated graphics card or
what they call a discreet graphics card
inside you're going to be able to play
legitimate games on something very slim
and light in terms of what it's able to
do obviously it's not gonna be a slim
and light as something like an iPad or
an Android tablet but that's because
this is a little bit different in form
and in function now you can you know
load up steam and play legitimate games
on here I mean you could play all kinds
of different games considering that the
res is not huge on here it means that
you're gonna be able to play back games
in fairly reasonable frame rates using
just this tablet and potentially the
game controller if you're interested now
there are a number of items that I
showed you at the beginning here three
different boxes in fact and in order to
keep things kind of clean we're gonna be
featuring just the gaming tablet in this
particular episode in this particular
unboxing followed by the accessories and
a test and a sort of review if you will
yes I know I don't usually do reviews
but in this case I'm going to because
this is such a different device and you
know not that many people are gonna have
their chance to get their hands on it so
I'm gonna give you guys some feedback as
well which I know you've been asking me
to do so hit that thumbs up button down
below if you do want to see my thoughts
and more of a review style video on this
device so let's take a closer look at
the bottom of the unit that's where
you're gonna see two down firing
speakers which are surprisingly loud for
a tablet you'll also find the
proprietary connector here that's going
to be used for charging the device as
well as interfacing with your multimedia
dock which I do have here and I will be
showing you more information on in the
future on the front of the devices where
you'll find your Windows key that's for
accessing all those wonderful Windows 8
features and then on the front along
top is where you'll see your
forward-facing HD camera and array
microphones there's also an ambient
light sensor hidden on the bezel now on
the top is where the remainder of the
buttons are you have your power button
followed by a couple of interesting
buttons one is a dedicated keyboard
button as well as an orientation lock
and then you have your volume rocker
over here followed by your 3.5 mill
headphone out / microphone in and then a
USB 3 port so a lot to look at on the
top towards the back is where you'll see
the exhaust vents that's because this
device does create a little bit more
heat than your average tablet but that's
kind of to be expected after all in this
case you're going to be playing graphics
intense games unlike you really do on
consumer-level tablets this thing is
really a different piece of gear it's
kind of hard to compare it to an iPad or
even an Android tablet or really
anything it's incredibly unique you're
gonna get a little bit of paperwork from
Razer as well so a QuickStart guide to
get you up and running warranty
information you're gonna get a cleaning
cloth so you can at least keep the
screen clean momentarily this is a
touchscreen device though so that's
probably not gonna last long that's just
the nature of the business you've also
got a couple of stickers from Razer so
you can rep the brand and taking one
last glance at the manual you can see
it's sort of dedicated to getting you
started with Windows 8 not too much info
in there you'll have to go to the
website for that there is a power
adapter included of course to charge the
device you have an extension cable here
so you'd be a fair distance from the
wall while using it one thing to mention
at this point the battery is not that
great on this device you're getting a
lot of power in a slim package so that's
to be expected but you can improve the
battery life using the gamepad
controller that I'll be giving you more
info on that shortly at this point it's
also a good thing to mention or a good
time to mention sorry that you can check
out pricing and availability on this as
well as the other components down in the
description of this video I will warn
you this is not cheap so if you're a
little bit squeamish about high price
tags I would say avoid that link but
otherwise go ahead and check it out you
know anytime you're dealing with super
unique devices in what they're offering
and the package they're offering it in
you expect to pay a higher price this is
really a toy it's a high end
toy for people with a big budget that's
just everybody should expect that I mean
everybody pretty much knows it and Razer
has been known for making high-end toys
in the past and this one is absolutely
no different now if you do add the extra
accessories I suppose it becomes a
little bit more functional I'm thinking
specifically about the multimedia dock
which will also be featured in the next
video it because in that sense it can
sort of turn into an HTP sea you can
dock it to your television and it can be
a console as well as a video player you
could stream HD content from it YouTube
I mean you could do a lot of things with
it you can also hook up a keyboard mouse
and just use it like a regular computer
that's totally up to you so from that
sense it is a little bit diverse and you
can sort of understand the higher price
tag but I'll go into more detail about
that
when I do my actual recap video this is
just the unboxing as you guys know I
don't like to split up the videos I have
made long videos in the past but in this
case I thought because there are a lot
of consumers that will probably buy the
tablet on its own without the gamepad or
the multimedia dock it would be you know
it would make sense to split them up in
this particular case so anyways this is
your quick setup I'm not gonna make you
guys sit through that as I said before
tons more coming up including the
official gamepad as well as the dock in
the next video don't miss it thumbs up
down below and I'll catch you guys real
soon later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
