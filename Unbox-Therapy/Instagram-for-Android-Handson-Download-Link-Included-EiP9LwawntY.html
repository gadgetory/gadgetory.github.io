wanted to do a quick little video about
Instagram for Android but first check
out this dope face unlock through the
reflection so Instagram just came out
right just came out for Android and
they've been talking about it forever
it's finally available now first things
first if you want to follow me its unbox
therapy as you might imagine that's the
username but very impressed so far you
know with the interface and the speed
obviously if you're familiar with
Instagram you know it's a place where
you can follow individuals whose
photographs you appreciate their mobile
photos of course up until this point it
was only available for iOS it is finally
available for Android making the service
available to a ton of new users so
there's going to be a bunch more content
available everything up until this point
has being very very smooth you know you
can obviously snap photos apply filters
hmm Instagram is known for some of the
top quality filters in the business
selectable down here you can check them
out for yourself so if you are on
Android and you have any interest in
photography you're gonna want to go
ahead and download Instagram the only
thing I noticed right now is that it's
impossible to find in the actual Google
Play Store when accessing the store from
your device it doesn't show up in search
when you type in Instagram so I'll put a
link down in the description to the
Google Play Store online on the web so
you can go download it there and then
sync it to whichever device you so
choose anyway guys that was just a quick
update I wanted to make sure you all
knew that this was finally out and I
wanted to provide that link because I
was searching in the store first and I
was like what the hell where is it why
isn't it available but it is available
it just hasn't populated the store yet
I'm sure it will very soon but until
then click the link below go download
and follow me it's unbox therapy once
again alright guys catch on the next one
got more content planned for today
later
you</div></body></html>
