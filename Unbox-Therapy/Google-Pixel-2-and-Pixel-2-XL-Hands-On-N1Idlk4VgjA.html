guys have to know about me at this point
is that I've been a fan of this lineup
of devices since the very first one I've
said it many times here on the channel
we're talking about the pixel more
importantly the pixel - with this early
look I've got a bunch of them in front
of me in fact I've got all but one the
pixel two over here and the pixel two
exhale on the far left slightly blue
probably my favorite color of the bunch
although the Panda set up over here with
the black and white not bad either
now the regular pixel on the left here a
familiar set up if you've used the
previous version of pixel this is gonna
be super comfy for you when you pick
that up on the excel things change up
just a little bit the display which
you'll notice here it kind of curves
around a little bit now one thing that's
different about both these devices
compared to other flagships is these
forward facing speakers which are an
immediate standout for me because I'm
always asking for it with this rush for
devices to become bezel lists speakers
kind of take a hit they gotta find
another place to go with the stereo
setup look at this I'm sitting here like
this we now have the search bar down at
the bottom of the screen as opposed to
the top so the smaller of the two the
standard pixel it's got a 1080p display
and then stepping up to the excel you
have a 1440p display they're both OLED
tech there's really no excuse now to not
have an OLED display there's a new
feature now we now have the squeeze
functionality so I can just grab onto
this here and launch assistant let's
listen it to me already
no Bixby no Bixby on here I just
squeezed this and it launched it I'm
squeezing the frame of the device and
it's launching assistant we've got the
fancy wallpaper with the waves coming in
beautifully and if you look very closely
you can see Jack vacationing right over
here there is what is towel sunscreen
this orange buttons look at this a
little flare now something they did is
they put the colorful button on certain
models so here you have this kind of
bluish green but if you don't want that
you could just pick up the black version
and this is the executive look no fancy
stuff with the buttons now the
fingerprint sensor it's where you expect
it to be on the back here kind of matte
finish where you might expect to get a
bunch of fingerprints it's not happening
so
much on these ones now if you're
completely against the idea of
fingerprints you could go for one of
these two colors over here even up on
the lighter section of the glass you can
see they don't really pick up so much
now all these devices feature USB type-c
as you can see here and quick charge
giving you potentially seven hours of
battery life in a fifteen minute chart
what you end up with is just a little
bit more clarity a little bit more
resolution in the voice is this the
first pixel or Nexus device with stereo
speakers facing forward I believe so
isn't it I've been using these things
for a while you can correct me if I'm
wrong but it's what I've always wanted
it seems pretty obvious you want them
firing at you this is I can't think of
another device off the top of my head
right now that's still doing this to
this degree to large grills and they're
coming at your ears now obviously with
the bigger boy you're gonna get a bigger
battery as well so that's something to
consider let's go ahead and test out
this fingerprint scanner real quick
where is the perfect spot what is the
perfect unlock scenario this is pretty
close having it on the back we all want
these giant displays there's no room on
the front anymore okay fine truly this
is where your finger falls anyways this
is where you hold it you you don't even
really think about it to be honest
there's really no mistaking that
location so you just land on it I know
Apple they're reluctant to put this
scanner on the back they got the Big
Apple logo there this is really where it
should be that was actually very quick
now something I like to do to make it
even more seamless is sometimes I'll
just register the same finger twice now
let's Lock this guy and let's see what
happens oh my goodness okay it's very
quick it's a very fast one sensor on the
back get used to it the face thing trust
me it's not gonna be what you expect
think about paying for something what is
all this about there's some what the
cashiers standing over there here and
then no no no kaboom no what about the
camera you're wondering about the camera
cameras very important this one here has
a bigger aperture than the last
which should allow for even better
performance in low light three-two-one
kaboom that's our image whoa we equip
peek around and of course there's you
guys in the lens there and there's me
looking at you looking at me okay let's
try this again
whoa okay by default check this out
look at this see how there's motion to
it so if it detects motion within the
frame or movement within the frame you
can actually toggle motion on and see a
few frames of movement prior to the snap
now there's also a portrait
functionality which will simulate this
very shallow depth of field that you've
seen on certain phones certain cameras
this one is capable of emulating that
effect from a single lens system so okay
you know what I got a good idea look at
that she's ready for portrait mode so
through machine learning it's capable of
distinguishing the edge a portrait
essentially and it can distinguish
what's important in the frame and what
you might want to blur bye-bye bye-bye
time Jack why don't you keep this thing
around anyway all right guys so there's
this feature called now playing in which
assistant can pick up a song that's
playing in the background and tell you
what it is on your notification pain
like on the lockscreen but it's doing it
locally on the device it's not it's not
like sending that data anywhere in fact
it'll work on airplane mode oh it got it
like you got it like it I don't know if
they can see it cuz it's in these look
at that it just grabbed it now playing
so I can remember the song that came on
maybe in a public space at a bar or
something like that oh this is good and
boom going to the notifications and it's
sitting I can download it or do whatever
I want it doesn't end there with
assistant there's another cool thing
which is new the ability to trigger
device level modifications right from
within assistant so for example on the
old pixel if I launched into assistant
and said start my hotspot I would just
get some instructions from Google on how
to do so but on a new one here I'll
launch it was squeezed start my hotspot
turning Wi-Fi hotspot' on BAM
do you like that stop my hotspot what
more do I need to say all right we're
living in the future okay so both of
these models are gonna be available in
64 gigs or 128 gigs of storage and
unlike the previous one this one has I P
67 certification for water resistance
and whatnot alright so there you have it
the pixel 2 and the pixel XL 2 showcased
in various colors and let me know down
in the comments which one would you go
for which color do you like the best
gonna be the Panda it's gonna be the
all-white is gonna be the black words
are gonna be the sorta kind of slightly
blue remember though this was just the
hands-on a quick hands-on on the day of
announcement but I'm gonna have a more
extensive video I'm gonna I'm gonna use
one of these exclusively for a while do
an unboxing and a review so make sure to
subscribe to that also hit the
notification button so you don't miss it
it's gonna happen here first on unbox
therapy that's where</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
