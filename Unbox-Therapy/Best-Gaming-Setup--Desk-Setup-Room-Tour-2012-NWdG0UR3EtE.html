for the long-awaited room tour video or
desk tour or setup or gaming setup
whatever you want to call it you guys
have asked for it over and over again
for like a month and so it's about time
that we head inside the office behind
this door and get a better look at how I
work and how I live let's check it out
let's get started so here is my office
from left to right you can see my desk
over there that's probably the first
thing that's going to surprise you is
just how big my desk is it's actually
sort of a custom setup I'll get there in
a quick second but first let's start on
the left side of the room so over here
is where my bathroom is it's pretty
straightforward bathroom except just got
a big a big huge bathtub in it but
that's not why you guys came to this
room tour it's nice having a bathroom
oked up to my office though because I
don't have to leave for any reason now
over here on this side table I got a
bunch of controllers remotes you've got
some 3d glasses those are active 3d
glasses for my television and then you
can see even up there there's the ps3
keyboard that hooks up to your
controller for inputting text in a more
efficient manner
we have the remote control for the ps3
there's also the logitech g27 race wheel
which has the pedals the whole nine real
professional feel on here got it hooked
up to this little table I pull that out
when I'm going to be playing games on my
TV which is actually on the other side
of the room and I'll tell you more about
that in a quick second but first on the
couch you probably get a look at
my MacBook Air now this is the 13-inch
MacBook Air you've probably seen it
unboxed on the channel if you haven't
links to everything I talked about are
going to be probably in the annotations
as well as down in the description I'm
gonna try and make it easy for you to
navigate through the items if you want
to know more information about each one
but I keep that MacBook Air on the couch
it's the core i7 by the way I keep that
baby on the couch for browsing chilling
you know I actually prefer sitting back
with the MacBook Air as opposed to like
a tablet even though I have a lot of
them because sometimes I want to get a
little bit of work done and this makes
it easy for using Twitter and you know
any time you got a input text it's a
little bit better than a tablet so as we
move along left to right here this is
the left side of my desk and I should
probably talk about my desk before I get
into too many of the gadgets that are on
there this is a custom job that I
actually put together in fact this desk
is supposed to be a production desk for
a studio a music studio and what I did
is took out the internal portion that is
supposed to be used for putting in
mixing boards and audio equipment and I
got these pieces of wood custom cut in
here put this metal trim on here as well
and as you can see it comes with these
nice leather pads here for where your
wrists rest I really love this desk I
think it's like 10 feet long maybe more
but it allows for me to get all my
gadget tree up on the desk so I don't
have to be feeling like I'm missing
anything at all the next thing I want to
talk about is my chair now this chair is
actually pretty exciting I know you guys
are probably like why is he telling me
about a chair when he's got all that
beauty up on a desk well the reason I'm
telling you about this chair is because
I sit in it all day and if I didn't sit
in it all day then you wouldn't have
much content to look at and this is
called the Herman Miller embody chair
arguably the best chair in the world I
guess you could argue at least a price
would argue that and on the back here
this section here sort of mimics your
spine and you can probably get a better
idea of that if you look at the little
bend here but it actually gives you a
little bit of flexibility and make
a real comfortable for sort of long
sessions where you're editing video or
you know browsing the web or anything
like that super adjustable as well not
cheap I didn't do a video on this you
guys want to know more about this let me
know in a comment section but a really a
nice chair that lets me do what I do now
let's get to some of the gadget tree up
on this big huge desk over here we'll
start left to right on the left-hand
side you've got my iPad 2 got YouTube
open on there it's in an Otterbox case I
believe it is called the defender once
again I'll put a link so if I if I get
anything wrong click on the link and you
can learn more information the stand
that's included that it's standing on
here is also a part of the case so it's
actually a cool package I'll put a link
to that in the description as well as in
the annotations this is a core i7
27-inch iMac now you're probably saying
dude what's up on the screen that
doesn't look like your regular iMac and
that's because it isn't it's got an
adaptor hook up hooked up to it now you
can see that little white box back there
from Belkin which I also did a video on
and that box allows you to input an HDMI
device in this case the PlayStation 3
into your nice 27-inch display that your
iMac has so I've got the the PlayStation
menu on here that you guys can take a
look at and it sort of allows you to use
your nice big display as a TV if you
want to and that's what's going on over
here
you got the badass pink ps3 controller
over here and it's a better look at it
yeah if you if you guys know how to rock
out you know go for a pink and then on
the table there is the regular Apple
wireless keyboard followed by the Magic
Trackpad and they're hooked up with I
believe what's called the magic wand
from 12 south so this whole unit here is
portable there on top of this this pad
here they're actually taped down with
double-sided tape so they don't come off
you can use them from the couch spin the
TV and sort of lie on the couch over
here not TV iMac I should say you can
spin the eye
Mack and lie on the couch if you want to
if you want to use it that way
and over here I got a set of headphones
lined up those are the beats power beats
I believe they're called
they're they hook around the outside of
your ear they're for athletics and
things like that and then there's a
little charger there in the back for the
ps3 controllers at least two ps3
controllers but what's cool is the way
I've got this ps3 mounted up on the
twist dock this thing here is called the
twist dock case you're wondering it also
charges some controllers on the backside
you see over there sorry guys I'm trying
to get you a look at everything here but
if you need to know more information as
I said earlier it's all about the
description on this video it's kind of
an epic video in terms of the proportion
of it I mean I got to cover a lot of
things but anyways so a lot of places to
charge up ps3 controllers up here is the
PlayStation Vita in its dock followed by
the Nintendo 3ds that's sort of the
little mobile gaming station over there
some of my favorite headphones in the
world also reside up in this location
the sony xba-4
get a little bit warm after extended
usage but most people who follow the
channel know that I love those
headphones check them out
I've actually got a PC over here as well
got to give the PC people some love
right this is a think pad the T 400s and
I use this for you know some web
development stuff or I want to check how
the site looks on the windows side of
things also for some Android stuff like
routing my phones and messing around
with a little bit of development a
little bit easier to do on the PC nice
to have one I've got a mouse hooked up
to it this is called the Logitech
marathon Mouse and the reason it's
called that is because it lasts for a
really long time on a single battery I
believe like two years or something the
next thing you're going to see down here
on the desk are two phones there's the
new Galaxy Nexus and then to the left of
it the Nexus S which is my old phone I
keep both of them around
this one sort of as a backup right now
both have ice cream sandwich so they're
still both really good phones what else
do I have to cover well my microphone a
lot of people ask about my microphone
this is brought to you by ADK
now it is not a standard USB microphone
instead it uses a traditional XLR cable
for connecting I'll pull that out I'll
give you guys a closer look at that hold
up oh gee you see if I can get that uses
a traditional XLR style cable I'll put
that down for now and that plugs into an
audio interface which is hidden back
here and you probably won't be able to
see it hidden back there in the desk and
that interface allows you to take any
XLR input guitar input whether it be for
vocals or instruments etc and record and
I like that because it actually has
really high quality analog to digital
converters slightly better than what is
what some of the USB mics are offering
so I'm really happy about my mic an
audio interface set up the audio
interface is called the apogee one once
again i got a video for that on the
channel as well if you want to check
that out let's continue moving along
holy smokes there's so much stuff to
cover here but I'm gonna try and fit it
all into one video because I know if I
split it up you guys will be yelling at
me like oh my god I want it all in one
video I don't want to have to go click
another video another view anything like
that so I'm going to fit it all in here
I'm just going to take my time make sure
I cover everything so here is I guess my
pride and joy my macbook pro quad-core
2.3 gigahertz it has 16 gigs of ram
which i recently installed if you
haven't seen that installation video you
can go check it out it's also got an SSD
a vertex 3 SSD which is a really speedy
and then in the optical drive bay I have
replaced the optical drive with the
standard hard drive that shipped with it
using an adapter so it's got lots of
storage and lots of speed from the SSD
side of things didn't really need the
optical drive all the time so if you
look to the right over here I have the
optical drive for the MacBook Air
anyways if I need one I can just plug
that baby into the MacBook Pro and I'll
be good to go another wireless keyboard
from Apple followed by a Logitech MX
performance MX Mouse probably my
favorite Mouse in the world right now I
love this mouse lots of buttons very
comfortable and that's on top of a
SteelSeries mouse pad that I really
enjoy as well never made a video on that
before this MacBook Pro is hooked up to
a 24 inch samsung shorty 23 inch samsung
monitor and this Samsung monitor is
actually on an arm hooked up to a cool
extension arm and that allows me to pull
the monitor out towards my seating area
depending on what I'm working on
sometimes I like to have it close
sometimes further away but it really
allows me to adjust my workspace so that
it's not always the same and that's kind
of a good thing when you're you know
sitting down for extended periods to
sort of move around a little bit so you
don't go crazy in one spot so anyways
that's nice that it can be adjusted I
usually keep it above the MacBook Pro I
keep some of my social networking stuff
open on the MacBook Pro and then
whatever else I'm working on Final Cut
or anything like that usually goes up
onto the Samsung monitor oh man I need
to catch a breath this is too much let's
keep it moving though we move over to
the right side of the desk you're going
to notice another screen just a sort of
standard Dell screen here I think it is
23 inches as well and I've actually got
the little miniature on live console
hooked up to this screen at the moment
and here's the on live controller as
well I'm still testing that system out
we've also got the modern warfare 3 Xbox
360 special edition console hooked up to
this TV as well and of course the
matching controllers are down here we
got the Sony 3d goggles haha what's the
what's the the model name the H MZ - t
1p this was a really cool video you guys
should definitely
check it out if you haven't yet
basically you wear these things and they
they sort of emulate what it would be
like to be in front of a really huge 3d
display but they do so by sitting on
your head you can plug in any console
into their ps3 xbox or any HDMI source
and get that cool effect so those are
really cool once again check out that
video for more information on that
particular setup I've got a couple of
tablets over here there's the Galaxy Tab
10 one up top and then the e Pad
Transformer Prime from Asus which I
recently unboxed and I'm actually still
evaluating so that's why I still have it
in the box at the moment there's the
Amazon Kindle Fire up above there that
super drive that I mentioned that's the
regular portable super drive with a 1tb
portable hard drive on top of it used
for just moving data around and whatnot
and then you can see one of my two
logitech speakers which sit on either
side of my macbook pro I can't remember
the model name at the moment but I'll
put a link on the screen right now if
you want to check out more info on them
I really do like them you get a lot of
base they do have a subwoofer that's why
so it's a two point one system the
subwoofer is sitting underneath the desk
somewhere I'm not going to go searching
for it right now that would be just far
too ambitious now one more thing on I
missed in the middle here are the astro
a40 s they're on a cool headphone stand
from astro as well and they've got the
mix amp associated with them too nice
little mix amp there I haven't done a
video on these actually if you guys want
to see more info on these or what I
think of them let me know once again
down in the description just like or in
the comments sorry
like everything else like anything that
catches your attention here now up on
the top shelf I've got the Steve Jobs
book which I haven't started reading it
I really do want to a couple of
collectors knives there I've also got
some business cards there that I do
enjoy on the side of this TV here is
little Dell TV I've got some beats
studios which I use from time to time a
couple of my watches including the
vestal observer and
this is just a nano watch inside of the
I believe that's the lunatic that's
right that's the lunatic watch strap and
up along back here we've got the Dyson
Airblade I believe it's cold and that is
a really cool high-tech turbine style
fan actually did a video on it as well
if you want to know more information
that is a top top-of-the-line fan you
know you got it you got to just sort of
match everything up in the setup you got
a got to stay cool while your work no
this all this content for you guys to
watch so as we move over to the right
here in the corner you can catch a look
at my tripod and a couple of guitars I
have and I even got a samurai sword back
there just in case anybody wants to run
up in the joint and try and snag
anything from me that I mentioned I have
a Starbucks cup over there too yeah I
want to cover everything make sure you
guys really get to know how I live in
here but I've got a cool magnetic
adapter on top of my tripod for sort of
quick quick release on and off you know
this little locking mechanism because
I'm constantly onto the tripod off the
tripod doing different things with my
camera I'm going to cover more
information on how I shoot my videos in
another video because there's just too
much to cover in this particular video
so let me know if you guys are
interested in a production tour this is
where everything gets produced in this
room here but before I go in there I'm
going to show you my television you may
or may not have seen information on it
before it is a 55 inch Samsung LED
backlit television really super thin I
really like it 3d everything like that
once again if you want to know more
about it I'll put a link I put a custom
LED lighting system underneath it and on
the sides of it and it changes color is
obviously the effect of this is more
major when there's less light in the
room but impressive nonetheless you can
freeze it on a specific color if you
want I'll give you a better look around
the side here you can get an idea of how
I line those up so there's one a long
top and one along the bottom so you can
either rotate colors or stay on one and
it comes into this room here in terms of
cables I put a hole in the wall and all
Peebles come into this room here and
this is where sort of things get a
little bit messy but this is the nerve
center this is what allows everything to
operate on the outside on that TV I've
got all my cables coming through right
here a little bit messy you guys know
how it is this power supply here
actually when you turn off the
television it has a master port which
also turns off the LED lighting system
so they go on and off together which is
cool all the games are sort of stacked
in here as best as I could fit them lots
of ps3 games mostly ps3 games you guys
probably want to get a closer look at
some of the titles in there I'll give a
quick little pan across so you can get
an idea of the different titles that are
up in here some that I play more often
I'm loving some racing games right now
and stuff like that but you can get an
idea up above there is where I keep some
boxes some stuff that I recently unboxed
or been working on or just some boxes
that are still hanging around there's
also some headphones up here you may
remember these Marshalls some Sony's
lots of different ones these ones are
from the saints row special edition I'll
probably give those away I don't use
those too often let me know if you if
you want to want to try and win those or
something in a contest some along those
lines now down on the bottom side here
we've got a couple of consoles we've got
the Gears of War 3 console special
edition with the matching controllers
which are outside on that side table
here's the BenQ joy bgp two little
portable projector which I use for
blowing up the games on a bigger wall if
I want to take it downstairs or
something like that it's also got the
iPhone dock and a regular HDMI port so
you can really interface with this thing
in a number of ways blow up your source
your HDMI source to 160 inches so really
cool thing when you get a lot of people
over something like that here is the
other side of the Astro gaming headset
setup that's what you need to interface
to send signal to that mix amp and then
we've got the old-school Fat Boy ps3
over here it's got the module on it for
interfacing with the P
free wireless headset as well down below
there we have more stuff a little bit of
cable spaghetti but it's tough to wire
all this stuff up some Nintendo 3ds
games over on the left you probably want
to catch a better look over there
followed by a limited number of xbox360
titles this box here well on the top
I'll cover that first
that's the avermedia Game Capture HD for
recording gameplay footage which I
haven't done a ton of yet haven't had
much time to do below that is a custom
computer that I built PC which I use as
a server it's got a couple terabytes in
there of storage and a mini ITX
motherboard and it you it works as a as
a network server for some data and stuff
like that I've got some official game
guides over here a number of different
ones and then that there's a random copy
of call of duty modern warfare 3 on top
of there and then over to the right is
what's called a dns-323
from d-link which is another storage
device there's I believe 4 terabytes of
storage in there - 2 terabyte hard drive
so once again just more backup network
backup for all my content that I've
produced and stuff like that on the
bottom here I've got something pretty
boring my laser printer it's the Lexmark
II 1 xx N network printer pretty boring
stuff like I said before I don't do a
ton of printing but it's nice to have it
networked so I don't have to have it
right be right beside the computer
here's the iCade this is an iPad arcade
once again you guys can check out more
information on that in another video in
the other video the original video but
it basically allows you to play
old-school Atari titles and stuff with
the traditional control scheme on your
iPad above that is my battle tank my RC
battle tank which shoots airsoft bullets
you can see a PlayStation Move
sharpshooter in the back leaning up
against the wall and a street fighter
fight stick which doesn't get a ton of
use but got it there nonetheless so as
we move out of this section here
which took a while oh you see up on the
wall here I got my trek pod GoPro
it's a monopod slash tripod kind of
system not going to go into ton of
detail on that right now we're already
at twenty two minutes and this this was
from the Lord of the Rings collector's
edition you've got the the map in here
which actually looks like a couple of
arrows pretty cool thing nonetheless and
that takes me to some of my more
commemorative items from special
editions of games and stuff like that
most of them live up here some are in
other parts of the house as you can see
there's stuff from Skyrim from Uncharted
Killzone you see the Killzone dude is
rocking the PlayStation headset the
wireless PlayStation headset which is
convenient to just sort of pull off of
him every so often if I want to use that
headset we got Batman Gran Turismo Gears
of War lots of stuff represented up on
this top shelf there's also a pair of
tritons hanging out over here these are
the 5.1 surround headset they've
actually got a bunch of physical
speakers in each ear cup so it's not an
emulation it's actually legit number of
speakers 5.1 representation as we move
over here this is actually the
production section I got a few things
laid out on the table right now these
are different prices and stuff that are
going to be given away you guys probably
know about the giveaways if you don't
yet get on them because I'm giving away
a lot of stuff over here if you want to
know more about my production setup how
it all works and stuff like that I'm
going to save that for another video
only because this video is going on and
on so long already so if you guys want
to know more information about how I
produce my videos like and favorite this
video and leave a comment and then I'll
know you guys want to know more
information down here I've got a music
production device called the machine
from Native Instruments we're making
beats and stuffing I haven't used it yet
my brother actually gave it to me so I'm
going to hook that up and check it out
real soon I got a bunch of cables
chilling over there pretty ugly stuff I
got got to go through all of those and I
think I may have covered everything in
this room right now that was pretty
intimidating but I
think I covered also games gaming stuff
systems all feed through the wall over
here out to my flat panel out here which
has a beast feed logo on it right now by
the way that's my second channel if you
haven't checked it out yet I'll put a
link and annotation probably up over top
of the beast feed logo so you can visit
that channel I got a couple things
charging down here the battery for my H
x9 v camera which is the one I'm using
to shoot this right now as well as the
battery for my Canon 60d which I use for
the vast majority of my unboxings
it has a nice articulating LCD which
makes it perfect for that I forgot to
mention my my nice samurai dude that my
brother picked up for me I believe in
China he's up on the wall there framed
pretty cool picture it kind of has like
a scroll feel to it but anyway guys I
think I pretty much covered everything
in this room for now I try to go
in-depth as much as I could with you
know without making the video turn into
an hour-long affair or anything like
that this is has been 25 minutes and I
think I did an okay job of describing
the majority of items now not everything
is always set up like this on a daily
basis some stuff has been placed out for
the purpose of this video but most
things live in the position that I that
they're in right now that you guys are
witnessing if you have any questions
about anything covered in this video
then definitely leave a comment below if
you haven't subscribed yet please go
ahead and do so lots of new content on
the way new products getting covered all
the time and specifically if there's
something in the setup that you want to
know more information about leave a
comment identifying
which ever item that is and if I get
enough requests to look at an item more
in depth I'll definitely do that so
anyway guys thank you for joining me for
this very first room tour I'll update
this setup from time to time so if I do
I'll probably do another room tour as
well to show you guys with what updates
have been made otherwise I think that's
it for now
I'll probably end this video with a cool
montage of some of the different angles
some of the different looks on this
setup so anyway guys until next time
I'll see you on the next one Oh remember
to Like and favorite and let's do this
again
right later guys
