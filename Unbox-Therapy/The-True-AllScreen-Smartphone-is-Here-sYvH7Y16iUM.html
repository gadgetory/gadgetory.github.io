be one of the most anticipated videos
that I could possibly make in front of
me today
the vivo apex there's like everything
that happened before this and then what
will come after ambition boiled down
into something you can hold smartphone
design is dead we've talked a lot about
differentiation in the space especially
in the Android world that one's pretty
good that one's pretty good like which
one every single manufacturer looked at
this thing and realized immediately how
do we get there they started working the
next day this screen to body ratio thing
for people like you that's the challenge
that's I guess for a smartphone maker
the reason to be in this business now
but from a manufacturing standpoint it's
a super difficult problem to approach
and I hit this button you get to see it
for yourself what this future looks like
it's not completely bezel asst there's a
tiny little bit of a chin over there 1.8
millimeters on the top as well as the
sides and 4.3 millimeters on a little
tiny chin here there's no goatee when
the people from vivo brought it over
there like Nenana the goal is zero bezel
first of all in order to achieve this
there's a whole different manufacturing
process necessary which is part of the
reason why you can't buy this phone
right now what it would cost to put this
thing together is beyond what normal
people will be willing to pay for a
phone at least right now the goal is to
make the bezel identical the whole way
around if you show this thing to me when
I was oh I don't know 15 years old I'd
be like that man is living in the future
so this particular design introduces all
kinds of problems where's the
front-facing camera where are the
proximity sensors how do you unlock the
device but believe it or not they're
here in the function surprisingly well
so first off let's talk about this
front-facing camera it doesn't exist on
the bezel at all it's up here on the top
and it's recessed it's kind of nice to
look at a display and not stare at a
camera so I just I just think the hidden
camera thing has some positive
attributes for people who might be a
little bit sensitive to having a lens
facing them all the time all right
privacy concerns whatever
it's a full-on motor that will push this
camera up I'm going to show you how it
works
lift off baby and hey everyone can say
hi now there we go hey hey Kirk say
what's up BAM special it's unprecedented
the beard hair test I understand some of
the apprehension about this particular
decision it's moving parts it could
possibly fail the level of concern that
you have it almost directly maps to how
important selfies or videoconferencing
is to you personally if you're that kind
of person is using the front-facing
camera I'm gonna go with you you have a
valid concern there would be some
serious engineering necessary to make
that motorized front-facing camera lasts
for five thousand ten thousand a hundred
thousand actuations some other
interesting things about the design here
power switch is actually it's over here
it's where your finger lands it's not
where your thumb is I do like this round
button actually it's very distinctive
you know right away when you're on it
you probably notice down here on the
bottom bar we have this fingerprint
indicator this is a demo you can
increase the security level by requiring
two thumb prints instead of one to
unlock the device I'll show you that in
a moment
so if I bring up the test you're gonna
see what the potential lock screen would
look like and in this case it's asking
me to authenticate to fingerprints at
the same time now this is a possibility
because of the size of the sensor area
now when these began to emerge the size
of that area was much smaller the
technology adjusts you watch this like
that's the magic right there I'm gonna
delete fingerprint okay no more
fingerprint I got a register I'm gonna
do a single fingerprint registration
this is the way I think most people will
use this so you press hard in this
location over here and it grabs a little
bit and then again and then again so now
I back out and I go to the
authentication test again according to
vivo the goal for the fingerprint
scanner is to eventually be the entire
screen oh my goodness you're just not
even thinking about it bam bam
ban here we go single fingerprint boom
done right boots up boom done alright I
have to sit when I saw this emerged on
the web I was very skeptical and now
having tried it myself
I had to say I think it exceeds my
expectations even though it's a little
bit slow works surprisingly well on a
product that's just a concept now there
are some security disadvantages to an
optical fingerprint sensor you are
correct
Apple is but it made a huge deal of this
face ID thing multiple points it's a big
topic of conversation right now and it's
true optical scanners might not be the
absolute most secure method of
authentication that said you can always
put the old-school pin code in what
we're seeing here is sort of an initial
stage I expect to see improvement let's
get back to the display real quick so
why is it so interesting to have a bezel
list display as the screens grow if the
device grows along with it you end up
with these really large objects in your
pocket I know that bothers Ryan to no
end
so the shrinking bezel is an antidote
because everybody wants a big screen the
goal is around 98% screen to body ratio
so when you hold this thing it's
basically all screen how impressive this
screen to body ratio is how much video
you get in such a small form-factor
now another thing that kind of surprised
me about this device it maintains a
headphone jack alongside the USB type-c
connector
we have a traditional 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and I was like if this is
the phone of the future is the headphone
jack still a thing I'm not so certain I
kind of like it because it gives a real
nod to the tech community and the fact
that we still value it why I think it
makes sense why not it's not doing
anything to the form factor it's not
making the phone bigger or harder to
hold there's a really no downside they
do have an OLED panel in here which as
far as I'm concerned is the best you can
do right now it's a flexible OLED panel
because it actually has to be wrapped so
that they can get these ultimate slim
bezels and beyond that the microchips
have to be mounted directly to the
flexible circuit in order to fit
that's where the complexity comes in how
do you manufacture that at scale but
what's particularly compelling about
this concept is the fact that it works
so well this isn't Samsung doing this
this is an Apple doing this
this is vivo doing this the package
functions surprisingly close to
something that's finished I came here
knowing that I was going to look at
something impressive but I have to say
as a package deal this thing near has
exceeded even that I believe even more
now in my original tweet in which I said
smartphone design is dead for everybody
else in the game it's time to scramble
reconfigure throw the design team out
the door and figure out how to make a
screen that you hold and that you see in
the absence of anything else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
