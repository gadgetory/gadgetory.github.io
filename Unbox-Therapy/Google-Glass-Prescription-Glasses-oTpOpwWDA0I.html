by Dollar Shave Club welcome to another
unscripted installment of unbox therapy
today we're taking a closer look at
Google glass more specifically Google
glass as regular everyday glasses like
the ones I'm wearing right here I never
owned Google glass well until now and
that's because I got really excited when
I saw that Google has finally released
legitimate prescription frames see in
case you haven't been able to tell by
this point after watching my videos for
a while I wear glasses most of the time
every so often I wear contact lenses but
most of the time I wear and prefer
standard glasses and so wearing Google
glass is a bit of a headache it's either
it either means you're going to have to
wear you know contact lenses with them
or you're going to have to try and strap
them over top of your regular
prescription frames which a few people
online have done with varying degrees of
success but now it's official there is
one screw that you need to use in order
to attach these frames to your Google
glass it's actually really easy to do so
the objective here and what I hope to do
in the next video is take these frames
along with the Google glass attached to
a local optometrist or opt in or whoever
it is who puts prescription lenses into
frames get the video recording on the
glass and see what that person's
reaction is when I ask them to put
lenses into it because it does look
quite unusual but I'm just really
excited to use these as daily drivers as
legitimate Google glasses not just glass
singular I think not only do they
function better because you can see and
you know you're getting your vision
corrected but also they look a little
bit less intimidating a little bit less
cyborg like when you've got them
connected to legitimate frames they just
blend in a little bit better especially
if you've got the dark Google glass
along with a dark frame now in my case
the only frames that were available in
the design that I wanted which is this
split design were the ones that have a
tangerine interior which is that kind of
crazy reddish or
that you probably saw on the latest
generation Nexus yes very close to that
vibrant color but it's okay because it's
only on the interior of the frame so I
can live with that and in fact I think
it adds a little bit of interest so
that's completely cool but the reason I
picked that is because it was the only
one currently available these things
have actually been selling pretty
quickly now this is a bit of an
expensive experiment because the frames
themselves are pretty expensive Google
glass is pretty expensive and I'm sure
putting lenses into them is going to be
pretty expensive so hopefully I can
offer up some insight for you guys as
this experiment moves forward into just
how they function as an everyday device
I know part of the reason that people
have a hard time justifying the cost
right now is because they really only
serve one purpose but in certain cases
in some states I have heard that
insurance companies are going to cover
the prescription frames to go with glass
so that could bring the cost down a
little bit if you have you know
insurance that has optical coverage but
anyway that's for another video I'm
pretty excited to finally get my chance
to check out Google glass on its own and
then be one of the first people to
really put Google glass as glasses you
know through its paces so anyway guys if
you're excited to check out this series
