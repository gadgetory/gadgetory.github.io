therapy comm and today I got a little
bit of a different unboxing we're
looking at an order from Threadless calm
if you don't know who they are they're
the Masters of t-shirt apparel if you're
not into apparel then move on to the
next video but you should be into
apparel because otherwise you'd be naked
anyway is the first shirt this is a
crazy modern take I guess on little red
riding-hood we got the crazy wolf man
there next we got a design called math
or maths with an S who knows why and it
looks like a chalkboard full of
equations and doodles to go along with
it next shirt we got is a
david-and-goliath style you get the big
dragon and the knight who wants to
conquer him with his gaming controller
anyway that was done in some metallic
ink which looks cool in real life this
one is called zombies in Wonderland you
can see Alice's kicking some ass here we
got one called monkey business which is
what I'm involved in all day every day
it's gonna be a party shirt for me yeah
next one we got is the spookiest of all
I believe it's called daywalkers and as
you can see there is one man in command
of many whether they be zombies or
vampires or something next we got the
classic for all you nerds out there to
control Z shirt if only there was
control Z for real life we'd all be in
good shape next one is out for all the
photographer's in the crowd this one is
called aperture and as you can see it's
gigantic aperture blades that you wear
on your shirt if you don't know what
aperture is then don't worry and the
last one is called impossible and that's
probably because it's impossible to
determine what the hell this design is
no I mean it's cool
impossible nonetheless
lastly we got stickers like we always do
from Threadless and I got to say had an
amazing experience with this order these
were on sale for 10 bucks a pop they
shipped from Chicago to Toronto in one
day if you want to look at some high-res
images visit the website thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
