wonderful portable you find yourself
with an urge to express yourself now
that can be mighty important not only in
school but in later life too so I've
made videos on many unusual crazy
keyboards computer keyboards Bluetooth
keyboards wireless keyboards wired
keyboards touch keyboards laser
keyboards if there's a keyboard I'm
probably gonna look at it it's very
surprising how diverse the world of
keyboards is it to me seems to indicate
that people have a very particular taste
when it comes to their choice in
keyboard what I'm gonna show you today
possibly the craziest keyboard that I
have ever featured it also might be the
most expensive I can't remember
well it's 300 bucks this thing is
expensive and I have to tell you that
it's called the quirky writer s a
typewriter inspired mechanical keyboard
this embraces a different mindset a
different time period the click in the
clack the war in the piece to kill a
mockingbird brave new world Lord of the
Flies the company is called quirky toys
there's a picture of what it looks like
us an attention-grabbing thing you put
that in the den a glass of cognac next
to it fine wood grain and the smell of
leather let's take a closer look at this
thing
does look cool feel like I'm about to
crack the code this thing is heavy hole
boy look it's a real typewriter field
now the switches are cherry MX blue that
little plaque to it BAM this tray is if
you want to use iPad or a phone this
apparently is programmable but that's a
throwback that's some clear steps and
front makes indenting easier -
typewriter days as well same with these
knobs on the side LEDs along the top
that I can see another button USB
connector to use it in a wired fashion a
traditional-style power switch on this
side braided style USB cable but that's
micro USB though oh it isn't micro USB
connector so it's more secure look at
that that's in there this will be cool
like a volume knob maybe it is so this
thing will work on PC Mac Android and
iOS got it connected to this macbook pro
over here my intuition was to test this
knob for volume that's exactly what it
does that is cool what does this side
supposed to do I don't know maybe
nothing you know this what does this do
no it's enter it acts as enter a test -
wow I kind of like it the quick brown
fox
jump over Jack what vertical scroll
let's just fill this up he's right
that's kind of nice so you do a little
webpage scroll in there now you probably
have a scroll wheel on your mouse but
they're trying to market the idea of
using this with your iPad you'll want to
reach up and it's annoying because
you're busy how about that well you're
sitting over there yelling yelling and
screaming and the truth of the matter is
you do your research I wanted to be Tom
Cruise against Matt Lauer I'm not out
here trying to prescribe ritalin I am
NOT gonna go out and say get your kids
on ritalin it's the cure-all Matt in the
end don't have but here's the point Matt
don't be glee
with glitter can you explain to me will
what this 10 M 20 M 30 M situation is
this is mapped to brightness oh they're
macros are we talking macros are we
talking macaroni
I saw a channel the other day on
trending which is a guy who specializes
in living like it's 200 or 300 years ago
have you seen this guy welcome to 18th
century cooking I'm John Townsend and
we're doing macaroni or we might call
today
macaroni and all right so listen there's
obviously a massive novelty factor here
there is spectacle here but they didn't
skimp on the functionality you've got
cherry MX blue switches the thing is
made out of metal it compared a three
separate Bluetooth devices you can use
it wired if you choose to so fear about
this style if you look at this and you
feel inspired it could be the next Harry
Potter and I think she's doing all right
for himself how many books did she sell
Willy do four hundred and fifty million
half a billion Harry Potter books and
she owes it all to the QWERTY writer s
you need to know about it kaboom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
