therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Asus Eee Pad Transformer now this is
probably the most unique of the Android
tablets that have come to market of
recent and the reason it's unique is
because it can basically turn itself
into a netbook you can take the tablet
portion slide it into the keyboard
portion and then you're gonna get a
trackpad and a keyboard and basically
get netbook functionality out of an
Android tablet so that's pretty
interesting and I can't wait to try it
out definitely stay tuned to the channel
for the proper review this is just the
unboxing so here's that unique portion
right here it's got a chiclet style
keyboard it looks to be a decent size
and it's actually fairly light so
hopefully when it's all put together
it's not much heavier than a netbook
would be we've also got a little bit of
paperwork make that a lot of paperwork
and then we've got our proprietary USB
connector it actually is incredibly
reminiscent of the Apple connector the
30-pin that we're all used to as well as
a power brick which resembles the power
brick that came with my Galaxy Tab 10
one it's almost identical as well so
let's get a closer look at the tablet
portion of this package and the very
first thing I notice is this unique
finish on the backside of the unit
unlike so many other products on the
market that have that glossy finish to
the back this one is matte and it's
actually got a unique texture hopefully
this thing will avoid the fingerprints
that were all used to on our glossy
devices here's a closer look at the
port's we've got a speaker a micro SD
and HDMI and a headphone jack this is
the right side of the unit and on the
left side of the unit we've actually got
another speaker so stereo speakers
that's a plus a volume rocker and our
power switch that's about all that's on
that side the back of the unit has a
camera of course there's a better look
at that unique texture and of course the
Asus logo as well the ever-important
manufacturers logo here's a camera on
the front that's gonna be useful for all
your video conferencing needs skype etc
so let's get a better look at the
keyboard
aspect of this package it's a very
unusual in fact I never seen anything
like this it's light and hopefully once
the tablets on there it's not too
top-heavy that's something I'm worried
about so you got a nice sized trackpad
on here as well it'll be interesting to
see how that works within Android and
it's also got the matching finish to the
topside which is cool the unit has a
full-size SD card slot as well as a USB
port this is a flip-down style allowing
you to connect your peripherals of
course and on the other side of the
keyboard dock we have our same
proprietary connector that was found on
the tablet itself as well as a battery
indicator charging indicator and another
flip down style USB now inserting the
tablet takes a little bit to get used to
you got this little locking switch there
and it feels find it kind of finicky at
first but I'm sure I'll get better at it
after I do it a few times there's a
better look at that trackpad and the
nice keyboard here with all of your
Android specific shortcuts which are
hopefully gonna make using honeycomb a
little bit quicker there's a better look
at that lock switch I was talking about
now when it's all together and all
hooked up it actually feels pretty good
it's not much bigger than any netbook
I've really held before and everything
is really accessible it actually feels
fairly solid the materials in use here
are quite impressive in fact so there's
how it works you flip it up it goes to
sleep and wakes up just like a regular
laptop so this will be interesting to
stack up against my Galaxy Tab 10 one
see how it performs and see if I end up
using it more as a tablet or more as a
netbook anyway guys until next time
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
