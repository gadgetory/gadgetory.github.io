therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Mass Effect 3 collector's edition
this came out yesterday and I wanted to
give you guys a closer look the best
the closest look humanly possible at
this particular collector's edition as
you can see on the back of the box here
you've got some nice inclusions that
won't come with the regular edition
including a steelbook case a little bit
of extra artwork and a 70 page art book
which is hardcover there's also a little
comic book inside now Game Stop also
included some special DLC along with
this package and pre-order it includes
the n7 defender armor and the Valkyrie
assault rifle so there you have it
in-game stuff included if you bought
this at Gamestop or EB games
if you're in Canada and you have one of
those as your local game store so
anyways let's take a look inside the
very first thing you're going to notice
is this very beautiful steelbook case
with some very nice artwork on the front
and on the back and on the inside we've
got the game to the right and a little
bit of paperwork to the left let's take
a closer look at the paperwork first a
fairly slim little manual it mentions on
the front cover that the manual is
included on the disc so that's the way
to get it and you're also gonna get some
DLC associated with trying out this new
game Kingdoms of Amalur reckoning never
heard of it anyways it's probably from
the same developer of course so here it
is the collectors edition disc as you
can see written just underneath the Mass
Effect logo there now on the right hand
side here is where all the extra
inclusions are all your artwork etc
there's also some nice artwork on the
back of this box here and as I pull it
out you'll notice there's also a patch
included in n7 patch which has velcro on
the back of it so you can apply that to
any place that has the female side Hotel
Crows this is the male side of the
velcro as you can see on the back here
or maybe you can't see but I'm trying to
show you here just how it looks here is
like a postcard sort of a thing
featuring the Alliance Normandy and then
we've got the mass effect invasion comic
book here from Dark Horse and some very
beautiful artwork on the inside here I
always do appreciate some of the
backstory some of the nice artwork that
you will see and experience in the game
being displayed in you know traditional
media like a comic book and an art book
now the art book goes one step further
it gives you some background on the game
development the different characters etc
very beautiful stuff I do always
appreciate receiving these helps you to
understand the amount of work that goes
into the art direction behind these
games if you're a big fan you're gonna
want to pick up the collector's edition
of Mass Effect 3 so here's a quick
rundown again you got DLC from Game Stop
the nice postcard the steelbook case
you've also got the Mass Effect invasion
comic book the seventy page hardcover
artbook a little bit more DLC and the n7
patch anyway guys if you enjoyed this
