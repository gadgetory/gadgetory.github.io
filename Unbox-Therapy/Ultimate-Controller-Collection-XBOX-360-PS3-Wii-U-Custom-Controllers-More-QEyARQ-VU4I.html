opportunity to collect a number of
different gaming controllers over the
years and I thought hey let's sit down
and finally get a closer look at each
one let's put them all into a video so
definitely leave a thumbs up down below
if you're excited about seeing every
single one of the controllers in this
massive collection the first two are
your standard Xbox 360 controllers the
wireless versions in both white and the
newer black version I've also got the
original wired controller but that one's
at home so it won't make it into this
video this is a custom controller from
pro mods of course once again for the
Xbox 360 and this one is black ops 2
themes they sent this to me along with a
little bit of unbox therapy
customization including unbox therapy
being written up on the bumpers on the
bottom as you can see here you have the
orange thumbsticks you've got this nice
paint job with the gradient from black
all the way up to a nice silver and they
also sent me another custom controller
in commemoration of my second channel
the Beast feed and this one's actually
quite interesting here you can see that
you've got if the bullet shell buttons
so a very unique look it's also got ps3
thumb sticks which some people like
others don't but as you can see I got
the wrong battery pack on there that's
actually supposed to be associated with
the controller I just showed you before
this one and it has beast written on the
side in gold to commemorate my second
channel here on YouTube the Beast feed
this is the razor ons a tournament
Edition which is of course not made by
Microsoft
it's got slightly longer triggers and
some people actually really like this
controller it also comes with a really
long cable I believe it's 15 feet and
each of the two thumb sticks is
adjustable if you guys are interested in
learning more information about this
controller because it is a little bit
different I will link it down in the
description so you could check out
pricing availability and full specs the
next one in the long line up here is the
hallo limited-edition halo 4 controller
this came with the console as you can
see now you've got the rotating d-pad
and it's got a translucent body so you
can actually see internally into some of
the components here one of my favorite
controllers right there this one is the
Gears of War 3 limited edition or
special edition collector's edition
whatever you want to call it this one
also has the rotating d-pad and this one
shipped with the special Gears of War 3
console so it matches the console that's
sitting on my desk right now next is the
modern warfare 3 controller once again
of the newer generation it has all the
same features as the last two I showed
you a slightly different paint job and
this also shipped along with the modern
warfare 3 console with the same sort of
paint scheme let's move down to the
PlayStation controllers this one is in
red your standard ps3 controller though
in this particular case we've added some
Pelican trigger extensions and these are
really one of my favorite things to use
on ps3 because you get a much more
satisfying grip on your triggers and
these are actually really cheap to pick
up too I will also link these down in
the description as you can see you get
four in a pack I can't see the price on
there right now but anyways definitely
check out the link in the description if
you use ps3 and you play shooting games
even driving games these little
removable triggers or whatever you want
to call them trigger extensions are a
blessing so you should definitely try
them out they are removable you know you
don't have to have them on there for
every single game they're easy to clip
on and off next we have the translucent
blue PlayStation 3 controller something
that's funny here is I actually don't
have a standard black PlayStation
controller here right now those are at
home so it's kind of funny that I had
the other ones but not that one we have
the wireless race wheel for the Xbox 360
this of course is going to be used
through motion control that's kind of a
different addition to this lineup the
next controller is also unusual this
one's from Nyko and if you guys didn't
catch my unboxing video of this you
should definitely check it out because
it took place at 30 or 40,000 feet I
actually unbox this on an airplane it
was a fun video to make and I'll link
that down below that's actually for
Android devices and Android tablets it's
pretty cool
you've also got the touchpad slash
keyboard that you can attach here to in
this
case a white PlayStation 3 controller
I've got two of those and this one also
has those triggers installed that I
mentioned earlier and as I said before
you can find out more about those down
in the description it also has an
adapter on it for charging in the little
base station that you saw in the early
clips within this video this is another
custom job that was sort of picked up in
a mall I believe in Florida if I
remember correctly and you can see here
it's got crazy lighting and a bunch of
sort of blood spatter on it so it's it's
more of like a something to keep on
display than necessarily one of my
favorites but pretty cool to look at
nonetheless here we have some special
additions to the PlayStation Vita and
these make a big difference for me if
you've got average - large sized hands
or you just play on this thing a lot
these really make it a lot easier to
hold
ergonomically and to play over you know
extended periods for longer sessions
it'll remap your shoulder buttons etc so
it's just really convenient if you have
a PlayStation Vita you should definitely
check out the description because I will
link those little adapters down below
here is the newest addition to the
entire lineup this of course is the
Nintendo Wii U controller with the
screen built-in and something that's
surprising here is that as big as this
controller is it's surprisingly
comfortable to hold but you can of
course still get the classic controller
for the Nintendo Wii U as you can see
here and this one kind of reminds me of
an Xbox 360 controller but of course
it's different because you've got your
two thumb sticks at the same level
instead of being offset so it's kind of
somewhere between a PlayStation and Xbox
controller an honorable mention also
goes to the PlayStation Move system if
you're not familiar with these they kind
of work like a Nintendo Wii controller
you get motion based control for
different active games within the
PlayStation 3 universe the last item
we're going to look at is the Street
Fighter 4 tournament edition arcade
stick this is for the Xbox 360 and you
can guess that this is going to give you
that traditional style of input that you
could have gotten many years ago on an
arcade machine many competitive gamers
still choose this kind of button layout
when playing Street Fighter in a
competitive manner so if you ever go to
like a competitive event where people
are playing this game you will probably
bump into one of
these arcade sticks on the back you have
a couple more buttons for start and
select and there is this little door
which houses your USB cable which is
fairly long so you can sit back on your
couch and use it anyway guys that wraps
up the ultimate controller collection
give you guys a look at everything we've
got in the office right now if you
enjoyed this video please remember to
leave a thumbs up down below pricing and
availability on all the things you saw
are down in the description I will catch
guys on the next one later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
