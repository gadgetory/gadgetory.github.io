right maybe 19 I decided I wanted to
make a sneaker video never made a real
sneaker video but if I was gonna do it I
had to do it big 24 hours ago I did not
own a single Jordan as you could tell
things have changed I decided to embark
on an expedition for an unboxing video
of every Jordan ever quick disclaimer I
decided to focus on game-worn Jordans of
course we know there are 31 pairs of
Jordans but only 18 during his playing
career each one representing a different
stage a different time not just in
Michael Jordan's career but your life
but here's the thing I can't do a video
of this magnitude without calling in a
special favor without calling up the
right man for the job ladies and
gentlemen
Brad Hall excited to be here
lots of shoes which camera do I look at
you can look over there I felt like I
was watching a church sermon just now
I've been told that before in fact very
passionate we got a lot of shoes here
you're kind of a shoe guy though I like
shoes Allah yeah okay I have my own
YouTube channel I talk about cool shoes
you're the perfect guy I think so I'd be
lost without you I think so Jordan one
can I am finna be my guest
can I take the mountains this look at
that that's Chicago Bulls man am i right
does that say Chicago Bulls smells great
though sounds a little bit strange
actually
this smells like that barbershop that's
a site a little small the great color
way in classic classic Chicago Bulls
here right this is a popular Jordan oh
yeah yeah really handsome ship wings
logo wings logo right here laces are
inside of the shoe right now here they
are so it's got pretty much everything
hmm where are those other ones Jack I
actually had to go out and get something
my size look at that right there look at
that this is not an on-court look I
don't like that one yeah it's not an
on-court look you can't go wrong with
this shoe this one you can go home you
can go wrong with it yeah there's what
is that gum is that dum-dum soul I don't
think that's gone all right the box has
changed air Jordan - and now you got
Michael starin right at you like making
eye contact with him this is not my
favorite Jordan I gotta say the older I
get the more I like these really I
really like this on the tongue here
Jordan on the bottom see that there
February 87 a high-flying aerobat rim
rattling jams keep MJ hovering around 37
points per game earned him his first
scoring title in these shoes right here
same box oh man nice now this is a major
development
have at it these are very nice Wow like
I've completely forgot the twos right
now the popular shoes get reissued at
different points this thing we're
holding right here is 14 years old it's
like a museum in here right now all the
non sneaker
these are the laces I don't like seeing
the my Claire Jordan dunking on the back
on the lower laces here we have the
extra three eyelets are those available
for use or those just for looks I think
you can use this it's gonna take a long
time to get I'll do it if you know no
I'm just I was just curious if that's
I'll do it okay
I didn't should I have not done this you
know my size shoe can okay
get at it not the amount it number for
this box is great I noticed you reacted
really strongly to it I knew what was
coming I started i i'm stirred up right
now look at that
hmm I love this pair it's like a little
bit of everything they're working on and
yet it looks like a complete package it
does look like a shoe it looks and look
at this cardboard stick I'm enjoying
this number five oh I like the shoe
though this silver tongue though hey do
not like this detail it sounds like
you're not a fan of the jump man it's
hard to look at these look at this the
lacing opportunities a lot of options I
feel like it was in the make it your way
era where everyone wanted to customize I
think burger king led the way then have
it your way
yeah they were telling everyone that
they could have it their way and this
piggybacked on it that's really not true
do you think the pace of this is going
okay I just feel like we're taking
should we speed it up three minutes per
shoe times 18
that's 54 minutes we're looking at an
hour-long video I feel like I didn't do
that well things have obviously changed
at this point I think the world is
transitioning they want things to look
more high-tech this is
the varsity red colorway leather feels
nice huh what is this is this a dryer
sheet this is a good one yeah maybe the
greatest year in Michael Jordan's career
mm-hmm look at that
I prefer looking at the monitor than
seeing them in real life actually look
at that I feel like they kind of tamed a
little bit from the last one with the
unusual color here but that's because
Olympics the Olympics Michael wins his
third MVP award his sixth NBA scoring
title of Finals MVP award his second NBA
championship and his second Olympic gold
medal that's in one year 1992 MVP of the
league scoring title Finals MVP NBA
championship look at an Olympic gold one
year that's a special shoe should I wear
these things you should put these on
right now all right now push push I feel
like I'm the luckiest 12 year old right
now
I'll take them number eight that is a
very white shoe I think we're back to a
lot filling on yeah yeah maybe too much
I like them if I'm in the mood for
something chunky right that's a
commitment that's a commitment really a
lot of lockdown look at the sparkling in
there it doesn't come together yeah okay
it's like you like peanut butter mm-hmm
you like jelly but you also like lettuce
and those don't go together I couldn't
have said it any better
go bird nein nein let's get it centered
in the shot cue back sorry I just
noticed you were in the shot
should we start over he was in he'll say
bang bang so we have an extra light that
it's just dark are we rolling on this
not a fan he's not a fan we're gonna
we're just gonna keep moving things are
getting better now
we're back in the realm now whoa you
can't talk about the 10 without talking
about this soul talk about history
you're wearing it on your feet 92 MVP
championship 93 MVP championship 94
beyond we are now back in the realm of
that number four I totally disagree I
like that it's just a little a bit of
color kind of seeping out you little
blue teasing you on the rim and you just
want to get in there and see what's down
there nothing else they're not too
flashy
no I think I know it's coming next
because they're numbered and we just hit
10 this is a different unboxing
experience look at this you could start
to tell right away you get the little
claws going on these are number 11 but
they're not just any 11 check that out
Looney Tunes we're talking about the
Space Jam shoot look at the reflection
they're on that
I love it something's gonna get you
fired up this has got to be it I am so
fired up right now something happened
here this is the first carbon-fiber I
think this is the first sneaker in the
group that I pulled out of the box and I
feel like something happened I feel like
I want to just give you let me have a
moment on any water warmup see when you
talk about telling a story you talk
about a shoe that's got a something
attached to it we said history earlier
of course this one the year Jordan went
off to make Space Jam the whole baseball
thing the number 45 temporarily when you
see this sneaker there's so much more
that comes to mind
no I didn't necessarily think I would
have this type of emotional reaction to
this particular shoe but it's happening
right now
a magic trick I had these shoes as a kid
man that's something I love this pair
wow that's a distinctive look without
being overwhelming this comes together
nicely you know it is details but from a
distance it's a package you see the
complexity great contrast just like
their low tops hang not my favorite Hey
looking at it on its own you can see the
inside of the shoe on the other side
that's what it looks like if your foot
we're in it that's actually that works
rolls over easy this way but this way I
can't roll over I think if the Jordans
just tied to this career we still have
one highlight left same model he wore
for his last shot just a different
colorway I love reliving that seeing in
sync that shot unusual tongue maybe the
weirdest tongue we've seen it certainly
looks kind of like what they thought was
futuristic at the time a Jetson of shoes
that's right
like iRobot mm-hmm they're not my
feeling yeah got my favorites do you
like this pair what happened it's like I
just said it's what happened this one I
think it's now coming into its own for
room 16
this thing is removable right this is
not that bad there's something happening
with the this is not that bad
I like these without the shroud yeah I
worried that I'd trip over this or lose
it 17 hang I don't know how to feel
about these this to me feels more like a
Nike shoe than a Jordan this one feels
like a some kind of dress shoe to me
this stuff on the back yeah he likes
going from the court to the boardroom
well said thank you I don't like this
shoe actually
this was the hardest one to find by the
way this came from somebody's personal
collection hardest to get open to no
that's it that's as far as it goes
no yeah I can get it out further I'll do
it later
I don't even this is I don't even it's
unfortunate this is the end though maybe
we wish he retired earlier to be honest
this is the moment right now where we
each select our favorite out of the
bunch I mean we just unboxed 18
different Jordans here who better than
us
to tell you which is the best you go
first okay
Michael Jordan one it's the beginning
and just love this ship in an adult size
two great shoe it's a classic look I see
where you're coming from the funny thing
about this entire experience has been
the less desirable shoes have been the
hardest to find the collecting part of
it is only half the thing like some
people want to wear this history for me
there's something about this package
right here which just screams of a very
particular era this gives me positive
vibes there's a confidence here this is
iconic to me they all are in a way they
all are and one that's up there too
out of the destruction of that time
period this emerged so there you have
every game warn Jordan unboxed here
thanks to my friend Brad Hall thank you
this is fun
