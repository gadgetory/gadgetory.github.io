have the brand new Google pixel three
and three XL in the house not just these
two actually every single color
variation of each model is here as well
for us to check out doing unboxing video
initial impressions and so on
this is obviously a very highly
anticipated device many people in the
tech space in the tech community
couldn't understand couldn't believe
what was going on with the camera in the
previous version this one claims to be
the next level right the new one it's
got to be better hopefully it's better
we're gonna find out I have the three XL
in a color called not pink it's not pink
don't call it pink that's the name of
that color right there this one is
clearly white of course you can also
pick it up in something called just
black these are both 64 gigabyte
versions though they will be available
also in 128 gigabytes the display on the
pixel 3 OLED in fact OLED on both on the
3 it will be a notch list display at 5.5
inches on the 3x L it will go up to 6
point 3 inches with a knotch and
something crazy about both of these is
that they have two forward facing
cameras that are inside of that notch
and stereo speaker so it's a different
type of implementation of the notch in
the three accel giving you a wide-angle
selfie capability and stereo speakers
which I'm excited to check out ok let's
start with the three XL sense for the
color there it's a subtle hue they
brought back some wireless charging
finally on a Google device we have
wireless charging this is actually glass
in the back it's like a matte finished
glass so this will work with Qi wireless
chargers or in fact also an official
accessory here a wireless charge dock
which actually has some special
functionality I'll show you in a minute
a speaker grill up in the top as well as
at the bottom stereo front-facing
speakers this of course is a rarity in
the smartphone space amongst flagships
and other devices as well up here you
can see those two front-facing cameras
which I mentioned earlier one wide-angle
and one standard fingerprint scanner is
in a familiar location over here where
your index
finger will sit that single lens system
capable of some incredible computational
photography is up in this spot right
here now the frame itself is made of
aluminum so pretty much the whole
construction is either aluminum or glass
though I do like the fact that the glass
back is matte it's resistant somewhat to
fingerprints and smudging you have USB
type-c there's your SIM card tray accent
color on your power switch there is a
green accent color on the clearly white
version a charge brick which yes it
happens to be a quick charge brick fast
charge capable seven hours of battery
life with a 15 minute charge nice to see
the quick charge brick in the box to go
along with wireless charging a rarity
you don't see this too frequently
anymore some headphones in the box they
are Type C headphones after all there is
no headphone jack
unfortunately on the pixel 3 pixel 3 XL
but I guess this is the next best thing
you're getting some bundled type C
earbuds and you also get an adapter to
you can go from type C to a mini jack
connector if you want to use some legacy
headphones or some higher quality
headphones that still use this
particular connector the type-c cable
itself and then also this adapter that
goes from type C to the classic USB
connector this could be used to migrate
over to this device from your previous
one okay so let's go ahead and unbox all
of them and we can do a quick comparison
of the various color and size options
it's eight on boxing now the thing about
the glass on the back of these devices
is it hardly even looks like glass at
first I was wondering I'm like is that
even glass but I've been told that this
is Gorilla Glass v soft touch glass and
yes it does feel soft there's almost no
fingerprint effect on this glass now the
thing I like about this one is it does
have a contrasting color on the front
because like the whole front is black
the back is white I mean it's kind of a
nice little touch you get the accent
button it's just a little bit more
unique so here's your first look at the
displays we have the XL on the left the
standard pixel three on the right six
point three inches 5.5 inches they're
both OLED of course we do have the notch
there's been a lot of discussion about
this notch in particular on the XL
version I did mention earlier at least
in this case get an extra camera lens
and the stereo speaker I've also been
told that you'll be able to turn off
this notch in software at a later date
so it would actually end up looking kind
of like the standard pixel looks here at
the top you'd have a similar bezel there
if you did choose to do that in software
so you get a little bit more resolution
in the bigger one this is qhd+ compared
to F HD Plus slightly higher ppi on the
XL version also so the bigger one is
just under 3500 milliamp hours whereas
the smaller guy is just under 3000 the
regular pixel 3 it feels surprisingly
foreign because you know smart phones
especially flagship smartphones have
been growing every single iteration I
can see this being popular people who
are looking for something a bit more
subdued easier to hold in one hand
somebody with a smaller grip it's super
comfy to hold myself I'd gravitate
towards the XL for the bigger display of
course the bigger battery now these are
not going to be the champions when it
comes to screen to body ratio this is
obviously an improvement over the
previous version but you still have
bezels
here the question is going to be whether
or not that's worth it for you can you
be convinced with two front-facing
cameras can you be convinced with
hopefully better speakers that's going
to be up to you to decide nonetheless
that is the trade-off speaking of
speakers let's go ahead and do the thing
let's test out the stereo speakers on
this unit this is crazy loud this is way
better than the previous version first
impressions here these are some speakers
there's some of the loudest I've tested
in here this is our first glance here at
what happens with the black bars you can
go ahead and pinch to fill the screen
zoom to fill kind of giant bezels to be
fair now there was a lot of talk about
the display on the previous version OLED
this looks like a completely new
component to me also if you head to the
settings you can kind of toggle in your
preferences for the display so that it
suits your taste buds specifically
there's adaptive brightness which you
can turn on some advanced settings here
for colors which can go from natural to
boosted to adaptive now you probably
also noticed that the home button the
navigation region down here has changed
a little bit on this particular device
you can now swipe up from there for
multitasking and you can actually swipe
across to to move between apps like this
there's also split-screen as well so if
I tap on an app icon here I can go to
split screen mode go ahead and pick my
other app and then make my adjustments
from there so it's right within the
multitasking maybe I'll actually use it
now because I don't have to go looking
for it I'm not really sure but it's in
the pixel device at this point now I
know what you guys are most excited
about you're sitting there watching this
video you're screaming you're saying Lou
what about the camera there's a lot of
pressure on this device to live up to
the legend of the previous version pixel
can it do it I don't know let's launch
it let's take a peek here now you can
also employ some degree of digital zoom
as you can see here
very interesting if I tap on the face of
the little figure there see how now it
is tracking focus that's a nice little
frame right there pixel cameras I don't
need to tell you you guys already know
but like there's some really nice stuff
happening that's just a simple frame
blue what about the portrait mode and oh
my goodness would you look at that holy
smokes
preliminary video this is this product
is not retail yet alright I can't say
too much test too much but you can look
at that you're allowed to look at that
that's fair very vibrant very wonderful
okay nice of course on the pixel there
is a portrait mode on the front-facing
camera there's actually also an official
beauty mode but look at that would you
live see it's you can toggle it off as
far as I'm concerned with
post-processing when it comes to
complexion and things like this that's
got to be an option you gotta be able to
turn it off if you don't want it so they
have three settings you can leave it off
you go to natural you go to soft I'm
gonna leave it off so currently it's in
the standard focal length if I hit minus
here I will go to the wide-angle selfie
which actually is a different lens this
will give me a lot more play if I have
extra people in the frame where I want
to capture something that's behind me
and not just my face boom that's a nice
looking guy right there
hey Jack what'd you say do I look like
I'm wearing makeup look at that wow this
is the kind of stuff I'm looking for
this level of detail the beard hairs are
one step the pores on my face are a
totally different step that is a ton of
detail this is the standard focal length
if I hit the minus here you see how much
more I get in frame we get Jack in frame
over there now we can go ahead and
that's a nice wide selfie scenario
that's the amount of range that you're
gonna be able to get out of the wide
lens now something else to mention about
the camera in the Advanced Settings
here's something I like you have control
over hdr+ which will show a manual
control for HDR plus if you want to
toggle off the processing that's taking
place in your images you can go a step
further as well and right within the
native photo app you
shoot raw plus JPEG so you get the
maximum amount of data out of the camera
sensor or if you want to make sure that
there's no processing taking place on
your images if you're that type of
person I like having these options
available there's even an option to
store videos more efficiently in the
h.265 codec instead of h.264 all options
that you can toggle on or off the back
camera is 12 point 2 megapixels and the
front is 8 but of course you can select
various different settings if you choose
to but that's the default setting now
the rear camera is capable of 4k at
30fps and it also features a fused image
stabilization using both optical and
software based stabilization for video
now there's another feature in here
called top shot which will take a motion
image and then through that set of
frames it will aim to select the best
frame automatically this whole thing is
a movement you see like this and its
suggestion is either here recommended
another recommended one there's probably
some that are not good like there or
there or there
now speaking of selfies is also a
photobooth option allows you to just
smile to trigger a photo let's see if
this works Jackie ready here we go
waiting for my lips to move you see this
is what it takes it takes a feature like
this to get a real smile now something
else that piqued my interest on this
particular device is in the settings
menu I know that seems strange like what
what are you doing digging through the
settings menu there's something called
digital wellbeing and if I click on this
this is all about how you use your smart
phone where you're spending your time
how you might want to make adjustments
to that time spent you can see here
it'll tell me how much use I've had
today and where it was spent Google
camera photos YouTube you can set timers
and reminders so that you're not
spending too much time in apps or on
your phone in general you can use a
feature called
Shh placing your phone facedown on a
surface maybe at a restaurant at home on
your nightstand we'll put the device
into do not disturb mode just by placing
it down like that give you a little bit
more control over your consumption on
your smartphone lens is built in to the
camera app so just by swiping over two
more and selecting lens grab some text
like right here ain´t boom it'll pick it
up
you think lens will know about my shoe
right now tap on his shoe Oh nailed it
and boom these are them actually that's
them right there now I mentioned earlier
that this device has wireless charging
um of course a big fan of wireless
charging I really missed it on the
previous version of the pixel and not
only that they're actually making their
own version first party accessory
wireless charge doc that's this guy
right here it's a soft touch kind of
material and it works like this you just
drop it in drop the phone right like
that
boom starts charging it's also quick
wireless charging so it's not gonna take
forever to charge up your device that's
of course one of the criticisms of
wireless chargers not in this case
now this display here it kind of acts as
your - you can imagine this beside your
bed you have Google assistant which you
can trigger sort of like a Google home
you could say ok Google asked questions
and so on you can also click on my day
which would do you know sort of break
down the weather your commute it can
cycle through photos from whichever
folder you identify there you go as you
can tell these people they're all they
all love each other very much now the
other thing we do is since it's sort of
a non multimedia mode is we can use this
to trigger some audio some music play
Drake you can see that the view looks
different since it knows it's docked
this piece here is gonna retail for 79
bucks I realize we didn't even talk
about the price of these devices holy
smokes
okay the XL the 3 XL is going to start
at 899 USD and the non XL the standard
pixel 3 will start at $7.99 USD so
obviously these things are squarely
planted in the premium price range so
now
give it up to you guys what do you think
should I switch over to this device huh
you want a little bit more a little bit
more testing a bit more of a
comprehensive evaluation I think you
deserve it I think I do too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
