you've probably seen all kinds of videos
about Electric skateboards it seems like
the hottest thing right now but believe
it or not I have not done a video on an
electric skateboard at all yet but
that's changing right now because I've
got the Carbon series from evolve
skateboards and I've been pumped up to
receive this thing it's made out of
carbon fibers it's super cool looking
it's fast and it can even be transformed
from a street version with street tires
to an actual off-road version so I'm
definitely going to injure myself I
don't know which configuration they've
sent is kind of a surprise that's the
cool part you can tell it's a pretty big
box but let's crack it open charge it up
and get into some trouble now keep in
mind my experience level with electric
skateboards is limited whoa the thing is
serious that's like an actual
transportation device you got the grip
tape with the cutouts you can see the
carbon fiber the whole way through and
look at the size of these tires
if you've ever rolled any kind of
electronic transportation in the past
you know that when you're going on a
sidewalk for example or over some bumps
having a small street tire makes it a
little bit more difficult so a tire like
this just gonna roll right over that you
hardly even notice it whoa on the back
where the drivetrain is that's pretty
well on the belt that goes around here
it's cool because I guess the battery
unit is all enclosed in here man and
carbon fiber looks nice and then over
here we have a power switch and this is
the charge port it looks like I've got
the street conversion kit allen wrench
probably for the wheels tires and here's
the remote whoa got like a screen on it
so this is how you're gonna accelerate
slow down charges over microUSB and it
even has a screen on it that's pretty
wild let's see has some power it'll tell
you how fast you're picking Wow
how far you've traveled how fast you're
going and a percentage of battery life
all on this display right here that is
pretty sweet
our charge brick extension cable and
here's the conversion kit street
conversion kit since you could tell it's
got the off-road tires already on it
some road-ready street wheels I'm gonna
be learning as we go as we go ride this
thing along with you so let's take this
over to the new studio where we have a
lot of space and let's see if I can
stand up straight or not
Haho so the thing has some charge in it
in fact what I like is the remote is
actually telling me ninety-one percent
charge over here and another thing I
noticed just in experiment if you tap
this button here you can put it into
reverse mode now keep in mind has the it
has the off-road tires on so the center
of gravity is like it's up a little bit
higher I feel like I have a lot of
control over it surprising amount of
control and can make pretty tight turns
too now keep in mind guys I'm not like a
skateboarder at all
I got no skills well you say Tom you
ready what's your experience level
skateboarding not great oh you're gonna
you're gonna feel it in a second and
feel more comfortable
Oh little more juice alright get people
some feedback right in this microphone
what you think pretty amazing
I'm not gonna go to watch fashion over
here oh yeah definitely in a straight
line it's on Eco mode right now as well
oh no you put on GT mode yeah I hit a
button right before you put on GT mode
that's going pretty oh let me try let me
try okay I was on eco mode oh oh that's
what you does the difference Oh baby Wow
I think Eco mode for the record I think
Eco mode it's perfectly fine for most
people
like I felt breezy enough on the Eco
mode which is also going to give you a
little bit better battery life I assume
based on a name but this GP you want to
get crazy we did the conversion on it
it's now got the street wheels
if you've ever messed around with the
skateboard if you've put new wheels new
trucks on a skateboard if you can handle
a an Allen wrench you're pretty much
good to go but it's a much smoother ride
than the other off-road tires having the
lower center of gravity or just being
closer to the floor whoa you're riding
around on on the street or on flat
surfaces or whatever you're not planning
on going off-road this is probably the
better bet for you but the best thing
about this skateboard is that it can do
both so this unit also has a
regenerative braking it can actually
charge up its own battery if you use the
braking system on here so give you a
little bit more juice in the entire time
we've been riding it we're down to about
80% battery life and I think we started
around 87 so either way this thing is a
ton of fun and it does bulb off-road
street wheels indoor/outdoor it's a
versatile unit it's a ton of fun and Tom
agrees with me Tom there you go Tom had
fun give Tom a thumbs up okay
I'm Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
