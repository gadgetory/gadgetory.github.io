therapy comm and today we're taking a
look at the canon 320 x speed light now
to some of you this might look like a
standard everyday flash but really it's
quite a bit more in fact it's a combo
unit it's got a traditional flash for
still photography on the top and right
below it it's got an LED video light and
the reason that's important is because
so many digital SLRs shoot high quality
video these days so why not mount a nice
video light up there that can also be a
flash if you need to jump into still
photography now I'm gonna use this unit
with my Canon t2i but it'll obviously
work with any of the newer digital SLRs
that Canon makes for example the 60d the
5d the 7d they all shoot high quality
video and stills so here's the flash and
Canon seems to ship it in a nice
protective case here it's made out of
nylon and it's nice to have you know
when you're traveling with photo gear
there's so much of it the more
protection the better because you tend
to throw it around whether you mean to
or not
now the flash is pretty light especially
considering that it's a combo unit
you've got the standard flash as well as
that LED video light below here's the
controls on the back side you got
controls for the LED light along with
controls for the traditional flash the
slave on and off switch down at the
bottom here now the traditional flash
portion is adjustable of course you can
set the angle that suits your needs and
below that here we can see the LED video
light and of course the amount on the
bottom for the hotshoe on your camera
here's the battery compartment to put
rechargeables in there if you want a
closer look at the controls on the back
side and here we see the adjustable
portion which can also adjust for tele
obviously that's for telephoto lenses
and here you get a better look at that
angle adjustment
the reason you might want to shoot
upright is to lessen the harshness of
the flashes effect you might want to
bounce it off the ceiling so here's what
the flash looks like mountain on my t2i
and as you can see she's ready for
action anyway guys if you haven't yet
