another video and today I'm gonna tell
you about the top 5 reasons to choose
over ear headphones like these and the
top 5 reasons to choose over ear
headphones when compared to those little
dinky in-ear earbuds or otherwise now
for this demonstration I'm going to be
using the brand new high five and he3 50
a little bit about these headphones open
back design premium materials huge 50
millimeter drivers and available
exclusively at mass drop and temporarily
this is a collaboration a relaunch of a
classic these things are a huge drop off
of the retail cost they're available for
about a hundred bucks and to be quite
honest it's going to be difficult to
find headphones of this caliber at that
price point so if you want to get in on
the action link in the description go
check it out so why over ear headphones
number one the driver these have giant
50 millimeter drivers and no matter what
you do in an in-ear style headphone you
simply will not have as big of a speaker
on your head what does this mean for you
generally speaking a better listening
experience bigger driver more sound
this is acoustics 101 you can have a big
driver that's terrible you can have a
small driver that's incredible but in
general general terms these guys are
going to have bigger drivers which do a
better job most of the time at
reproducing a wider frequency range all
the way down to those low frequencies
that we all love number two longer
listening sessions so with this set of
headphones I've got here this is a
pretty lightweight over ear and it's
adjustable so chances are it's going to
be comfortable for you to wear for very
long periods of time where the inside of
your ear generally speaking is going to
be more susceptible to fatigue so you
can throw a pair of these on and three
hours can float by as you listen to your
Pink Floyd or whatever it is that you
choose plus the adjustability means that
they're gonna fit better for more people
number three sound stay
this is terminology that gets thrown
around in the audio world and with an
open back design the experience you have
is a lot more similar so what it's like
to be in a live venue where it kind of
it kind of feels like sound is coming
from a further distance away like you
are in an environment of sound it's very
difficult to have this very wide
soundstage that comes with an open back
with an in-ear design number four at
home listening generally speaking when
you've got a set up you got a record
player you might have one of these guys
right down here I've actually got a dark
voice tube amplifier like this one
generally speaking you're gonna want to
give them something that's easy to put
on easy to share you're not gonna have
those kind of hygiene issues with in-ear
headphones so for those kinds of social
listening environments maybe in the
living room or in your bedroom or so on
these are just gonna be a little bit
easier to pass around the fifth reason
why you should choose over ear
headphones when compared to in here is
for gaming or movies anything that's
mixed in a kind of potentially surround
environment when you're in a game and
you hear you know a gunshot coming from
a particular direction that larger
driver on the outside of your ear is
going to do a really good job of helping
you identify the exact location of that
sound these things are going to do a
fantastic job of delivering that so
there you have it that's five reasons
the most important reasons to me to
choose over ear headphones when compared
to in-ear style if you want to jump on
the mass drop for the Aichi 350 become
one of the few people on the planet to
actually have these headphones at this
price click the link in the description
and also stay tuned because coming up in
the next video tomorrow it's gonna be
the top 5 reasons to pick in-ear
headphones compared to over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
