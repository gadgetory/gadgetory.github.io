my casual opinionated review of the
13-inch MacBook Air that was just
released and just announced at WWDC this
of course is the Ivy Bridge model and
it's got some new features and functions
not too many but what I really want to
do in this video is talk about the
difference between the MacBook Air and
the MacBook Pro the one that was also
just announced with the retina display
because I've been getting a ton of
questions from people about whether or
not they should pick up the latest
generation MacBook Air or if they should
spend some extra cash and get themselves
the MacBook Pro so I'm going to get
straight to the point here this computer
is $1200 that's the base model 13-inch
you're going to get a 1.8 gigahertz
processor dual core of course when you
step up to the MacBook Pro you can get a
quad core you're going to get the Retina
display so on and so forth but more
importantly than any of that stuff any
of those specs are you know that number
driven stuff that we could talk about I
think we need to talk about money this
right here is $1200
the MacBook Pro is if you're looking at
the one with the Retina display which is
obviously the most compelling model
starts at 2200 dollars is that computer
twice the computer that this one is is
the cost justified well I'd say for a
select a number of people it is I mean
if you really know how to stress out a
quad-core CPU and you really want 16
gigs of ram and you need you know larger
SSD storage so on and so forth you know
who you are and I'm talking to you and
you probably don't even need to watch a
video like this because you know how to
use you know those improved
specifications but for somebody who's on
the fence and sort of thinking hey could
I get by with a MacBook Air and half the
investment I think you can and in some
ways I think the MacBook Air is actually
a better purchase for casual users
students people who travel a lot etc
then the MacBook Pro would be now I'm
going to tell you why it's got the 13
inch form factor and it's only three
pounds now that's obviously the same as
the previous gen MacBook Air so this
would apply if you're going to pick up
an older model as well
now this particular size and form factor
is significantly better for airplanes
backpacks it's a lot more friendly in
that
sense you're not giving up a ton in
terms of screen real estate of course
the new Retina display packs this
incredible figure 28 80 by 1800 but
currently there are a few things that
can take advantage of a resolution like
that while remaining legible people have
been reporting that websites don't look
that great and you actually spend a lot
of time down rezzing the screen meaning
that you're not actually going to get
the the represented workspace that's
advertised you're not literally going to
get 28 80 by 1800 in terms of work space
of course pictures image based things
and of course as application to begin to
become optimized for that Retina display
things are going to get better and look
more beautiful but again that sort of a
niche the niche end of things when you
start to worry about that I say the
other the other things that I mentioned
earlier are far more practical
considerations when you're talking about
size weight and cost now from a
performance standpoint 9 out of 10 or
maybe even 99 out of 100 users are going
to be completely happy with the
performance that this particular base
model 13-inch MacBook Pro can deliver at
$1200 the vast majority of computer
users are doing very basic tasks you
know the number of people who are doing
intensive video editing on 1080p files
is growing but it still doesn't
represent the substantial amount of
computer users in general now this
particular MacBook Air has been improved
over the previous generation not a ton
you now have Ivy Bridge so you've got
better processing power you've got USB
3.0 on here now you've also got an
improved webcam which I think the
previous generation should have had in
it you've got a 720p webcam that's the
same as the other MacBook models which
is a good thing and maybe one of the
most important factors is now the latest
model can be specked out to 8 gigabytes
of RAM whereas the previous generation
maxed out at 4 gigabytes now the reason
that's important is because if you are
the kind of user that does want to do
some video editing from time to time you
can really bridge that gap between this
model and the pro model by throwing in a
little bit of extra RAM one downside of
trying to add extra RAM is the fact that
you can't do it at a later date this
thing is not users
serviceable in any manner but then again
neither is the retina model MacBook Pro
people have been reporting that
everything is soldered on the board in
that particular model as well so you're
not gonna be able to upgrade Ram on that
one either whatever you buy from the
factory is going to be with what you're
stuck with so if you do pick up one of
these MacBook Airs and you think you
might get into multimedia eventually
then you might want to consider specking
it out with eight gigs of ram from the
factory I'd probably leave the processor
where it is again you're going to start
spending more money than you should on a
cost of performance ratio if you start
upgrading that I'd go with the base
stock model with the smaller SSD of
course unless you know that you're going
to need more storage but with the stock
model SSD and then spec it out with
eight gigs of RAM that's my
recommendation this is a great machine
this is I mean I would recommend this to
almost anybody like I said the only
people that I would suggest step up to
the latest gen MacBook Pro which of
course I don't have yet but I can't wait
to get my hands on are those that know
exactly how they're going to utilize
that extra power because otherwise this
thing is going to be sufficient for nine
out of ten computer users as I said
before and in some cases it's going to
be a major upgrade over what you already
have that's something that's amazing to
say when you're talking about a computer
that is as a 13 inch form factor it's
three pounds this is still a marvelous
design and it's still amazing to me that
they were able to pack what they packed
into a form factor like this I mean the
thing is solid - it doesn't feel flimsy
in any way you get lots of battery life
as you guys can tell I'm a big fan of
this particular machine and and other
than that I don't think I've got
anything else to mention I hope you
enjoyed this casual style review
hopefully once I get my hands all right
I'm definitely going to get my hands on
the latest generation MacBook Pro with
the Retina display and at that point I
might be able to put them side-by-side
and do some actual speed comparisons and
things like that but as I mentioned
before most of that information only is
only really represented in those tests
in real world scenarios for most people
the performance difference between a
MacBook Air like this and the
top-of-the-line Retina Display MacBook
Pro is not going to be significant
enough to warrant double the cost that's
my opinion
take
or leave it I hope you appreciated this
particular review if you did make sure
to hit that like and favorite button
down below leave your own comments I do
appreciate it and other than that I'll
catch you guys on the next video if you
haven't subscribed yet please go ahead
and do that too and yeah catch you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
