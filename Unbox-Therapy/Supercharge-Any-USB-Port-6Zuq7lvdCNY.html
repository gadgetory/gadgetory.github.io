another video and today we're gonna be
checking out something that I stumbled
upon wow you remember there was a
website called that I stumbled upon on
Amazon it is called u charger
essentially it allows you to charge up
devices from your laptop's USB port that
you wouldn't otherwise be able to charge
from those ports like an iPad or a
tablet but then on top of that it
reduces the amount of charge time that
you would expect to have on things that
would charge off those ports like a
smart phone Lou that made no sense what
you said I don't know I feel like it
made a little bit if you're looking at
an iPhone normally off a standard USB
port it would take four hours and ten
minutes to completely recharge with this
guy it's two hours and thirty minutes if
you plug in a device like an iPad or
something it's like do you want to sync
do you want to use iTunes you want to do
this you want to do that you don't want
to do any of those things you just want
to charge what juice if it's the juice
you're looking for this will also stop
those prompts cool okay awesome
what do you need to do pull it out and
plug it in a parent look at that what an
unboxing experience Jack now you might
be thinking hey but Lou my little power
brick is not much bigger than that okay
fine
but then you're still using two wall
outlets to get recharge speed this is
one wall outlet maybe you're in a hotel
room or something and then you're just
getting more juice out of something you
already have damn it Jack don't these
people get it what else - I don't think
I need to know anything else I have an
iPad here the big boy the machismo the
El Chapo and see if we can now charge an
iPad can you see that there jack I mean
it's really not that big plug that into
my laptop have power kind of important
ooh cool so when you're getting juice
you have a blue LED into the iPad pro
boom charging instant charging so we're
just sucking juice out of a straw like
it's a juice box
remember Welch's unbelievable concord
grapes give him a shot
not sponsored by Welch's Welch's used to
have they had a great commercial with
the kid
so did McCain with the French fries
remember the McCain kid just eating that
I love that just basic you don't need
anything he's just enjoying this goddamn
french fries you want to join too why am
I getting required not IRA bitch
alright I've got an iPhone now with a
crazy Swiss Army knife kind of case on
it if you haven't seen that video go
check it out anyways what do we have oh
this is completely dead but it is
charging let's see how quickly we can
get from the dreaded iPhone I have no
power screen to I'm alive ah see yo face
look at it juice that didn't take too
long
anybody who has experience with that
dreaded screen that wasn't terrible what
do you think a couple minutes really not
even and there we go
juiced and charging put it in your bag
of tricks tricks are for kids
hey the cereal right before you go say
hi to everybody on unbox therapy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
