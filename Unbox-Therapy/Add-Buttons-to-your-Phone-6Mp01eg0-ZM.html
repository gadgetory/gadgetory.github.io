little bit now I'm back in the comfy
studio it's really not that comfy not
this exact spot
it's a white table and a green chair
some of you might not know the chair is
green anyhow what's up guys Lew here
back with another video and today we're
gonna check out something called dimple
dimple dimple dot IO your custom buttons
for android NFC devices sounds cool this
is a simple inexpensive way to add more
buttons to your device and it doesn't
need any kind of external power source
it just needs NFC on your phone it can
do various things like launch
applications it can turn on the
flashlight trigger your camera this is
exactly as it sounds there's really not
too much to explain here it's more of a
demonstration so I'm gonna go ahead and
as you can see here there is a little
bit of a QuickStart guide
clean the back of your gadget turn on
NFC try out a little bit
try out the location long hold a button
install the app or movie adhesive
backing stick it to the device follow
the instructions and then as you can see
here the final step is buttons with an
exclamation point it will work on
Android devices 4.0 and above with NFC
but it excludes metal phones like the
HTC One I apologize HTC people alright
so let's go ahead and cut across this
dotted line and as you can see I sort of
missed that line just like that we have
the dimpled IO I have a galaxy s6 U and
I'm sort of thinking it would make sense
here because when you're holding it
right that's sort of right where your
finger lines up comfortably comfy little
spot it's just a 3m adhesive
let me follow the steps here clean your
device okay got some cleaner here from a
company called woosh turn on the NFC
okay NFC turn it on baby
so rather than permanently installing
the buttons right away you want to make
sure that the location you hope to put
them is going to work fine with NFC so
you just sort of hold it in that
location and then long press one of the
buttons
and if it picks it up you'll go straight
to the dimple IO app which I'm gonna
install right now I'm gonna line it up
lined up thank you for purchasing simple
this tutorial teach how to use it do we
want the tutorial alright give it a
chance he uses NFC okay fine we're gonna
leave NSC on press and hold a button now
tells me I successfully press the button
thank you for that press a button to
edit all right the top button okay hold
it this is a pop-up window this button
is empty alright let me add something to
that I want to turn on my flashlight
success saved okay let me do something
on the second button ad and let's launch
an application this time we will launch
the camera app save and then press the
button to save that is easy alright
third button and now you can open a URL
that's kind of cool call a number it
could be a media button for play pause
if you are listening to like a podcast
or something like that call a specific
number that you might call often take a
picture just right away take a picture
okay I'm gonna try that and then I'm
gonna program the last button use a
third-party plugin open a URL change
your settings settings might be in it
might be nice and you can pick a
specific setting so change your Wi-Fi
setting Bluetooth to screen rotation and
then in action to either turn on turn
off toggle what about screen rotation
let's try that and let's say that the
button toggles it toggles the lock I
suppose okay yeah check it out that is
locking the orientation now beautiful
alright now this button it just takes a
picture right away whoa that is fast
get over here for a second Jack come
here and take a quick picture yeah right
in there
right in you people think you're
imaginary
that's fast okay that's very useful for
that reason alone not launching the
camera app but just snapping a photo
snap now the top button I programmed for
what I can't remember now ah flashlight
show you guys up there see that alright
when you need a flashlight you're
searching for something real quick bow
buttons buttons for everyone and then
the nice thing here is that this doesn't
require any kind of maintenance or
charging or anything it's it just sits
there and that's that's all you really
ever need to do with it this thing is
probably the quickest way you're gonna
get some things done I don't know I
don't think there's a quicker way to
access your flashlights about
youtube.com slash more top five more top
five I've reprogrammed the nipple never
thought I'd say that combination of
words press down the button boom right
to my favorite YouTube page more top 5
yeah this thing is cool this thing is
definitely cool anyway if you're
interested in it I'll drop a link down
in the description but as you can see it
does some simple functions that you
would otherwise have to navigate to in
order to get to and it does it in a in a
physical way something else to mention
you can put more than one dimple on the
back of your NFC enabled Android device
you could put multiple dimples if you
get addicted to these nipples alright
