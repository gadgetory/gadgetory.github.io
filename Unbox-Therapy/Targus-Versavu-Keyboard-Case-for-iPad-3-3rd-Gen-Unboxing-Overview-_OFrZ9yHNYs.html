therapy and today we're taking a look at
the targis versus view case for the
latest generation iPad the iPad 3 as
I've been calling it now for the purpose
of this unboxing targis has also
included the three-in-one stylus which
is a capacitive touchscreen stylus a
laser pointer and ballpoint pen all in
one package we're gonna get started out
on the case the Versa view case once
again that's what it's called and as
you'll notice it's leather in
construction you've got some nice
stitching on the exterior but it also
has some special functionality first and
foremost it includes a bluetooth
keyboard built right into the case
turning your iPad into sort of a netbook
if you will giving you traditional input
functionality that you don't have via
the touchscreen you've also got a slot
to hold a pen and here is the important
part of the verse of U and the reason
it's probably called the verse of U is
the fact that this portion here spins so
you insert your iPad into this clip and
you can use it either in portrait mode
or in landscape mode whichever you find
more convenient for the specific app
that you're using other than that
there's not much else included in the
box you've got a little bit of paperwork
and then you've got a mini USB cable
surprising it's not micro most things
are micro nowadays but anyway it doesn't
matter you've got a mini USB cable for
charging up that bluetooth keyboard that
is installed in the case as I mentioned
earlier installation is really a breeze
you just drop the iPad down into the
clip and push down you'll hear a slight
little click noise and you know that
you've got it inserted correctly pulling
it out is basically the exact same
procedure in Reverse so it's not a big
headache getting it in and out of here
so as a case it's actually pretty nice
looking and it doesn't add too much bulk
it's not overwhelming or anything like
that easily something that you can carry
with you without worrying about carrying
an extra bag if you don't want to so
here's a better look at the design one
thing I was worried about was whether or
not the keyboard was going to scratch
the screen on the iPad B but they've
designed it in such a way that there's a
suede Ridge which elevates above the
keyboard so that's actually not an issue
at all you've also got cutout
for all the important components on your
iPad so they remain functional even when
it's installed in the case there's a
look at that platform I mentioned
earlier that elevates the iPad up off
the keyboard it's actually a really nice
design all around I can see it adding
some functionality to your iPad say if
you're a student or something along
those lines
maybe you're somewhere in between
whether knowing if you need an iPad or a
laptop maybe this can sort of bridge the
gap a little bit now a long top you've
got iPad specific shortcut keys which
are gonna make using this device a lot
easier you've got shortcuts of course
for search to bring up the on-screen
keyboard to lock the screen volume play
pause so on and so forth you've got an
on/off button along top and an LED
indicator to tell you whether you're
connected or not well via bluetooth of
course that's how this operates now this
is a chiclet style keyboard very similar
to the Apple keyboard if you have your
used one on a MacBook MacBook Air or
even the Apple wireless keyboard but it
is shrunk down a little bit if you have
huge hands you're gonna have to adjust
that's for sure but it's usable
nonetheless and I have I'd say large
average to large sized hands and I had
no trouble typing on it at all next
let's talk about the three-in-one stylus
that targus has included the very first
thing that I notice as I pull it out
here is that it's got some good weight
to it you know like an expensive pen
would have you have three batteries on
the side of course for powering up the
laser pointer portion not sure how much
use that's going to get from me and then
more importantly you have the capacitive
touch portion on what seems like the
wrong end of the pen but it'll work
nonetheless I guess you don't want to
use the ballpoint and I think your
touchscreen right so it functions just
as you'd expect it has slightly more
precision of course than the tip of your
finger and one nice added incentive of
using a stylus is the fact that you're
not going to get smudging all over your
screen from you know your fingerprints
or if there's anything on your hands or
anything along those lines and
highlighting texts and things like that
is slightly more precise as well so I
can imagine this would also be useful
for art applications drawing
applications sketching so on and so
forth I don't do too much of that on my
iPad so that's not a huge issue one
thing one little drawback for me
is the fact that the pen holder that's
built into the case doesn't fit the
official target stylus it won't slide
under here either way that I tried plus
if I use the clip portion which is how I
expect you'd insert a normal pen you
can't get it in there it's too tight so
it's kind it's kind of weird that their
pen wouldn't work with their case but
nonetheless I suppose it's an
afterthought something that they missed
no real big deal the case is cool the
stylus is cool if you guys enjoyed this
