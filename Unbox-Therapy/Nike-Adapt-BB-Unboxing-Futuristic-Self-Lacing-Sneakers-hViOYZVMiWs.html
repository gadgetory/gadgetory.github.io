planet earth new adapt bebe from Nike
they're not even officially out yet I've
seen a couple videos from the Nike event
this is an area where there hasn't been
a lot of Technology with the exception
of the couple of previous versions of
the adapt series the self-lacing shoes
that Nike has put out in the past
there's an app that goes with it
technology meets sneakers and finally in
fashion robust enough to be used by
professionals suggested retail price on
the tag there are 350 sneaker heads are
paying 350 for sneakers that do a lot
less than this ok so there we go
ok box in a box situation so as I
understand it you can either lace these
up with the electronic buttons right on
the side of the sneaker or you can do so
through the app the app is not out yet
officially so I'll be using the sneaker
to tighten these up look at that Wow mmm
all wrapped up and whatnot whoa
high tech city now the thing you can
probably tell right away you can't see
any laces so there's actually a wire
system in here some people like that
some people not as much even with the
motor in here these things still feel
like a typical basketball shoe and
that's what they're targeted at the nike
adapt charger 1.0 that's one downside of
having self-lacing sneakers is I mean
they got to get some juice in there but
wireless charging is kind of convenient
I guess you just put this down and the
sneakers just drop on and that's it they
charge it's a little mat we have a
charge brick and a USB cable actually
type-c connector as well so the LED
lights on the side will change their
color depending upon your charge level
though even if these things do run out
of battery life when you have them on
they will always keep enough battery in
them to at least loosen up so you can
get your foot out so it's always like a
reserve battery power in there
apparently you can get like 2 weeks of
battery life lacing unlacing
and so on okay so you power a mom
by pressing and holding any button on
the side of the shoe for one second and
then you place the shoe flat on the
ground slide your foot inside the shoe
will automatically tighten to a
comfortable pre-programmed fit you can
adjust your fit by tapping the front
button this guy here to tighten or the
back button to loosen push and hold both
buttons simultaneously for two seconds
in order to save your fit when you do
install the nike adapt app when it's
fully available you could have like a
basketball fit where you have it really
tight and then you could have a casual
fit saved as well where you could toggle
between the two quickly or some people
like to have their laces untied when
they're just I don't know heading out to
brunch and whatnot oh that was the noise
of the motor listen to this here we go
you can kind of see that see that Jack
so the mesh is still extended out but
even the interior of the shoe has
tightened quite a bit the heel came in
kind of locking the foot in as well what
do you say boy should I try them on why
not that's already a pretty snug fit to
be clear this is a very snug fit right
out of the gate just just getting them
on but let's go ahead and tighten them a
bit here we go oh baby oh my goodness
gracious
and now my foot is being gripped like
substantially a lot more support than I
expected to have I mean it's like having
a very tight tighten shoe
been up here
I'm kind of into these whether or not
the look is for you I guess that depends
on your taste it's meant to look
futuristic and I think that it does
there's an R on the right foot and an L
on the left foot
if you tighten them up via the app
there's two sliders one for the left
foot one for the right foot I'm glad
obviously the DS are not strictly a
gimmick that said there are 350 bucks
everything in the future is supposed to
be electrified or automated in some
sense even your sneakers
it's the adapt BB and I think this is
the first unboxing on the Internet so
how about that what you say jack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
