to give a quick shout out for a project
a collaboration I got to do with
YouTube's own Phil DeFranco we had a lot
of fun things went off the rails did a
little bit of trivia and there was even
some punishment involved for the loser
that's about all I can tell you right
here so check out the link in the
description there's also an annotation
somewhere here so watch this video then
go watch that one thank you very much
guys show some unbox therapy love much
appreciation what's up guys Lew here
back with another video and today I'm
going to be showing you how you can
substantially increase the storage on
your Playstation 4 got one over here
you'll see it in a minute using this
Nyko modular databank it will allow you
to put a 3.5 inch hard drive so
something like this I've got a six
terabyte Western Digital black over here
so something like that or whatever it is
that you have lying around it allow you
to put that on top of your ps4 now the
reason that's important is because
unlike on your Xbox
you cannot just connect an external USB
Drive and install games onto it you can
of course swap out the 2.5 inch drive
that's currently installed for another
bigger one but you're gonna pay a lot of
money for a little bit of storage and if
you want to do something crazy like 6
terabytes that's just not currently
available in the two-and-a-half inch
form factor let's open this thing up and
take a closer look at it now it kind of
sticks up a little bit kind of like an
appendage you probably want an external
USB Drive for backing up whatever is
currently on your PlayStation before
installing this guy here this is pretty
light actually comes with a little tiny
screw driver for the purpose of
installation and then this little tray
over here ok perfect and some
instructions which do I really need
Jack what do you think geez Lou need to
be this complicated think I never done
this before this is the main component
here it is actually you can kind of see
through this a little bit so I guess you
can you can look in and see your large
hard drive you're the kind of guy that
likes to remind yourself of how big your
hard drive is and then on the back you
can see there's like a power cable
pass-through it's time to do some
surgery here is this a record-breaking
Playstation maybe I don't know if
there's any other six terabyte
Playstations out there that just slides
off I was right
now you'll see how much smaller the
stock drive in the PlayStation is here
Jack you got to see how cool this screw
is to hear just like my favorite screw
of all time
right now everybody's thinking blue it's
a screw calm down cool right okay fine
you're not as excited as I am
this was the stock drive 500 gigabytes
these drives desktop drives are faster
to substantially faster this little
component here replaces where that one
went just slides right in there
you take that fancy little screw put it
back into this spot here the big the
behemoth here
Oh like that okay perfect ooh yeah now
you want to connect this part here
regular SATA connector in that location
and then connect your drive six terabyte
WD black getting it done the cool thing
here there you go you can sort of feel
it connect the cool thing here's if you
wanted to then take this one out and put
another one in for whatever reason it's
actually really easy it's just this
little this little cover here so this
guy goes on top there we go yeah I can't
without a flashlight I'm not gonna be
able to appreciate my hard drive the way
I'd like to and then the last thing to
do on the back is you take this little
cable bring it over to the power plug
and simply plug that in right like that
now your standard PlayStation power
cable is gonna go from here to the wall
and everything's gonna be powered up now
if you have an older PlayStation running
older firmware then the six terabyte
drive might not function as expected so
it's important to check out which
version you have so you know it's gonna
work well otherwise you might want to
stick to a two terabyte expansion which
is supported pretty much on every
PlayStation actually it is supported on
every PlayStation there's a press
release on nycos website which details
all of this I'll link it in the
description as well as a link to this
product page build yourself a monster a
six terabyte ps4 now I'm definitely
rocky see you see what you got
don't forget the uppercut just when you
were relaxing you had the hands up you
were looking for the overhand but I hit
you from underneath</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
