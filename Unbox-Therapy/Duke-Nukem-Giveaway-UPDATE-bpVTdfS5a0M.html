therapy and I wanted to give you guys a
quick update about what's going on with
the Duke Nukem giveaway that's the balls
of steel edition of course if you
haven't seen that video or don't know
about the giveaway then click on the
link in this annotation up here so you
can go ahead and enter but to all you
who already have entered you're probably
wondering when is this guy gonna end
this giveaway and believe me I signed
enough questions about that and the
reason why I didn't put a date
originally is because we've been having
this postal strike up here in Canada and
it's finally over now so now I know I
could ship it out for a reasonable
amount of money and I'm not gonna run
into any major problems so anyway I'm
ready to put a date on it we're gonna
end it a month from the day that it
started so that's gonna put us at about
the 17th of this month or July the 17th
now that's real soon so if you haven't
jumped on it then go ahead and jump on
it now on another note I want to tell
you guys about some upcoming stuff first
and foremost this tablet showdown that
I've been talking about if you've been
following the videos you saw that I
recently unboxed the Galaxy Tab 10 one
as well as a HP TouchPad now I want to
see how those stack up against the iPad
2 which I've been using for a while and
I really want to give them a fair shake
so I'm gonna take my time with both of
those tablets so expect this review to
come out maybe late this week or early
next week and the last thing I want to
say I know I got a lot of new
subscribers first and foremost I want to
thank you guys for jumping onboard but I
also want to mention that we're
available over on Twitter and Facebook
and it's a great way to communicate with
us in the future we're also going to be
having exclusive giveaways to those
particular social networks so if you
haven't followed us or liked us on both
of those subsequent networks then go
ahead and do so now I guarantee you it's
going to be beneficial to you in the
long run anyway guys until next time and
until this giveaway is finally up and I
got some winner to announce enjoy the
rest of the videos in the meantime peace
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
