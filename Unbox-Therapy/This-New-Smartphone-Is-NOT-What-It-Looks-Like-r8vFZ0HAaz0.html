possibly an exclusive in early unboxing
it's the zenfone 5 and it's actually my
very first look at the zenfone series
you might be surprised at what this
thing packs in at the mid-range price
point now you can see on the side of the
box we love photo so you can probably
guess there's gonna be an emphasis on
camera to a certain extent in here so
what do we have here we have sim tool a
case is included you gotta love the free
case now look it's that device so this
is kind of like a bluish tone to it it
shimmers around this focal point where
the fingerprint sensor is up here in the
top corner you see the dual lens setup
which is implemented a little
differently than other manufacturers
I'll tell you more about that in a
moment
this is the front of the device and once
I boot this up you're gonna be able to
see we have a new member to the notch
family although in this case a slightly
smaller notch
than on the iPhone 10 before I boot it
up though let's look around the device
you see there's still a headphone jack
I'm happy to see it manufacturers hold
on to it there are some very nice
headphones they use that Jack speaker as
well volume rocker the power switch on
the right hand side and then the SIM
tray over here on the left and you'll
see you have expandable storage as well
also inside the package we have a quick
charger a headset with an in-ear style
which I always like to see and get the
right fit you have some extra ear tips
as well many manufacturers aren't
including headsets at all anymore so
this is good to see also type C cable to
keep it all charged up okay let's power
up the device here now since I'm filming
this just before the announcement price
is not exactly official this thing is
gonna compete in the same territory as
something like the 1 + 5 t now there's
gonna be different versions of the
zenfone 5 there's gonna be the 5 the 5 Z
and the 5 light this one is right in the
middle of the three I can speculate a
little bit here I think this is gonna
slot into the mid-range and I think it's
gonna represent some pretty decent value
so there you get your first look at the
notch cut out we can thank Apple of
course bringing on this trend but at
least it shrunk down a little bit in
this case surprisingly this is a 6.2
inch display it's very easy
hold on - but of course when you're
watching video and whatnot you have to
get used to that not sitting up there
now I do want to test out the
fingerprint reader as well fingerprint
on the back all right so I mean that's
doing the job I'm still a fan of
fingerprint sensors at this point you
guys heard my whole rant on face ID face
unlock in general I don't mind the face
unlock on the 1 + 5 t because it's fast
even there I end up using the
fingerprint as well it's kind of a thing
where you're like you're already
unlocking it before you even look at it
right like face IDs not gonna see me
from there it's a bit of a physical
adjustment I also just don't like the
swipe up gesture from below because for
me that's a two-stage thing if there's a
bit of an adjustment here and Dennis
white the whole thing could have been
over a long time before that with the
fingerprint you know without bowing to
your device anyway people are talking
now about the under display fingerprint
reader all these various vivo devices
like maybe that's the future I don't
know those don't seem to be as quick as
the traditional capacitive ones on the
back or wherever else they happen to be
so ok now something to keep in mind this
is a prototype like it's it's a
pre-release version even though it's in
the retail box and whatnot because of
that it can't really evaluate it yet
this is by no means a review at this
point in the meantime one of the things
I'm excited about on this particular
device is the camera implementation and
the reason for that is because they've
done something similar to LG where they
opted to use the second lens as a
wide-angle lens as opposed to just
contributing to portrait data for depth
of field or low-light performance and
you can see that's represented at the
bottom here by these indicators you got
the one mountain or the three mountain
to get the the wider angle perspective
I'm gonna show will what I'm talking
about there we have the stock main
camera and if I switch over to wide I
mean you can already see my knuckles in
the corner here being picked up by the
lens so that's just how wide it is maybe
a better demo of this is if I use it on
myself here so you can imagine I mean I
could get like one more person in the
frame here put on the wide-angle I got
here like two people over
I just really like wide-angle cameras
it's a nice implementation so it looks
like the wide sensor is an 8 megapixel
sensor and when I switch to the main
camera
she had switches to 12 megapixels so
that's something to keep in mind okay so
wide has no problem seeing that thing
and it's right up in the grill now also
you've got a pro mode which gives you
access to all kinds of settings here if
you want to go in and toggle you want to
play with the white balance exposure
compensation focus whether it's auto
focus manual focus you can do that all
within the professional mode or the
automatic mode actually has some AI
functionality built in right up there in
that corner just by pointing this at
this object it figures out that it's a
plant and you'll see the plant icon pop
up in this location over here somewhere
it's able to learn and figure out what
these objects look like frequently
adjust the camera settings accordingly
so you end up with an image like that
there so it's got a regular selfie mode
but then I also noticed there is a
selfie panorama and a gif animation mode
I'm gonna leave it in Auto the selfie
test very important here so it's an 8
megapixel image on the front camera look
how happy that character is the glorious
beard hairs which are incredible for
autofocus might I add now another cool
thing that this device has on it that I
haven't seen before
is this AI boost and that's gonna boost
the performance of the device and juice
out some extra horsepower from the
Snapdragon 6-3 6 whether you want more
power or if you want to save some
battery life so you can turn that off
and extend your battery but then I don't
know you want to play a game or
something
you turn on AI boost to juice out a
little more performance now another
emphasis on the zenfone 5 is an
improvement in the audio performance
over the previous version so course as
usual I want to test the audio so the
implementation is actually kind of
similar to the new Galaxy S 9 where you
have audio coming out of the earpiece up
here as well as on the bottom and each
one kind of
represents different frequency range so
you get a little more high-end out of
this one in clarity the low-end and the
bass comes out at the bottom one thanks
and you can tell when you cover up the
bottom on how that operates
these unusual this is the charge doc so
that the speaker is ready to go when you
want to take it with you this also oh I
like oh wow I like what they've done
with the speaker here certainly for
watching YouTube there's a lot more
clarity coming out of this one which is
weird because this has two forward
facing speakers there might be a little
bit more bass on the pixel to excell but
overall I think the experience on this
one is somehow more pleasing that's one
of the louder phones that I've tested
absolutely claim music and create your
own audio effect with the customized
equalizer this is out of the box here
fine-tuned audio output that fits your
headphone configuration remember you do
have a headphone jack DTS surround sound
for your headphones we have normal
settings settings for pop rock vocal and
of course custom which allows you to
toggle in your favorite equalization
settings and then there's also sliders
for bass and treble and you can save
your own custom equalizer and we can
optimize for Wired or Bluetooth
headphones that's cool it's not just a
headphone jack but it's it's a whole
suite even myself there are moments
where I still find myself in a pinch
that I'm carrying the pixel to XL with
no headphone jack it's just convenient
to have that alright and if
manufacturers keep it there I'm happy
it's pretty bright for a non OLED
display now it's important to know that
pixel to excel display is not
necessarily regarded as the top tier in
the game at the moment but it is
surprising when you see them head to
head there's a slightly different color
tint to it as well anyways this is an
interesting device to me I mean that's
why I'm making the video a lot of it has
to do with the targeted price point all
right this is the zenfone 5 there's
gonna be the 5 Z and the 5 light I think
it's gonna be in a compelling spot
somewhere around that
400 dollar range it's a pretty
interesting set of features at that
price point yes you have the Snapdragon
636 in here but you add to it the
ability to boost up some of the
performance or toggle it back for power
efficiency which that's gonna be a very
power efficient chip for battery life
and the implementation that they went
with on the dual camera setup with the
wide angle lens of course we're gonna
see more about camera performance on
this thing over time when I can evaluate
the final software but the package as a
whole with the large display in the
small form-factor if you can get used to
the knotch life or if it's something
that doesn't bother you or if it's
something you saw in the iPhone and you
were like where is the Android version
of that I believe we have our first
player in that space right here in the
zenfone 5 you can begin to make that
comparison I'm gonna keep my eye on this
one if you guys want me to dive a little
deeper when a final software is out
really getting to the nitty gritty
compare it to some other players at this
price point and do me a favor leave a
thumb down below just to let me know
you're interested in this device and
I'll go ahead and do that but for now
there it is the zenfone 5 unboxed here
on unbox therapy</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
