therapy and today we're taking a look at
a capture device from Blackmagic Design
this is the intensity shuttle this is
the thunderbolt version as well but it
does come in a USB 3 version if you
don't have a Thunderbolt port I will
link both down in the description make
sure you're clicking on the right one
depending on which port you have other
than that they're pretty much identical
both very fast interfaces of course
Thunderbolt super quick and USB 3 super
quick as well so this is pretty much as
high quality as you can get for HD
recording out of a portable capture
device it does 10 bit HD for incredible
quality and that's gonna give you the
ability to record anything from your
games console to a set-top box to a
video camera say you want to help put
the HDMI video from your camera rather
than recording to say an SD card you can
go straight into your hard drive and use
this to make the recording something
that's important here that a lot of
people don't know is that your video
camera often compresses your video
content because it doesn't have the
buffer necessary to deal with super mega
files if you use the HDMI uncompressed
output on your video camera though and
then use your computer to record the
video you can actually sometimes achieve
higher qualities using a device like
this anyways that sounds really
technical let's talk about the unboxing
on the inside you have a little bit of
paperwork as well as an installation
disk other than that you have the device
after that now I know a lot of you guys
are going to be interested in buying a
device like this for gameplay capture
and that is a very popular function for
this particular device reason being
because this has all the inputs and
outputs you could possibly want for a
gaming console unlike some other devices
on the market this one has everything
right on the box no breakout cables
you've got HDMI you've got component
input s-video and you've also got the
old-school composite video 2 on the top
side of the device is where your
Thunderbolt port is of course if you've
got the USB version that port will be
there but you've also got outputs to so
inputs and outputs for every single type
of interface so regardless of what
console you're trying to record and
which display you're trying to output to
while you're playing this is definitely
going to support unless you have some
super old school like coax TV I hope
you're not using one of those if you are
using super old school TV like that
without even composite video inputs let
me know down in the comments I don't
believe you anyways so yes this is a
very high quality capture device for
anybody looking to record high quality
video whether that's from a games
console or otherwise it will interface
with pretty much all of the popular
software that's out there so everything
from final cut to Adobe Premiere pretty
much if you can download it and cut
video with it the video that you're
going to take out of this device will
likely interface just fine and it'll
also support all of the mainstream live
streaming mainstream live streaming
software out there if you want a live
stream gameplay too so a very popular
choice right here and pretty much the
highest quality you can get in a
portable game capture device anyway guys
