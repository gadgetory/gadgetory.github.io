therapy and today we're taking a look at
Matt in 12 this is the Hall of Fame
Edition and it's gonna be real quick
because the main extra included here is
an oversized football card that they say
is hand signed by Marshall Faulk let's
get a closer look and see if that's true
because they go on to say on a website
that there's a hundred and twenty five
thousand copies of the Hall of Fame
Edition made
now either Marshall Faulk has a real
sore hand or they came up with some
system for making that claim and it not
being true maybe they're full of I
don't know if you know anything about
that then drop it down in the comment
section now let's talk about the
unboxing we got this limited bronze
cover on the outside and underneath that
I think it's a I think it's a regular
matte in twelve case now I want to take
this opportunity to give a shout out to
my boy Mike we used to play a lot of
football Madden as well as the 2k series
and that guy used to be a gigantic
Marshall Faulk fan a gigantic Kurt
Warner fan a gigantic Rams fan for that
matter in fact he never played with any
other team so shout out to you if you're
around here then leave a comment buddy
anyways let's talk about what we get
inside a year after all this is unbox
therapy you know where products get
naked so let's get this gang naked and
check out what she looks like so there's
the game disc no surprise there and then
we got our paperwork we've obviously got
our registration codes and whatnot over
here and I'm gonna have to keep that
hidden I had you guys steal one of those
off me before I will never make that
mistake again damn you guys so let's put
that one to decide without flipping it
over and here is that special card that
I mentioned and damn it looks legit it
looks like marker man if it ain't they
got me fooled this is a real nice
looking card you know if you're a fan of
this guy then this is a great chance to
get a piece of memorabilia for really
not much extra they got his classic
attributes on the back yeah these are
classic for sure that he he didn't have
that kind of agility any anytime
recently so the last thing we got is the
user manual and look at this thing they
keep getting thinner what is it one page
trifold one page damn I hope you know
how to play Matt
because that manual ain't gonna help you
out anyway guys I hope you like and
favorite this content that helps me
produce more and do giveaways and you
guys know how it goes
anyways until next time thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
