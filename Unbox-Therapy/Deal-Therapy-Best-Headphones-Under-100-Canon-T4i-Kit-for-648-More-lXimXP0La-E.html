this is for Canadians a special deal for
you guys
now over on Best Buy they're actually
having a sale on Tamara's pretty much
all their cameras from five to thirty
percent off but the one deal that caught
my attention the most was a deal they
have on the t4i the Canon t4i kit it's
very similar to the camera I'm speaking
into right now which is the Canon 60d
the t4i is a little bit more affordable
it shoots the exact same quality video
and you can pick it up right now along
with the kit lens for six hundred and
forty eight dollars which is a crazy
value it's over two hundred dollars off
the sticker price so check out the Best

direct so Tiger Direct comm they are
having what they're calling a 24 hour
tax relief for sale and there's a lot of
different things to look at in this
particular sale from television screens
to laptops one of my favorite items
available right now is a monitor from
Asus it's a 24 inch LED monitor with
HDMI this would be a great monitor for
gaming it's that perfect size at 1080p
and it's on sale for 139 bucks which is
well below the sticker price you can

price as well as the other deals keep in
mind since this is a 24 hour sale and

any of those deals the last deal we're
going back to Amazon and this is on
memory SD cards as well as micro SD s

cards from

past never had any problems these are
relatively quick cards and you can get a
16 gig card for $13 or a 32 gig card for
