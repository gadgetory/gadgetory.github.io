another video and today we are checking
out a portable monitor this is something
that you can stick beside your laptop or
use with a game console or anything that
uses HDMI but it's incredibly light and
incredibly thin
I suppose it's called the odd lap I know
it's from a company called J chic I was
worried about pronouncing that once I
got here in front of the camera but
that's actually how it's pronounced this
is the 1303 h so it's a 13 inch monitor
IPS display with a hundred and 78 degree
viewing angles and 1080p you're getting
something that's a little bit higher
quality than what you would normally get
from portable monitors and in this
particular case you've got HDMI so no
lag associated with a USB connected
portable monitor so let's go ahead and
crack this baby open and take a closer
look at it oh my goodness
upside down inside out about to show
what the folks is all about kickin it
old school cuz I'm an old fool fool
who's so cool if you want to get down
let me show you the way whoo there it is
Jack you know the song right upside down
and inside anyway so I've opened this
upside down and I'm supposed to be a
professional so there you have it let me
just make sure I don't miss anything
here might as well tell you the weight
right now it's 599 grams it's very
lightweight when you hold it okay so
here's the actual monitor which is
housed in this cover here and it does
have a stand that goes with it a pretty
cool stand actually I'll show you that
more about that in a moment
you know that speakers built-in I'm not
sure how those are going to sound a
headphone jack as well if you want to
output to external speakers or use
headphones it clips in here pretty easy
and there's a little padding for it too
so here's the actual monitor now it's
also a matte finish it's not a glossy
display which I'm very happy about has
all the controls over here we have a
power switch well as a Settings button
menu button I assume and then an up and
a down those are probably going to be
for navigating the menu maybe also for
volume and it looks like an LED
indicator at the very top and then all
of your i/o is on the other side here
phone jack hdmi displayport vga power
and USB that's about it
now the stand another important
component here now look at this it's a
magnetic I guess magnetic and what you
do is you just sort of slide this down
to whichever angle you want I'm going to
insert the monitor in the meantime if I
want a more upright angle there's
obviously a number of different
selections here and then you can go with
sort of more of an angle there
other accessories this is the USB brick
I assume haven't actually seen this type
of design before Wow very nice
here's the USB cable and here is the
HDMI cable let's go ahead and set this
up I'll do it with a laptop first to
show you guys what that looks like
and then I'll do the console after that
all right so now the monitor is hooked
up to this 13 inch MacBook with Retina
display which as many know is a very
nice display for a laptop and here it
doesn't really look out of place next to
that Retina display to be honest with
you I haven't calibrated it this is
exactly how it's going to look out of
the box this is just a way of getting
more work space while you're on the go
in a portable fashion I was thinking
this isn't going to be bright enough to
stack up to the to the laptop display
but as you can tell very comparable so
it does the job another interesting
concept would be to use it with a game
console so I'm going to set that up now
and give you guys a closer look at what
that looks like here you can see it
hooked up to my PlayStation 4 but it'll
work just as well on an Xbox 360 Xbox
one anything with an HDMI port that
plays video games or displays video and
that's what makes it a little more
versatile than a traditional USB
extended desktop super thin super
portable and versatile and it's not
helping with my defense at all anyways
there you have it a nice little portable
monitor from a company called just chic
if you want to know anything more about
pricing and availability I'll drop the
links down in the descriptions you check
that out thanks very much for watching
leave a thumbs up if you enjoyed this
content and I'll catch
shortly on the next episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
