wanted a sponsor a few episodes here on
unbox therapy they wanted the world to
know more about Android pay there's some
of them out there and this lens right
here they're still using cash looking
for change what do you think it is
nineteen fourteen using nothing but NFC
this device and even in-app purchases I
went to New York City connecting my
credit card to this phone right here and
I did 24 hours on Android pay
told me Madison Square Garden
I'm going
so I'm out here in New York as you can
tell with my pouch under from your
average consumer a 24 hour Android pay
challenge do you know anything about
this well I know there's a few places
okay all right
a tour guide if that well I got
surprisingly simple to set up and use a
lot of people out there not using it yet
so how to do it and listen we're gonna
be the guinea pigs if we can eat today
if we can travel today you might have to
host me at your place I'm not that works
I think the main thing here is figure
out how we're gonna spend all this money
yeah yeah quite a bit sponsored by
Google we're taking a secret trip that's
happening later I don't even know if you
know about this yet we can use we can
use lift to get out there that works
first I want to get some Doritos
I gotta show this guy around I don't do
spicy man what know if you guys take
Android pay yeah yes up here yes
all right there we go success Doritos I
want money is the best one thing how do
we pay for gender put the phone right on
the terminal you saw it go win it
nothing wrong with Doritos but I come
all the way to New York I expect to have
a nice meal I got to
finally with my entire life this is what
I've been waiting two different kinds of
bait you're coming here to be healthy
because I'm a home place for that's
right Oh take care of you New York all
right marna you know me too well Mac ha
ha ha the fanciest McDonald's bite of
all time right now I'm in New York so
you got do a little shopping too I heard
the GameStop accepts Android pay though
say no more say no
we're at Gamestop now they're going to
take our Android pay so why not do some
gaming I need the latest NBA as far as
my girlfriend XL hey what's going on NBA
that one right there
ps4 oh he's just coming a YouTube video
wanna get nuts
let's get nuts oh thanks you know where
to go
this way
haha thank you that's what I'm saying
I like a shoe that can breathe here
though getting hot all the time
cool I have channel sneaker talk sneaker
therapy yeah I mean we can have LeBron
on blue your presence that's a--that's a
magnet but it's strong so you can't
really tell today if someone's wearing
this right now you're not going all that
guy looks like he's wearing 30 year old
shoes yeah I remember back in the day
where like the air concept seems so
mystical and you pop the air bubble what
happens if you pop the air bubble Puli
some kids steal their shoes pop the air
bubble is that really well okay fresh
kicks
Kutner goes for some Jordans Jack goes
for some air max I know it was left over
for me socks maybe I'll do better next
time we've been all over the city it's
now time for the moment you've all been
waiting for we are going to head to the
fringes of New York City it's kind of
like the pyramids in Egypt the Grand
Canyon
Niagara Falls it's time for us to use
this Android pay for some major
transportation we're going to use it for
lyft fully supported coming up shortly
we made it
oh look at this place
good guys it's like an art gallery in
here for tech heads start the show I
told you this was a special place take a
look this is how you know this is real
oh that's how you know we're really here
people all I've eaten for the last three
years is that that's a true professional
so what's good why you guys here 24
hours using nothing but Android pay to
survive a day in New York City no wallet
no cash just Android pay strictly
digital we had food transportation
chicks what we learned is you can
survive in New York on nothing but
entropy as long as you're happy need
Doritos all right well that sounds
pretty good what you guys say we get
outta here maybe got some food I think
that's a great idea yeah and I can cover
it using nothing but Android Bay</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
