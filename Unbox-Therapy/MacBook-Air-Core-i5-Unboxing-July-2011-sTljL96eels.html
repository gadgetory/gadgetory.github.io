and I'm very excited just walked in my
front door after picking up the
brand-new MacBook Air this is the core
i5 model and this is supposed to be a
huge performance improvement over the
previous one and I also want to mention
that it's the 13-inch I do have the 11
inch of the previous generation so this
one is going to be an extensive upgrade
as far as I understand from the
benchmarks I've seen now this is just an
unboxing video guys but I definitely
want you to stay tuned I'm going to
stack this up against my quad-core
MacBook Pro that I just picked up you
guys can get a sense for just what kind
of performance to expect but first let's
talk about what's happening in front of
your eyes let's talk about this
beautiful slim laptop that's getting
unwrapped getting naked for you after
all this is unbox therapy where products
get naked so let's put this to the side
for a minute and just look at the other
things that come with it
now here's our little package of
documents it's pretty straightforward
stuff I've seen a bunch of these before
we have our hello guide which is Apple's
way of saying Quick Start Guide usually
not going to need to read that and
something my notice straightaway is that
we don't have a reinstallation USB Drive
like on the previous model MacBook Air
so I suppose this whole Mac App Store is
going to be your way to restore
something I don't know I don't know what
you do if you get into real trouble
anyway here we've got our extension to
the power adapter and then we have our
nice little brick along with our MagSafe
nothing too special pretty much
everything you'd expect and that is it
but here's what it's all about
here's what you came to see let me tell
you something this is real thin real
light and if it's as fast as everybody
saying this can be a real replacement
for your current system whether it be a
desktop or a laptop as you guys know it
comes pre-loaded with an SSD and as far
as I'm concerned that's the biggest
upgrade you can make to your laptop
after all they've been plagued with slow
hard drives for many many years and that
is no longer a drawback once you go to
that
ssv I'm not going to make you sit
through the initial installation here
like I said I'm going to have a more
extensive review and MacBook Pro
comparison coming up a real soon either
later today or maybe tomorrow anyway
here we've got our MagSafe port a USB
our headphone jack and our microphone
and on the other side of the unit we got
that brand new Thunderbolt boom as well
as a USB and SD card slot and you can
see it tapers down real slim here I mean
that's impressive that's beautiful you
got the backlit keyboard now as well
this is an improvement over what you
previously had we didn't have a backlit
keyboard on the previous generation
MacBook Air and then we've also got a
new shortcut key on the f4 button since
this runs lion that's going to open up
your new app drawer which is similar to
the apps you see on your iPad or on your
iPhone so it's going to give you this
kind of icon based app organization I
suppose you'd call it here it is up
against my Galaxy Tab 10 one which is
obviously very thin as well but as you
can see this is impressive I mean it's
very close to the same thickness and
that's a laptop boys and girls anyway
guys as I said before click that
subscribe button I got a lot more
MacBook Air content coming up including
a really cool benchmark comparison
against my quad-core MacBook Pro stay
tuned later</div></body></html>
