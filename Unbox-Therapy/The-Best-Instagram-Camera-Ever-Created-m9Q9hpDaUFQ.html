primary camera these days even though
they've kind of advanced to this point
of having a really amazing cameras
considering their size they are still
not gonna replace a digital SLR they're
not going to replace the camera that
Jack is using to see all this right now
look at that thing look how thin that is
I mean that find me a professional
camera that is that scale right there
just not gonna happen
so maybe you want to step your game up
but maybe you don't want to give up some
of the functionality of your phone and
your instant share ability that's where
this thing comes in this thing is not
cheap be warned this thing is not cheap
the DxO one professional quality
connected camera it fits into the
lightning port of your iPhone you're
getting a one inch sensor one inch in F
1.8 lens this is stuff you're used to
talking about with professional
photography equipment it captures RAW
files so if you want to manipulate them
and edit them later that's the way to go
what does this mean for you an Instagram
professional so to speak might be you
well you know what it is you a little
seal okay holy unboxing experience right
now whoo look at the way they did that
so the manuals right on here that's the
camera whoa wow that's really intense
just open up Jack see if you can catch
that when I do that whoo a micro USB
cable to keep things charged up power
brick a microfiber cloth or carrying
case sorry fine we're gonna find out
cloth whoo luxurious
we got an iPhone over here you can see
the battery life and it's telling me it
has no memory card so this takes microSD
cards when you pull the lens cover down
seems like it's ready to function well
you need this lightning connector out so
what you do is you pull down a little
further push down and there's like a
little clasp that then ejects the
lightning connector now to put it away
is the same fold down put
 in let go and it locks I can kind
of pick my angle and then this access my
shutter button right up here got a micro
SD here the DxO one app gives you
control good auto mode or manual
aperture ISO speed essentially all the
camera settings you'd be used to in a
more professional camera
first off I'll do a shot in auto mode
whew this is this is insane image
quality for what you're used to seeing
on your phone so here in full manual
mode you have access to shutter speed
ISO aperture below out the background
have it nice and smooth and out-of-focus
people use the term bokeh for that dude
those photos are insane come look at
this holy this selfie is scary high
caliber right now haha you didn't want
to see me like that fact that I can
share a photo of that caliber
immediately and not having to go in pull
it off of a camera put it onto a
computer potentially edited and so on
like I can just throw this into maybe an
editing app if I want or just share it
right like that and that's another level
right there most of you are going to
think if you snap a photo that you're
gonna end up with the entire thing in
focus now I just want to show you how
with the shallow depth of field you can
completely change the scenario from a
creative standpoint that's the look
that's really tough to achieve with a
small sensor and a small camera lens so
creatively there are options here if you
were out and about with this kind of
setup the things you can do creatively
just go to the next level</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
