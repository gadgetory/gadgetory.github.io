time I've got to do it I've been using
this device for a while and it's time to
switch to a new one this is the polka
phone f1 the legend itself you guys have
demanded that I cover it use it make
videos tell you about it and then
ultimately have everything culminate in
this video here where I tell you the
truth about it the truth based on using
it for a real extended period of time
with my main SIM card in it the truth is
this thing is legit it's everything you
thought there's no real reason to be
worried about this thing it's crazy that
it costs 300 this thing blew up in India
right and it is for that market
specifically but people in other parts
of the world can't believe the deal they
want to try to import it so to be clear
since this is designed for that market
your mileage may vary depending on where
you want to use it when it comes to
getting a 4G LTE signal I am in the
Toronto area I have a Roger SIM card in
here and there are times and places
where I would normally have an LTE
connection where this one revert back to
a slightly slower connection so that
just has to do with the radios that are
inside of here in the market that they
are developed for it hasn't really hurt
me at all or bothered me all that much
reception otherwise has been good calls
have been good and has been functioning
properly let's move on to the good stuff
this thing is fast we expected that
snapdragon 845 you can see I changed the
layout a little bit here this is Nova
Launcher I would do this on many devices
and actually this launcher brings me to
maybe the one thing that kind of bugged
me on this phone and that is the fact
that it has a skin on it and that skin
extends into the settings and it will
slow you down a bit if you are used to a
more stock experience for me the perfect
phone here would be this the polka phone
f1 with the Android one program
associated with it just like the phone I
featured here recently the me a - from
the same company shall be of course in
this case called polka phone if this
device had that stock experience this
would be tough to switch away from even
at the $300 price point I'll tell you
why battery I can't kill this thing I
use it extensively at the end of the
night there's plenty of percentage left
25% sometimes out of 4,000 milliamp hour
battery in it and with the Snapdragon
setup that is a ton of battery to work
with to put this in perspective it's the
same battery size as the note 9 that's a
premium device you know the price tag
it's got the same chipset as the note 9
the display is probably not as nice as
the note 9 the camera is probably not as
nice as the note 9 but let's adjust our
expectations for the price point and
realize how crazy this thing is speaking
about the camera I have a few shots on
here I can show you I will say I had low
expectations for this camera both front
and back but I was pleasantly surprised
this camera is pretty good and that goes
for low-light conditions as well you can
see the detail actually holds up I mean
look at the gradient in the sky on this
particular image so as I've mentioned in
past videos regarding budget phones
usually the camera is going to be the
differentiating factor that's gonna be
the place where you're like look that's
a cheap phone and I know it in fact in
the recent video where I had that
knockoff iPhone the Android iPhone the
camera was terrible it was a dead
giveaway even when I had the most recent
blackberry on the show the camera was
terrible
comparatively this device here is crazy
competitive I should mention the
fingerprint scanner has been rock-solid
never missed the scan it's fast it's in
the right spot some people have
criticized this device for being
essentially plastic in most of its
formats this is the armored Edition so
this one has this aramid Kevlar kind of
feel to it which I like a little bit
better that said it does get some
fingerprints on it and it mostly feels
kind of like plastic it might not feel
as premium let's say as glass I don't
see this as a drawback I was never a
huge fan of glass it's a fingerprint
magnet it's fragile so in a way from a
utilitarian perspective this might even
be a step better let's not forget the
fact that it keeps the headphone jack
it's also got expandable storage so it's
a versatile package and I feel like I
need to keep saying it it's all
happening
for $300 the starting price point now
one thing I wasn't able to test due to
region specific things is the facial
unlock though I do know that they're
using infrared so it is a step better
than strictly optical face unlock and
again that's kind of a feature that
we're just not seeing in lower end the
lower pricepoint bones the speaker sort
of falls into the average realm but it
was never an issue for me it felt
comparable to some of the stuff that I
had been using previously it was sort of
in the same realm as the p20 Pro that I
was using before this okay so I said a
lot of nice things about this I don't
know it could be the hit all around
smartphone of 2018 I don't really know
how anything can touch this right now
when you put together the combination of
what's inside of it and the price that
goes along with it
but there is a but okay this is this is
the real butt this thing is kind of hard
to get your hands on for a regular
customer in my particular case that they
reached out to me and sent it out so
that's how I got my hands on it but for
everyone else it's kind of this flash
sale situation where some become
available and then they sell out so
there's this question it started to
arise amongst community members tech
savvy people like yourself is this thing
being sold at a loss do they really want
to move a lot of units or is this really
a marketing campaign to build hype
around the device and then maybe on the
next version it comes with a higher
price point so they can earn some of
that revenue back that might be possible
I'm not familiar enough with the
specifics of the Indian market and how
sales happen there but as I understand
it this flash sale scenario is pretty
common and the question that exists now
is just how many of these devices can
they fulfill now I should say one more
thing I made a video talking about a
problem that this device had regarding
streaming Netflix Amazon video and
various other services they use a
particular type of encoding for DRM
purposes and the problem meant that this
device couldn't stream those services in
full 1080p resolution while someone from
shall be reached out to me and actually
told me that they may be able to patch
problem via software which I didn't know
and I didn't state in my original video
so apparently this is something that may
be fixed in the future take that for
what it is don't count on it but it may
be patched if it's a big issue for you
so there you have it polka phone f1 may
be the most important phone released
this year it signals a change its
signals competition as a customer you
win you're seriously winning right now
and it's because of more brands playing
in the space and customers demanding
more for less that's how you get better
stuff so I hope you guys keep doing that
and I'm gonna keep talking about it and
hopefully more devices like this arise
so more of you can get your hands on the
latest tech for less that's what's
happening let me know as usual down in
the comments which phone should I switch
to next coming up very shortly I need to
put my sim card in something so where do
you guys want to see that SIM card go
name any device that you want to see me
move to after this one I kind of have an
idea of what you guys are gonna select
nonetheless put your votes down in the
comments and I'll be picking a new phone
immediately after this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
