different types of keyboards keyboards
for mobile devices keyboards to desktop
computers maybe a modern design and
old-fashioned design mechanical or
otherwise glass there was a glass
keyboard Jack remembers that video is
very cool look at that
because then that thing is super slick
very clean I showed you keyboard you can
you can dump water on and wash it it's
not even fair the world of keyboards
it's vast and today we're gonna add to
that universe with this thing here the
rollable design two in one wireless
speaker keyboard there's not really a
brand name on it but that's probably
because this thing is currently on
indiegogo as you can tell this thing has
a very strange design unusual it also
has a speaker built into it now straight
away this reminded me of a gadget that I
never put my hands on but I heard about
it was from LG and it was a keyboard
called the Rolly with the exception of
fact that it didn't have the speaker
functionality at all iOS Android Windows
and Macs and could use it with anything
maybe we have something cool let's find
out if that's the case maybe it isn't
hyper bass a built-in microphone up to
six hours of talk / play time and a
power meter here's something weird
though the number six is in a different
font maybe they came up with that after
the fact I don't know maybe it had a
higher number and they're like nope
we're only gonna go with six who knows
so there it is this is a keyboard whoa
that might be the champion for the
weirdest keyboard we've looked at ever
and I haven't even unrolled it yet there
it is look at that I guess that's kind
of cool you get the speaker's pointing
at you
now the cool thing they've done with
this model is made this portion
detachable I could have this a distance
away from where the speakers are and
also this happens to be the stand and
now you could talk a phone or a tablet
in that location now uses bluetooth
completely wireless pairing there's a
power button on the keyboard and then
another independent power button on the
speaker unit a microUSB port to keep
this thing charge and then guessing
there's probably one on here too or not
I know that there's four speaker units
in here so one two on the front and then
on the ends as well micro USB cable to
charge it up a little carrying pouch
which is very basic this is a Galaxy s8
that fits in there right like that
even without the keyboard you have a
little speaker dock those little arms
they pivot so you can pick whichever
angle you want but for a heavy device
like an iPad this is the way you're
gonna use it all right so let's check if
this thing has juice okay so you have to
pair the keyboard and the speaker
separately when the keyboard is attached
there's a key sequence it's FN C so that
the keyboard looks for the speaker I
suppose I got to be honest the
instructions the translation on the
instructions not the best the blue
indication amp light three seconds and
crush out and then we'll go ahead and
just type unbox therapy look at that
how do you like it you know what the
keyboard itself is kind of nice to use I
don't know maybe you like to type a
novel at a cafe or something maybe
that's one advantage of having them pair
up independently you don't actually have
to use the two of them together
exclusively now there are function keys
on here as well the FN keys for volume
let's see if those work oh they do one
thing I didn't expect to see on a
keyboard so small is the directional
buttons if you guys caught my recent
video on the $39 laptop the directional
buttons were not functioning spoiler
alert what does this do FN look at that
I can lock the phone see what I did
there
yeah I mean way better than your phone
obviously for your iPad for that matter
it's it's a nice little speaker I mean
it's an odd combination of things but I
guess it makes sense if you think about
what you might be lacking on your
smartphone or tablet if you use it as
your main computing device so far this
is probably the slimmest little package
that I've seen plus it has the cool
aspect of being able to roll up you're
probably gonna turn some heads what do
you say hey not too shabby
if I want to roll it out let's see how
long the setup takes kaboom rolled out
typing away now if I didn't remove the
keyboard it's even faster and you're on
the go I don't know I think it's pretty
cool the design itself
I have seems with the LG rolling
keyboard which I never had the chance to
look at but it didn't have a speaker so
a lot of that space that it took up was
strictly for the purpose of the rolling
aspect whereas here we're getting some
sound to go with it so it probably puts
this a sliver ahead</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
