got the power beats these are the
athletic equivalent to the beats by dre
and the purpose of these headphones if
you don't know about them is to be as
comfortable as possible during physical
activity while delivering unsurpassed
sound quality as you can see so far the
packages pretty similar to what we're
used to with the beats by dre lineup we
have our cardboard interior box now
what's special about these headphones
over other athletic headphones is that
the driver attached to the ear piece
itself is significantly larger
delivering more bass at least in theory
haven't heard these yet inside we see we
have the statement sound as energy here
is our traveling case which is really
small actually nice and convenient for
taking these headphones with you here we
have a couple of different tips to suit
everybody's ear size we have a cable in
the case as well this looks to be a
gold-plated cable of course it's a
extension in the event that you want to
string the headphones behind your shirt
possibly for you know playing basketball
or even jogging inside the case here it
looks like we've got some paperwork
looks like our manual and warranty
information now let's get to the
headphones
as you can see when I pull them out
they're not huge I mean they're bigger
than some earbuds but they're not huge
and the whole purpose of this sort of
design is so that it can sit on the ear
but that the ear can hold the weight as
opposed to the ear canal itself which
can be annoying over time here you can
see the size of the driver which is
impressive for such a small set of ear
buds and the flexibility as well here is
the remote and mic for you know
answering phone calls switching songs
controlling volume etc the design of the
of the remote is a little bit different
from other ones we've seen on the beat
series here is our other gold-plated
connector can be used on its own or in
conjunction with the extension you get a
decent length of cord without the
extension but probably not enough to run
it behind your t-shirt or sweater or
whatever you're wearing as you can see
here the cord itself is adjustable this
means you're going to be able to get it
tight up under your chin so it's not
getting in your way during physical
activity anyway stay tuned we got some
macro photos coming right up</div></body></html>
