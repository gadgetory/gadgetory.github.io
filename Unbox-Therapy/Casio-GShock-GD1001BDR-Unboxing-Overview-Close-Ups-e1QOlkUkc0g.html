we got another casio g-shock to follow
up our last G shotgun boxing this one is
a little different than the last it's a
little bit more stealth and as I get
inside you're going to find out why some
cool features though off the bat even
though it's an oversized watch on the
wrist it only weighs in at 72 grams
which makes it light extremely
comfortable another cool thing is the
battery lasts seven years on a regular
cr2025 watch battery here is warranty
information just like you'd get with any
casio timepiece here is our user manual
module number three one nine four
available in all your favorite languages
as always now let's take a look at the
watch itself as you can see it's got
that stealth coloring it's black on
black the finish on the body itself is a
matte black another cool thing about
this watch is it's got world time built
into it with 48 cities now we're going
to see it mounted on my wrist and as you
see here it's a decent size as I told
you in the last watch video I consider
my hand and wrist to be average - a
little bit large here we are a little
closer on a watch and you get a sense
for the quality of the clasp
there's our backlight it's a cool blue
kind of color which looks nice against
the black finish we've got our oversized
buttons just like we did on the last
model
and let's go ahead and get even closer
into the watch here so here we are even
closer you can see the contrast of the
LCD it's a little different than your
standard one which is the black on the
light color this is the light on the
black color and there's that backlight
as you can see from these close-up shots
it's a high quality piece you've got
some high quality Hardware holding the
thing together and you got that really
comfortable band with the dual clasp
you'll be able to wear it all day and we
got the stainless steel back which says
shock resist on it because after all
that's what these G shocks are all about
anyway I hope this gave you some insight
check out our channel for more cool
getting unboxed later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
