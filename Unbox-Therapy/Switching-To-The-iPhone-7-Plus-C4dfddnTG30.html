on a channel well I guess I'm still
doing it it's just that I haven't
updated that series in a while it's
myself making the commitment to switch
to another phone I don't mean like for a
day I don't mean for a video I mean as
my daily driver means in my pocket on a
daily basis probably no device in my
life like my smartphone right there's
none that you interact with on such a
regular basis maybe my workstation but
this thing goes with me everywhere now
you probably noticed that on the table
sits a galaxy s7 this s7 was actually
the last switched video with the
exception of that dumb phone challenge
which as you know well so today I'll be
switching from my tried and tested
much-loved s7 to the iPhone 7 plus this
is important because I'm switching os's
os's OSS truthfully this is really the
only way to get feedback from me on the
pros and cons of day-to-day life with
these different platforms and different
devices so what am i excited for with
this guy right here the iPhone 7 plus a
few things to be honest this camera it
might be the best in the business right
now so starting from this point forward
the point that you watch this video all
my Instagram photos Twitter photos and
so on will be uploaded from this device
for your evaluation she'll follow me in
those places if you don't already it's a
bigger phone I've never been a huge fan
of giant phones this is my first step
into the plus realm and this thing is a
big phone I told you before it's pretty
slippery so I'll probably put a case on
it in fact I have a comprehensive 7 plus
case video and seven case video coming
up after this so stay tuned for that
I'll probably put a little case on it
honestly I'm excited to really dive
deeper into this camera module and see
what I can do with it the slightly
improved
audio coming out of it of course
experimenting with iOS 10 the display is
supposedly a little bit better and also
you know to see if I can get used to
this new home button the home button
that no longer clicks things I'm afraid
of iMessage some people love iMessage
effects for some people I messages the
reason that they're locked into the Iowa
platform when your person that switches
phones so often it could be a bit of a
nightmare iMessage is meant to like live
on one SIM card in one place without
complications also just email right like
being a gmail user and having multiple
Gmail accounts that I manage there's an
abundance of ways to do that natively on
Android might be a little bit more of a
headache on iOS the critical moment
Android to iPhone s 7 to 7 plus here
comes the SIM card the ceremonial moment
oh my goodness this is nerve-racking
right now ooh it's official pick that up
jack here we go your boy just officially
switched to iPhone ok so check back here
I'm gonna update you when I feel like
I've got a real grip I will not be
touching this guy the old phone am I
gonna stay switched or am I gonna switch
back the saga continues wu-tang</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
