therapy and today we're taking a look at
the glyph tripod mount and stand for
your iPhone 4 or iPhone 4s as you see on
the back here it was designed and
manufactured in America and that
obviously comes at a price
there are obviously cheaper tripod
adapters you can get on eBay and all
over the place but I don't believe there
is nice as this one this one retails for
about 20 bucks so it's a bit of an
investment but it does have dual
functionality it also works as a video
stand and most importantly it's made out
of nicer materials it's a soft touch
like rubberized feeling and the reason
that that's important is because you're
sliding your iPhone in and out of here
consistently and you don't want to
scratch it up every other alternative
I've seen especially the cheap ones are
a hard plastic and really the phones the
investments will spend a few extra bucks
on your tripod adapter anyways here you
can see it mounted up on my little
tabletop tripod but it'll work just as
well on a full sized tripod it is a
standardized mount and that's what's
cool about it as you can see here you
can insert your iPhone in one of two
ways the first way that I've shown you
here but also the other way which places
the lens along the bottom side of the
phone and the reason this is interesting
is because you can now use the physical
shutter button on the top of your iPhone
the plus button as we all know has
recently become the physical shutter
button if you like to use that instead
you'll get a slightly different
perspective having the lens along bottom
but nothing too major I'll give you a
quick demo to show you that the entire
tripod and mount stays stable when you
snap a photo whether you use the
software button or the hardware button
everything stays nice and stable take
your iphone photography game up a notch
if you know what I'm saying now it does
have this dual functionality it also
works as a stand and it can either be
used in portrait mode or landscape mode
obviously landscape mode being the more
useful function if you want to watch
video either at lunch on the airplane or
you just want to prop it up this way it
gives you about a 45 degree angle so
that's a sort of useful angle for that
exact usage and hey it's a bonus because
May
it's a tripod adapter but having it with
that dual function just it's that's
that's value-added am i right
so these devices here are obviously
designed to take your photography game
on your phone to the next level get you
some stable shots and just sort of give
you some options that you didn't have
with handheld photography anyway guys if
you enjoyed this content then hopefully
you can like and favorite this video as
it does help me out a bunch and also if
you haven't joined us yet on Twitter or
Facebook those are the two places that
we communicate most or I communicate
most and the reason for that is because
it's really hard to keep up with the
youtube inbox these days and I can
answer something once on those social
networks and then everybody can see the
answer so definitely either like us on
Facebook or follow on Twitter if you
want to stay up-to-date with upcoming
