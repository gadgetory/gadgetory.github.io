therapy and today I am very excited to
take a closer look finally at the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 this thing is big
and it's packin some processing power to
back all that up in fact it's got eight
total cores the first four on a 1.9
gigahertz cortex a15 and then the next
four on a 1.3 gigahertz cortex a7 so you
heard me correctly eight total cores of
processing power it's of course also got
a bunch of RAM in there three gigabytes
of internal RAM and this particular
model has 32 gigabytes of storage though
that is expandable up to 64 gigabytes
using the microSD slot on the inside now
this particular version happens to be
the HSDPA instead of the LTE that's just
because I wanted it quickly I wanted it
fast to show it to you guys I'll
probably pick up the LTE version as well
as you can see it's also white and there
is this new texture on the back it's a
leather-like texture it's a little bit
different than you know what you see on
say the galaxy s4 I think it feels a
little bit more durable I'm not really
sure having not thoroughly tested the
device but at least at first it seems
slightly more durable and maybe a little
bit thicker now you've also got some
paperwork inside the box followed by a
USB cable but you might notice it
doesn't look like a micro USB that's
because it's actually USB 3.0 the next
thing is a little tool for pulling up
the nubs on your stylus then you've got
some headphones they do feature
interchangeable tips so that you can
find the best fit for your particular
ear canal you've also got a power
adapter for plugging this into the wall
and then you've got this large 3200
milliamp hour battery this was
definitely my favorite feature on the
Galaxy Note 2 which was a little smaller
than this and really it's one of those
areas that I feel smartphones in general
should be a lot better than they are its
battery life and having walked around
with the iPhone 5s for the last few days
it's one of my most major complaints is
that the battery life is not really that
great in fact sometimes I can actually
wear it down before the day is over so
having a large 3200 mm
power battery is one of my favorite
additions and one of the major things
that compels me to carry around a larger
device not just the big screen but the
big damn battery so as you can see I
have booted up the device and after you
do that you will be greeted with the
setup interface but rather than bore you
with those different steps I'll fast
forward to the point of going straight
into the operating system here as you
can tell the screen is very bright it
really struck me because not only is it
a large screen but it's blasting light
at you it's very vibrant and of course
the thing that makes the note famous is
the stylus or s-pen although I'm not a
huge user of this it sort of sits in
that area for me most of the time this
wraps up the initial portion of the
unboxing video and now we're going to do
the world-famous unbox therapy style
close-ups for you to enjoy and stick
around to the very end because I
actually do a quick physical comparison
between the note 3 and the iPhone 5s
alright enjoy guys</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
