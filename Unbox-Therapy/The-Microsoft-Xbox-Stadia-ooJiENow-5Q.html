about you know the new gaming service
from Google Google stadia you just have
your controller your smartphone your
tablet your laptop you can play games
anywhere of course that's not a real
product yet and many of you doubt that
it will ever be a reality the way that
Google was showing it off so I decided
to make my very own version of gaming
anywhere but with the more traditional
approach of using an Xbox so this guy
right here the games G 170 Sentinel this
is a like suitcase looking package that
lets you jam in an Xbox and you get a
monitor and it all folds up almost like
a console in a laptop so I'm calling
this creation the Xbox stadia the Google
stadia killer you know you can just plug
it in and start going no matter where
you are in the world even if you're
camping you don't have power when you're
camping maybe you like to camp with
power
look at that Wow
350 bucks so it's I mean it's a few
dollars but keep in mind you've got the
display built in so you're getting a
display you're getting a speaker setup
it's all designed around this idea just
flip it open and play and this whether
you like playstation or xbox you can
pick okay this is uh what are you
putting a bag controllers and stuff
it's factory-fresh right there oh okay
a remote control they give you a short
HDMI cable with a right angle connector
so that should be convenient it's nice
that they included that a power brick
obviously whoo here we go it really is
like a suitcase or a briefcase oh here
we go we're getting a big peel here are
you ready it's a big peel coming up
who Willie do you're a big fan I hate a
big peal like that the orange peel
once again factory-fresh all right yeah
up like this whoo
so once again this 1080p it's an LED
panel it's got a matte finish on it it's
not glossy so that should be good for
reflections also a lot of controls here
on the front power switch volume up/down
brightness and I like that they have
those without going into the menu system
cuz that can be a bit of a nightmare for
the frequently used buttons so you could
just reach up and you got them straight
away power goes into this port right
here you can see the speaker units right
underneath the display two headphone
outputs very convenient and then of
course the HDMI in that I mentioned this
whole region over here is like a
neoprene wetsuit kind of material and
it's padded it's got like a memory foam
underneath so hopefully it's gonna treat
your console very nice and protected and
comfy and whatnot this will do an Xbox
this will do a Playstation and these
straps hold it in place
okay so here's that both this is an Xbox
obviously so all we're gonna do is slide
in a slack through here actually this
one fits really good get the straps
going tightened up too simple doesn't
move around too much now you might be
thinking like who is this for
why aren't you just gonna get a I don't
know a gaming laptop or something I
think the idea here is a bit more social
like maybe you show up
got a couple controllers maybe you're
into sports games or something you can
have a little versus mode and maybe you
already have an Xbox to begin with but
again this isn't the kind of thing
you're gonna bring with you every day
you're gonna bring this to class in
college could you you just pretend it's
a laptop you know where they take notes
in the auditorium is it just you just
flip this open I don't know if you could
get away with that these days I'm not
sure I'm not advising you do it I'm just
anyhow let's see how we close it down
that's what it's like okay it's it's
smaller than I expected it to be when
you see it unfolded it seems huge but
like this you can get away with that you
show up you pop it down you flip the
switch
look at you we're gonna hit the what the
right angle one over here you think like
that that's a nice set up this guy goes
right over here so you're gonna have two
power cables coming out of this keep
that in mind you do have some cabling
showing and of course if you have
headphones that we'll be showing as well
but it's not terrible so it's a pretty
smooth Center nonetheless okay oh all
right we're 100 sound just for a quick
test hundred brightness now keep in mind
very brightly lit environment we're in
so that's gonna affect the appearance of
brightness on this display as well man
haven't played a Capcom game in a while
oh by the way we're playing Resident
Evil 2 this is uh this is Welles
recommendation what does it say saving
requires an ink ribbon no autosave
stronger enemies normal gameplay
assisted it has a missed recover health
automatically that's rude there's no way
of doing that
there's no way I'm doing that I'm
definitely doing standard come on man
Will's hitting the lights to spook me
out over there wow this looks pretty
good
oh it's a nice man this is spooky
stay back sir I got you straight shoot
keys
is that doing anything wasting my
bullets right now Wow he took a lot of
bullets I think I only got one bullet
left now now I'm dead
yeah I'm gone oh yeah oh I got another
boy for that purpose I discovered
another bullet I'll take I'll take the
cutscene right now let me out of here
that's the thing I'm always wondering
what this all-new situation the amount
of time between you getting bit and you
going zombie it's always up for dispute
sometimes it's like instant other times
it takes an hour like that dudes gonna
emerge from the truck he's obviously
zombie mode maybe not at that explosion
you know you wanna know something I kind
of like this thing it's kind it's a it's
cool it's not the brightest screen I've
ever seen up but I do like that it has
the matte finish and 1080p at this size
at 17 inches is plenty of pixels so you
don't really need anything more than
that I surprisingly ended up immersed
I wish the speakers were a bit louder
but that said you have to do a headphone
jack so you can use those and really
you're talking about a package that's
just unique in and of itself like if
this is what you want to do I understand
the potential criticisms obviously it is
a bizarre device it's but that's kind of
that's kind of why I like it cuz it's a
bit unusual as far as like the different
gadgets that you see out there you know
you hear about like athletes for example
that go on road trips they want to bring
their video games in the hotel room
things like this you could take it to a
party
load up Madden NBA NHL have a couple
controllers and you just you have some
instant fun all you do you unplug right
you unplug this you won't plug this you
take your little cable out it goes into
the bag and then the whole thing closes
up
look at that I mean you're like a secret
agent console gamer I call it the Xbox
stadia that's what I just named it I
coined it the package together it's the
Xbox stadia obviously I'm just joking
with that it's not the same thing at all
but nonetheless if you ever wanted to
have a portable Xbox this has got to be
the best way to do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
