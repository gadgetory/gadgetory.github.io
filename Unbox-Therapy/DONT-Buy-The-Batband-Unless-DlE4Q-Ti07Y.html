alone has gotten me motivated here
Batman
say something Batman would use the bat
band there's a thing in the world called
the Batman then it needs to be here on
the desk so I could tell you what it's
all about ear free Wireless hero Bowl
hero Bowl with bone conduction sound
it's being modeled I was the first
choice I couldn't do it and so they
ended up with this I think it's not that
bad but of course there it is put on
your head with the logo in the upright
position
download the app to calibrate swipe one
finger to bring volume up two fingers
for the next or previous track and click
it once to play pause and take or end a
phone call that is so strange looking I
mean it's certainly not headphones some
light reading with an afternoon cup of
tea that's what Jack likes to do connect
to your virtual assistant be social be
social Jack do you know how to be social
at life listen to music and free your
ear for your ear I've done videos on
bone conduction style headphones before
but they looked more like headphones
that Raptor on the back of your neck
this is unmistakable if you see this
thing you're gonna ask some questions
yes bat Bend I heard something okay cool
now now there is an app I'm supposed to
get as well so I should probably do that
Batman by studio banana oh my the app
has a an average of a 1.3 rating that's
a little rough connected sweet there's
presets so you can choose between
outdoors indoors or a personalized
preset oh this is cool alright so you
can also set the microphone sensitivity
balance between the left and right
channel let's say it's just cool like
there like that it sticks and it's kind
of comfortable - I don't know maybe I
don't mind it you could hide it like oh
that might be the move
I'm not doing anything look I got the
ears all right let me play the demo
track a lot more vibration than I
expected
oh the closer you get to the this is
much louder down here okay it's quite a
bit louder now here's my personalized
let me create one here let's just max it
we just need more that does not sound
great let's just do outdoors like you
hear this right now yeah you hear this I
mean you can't be listening to this on
an airplane or something no that
actually sounds better this sounds way
better like this what it is is the
closer that gets to your actual ear the
louder it gets you know it bleeds that
this out the sound bleeds out so if you
get a closer to your ear the louder that
it gets so I did a video a while back
that was the first bone conduction audio
device that I had tried and the design
on those it kind of brings the bone
conduction part up in front of the ears
if it sits right here and those are
usable the trouble with these unless
you've got them right over your ears
it's just not loud enough maybe that's
fine maybe that's where you would end up
wearing them anyway the whole premise
here is that your ears remain accessible
to outside input you're at the grocery
store you go for the jog like I said
you're on the bike you need to be aware
of your surroundings see the trouble is
if you don't give that correct mix you
end up getting not enough of either not
enough of your surroundings not enough
of the audio that you're wishing you
were listening to now I felt like with
that last pair it was good enough but
with this I feel like you're probably
giving up too much plus I think this
thing is expensive how much is this will
$250 you want to be that whatever that
is you want to be that nice I'm not
wearing this I'm not gonna wear it it's
not happening if it sounded great maybe
I kind of like the idea of not having my
ears covered when I'm out but compared
to the pair that I tried in the past
they did sound better and that I think
that counts for something I don't know
what to tell you two-fifty man you could
get some serious headphones for 250 like
the IQ buds that have microphones in
them so you can get some spatial
awareness Tom say something
oh you're amplified right now I don't
know who this is for
other than the girl on the box some kind
of a costume I mean that's I have to try
it I got to be on the lookout for that
new tech but what I would say is if
you're looking for bone conduction look
away from these I look the one that's a
lot less expensive I will link it down
below in the description a company
called aftershocks and that one does a
better job for less maybe it's for
somebody if that's for you I want to
know in the comments how you see
yourself using that beyond the fact that
you're a huge Star Trek fan and it's
time for you two to beam beam off into
another galaxy far away this episode of
unboxing has been brought to you by the
new honor 7x and in celebration you can
probably tell I've got seven of them in
front of me that's because courtesy of
Honor we're gonna be doing a giveaway
it's happening on my Twitter so make
sure to go follow me there and now I'll
tell you a little bit more about this
device 0.2 second fingerprint scanner so
it's got something they're calling full
view display which is 18 by 9 by default
but then you can utilize that extra
space to have a multi window set up
pulled down the multitask button you see
it'll bring up other things that I've
got open scroll and read it and then
just size this up so it's just the right
size of the YouTube player so it could
be YouTube along with reddit or
Wikipedia or you could be playing a game
along with using a messenger app like
whatsapp or even just a text message do
two things at once you're a busy guy or
girl now another feature this device has
is inside the camera in which the
front-facing lens will respond to a
gesture this is kind of cool if I just
hold up my hand it'll trigger a
countdown timer are you ready jack here
we go look at two one you see that I'll
do it one more time in case you missed
it hand up
see what happened here you trigger a
nice little timer get your pose right
get your beauty mode on who's kidding
who Jeff that's there's some billboard
material that's some Times Square
material some GQ magazine material this
one here has 64 gigs of storage and 4
gigs of RAM but you can expand the
storage as well it's got one of those
combo sim card / micro SD card slots now
honor also told me that this is going to
be a value device available for
somewhere around 300 bucks on top of
that we're gonna be giving 7 away
because it's the 7 X
Willy do ladies and gentlemen also a
smartphone delivery guy so that's a lot
of phones in fact that six this makes 7
we're giving away 7 shout out to honor
for making that possible if you want to
participate go follow me on Twitter the
details will be over there you could be
the happy new owner of one of these
honor 7 X's don't do it do it now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
