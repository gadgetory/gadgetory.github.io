of headphones here on the channel I'm
sure you're aware that you've probably
seen some of those videos nowadays it's
kind of like hey what's it gonna take to
get me excited how is somebody gonna do
something different today I've got a
whole lot of different the product is
called Vinci smart headphones you may
have seen these guys on Kickstarter they
raised close to a million dollars
they put an entire display on one of the
ear cups these things can operate
standalone without a smartphone in fact
there's even a SIM card slot on here
voice controlled hands-free experience
there's sixteen gigabytes of local
storage inside the headphones so you can
load songs right on to the headphones
and leave your smartphone at home it
supports Wi-Fi Bluetooth and 3G
connections so that's what the SIM card
slot is for now you can have a
standalone Spotify or SoundCloud player
I guess it also has activity tracking 21
days of standby time 26 hours of
Bluetooth playback in 10 hours if its
standalone it also supports HD voice
through LTE so there's a lot going on
turns out these are only 149 now they do
come in a few different colors have we
ever had a box with this kind of
coloring on it before that is wild okay
I have no name until you name me I have
no form until you shake me I don't exist
until you make me I am Vinci
I am waiting deep inside you touch my
spark and let me light you give me life
and I'll revive you I am Vinci oh wow
that's a change of pace one free month
of wireless service with t-mobile ooh
okay not as heavy as I expected
considering there's a screen on the
earcup this is the screen that's the SIM
card tray micro USB to charge it up a
mini jack connector so you could use it
wired if you wanted to that looks to be
the heart rate sensor the micro USB
charge cable auxiliary cable to use it
wired to activate your Vinci please
connect to a Wi-Fi okay let's do that
now there's also a voice assistant
built-in here and since the brains are
completely
built-in and it's not relying on your
phone it's got its own assistant
that make any sense what I just said you
guys ever listen to what I say one of
you now you can have this always-on or
only when you're wearing them I guess
always-on is fine now there's a couple
of different services that you can
connect here by default there's Spotify
SoundCloud and Amazon Alexa swipe
horizontally to change tracks swipe
vertically to adjust volume tap once to
pause tap twice to save to favorites
hold to talk Wi-Fi on and off there's an
airplane mode bluetooth on and off it
looks like you can use this as a regular
Bluetooth headset there's a music
visualizer oh look at that
oh you can even do your own DIY oh so
it's like one music service or the other
I guess
now what if I just want to search
something on Spotify I wonder play Led
Zeppelin okay here we go we got a song
playing guys
play Daft Punk play wu-tang Clan no
these are good guys these are cool
I can see one issue being when you're
offline right when you're offline then
you're stuck with whatever music you
have loaded on here these are cool I
didn't expect to be saying this these
are cool it's not Google assistant maybe
maybe it'll get there one day the way
she talks super robotic these should be
like Spotify branded or something
because it's a very unique way of
interacting with Spotify without the
need for a secondary device I could go
for a jog cellphone-free
just quickly turn it down quickly turn
it up I'm not sure how much attention
you want like you could turn that off if
you want you're not gonna be bumping
into people who've got visualizers on
their headphones to record please say
start recording start recording this is
for like voice memos you have a killer
idea you got the best idea ever I need
to put it down and either lay it down
play recording the sound is okay like
it's nothing
special stop blowing me away it's kind
of what I would expect in this
particular price range it does take a
SIM card you can use this thing with 3G
which should be plenty to stream Spotify
so Bluetooth the functions like any
other Bluetooth headset you toggle it on
or off here the idea of putting a screen
on headphones is just not something I
thought would ever be necessary but
because the capacitive input is so
sensitive it's a little more smooth
interacting with it when it's on your
head when compared with a bunch of
buttons and switches I'm gonna go ahead
and say you should check these out I'll
drop a link down in the description they
do come in a couple of different colors
and they've got a model coming out on
Kickstarter it might be active right now
man turn some heads a screen on your ear
cup the future</div></body></html>
