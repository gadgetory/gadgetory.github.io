therapy and welcome to the third video I
believe in the super macbook pro project
of course the hardware installation is
now done so we're going to be talking
about software we're going to be doing
some benchmarks before we get there when
i mentioned that i took the old hard
drive that's no longer being used and
put it into this simple USB 3 enclosure
that's what I recommend you do if you do
an upgrade like this these things are
very very cheap and they're very useful
because instead of just you know
throwing the hard drive out you can use
it as a fast USB 3 backup drive so I
will link an enclosure down in the
description so you can pick one up if
you do an upgrade like this now the next
thing to do is of course to install the
OS because these drives are blank right
now what you want to do is hold down
command and are when booting up that
will get you into the Apple recovery
module now it does need to hook up to
the web so you need an internet
connection for this to operate as you
can see the little globe is spinning
there after putting in your network
credentials password etc it will go
ahead and download the necessary
information so that you can boot into
the recovery console which includes a
reinstallation button as well as Disk
Utility and some other functions that
will be useful to you if you are
upgrading your system or if you just
want to restore your system so from here
the first thing we're going to do is
access Disk Utility that's because we
have two blank SSDs in here the 480
gigabyte Neutron GTX SSDs from Corsair
everything in this upgrade will be down
in the description as well I'm trying to
do that on each of these videos so you
want to make sure that they're being
read correctly and that you've installed
them correctly as you can see I've got
two of them here now I have already set
up the raid for a total of nine hundred
and fifty nine point five two gigabytes
of storage which is amazing I'm super
pumped about that but if you are at the
early stages of this particular upgrade
and you need to still set up the raid
what you'll do is select either of the
two drives then hit the raid button and
then from there you can just drag and
drop the two hard drives or SSDs in this
case into this little window right here
and then you can go ahead and hit create
for the raid now
in this particular case we have a stripe
trade which means that you get the full
storage capacity of both of your drives
with no redundancy so a little bit of a
performance improvement but no extra
redundancy for backup if you want to
have an active mirror of your system
Drive you can use RAID one instead and
that will give you in always their
backup but it won't give you any
performance improvement and of course
you'll only get half the capacity
because one drive is constantly running
as a backup so the next thing to do is
to reinstall the OS which I've already
done here and I've gone ahead and set up
the system with some benchmarking tools
pre-installed so that I can show you
guys how this system performs but before
we get there I do want to mention that
you should always check into your about
this Mac in order to make sure that
everything is being read correctly and
also that the link speed on both of your
SSDs is being negotiated correctly so
I'll give you more info on what that
means right here so you want to go into
about this Mac and then click on this
system report from here you want to
scroll down to serial ata on the
left-hand side this will give you all
the important information on each of
your two SATA ports and as you can see
here the link speed is six gigabit on
both the traditional hard drive Bay as
well as the newly created optical drive
bay that we used an adapter in order to
access so some people suggested in older
videos that you wouldn't get six gigabit
connection on both of the two ports but
on these new 2012 MacBook Pros you
actually are getting full link speed on
both ports so those people are actually
wrong there's some really good
information around the web about this
and whether or not your model is
compatible but in this particular case
you get full speed no performance issues
six gigabits on both ports so hitting an
incredible performance boost here having
both of these SSDs installed speaking of
performance here is the first benchmark
we're going to run this is the disk
speed test from Blackmagic Design
targeted at testing disk speed so
perfect for testing this brand-new SSD
raid the highest figures I came up with
after a number of different tests and
scenarios was eight hundred and forty
point four megabytes per second right
and nine hundred and thirty-two point
one megabytes
second read these are astronomical
figures for a laptop and the performance
like the real-world performance I mean
is just as good you can tell it's
incredibly snappy so the next benchmark
we want to do is Geekbench 2 and I
actually bought the full version finally
so I can run it in full Intel 64-bit
mode this takes a couple of seconds so
I'm going to fast forward the actual
benchmarking progress so we can get to
the end and get the score figures this
system managed a 13,000 466 score that
might not mean much to you on its own
but once you put it in context and put
it up against some other popular scores
from other systems in the Mac universe
it actually comes up pretty damn
impressive
the Geekbench score is like an overall
score based on a number of different
tests to tell you what your system is
capable of so if you open up the Mac
benchmark chart on their website you can
see here the top score ever recorded is
for the top-of-the-line Mac Pro with 12
cores you can pretty much assume that
would be it
but this is where things get interesting
ours actually fits in pretty damn well
below the six core Mac Pro desktop
computer so even though this thing has
four cores and is of course a laptop it
scores pretty much as well as the six
core Mac Pro and above the top spec
27-inch iMac with a much faster clock
speed at 3.4 gigahertz so that's the one
with even the upgraded processor so this
is really an amazing figure for a laptop
and beyond the stock systems that you
can purchase consumer stock systems with
the exception of the Mac Pro so that
includes the retina macbook pro top spec
that you can order from them so the next
benchmark and the last benchmark is
Cinebench release 11.5 this will run two
separate benchmarks the first one is
OpenGL and the second one is CPU this
will look at your CPU of course as well
as your graphics processor so basically
what you're seeing here is 3d graphics
and it's being rendered by the graphics
card and then in the end it will spit
out in FPS rating to tell you how
quickly your system was able to deal
with rendering those graphics and then
you
a score based on that FPS so this is 40
0.32 FPS on the Open GL score so the
next thing we're going to run is the CPU
score and this is a little bit different
rather than be 3d graphics rendering
like moving graphics this one just
renders a really high resolution image
like you might be doing in the creative
arts the way you might be using one of
these MacBook Pros and then this will
also give you a score but in a points
figure seven point zero seven points and
you can also check where this stacks up
against other systems so as you look
down here you'll notice that it actually
beats at three point two gigahertz core
i7 960 from Intel which is also a four
core chip but a desktop chip so once
again really really nice numbers here
but this would be essentially the same
as CPU figure even if you didn't upgrade
this system it's just a great CPU to
begin with so anyway guys that wraps up
the performance portion of the super
macbook pro project I'm really excited
about this particular system I'm happy
with the way it's performing in the real
world thanks for watching up until this
point I'm going to put all these super
MacBook Pro videos into one playlist if
you want to go back and watch them I
will link the playlist in the
description thanks for watching if you
guys enjoyed this project leave a thumbs
up and I will catch on the next video
later</div></body></html>
