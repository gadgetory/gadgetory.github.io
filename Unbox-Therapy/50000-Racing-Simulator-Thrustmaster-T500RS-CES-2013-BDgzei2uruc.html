coverage what's up guys Lew here in the
next item I want to show you from the
show floor at CES 2013 is this amazing
racing simulator from Thrustmaster I
know I would love to have one of these
unfortunately something like this this
exact setup is going to run you about 50
grand
that's correct we've got a lot of zeros
there but it is also very sophisticated
there's a bunch of actuators built into
the seat that will push and pull you in
the direction that you would naturally
be pushed and pulled into if you were
driving an f1 car it's just like being
in an f1 cockpit this dude here he's
having a little bit of difficulty
keeping this car on the road as you'll
see here he actually ends up flipping it
I didn't even know that was possible in
the game so he takes his hands off and
he gets the hell out of Las Vegas
immediately after that because of the
obvious embarrassment next on the wheel
is AJ and he does a better job of course
we've come to expect that from AJ in
general and as you'll notice here he's
got his hands wrapped around in f1 style
steering wheel that steering wheel is
actually available independent of this
entire system if you're looking for
something more affordable in the way of
a racing simulator the wheel I believe
is around 200 bucks but it is an
attachment to the thrust master system
so you could get set up for something
around 500 bucks without the pedals and
the actuators and all that I think you
actually do get the pedals regardless
I'm going to link some of the items I
can find independently down in the
description so you can go check out the
pricing and different configurations
that are available as you can see here
there's independent speakers in this
setup as well those are going to also
add to the experience making you feel as
though you are on the racetrack so
overall this is probably as close as you
can get to driving an f1 car without
driving in f1 car so a pretty cool
experience one of the cool experiences
here at CES 2013 lots to see and do and
I've got a lot more to show you guys so
don't go anywhere CES coverage is not
over yet
I'm going to be going through a bunch of
footage picking the best things and you
guys can also give me your suggestions
if there's something that you want to
see because I think we have like 65 70
videos left to go through so if there's
something you want to see
I'll check the inventory and I'll get to
that first so let me know in the
comments down below anyway guys thanks
as always for watching and we'll catch
you on the next
video thumbs up alright later guys sync
is all about staying in touch all with
simple voice commands you never have to
worry about a phone call while driving
with hands-free calling if your phone
rings you can answer with the push of a
button and you can make a call with the
sound of your voice unbox therapy CES
