Lou time to give up your Nokia time to
give up your pager time to give up your
cell phone that's actually cellular do
you remember car phones right in the
middle there in the console and it had
like it was corded and you could only
use it in the car
my grandfather had one of those all
right jack we were rolling on all of
that so you know what that means
short and sweet the only way to do it
what's up guys Lou here back with
another video and it is another
installment in the top three tech deals
series seems like you guys are enjoying
this series and we're gonna continue
with it basically me bringing you three
interesting tech deals that I bump into
on Amazon on any given day the first one
not exactly a piece of tech but tech
related important for your tech it is
whoosh screen shine duo desk bottle and
pocket sprayer with two microfiber
cloths now this is a combo kit you don't
need to buy it like this you can buy it
just as the spray or the cloth or a
travel size this is the kit that I've
bought a couple times now and the reason
this stuff is important is because your
gadgets get dirty and ugly and
everything has glass and screens and
glossy stuff on it and you end up with
fingerprints everywhere and this is the
cleaner of choice here in the office
it's not very expensive it's non-toxic
safe to use approved to use and
relatively inexpensive from five bucks
up to ten bucks I'm talking about
cleaning stuff it's time to move on Lou
next up a USB Drive not the most
exciting item but a great price here and
it's a USB 3 Drive 64 gigabytes from PNY
great customer reviews it's quick its
inexpensive 22 dollars a substantial
amount of portable storage 64 gigabytes
of USB 3 so if you've been holding off
on getting a USB 3 thumb drive which is
significantly faster than USB 2 this
might be the moment to grab one I also
like the mechanism for how it opens and
closes this retracting lid I suppose
that stays attached so you can't really
lose it you just lift it up push it back
that doesn't sound very appealing but
yeah pull it out push it back push it in
pull it out god damn it god damn it jack
look how strategic it is $34.99 free
shipping on orders over 35 ex tup we
have something that's not really hugely
on sale as far as a deal is concerned
but it was too difficult to pass up for
this episode because it's a classic USB
version of an NES controller play those
old-school classics through an emulator
using a controller the way it was
originally intended whether it's Super
Mario double dragging see how I'm like
getting more active here the soundtrack
to Double Dragon - no joke no joke go
look for this I'm gonna go after I'm
done recording this is no word of a lie
I am gonna go put that soundtrack on
repeat on the speakers Jack remind me to
do it only $8.50 with decent reviews
four out of five stars on 882 reviews
but what I noticed when I scrolled down
you got all kinds of classic controllers
on here so if your jam was more like
Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis or
Nintendo 64 there are super affordable
replicas check all of them out in that
list when you scroll down you can get
the controller that satisfies your
nostalgia these don't require a driver
and the listing here says that it will
work with Windows 98 ME 2000 2003 XP 7 8
8.1 it's just a cool looking thing
reminds you of happier and simpler times
8 bucks
Nintendo times
nes times if you want to stroke your
nostalgia a little bit more Oh Jack so
that wraps up this video let me know
your suggestions in the comments maybe
you find a cool deal and you want to
link it to me like a blanket most people
like to use a blanket and a pillow you
know I hate my pillow right now I used
to have this pillow that it had
curvature to it you know he like had a
little portion up here where your neck
would sit then he dipped down for the
head a little bit and was made out of
foam I don't know what happened to it
this is a serious thing right now if you
know of a good pillow that follows that
guideline I just talked about the
world's best pillow I need to know about
it leave a comment hit me up on Twitter
I need a new pillow from NES controllers
two pillows thank you very much for
watching goodbye because I can just I
can feel I can feel the presence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
