therapy and today we're taking a look at
the avermedia Game Capture HD 2 as the
name implies this device will capture
your gameplay in super high quality in
fact up to 1080p it will support your
Xbox 360 or Playstation 3
it has HDMI inputs as well as component
inputs but what's special about the Game
Capture HD 2 is the fact that it
features an internal drive bay a two and
a half inch drive bay so you can take a
really large hard drive install it right
into the capture device and then you
won't need a secondary computer in order
to start and stop recording and to store
those recordings before you go and
offload them upload it or whatever it is
you want to do with that gameplay
there's also a usb on the front so if
you prefer to use external storage like
an external hard drive or a USB thumb
drive you can do that as well but for
anybody who's been in the business of
recording gameplay before you understand
that these files can get huge especially
if you're logging you know long sessions
of gameplay and having an internal drive
installed just gives you tons of
headroom 20 30 40 hours depending on
what size of hard drive you choose to go
with the device is relatively portable
as you can see here it's about the size
of a Wi-Fi router maybe and since it's a
standalone product and you don't need a
computer to operate it you're going to
do most of your navigation with this
remote right here it's actually fairly
simple you've got dedicated buttons for
taking snapshots starting and ending
recordings you've got a power switch on
there there's a directional pad and then
of course multimedia buttons for
navigating the gameplay after you've
recorded it if you want to watch it back
make sure that you've captured the clip
that you hope to have captured as you
can tell you've got a pretty standard
power brick here but it does look like a
universal version so depending on where
you are in the world you will also
receive the necessary tips to install
onto this power brick so that it works
for you in your particular region of
course for us here in North America
we're getting the standard two prongs
they've also included an HDMI cable
which is awesome that's always a welcome
addition and then you've got a little
bit of paperwork down here this is the
user manual which is actually quite
detailed and helpful as you know some of
these setups can get a little bit
complicated so this is one of the rare
occasions where I recommend you read
through the manual they've also included
some batteries for that remote control
so you won't need to go searching for
some to get up and running when you
receive the device there's also a
QuickStart guide if you want to avoid
the full in-depth user manual here you
can get a better idea of the design on
the top of the device it's actually
pretty cool it's got a black and red
color scheme going on I'm a big fan of
those two colors especially in
combination on the back here you can see
the component inputs on the left hand
side as well as analog audio inputs
there's an HDMI IN an HDMI out there's a
LAN port you can actually connect this
thing to your network and of course a DC
into power the device on the front you
have your USB port as well as a
microphone in and headphone out if you
want to connect a headset for live
commentary there's a record button and
of course the power button as well
underneath is where you will install
your two-and-a-half inch hard drive as I
mentioned earlier and the cool thing
here is that it doesn't require any
tools you just remove the backplate
install your Drive slide it in there put
the plate back on and you are completely
ready to go but you will not need to do
this to operate the device this is just
a convenience thing if you want to use
an external USB Drive you are completely
free to do that as well now the most
important thing with any game capture
device is of course the quality of the
gameplay footage that's captured so I
decided to sit down play a little bit of
GTA 5 record some gameplay and let you
guys watch it but before we head into
that gameplay I want to quickly mention
an awesome promotion that our friends

conjunction with sharp it's the sharp
