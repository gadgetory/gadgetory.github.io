for this video is just to give you a
quick update on the giveaway that I was
planning to do M planning to do because
I mentioned back during the Ben q
contest that I was involved in that if I
won which I did thanks to you guys
thanks to the viewers and the voters of
course that I was going to do a giveaway
to give back to the community to the
unbox therapy army as I like to call you
guys but please let me know if that
offends you nah I'm just kidding anyways
and I wanted to put some of the
determination of what's giving away in
your guy's hands now the way I want to
do that is with a simple question you
know over the years I've been
accumulating a lot of cool stuff that
I've unbox on a channel and you guys ask
me all the time you say Lou what do you
do with all this stuff you know how do
you use it all so on and so forth well
in truth a lot of stuff is just hanging
out just just sitting around and so I
was thinking rather than do the usual oh
I'll give away an iPad or a games
console or something along those lines
maybe I could put together a package
deal you know a number of cool things
that I featured on the channel in the
past that are hanging out I could put
them together in a package maybe up to a
value a total value of around $500 and
give that away instead of the usual now
if you're a bigger fan of the usual
which is like a single tablet or a games
console then let me know down in the
comments section if you're a bigger fan
of the package deal then you let me know
down in the comments section now
whichever vote wins out if there's more
people that prefer the package we'll go
that route we'll roll that way and if
there's more people that are interested
in the single large item then we'll go
that way you know I'm just trying to get
you guys involved in the process I don't
want to give you something that you
don't want to win so the second part of
this is that you guys may or may not
know I launched a second channel some of
you do some of you are big fans others
of you probably haven't visited yet so
as a result in order to help promote my
new project which is called the beast
feed I'm going to be announcing the
winner of this particular contest on
that channel so the giveaway once it
goes live will be announced on this
channel on unbox therapy but the winner
will be announced over on the beast feed
now if you know if you haven't visited
that channel yet I'll put a link in the
annotations of this video as well as
down in
description you're gonna want to go
ahead and subscribe so that you do not
miss the winner once this giveaway goes
live and hey you might just enjoy the
content on top of it so anyways that's
all I want to say in this little update
video as soon as I get the results in
from you guys answering that question
that I asked I'll go live with the video
so please get your responses in get your
comments in as quick as possible and
otherwise I just want to thank you guys
for taking part supporting this channel
and helping me out along the way if you
guys enjoy this content then please do
like and favorite the video as it does
help me out a bunch and you always do so
that's not even a big deal and until
next time until the next video I'll see
you around a channel and I'm waiting for
the results and if you guys want to
catch up with me on Twitter please go
ahead and do so that's twitter.com slash
unbox therapy you can ask me specific
questions over there it's very easy for
me to monitor it is my social space of
choice so once again that's twitter.com
slash unbox therapy I will see you guys
on the next one later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
