another video and today we're taking a
look at a fairly sophisticated security
camera this is from a company called
amcrest it's the pro HD the real model
name is IP - em - 841 B you probably
don't want to say that so let's say
amcrest pro HD what's different about
this one compared to some of the other
stuff I've looked at is that it has pan
and tilt and it's not just zooming into
the single frame this actually moves
around so you can keep tabs on every
inch of the room from your smartphone
you can actually interact with it that
way it'll record to the cloud if you
feel safer doing that or it can record
to a micro SD card slot it's also got
night vision on it 1080p recording at
30fps they claim you can set it up in 60
seconds
that seems ambitious to me advanced
video recording as I mentioned micro sd
amcrest
MBR that's like a an actual recording
box type situation or amcrest cloud
there are alerts as well motion let's
say or sound that's detected you can get
that notification and go hey I didn't
expect anyone to be in that space at
that particular time and then go ahead
and look at the live feed to see what's
going on let's go ahead jump inside the
box and take a closer look ok you got to
download an app on either the App Store
or Google Play so it'll work with iOS or
Android now the app is called AM
crestview Lite or pro I'm gonna launch
the lite version
cool you'll notice there are multiple
boxes that's because you can have more
than one camera hey you guys are
probably wondering Lou why are you
always talking about security cameras as
some of you know I'm in this pretty cool
office right now studio as we like to
call it we have a lot of I don't know
expensive gear in here the camera I'm
talking into all these fancy monitors my
eye in the sky and see what Jack's doing
when I'm not here
DC power audio in and out so you can
actually send the audio from here out to
a speaker and then you can send a
separate microphone in if you don't want
to use the built-in microphone that's
kind of cool
microSD as I mentioned over here that's
for recording locally to the actual
device and then it has Wi-Fi but it also
has an Ethernet jack if you prefer for
it to be wired in this on the back here
is a speaker and then on the bottom is a
tripod mount there's actually two way
communication here so you could speak
back to somebody on the other side and
then through the microphone hear what
they're saying and so on also inside the
box a little tiny disc
oh my goodness a Ethernet cable for that
wired connection that I mentioned
earlier so this is another option for
mounting here is where that thread lives
you can screw this baby in and get
whatever angle you want on the camera
that's kind of cool a fairly slim AC
power brick for powering the device up
so I'm gonna go ahead get this baby
plugged in launch up the application and
see what can do name for the camera the
Jack cam monitoring jack 24/7 apparently
if I tap the QR I can just scan it all
right you try this out dot it Wi-Fi
password close your eyes and to make a
password for it okay look away once
again whoa Jack two four seven limbs you
have it set to four cameras nine sixteen
and snap a photo oh whoa okay there's my
hand
hello where's me hello there
that's really cool
check you logs we were getting some
feedback because but now you hit it
sense for the two two-way communication
so I can be like over here drag that
back to whack get back to work you could
take this audio output to like a
seriously loud speaker and essentially
have like a a walkie talkie type
environment you simply say listen I see
you buddy you're in my spot I know you
are leave now or it's over for you you
see how intimidating I am right now we
could film an entire unbox therapy video
right here this is not bad actually
quality wise now that's some real
inception stuff right there it's me
recording me recording me recording me
recording me from the mean oh there it
is we have our very own eye in the sky
now here at unbox therapy headquarters
brought to you by amcrest whatever it is
you're trying to protect this is
obviously a deterrent oh and there I am
