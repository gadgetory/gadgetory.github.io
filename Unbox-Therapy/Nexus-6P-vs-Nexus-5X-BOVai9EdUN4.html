look at the one you're a professional
I'm a pro I do this what are we doing
here today we're being pros what's up
guys Lew here back with another video
and today as you can tell things are a
little bit different I can't put my
finger on it something seems strange
here gone I'm Dom big dumb Dom Esposito
mr. purple mr. purple Dom's a friend of
mine and he's a youtuber youtube.com
slash Don Diego happens to be visiting
my hometown and so we decided why not do
the YouTube thing and collaborate on a
little on a little piece of content for
you guys we have the new Nexus devices
X's for the first time we have two Nexus
devices launching at the very same time
closer to me here we have the Nexus 6p
and Dom in your hand Nexus 5x these are
some skins from our good friends at D
brand a new style this is called copper
and as you can tell it's got a cool
texture to it and color take it to the
Nexus level but the point of this video
to sort of look at the benefits and
drawbacks of each of these two devices
which one should you buy right yeah go
ahead and sell the people the 5x budget
phone you know it's it's under $400 got
a 5.2 inch HD display 1080p yeah got a
nice of twelve point three megapixel
camera on the back I mean if we're
comparing to the Nexus 5 better big step
in the right direct obviously got a
plastic bill but we do have the laser
autofocus like you know you have with a
lot of other LG phones that are out
there hmm
competitors for this device may be a
Moto X you got your Moto X pure there is
something about Nexus the Google
Experience the way that it was intended
when you boot one of these devices up
man is it clean but maybe the Nexus
terminology is going up market a little
bit starting with this 5x and then being
fully realized in this 6p you know you
got you
like 380 and your 500 different
processors set up two gigs of RAM
Snapdragon 808 3 gigs of ram Snapdragon
810 so there's you know there's some
differences there but overall I mean you
really can't beat this if you're purist
you didn't talk yet about the
fingerprint sensor but you have actually
been using this 5x for a little while so
I mean you can give some feedback and
your print sensor it's you know right
where your finger would rest and I'm
just holding the phone my finger just
goes right to that spot and it's very
fast I mean it does work exceptionally
well for what it does this one is at
least $100 more than this one yep
what do you get in this one it makes it
so much better yeah then just going with
the budget option you're getting kind of
a feel here a construction that is more
in line with the other flagships on the
market weight can actually add sort of a
feel a presence of quality whether it's
legit or not now if you are somebody
with dainty little paws maybe you're a
hobbit then you need to take that into
consideration but of course bigger
screen means a greater sort of
consumption experience when you are
watching video it almost always means a
bigger battery as well you're getting
close to 30 500 milliamp hours at 3450
with a 6-inch display higher resolution
and this other one over here is 2700
yeah that's 3450 yeah yeah big
difference there big difference when I
turn this on oh that's an AMOLED display
I could just tell like just based on the
colors right the richness of the colors
I think to a large percentage of people
you show them an AMOLED display they're
like oh that looks better it's hard to
go back yeah on the front of the device
the fact that we have stereo speakers
which is not on this guy
yeah you might you might look at that
maybe and you're received with the
design of this the 5x is deceiving you
Hawaii you only the bottom on the 5x is
actually a speaker the 4 facing camera
yeah you got a 8 megapixel 8 megapixel
versus 5 so you've got a little bit more
res cameras I know you touched on this
very similar we were doing some test
shots prior to coming in here and
recording they are
pretty damn close it is not a major
differentiating factor on the both of
these what is the the main consideration
here when it comes to a person making a
decision they know they want Nexus but
they don't know which one well first of
all how much money do you want to spend
yeah it's important to know going into
it second you know I hate to say it but
this one's made by LG this one's made by
Huawei how many people have heard of LG
vs. how many people have heard of Huawei
that's a consideration for sure I would
say it's hard to pass this up for what
it is yeah but I'm a build guy really
i'ma build guy okay I mean I like the
bill all right you know it seems that
especially looking at some of those old
Nexus devices they keep getting bigger
things that keep scaling and they keep
accelerating the rate of scaling when
considering the size of your device you
need to think about how you use it
size-wise they're pretty close but
they're not they're not because this is
on the fringe of one-handed use look at
this I mean I can reach with my hand the
taller the top corner of the screen
makes a big difference I couldn't do it
on the other one without making major
adjustments with my hand that's another
thing about the big the big fella see
you drop them yeah there's Latian
they're just a little bit more awkward
especially in one hand I think this guy
here is right on that fringe of
usability and consumption when we took
out that Nexus 5 earlier yeah holding
the Nexus 5 feels great confidence and
confidence in one hand but er I
personally will prefer to see premium
build materials in a slightly smaller
form factor why why is handsome and and
and one of the things that's unfortunate
is it seems that the flagship if as it
were yeah is only a thing that comes in
a in a larger form factor so I'm gonna
pick the opposite you said the 6p wheels
for you I'm gonna say save your 120
bucks and get the 5x you keep it Nexus
this is as pure as it gets this is as
pure as the driven snow as they once
said in a famous movie it's a pure heart
do you know what movie I'm talking about
no never mind I hope you guys enjoyed
this video big thanks to Dom for jumping
on this collaboration big shout to D
