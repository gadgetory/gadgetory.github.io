I'm whispering is to show off this brand
new microphone that I'm playing with it
is incredibly powerful and as you can
tell listening to my whispers there's
absolutely no noise created by the
preamp now the reason I'm saying preamp
is because this mic has a built-in
recorder it's not feeding back to the
camera in any way and that's why I'm
monitoring with headphones right from
the microphone you put an SD card in
here hit the record button on the back
and it does everything you just grab
that audio file afterwards and line it
up with your video and you are done no
external recording device and insane
quality so in this video I'm gonna go
around my house do some regular everyday
things and record the audio to show you
what this brand new microphone from sure
is capable of
so hopefully those demos gave you guys a
better idea of what you can achieve
through upgrading your audio the model
here is VP 83 f-from sure and as I said
in the beginning of this video what
makes it unique is the fact that it has
a built-in audio interface SD card slot
and it records internally so you just
you know pull out the SD card from the
front I can show you while I'm still
recording and put that into your
computer and then you can sync it up
after the fact you know you can do a
simple clap if you absolutely want to
have the audio on the same track as your
video recording you can send the cable
out and then back into like I'm using a
60d or other digital SLR but I
completely recommend against it the the
major value proposition here is that we
can bypass the crappy preamps on the
DSLR and trust me they're all crap no
matter how much money you spend that's
why so many Pro youtubers are using
separate audio interfaces and recorders
especially from companies like zoom but
this is even more streamlined and the
results are pretty amazing so instead of
having a separate shotgun microphone as
well as an audio recorder you get that
all in one convenient little package
that can mount on the top of your camera
if you are interested in more
information pricing and availability on

link down in the description to make
your life a little bit easier hopefully
