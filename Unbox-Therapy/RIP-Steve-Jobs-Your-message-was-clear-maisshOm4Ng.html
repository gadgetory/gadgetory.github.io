can see I'm out in the park an unusual
place to find me and the reason I came
all the way out here is because I wanted
to say a few words about the late Steve
Jobs the giant that he was you know you
can have your different affiliations
with different tech companies and you
know I've seen enough of it in my
comment sections and in my inboxes
people getting all militant about which
devices they use and I wanted to take
this opportunity to sit down and and
talk about the collaborative aspect of
this whole industry and every industry
and the planet for that matter I don't
want to get overly dramatic but Steve
said it best himself you know in talking
about innovation and and ideas and
thoughts in general that the vast
majority of us are held back or held
back by others instead of working
together you know we we get down about
about things and you know we might not
always be moving forward or moving in
the right direction
he forecast you know his own death in
his speech at Stanford and you know we
can all do the same for ourselves it's
going to happen we were all gonna die
and it's about what you do while you're
here I mean that man was was twice my
age I've had half the time on his planet
that he has and it just you know it's
staggering a belief that you know
somebody like him could be cut down you
know he had that that sort of immortal
stature you thought that guys like him
might live forever but obviously he's
just human like the rest of us and
that's really the thing about being
human is that you know what we're doing
here is we're just really sharing
influence we have a short little glimpse
we're here for a very short period of
time and it's that influence that lives
on in his case maybe it was the graphic
user interface or maybe it was the iPod
or it doesn't really matter because the
effects of what a person does on this
planet can never really be quantified
you don't know who they affected and how
they impacted
all the different moments in everybody's
life that went on to change the world so
let's not let's not continue this crap
about you know which gadgets are the
best that which brand is the best or
which company is the best the fact of
the matter is that everything that every
company accomplishes every innovation
every social change is rooted in
influence and it's rooted in the things
that people have done previously and you
know to change the landscape of where
we're currently at you know whether you
like say an iPhone today it doesn't
necessarily mean that you can't respect
the amount of innovation and the amount
of change that took place because of
that device if it wasn't for the iPhone
you know smartphones in general might
not have taken off you know the the the
market might not have become so you know
so willing to accept those kinds of
devices most people today who I know war
on Android devices you know had an
iPhone at some point you know the iPhone
really brought touch interfaces into the
limelight and if you look at old footage
of Steve Jobs I believe there's
something from him somewhere in the 90s
I'll see if I can find a link but where
he was identifying forecasting that the
way we would compute in the future would
be on touchscreen devices small
touchscreen devices with you know color
imagery so on and so forth I mean
basically forecasting the exact
direction that we're moving in so that
imagination of his has driven the
marketplace regardless of where your
affiliation lies now so if there's
anything that can be taken away from his
death is you know his own words that
that our time here is limited and and
you've got a you got to wake up every
day thinking about you know how you want
to live it if it would be your last you
know you got to wake up every day doing
exactly what it is that you want to do
because before you know it your time's
going to run out and the last thing the
last thing that any of us want is to not
make the impact that we could have made
so anyway guys a very unusual video I
know it's obviously affected me greatly
you know celebrities die and all the
time very few things affect me but this
is one of the few people you know CEOs
that that you can ask anybody on the
street and they knew his name you know
and I don't believe that that happened
by accident so I guess we're gonna move
on we're gonna see where Apple goes it's
amazing that he waited you know until
officially passing the torch through you
know the last keynote there you know he
held on and passed shortly after but you
know it's hard to imagine a world
without him and I guess that's where
we're at so anyway guys hopefully I have
a more regular video coming at you soon
but those are my thoughts and you know I
hope you can sympathize don't get nasty
in the comments you know this is a
moment to remember somebody who made a
gigantic impact a giant himself see you
guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
