therapy and today we're looking at my
old phone the Samsung Nexus S and you're
probably saying dude
I watched you unbox the Galaxy Nexus why
are you showing us this old piece of
crap well I'm here to tell you that this
is not a piece of crap today the
official Ice Cream Sandwich update
rolled out to this device and completely
overhauled it let me tell you it feels
like a brand new device the app drawers
the animations the web browser I mean
really everything has been overhauled
this is a major OS update and this phone
even with its single core it really
feels like a new device now if you're
sitting around waiting with your Android
device and you're you're wondering when
this update is gonna roll out to your
specific device via your specific
carrier I don't know when that's gonna
happen as of this point it seems like
it's only Nexus S is but let me tell you
something you have a lot to look forward
to because when that does occur you're
gonna see all kinds of improvements
around the operating system and your
phone is just gonna feel faster in
general there's a new messaging app the
keyboard got better the web browser got
better the ability to select text has
gotten better I mean this is all
obviously Ice Cream Sandwich based
improvements these are software based
improvements but as we all know with
software improvements comes a better
user experience all of a sudden you
start believing your phone is better
than it is at least that's what I'm
saying in this case I mean I can't you
know tell a huge difference between this
and the newer Galaxy Nexus on the new OS
just in everyday use yes the browser's
faster on the other one and of course
the screen is significantly better etc
but this is a major improvement this
makes this phone an incredibly good
value right now if your carrier is
giving it away or something
because at the moment as far as I know
it's the only other device on the market
that's gonna be running native Ice Cream
Sandwich Android 4.0 at least at this
moment there may be others added soon
you can see the new animation for the
notifications it's changed a little bit
it's it's a little bit translucent you
can jump right into settings from there
of course you've got your Wi-Fi toggle
switch which I'll go ahead and turn on
and off here but you can see the design
has changed slightly if
fonts that they're using has changed
slightly they've also improved the
contact section I did have like a sort
of a more inclusive look at Ice Cream
Sandwich in an older video you can check
that out on my channel if you'd like to
but this was just to sort of celebrate
the fact that other devices are gonna
get to share in the Ice Cream Sandwich
enjoyment and chances are if you're
running an older Android device you're
not gonna have to wait around too long
so rejoice celebrate Merry Christmas
everyone
anyways guys if you enjoyed this content
hopefully you can like and favorite this
video I've got another video on the way
tonight before the Sun comes up so stick
around for that and as always I want to
thank you for watching I'll see you
around the channel okay thanks guys see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
