here on unbox therapy speakers Bluetooth
wireless speakers right they've taken
over the whole landscape of the way that
we listen to music but there's no
shortage of different brands trying to
make the next best one try to make the
greatest one and what I've seen recently
emerging these boombox style
large form factor Bluetooth speakers
that are essentially replacing the
boombox of yesteryear they're a step
better sound wise than those ultra
portable ones but they're still kind of
portable themselves now this one a lot
of people say it might be the top dog so
what we're going to do here is what we
do best find out if they're telling the
truth it's the Iowa exos 9 portable
bluetooth speaker big speaker big sound
two is better than one so you can link
these together with one button if you
want even more sound it can go outside
you can unplug it so it's got a battery
in there fifty-foot bluetooth operating
radius that's good a number of speakers
on the front NFC pairing I like that and
the battery is good for about 10 hours
it can also charge up your phone or
tablet via the USB charging that's
onboard I've got a whole playlist for
Bluetooth speakers so you can go back
watch the videos look at my expression
right here and pointing on something
tonight and all the evidence is right
there this here just don't lie all right
there's no script there has never been a
script on here Jack's waving paperwork
over them saying put it away man
goodbye - good enough
oh here's the unit whoa this looks like
the fabric power and auxilary if you
maybe need it oh wow
padded hand on the back you know you
could be looks like some controls link
EQ play/pause that metal feels like
metal a volume knob and then on the back
we have the USB charge here this says is
for software updates that's a micro USB
connector it looks like USB charge for
your device maybe the device that you're
streaming from or maybe you want maybe
you just want to share some juice with
whoever it is that's at your picnic
there's a line in if you want to go up
Ziller e power and then a power switch
that's what a battery goes see if it
shows up in a bluetooth here maybe I
just do NFC oh are you sure you want to
pair with the Bluetooth device yes
please oh wow it's an actual full out EQ
control one two three four five stage EQ
control you can scoop it out a little
bit having enhancement on the lows and
the highs options I mean that's good the
other stuff I looked at didn't have that
so there you go
we're clipping or clipping the recording
editing it loud play pause on the top
very infrequently with your recording
level that we have set on the microphone
in the front very infrequently are we
capable of even clipping this mic now
what you hear in those samples is the
super high end of the recording
interface here before you start to get
compression at the very end of the
spectrum this thing is loud but the
sound here in front of me is not
breaking up at all at the high end is
it's not crunchy yet it's not like it
gets there easily
newblue to charity I think a lot of
people want this to be their main stereo
system there are a lot of Bluetooth
speakers out there in the smaller
category those don't really replace your
stereo system now I know a lot of you
are gonna be sitting there saying Lou I
don't have space for that like I need
something portable and that's fine
that's fair when it comes to sound when
it comes to acoustics there currently is
no substitute for the physical scale you
have to have the cabinet size to
resonate at that level if you want that
capacity if you want to feel that thump
if you want to get people moving you've
got to have a cabinet to do it
this is loud enough that your neighbors
could complain $3.99 great reviews on
Amazon as well I'm not the only one
apparently there may be a new value
champion at 399
stuff like that I'm like a minute
nobody calm please feel uncomfortable
semana stupid face I'm out here</div></body></html>
