it a thing I think it's a great way to
start a video we all collectively take a
deep breath Wow
what's up guys Lew here back with
another video and today I am showing you
something outlandish the Box not so
outlandish but inside I am fairly
certain we're going to look at something
that will only be bought and consumed by
a small number of people the elite the
Donald Trump's of the world okay maybe
it's not that elite in here is a $1,000
iPhone 6s case $1000 let's see what it's
all about inside of this cardboard box
there's a couple of different things
here a little ziploc bag with what looks
like maybe some options color options
sounds hard gray Advent some weight
there whoa - our dear customer that's me
the Advent was created to turn your
fantasies into a reality
you hear that beans it is a case that
redefines design and elegance each case
goes through a time-consuming machining
process where a solid block of aerospace
grade five titanium alloys transformed
into being in to up being of such
complexity and precision inheriting the
strength and lightweight properties of
titanium oh my goodness gracious
okay so you guys are serious I see my
name engraved a little cursive writing
there my name here right on the case
itself
holy smokes inside the important
components grade five titanium sounds
quite serious actually lightweight and
then the other side of it mmm it's
numbered number 34 of 100 like a fancy
car if you will watch the way this
closes right here
Oh attention to detail me extra touches
a little touch to the thigh when it
counts it's a family show Jack you know
what I think that yeah that makes sense
okay okay I mean okay it definitely
looks cool and it's got your initials or
your name engraved in it so yeah but I
gotta say for a thousand bucks
I kind of wish that maybe the the gasket
portion was like right adhered on to the
also I'm not sure how confident I am in
just having that friction fit on there
nonetheless this is such a low volume
product like how many people are gonna
put $1,000 case on their iPhone Donald
Trump he's your guy so anyway I guess
you can swap out the colors you could do
different colors you have a cutout for
your headphone jack your microphone
speaker situation there's still space in
the middle for your lightning connector
and then cutouts of course for your
volume your lock switch and then your
power button over here this is going to
protect your phone for sure elevate it a
little bit from the surface and on the
front but my goodness $1,000 for a case
I mean this thing might need to make me
breakfast for that kind of money maybe a
waffle belgian-style waffles they put a
little fruit on top of it unbelievable
okay question for the audience
waffle pancake or french toast you got
to choose one for the rest of your life
you're done with the other two you got
to stick to only one of those three let
me know in the comments in general I
probably go with french toast I know
it's weird but um the Advent case okay
it's for fancy people
I mean you pull this baby out of your
pocket you're all of a sudden an
interesting fellow the ladies they see
this case they go oh my goodness what's
what mr. titanium over here Tony Stark
type dude definitely not mr. bean over
here
this case says I got more money than I
know what to do it just got back from
Las Vegas people are throwing money
around like it's going out of style
like they can't like they can't get rid
of it fast enough there's like green
felt tables everywhere in machines that
you pull a handle and you just pump
money into them Jack saw it well this
case is like a slot machine
it's about exclusivity it's about
belonging to a particular club I'm here
to be honest with you guys you guys are
my guys that's the world we're living in
here with this titanium enclosure for
your already expensive phone life is
weird at least we're in it together take
a deep breath we out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
