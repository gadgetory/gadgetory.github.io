and in this case very expensive
smartphone this one is courtesy of mr.
Willy dude who keeps bringing the heat
8848 does that not inspire confidence
8848
is the number of feet to the peak of
Mount Everest because this is the peak
of smartphone engineering and
advancement six gigs of RAM 256
gigabytes of storage about $1,900 almost
2 grand
mr. worldwide this is the smartphone for
you see how they do that when you pay
money you don't struggle with boxes you
just that's what you do
leather ooh
luxurious oh my goodness look at them
Wow leather as well
genuine rounded buttons for the volume
up and down so that's the camera unit
there and the flash is over here
snapdragon 835 not the top tier
snapdragon but an 835 in here camera on
the rear is 12 megapixels what about the
front selfie camera 16 megapixels 34 50
million power battery let's be honest
you're trying to send a message with
this guy you're trying to let people
know something is different about you
when you hold this baby up ooh a screen
protectors included you're gonna need a
power brick reminiscent of the device
itself inspired type-c cable to charge
it up a wired headset using the type-c
connector these look like a black
version of Apple earpods now you can see
by default we're set up in Chinese here
I'm gonna switch it over to English if I
can Oh God
oh my god there you go this could be a
cut this is a cut you see there's a
whole theme skin situation going on
analog looking clock at the top which
I'm starting to realize is kind of a
signature of the brand analog graphic
there as well can I
how do I control it though look at this
I can modify what's on the back bunch of
clock faces to choose from let's try
that one the color ring look at this so
if you have this upside down
you get the call ID on the back and you
have VIP contacts which ring a different
color her ass call you don't want them
look at that mechanical beast what
that's for the real gangsters obviously
here's a bit more modern and that's for
the crazy dudes that's for the dudes
with face tattoos oh my goodness
gracious that's unique that's a nice
touch some pretty intense security
settings as well anti-fraud antivirus
intercept intercept it's like in one of
those action movies intercept the call
we're four minutes in T boom or no I
Android version 8.1 okay now what about
the camera I don't know what a griddle
is oh it's a grid they called the grid a
griddle like golden griddle are they
still around golden griddle interesting
there's no like beauty thing or anything
flashy like that mm-hmm
may have cleaned me up a little bit or
softened my skin I'm not really sure but
the beard hair test is in full effect
no portrait mode even whoo can you see
the texture there in the in the leather
of the box you know what I've seen worse
it's pretty decent granted the device is
very expensive so it should be decent
still not really the reason you pick up
this phone you pick up this phone cuz it
looks like no other phone from a
distance you know it's something
different now I do want to check out the
fingerprint scanner so it's a really big
fingerprint scanner
alright let's lock it you know what not
the fastest ever
not the slowest I know some people
really like to have the scanner on the
front still I got really used to having
it on the back to be honest of course in
the case of this phone not exactly an
option okay let's check out the speakers
real quick we got to do that wait what
is this button this button just gives
you a quick change of theme it just
gives you a fresh one look at that
that's like a work in play situation you
have like a work profile then you hit
the button and you go to play mode maybe
this is off hours here's a good video
for you it is small that's a quarter so
where is the speaker hold on interesting
it's firing your students you see I can
cover them like this way your hairy
parts and there that's kind of cool
actually
speakers sound pretty good it's so it is
it's equally firing out of both sides
which is kind of like a stereo it's like
a portrait stereo mode which is not
something I've seen before it's an
unusual implementation I mean what's the
story of this phone obviously it's very
expensive it's like two grand and it
doesn't even have the latest processor
in it so it's a really weird thing to
evaluate it's not even about some crazy
screen to body ratio
I think the pitch here is luxurious
materials in experience which feels
expensive when you hold it weirdly I'm
kind of into it I don't really know why
maybe it's just as so many of these
smartphone slabs are looking the same
these days to hold on to something
that's so obviously different is just
kind of exciting I guess that must be it
would I spend two grand on it probably
not I kind of like the fact that it
exists in a world full of rectangles you
got this and I like things that are
weird
there you have a 8848 they breathe the
rarified air that you might find at the
top of Mount Everest boom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
