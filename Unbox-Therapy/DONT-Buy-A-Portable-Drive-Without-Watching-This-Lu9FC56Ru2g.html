tech the things are related right
everything has to get faster it has to
get better external storage speed today
I'm showing you what I think is the
fastest portable SSD that plugs in over
USB and it also happens to be tiny
anyway this guy here it's the t5
portable SSD it's brand new just came
out this is a 500 gigabyte version you
can get it up to 2 terabytes though it
does get expensive this one is probably
the value point I'll have the link to
this in the description but by the time
you get up to 2 terabytes it's like 800
bucks so keep that in mind it happens to
use USB type-c for the interface what's
cool about that is it doesn't just hook
up to Windows or Mac but also Android
knives you know phones like the galaxy s
8 have a type-c connector so now this
media that's on here is not only
available to your laptop but available
to your phone as well if you have some
movies on here music whatever single
cable it's really incredible powers of
Drive I mean we're living in the future
okay cool up to 540 megabytes per second
transfer speed using USB 3.1 gen2 also a
shock resistant structure
let's check this little guy out oh that
is tiny look at that little guy Wow and
that's it all you need on this thing is
a single USBC port okay also in the
package a little bit of paperwork a
couple of cables so this one is C 2 C
and then a type C 2 a classic USB if
your laptop is rockin the old-school
connector for the purpose of this test
I'm gonna use this MacBook this is the
latest MacBook Pro Drive can go in over
here also worth mentioning there is an
LED indicator on there it will show
activity and of course the fact that the
drive is connected and has power now
I've got two separate apps here to test
the speed of this drive for read and
write the aja system test and the black
magic disk speed test okay here we go
three two one okay close getting 478
over here on the right speed now let's
check out the read speed
uh okay 510 well I'd say we're in the
wheelhouse I mean we're around 500
megabytes per second on both
and that's for a five gigabyte file if
you take a look at the specs here in the
disk speed test you see the various
resolutions of course you can imagine
the type of data that we're talking
about necessary to edit those
resolutions so we can go all the way
down here to like 2160p or 4k and you
can see that this drive has enough speed
to write and read for to to HQ ProRes in
4k at 30 frames and if we travel along
this little grid it can even do cinema
DNG RAW you could edit 4k raw footage on
this little drive okay so next let's do
the aja system test to see if it matches
with the Blackmagic test and it's almost
identical alright now the last test I
want to run is just copying to the drive
so here's some video files from one of
our shoots it's about 30 gigs for a
front facing angle which is pro res
let's see how long it's gonna take to
copy a 33 gigabyte video file right onto
this Drive here and it's gonna take
about a minute just under 34 gigabytes
of footage from the local Drive here on
to the SSD there you go bingo
transferred over how convenient is that
alright so here's the thing do you need
the the t5 is it for you well I think
you probably already know that if you're
moving around large amounts of data if
you can see a huge advantage in having a
drive like this you can save a ton of
time it's also so compact but there's of
course no moving parts because it is an
SSD personally I think this is gonna be
popular mostly for multimedia
individuals like myself I can see this
thing being useful around the office I
can't think of a faster way to move
large amounts of data around without
some sort of network setup or something
like that with this here I could just
quickly pass some footage over to
someone and as you saw earlier I can put
a 30 gigabyte clip on here in under a
minute so an entire project could get on
there in about 10 minutes
and then BOOM pass it to someone else
they can start editing on this thing
right away that's why you pay the price
if you land on that page and you're
wondering why that's the reason why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
