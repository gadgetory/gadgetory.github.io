therapy and today we're taking a look at
Deus Ex Human Revolution this is the
Augmented edition I've had it
pre-ordered for a little while at my
local Gamestop and sort of guys over
there threw in a free strategy guide a
$20 value Big Ups to those guys might as
well give them a little plug I'm not
gonna read that until I'm done the game
don't worry guys I ain't gonna cheat so
this isn't a you know huge special
edition that comes in a gigantic box
there is no statue action figure
backpack bla bla bla but it does have a
couple of cool extras first and foremost
it's got a 40-page art book in here you
know showcasing somebody artwork in a
game as well as a 44 minute video on an
extra disc you know outlining some of
the making of I'm not sure if you guys
know but this game was put together by
Eidos Montreal so big up Canada I'm in
Toronto so represent anyways you can
already see you that you got some nice
artwork on the interior your box this is
a box inside of a box by the looks of it
and underneath that we've got our art
books so let's get a closer look at that
and get this external box out of the way
now I like these things because they
really do help you appreciate the amount
of effort and some labor-intensive work
that goes into making these games these
things don't happen overnight I mean
there are so many people working on
these over such a long period of time
just for your entertainment so looking
at books like these really helps you to
appreciate now I'm gonna go ahead and
hide my special registration code here
how'd you guys snag those off me before
and next we got the user manual pretty
straightforward lookin user manual not
as small as some that I've seen and not
as large either so hopefully fairly
descriptive if you like to read those
here is the game itself if I can manage
to get it out of here without snapping
the disc there's the game of course a
blu-ray game for the PlayStation 3 here
and beside that is the extra disc that I
was talking about earlier it's also got
a motion comic on there from the first
issue of the DC Comics adaptation the
game soundtrack is also on
and some animated storyboard some other
cool stuff to look at so in my in my
opinion you know it's worth a few extra
bucks especially if you're a big gamer
and you really appreciate the work that
goes into these things so lastly we'll
take a look at the strategy guide now
you're not gonna get this included
everybody's not gonna get this included
this was a perk that my local gamestop
clerks threw in for me so don't expect
this if you get the Augmented edition
this just came for me because I am such
a regular customer and blow my entire
living at the game stop anyway guys if
you don't mind hopefully you could like
and favorite this video after all it's
those little clicks that help me keep
making this content and if you don't
mind also give my channel a visit I got
a lot of other unboxings to look at over
there and until next time thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
