Pirates to the Caribbean in here is that
what's going on I'm getting a real
treasure kind of vibe here no I don't
know what this is once again and that's
always fun
when a package comes along that's
obviously been customized and I don't
know what it is you can see they have
unbox therapy stamped in it says bomber
and company we have wooden planks nails
in there look there's rope on the sides
it's like something you find at the
bottom of the ocean my interest is
piqued
speaking of peeking Jack actually peeked
in here he's like kind of the guy who
can tell me if it's worthwhile so this
is his recommendation he says this thing
might be hot fire we're about to find
out all right look at the clamp on here
it's all very old-school so let me just
do that with the burned pages unbox
therapy X bomber and company what is
this straw mm-hmm this crate contains
the world's smallest tactical
pocketknife the b2 nano blade inspired
by the b-2 stealth bomber military
aircraft it's the last everyday
pocketknife
you will need to carry oh and they put
it in an ammo box it's how you know it's
a real deal right there look at the
unboxing experience so far b2 nano blade
world's smallest tactical pocket knife
unbox therapy on the other side
is it and here is this it's in this tiny
little 200 it's actually tiny it's even
smaller than that what whoa it actually
is tiny look at this holy here's a knife
that I normally use okay look at that
guy right beside whoa
it's miniature you know what this has me
thinking about those videos would like
the miniature food the Japanese the
little hamburger that's like that this
knife it's it almost seems unreal how
tiny it is but the thing is it feels
solid at the same time I feel like I
could open up a you know a box easily
okay yes satisfactory I have to say what
do we owe unbox therapy stickers of
course what should I do with all these
Tom can we figure out how to give these
away to people a lock on it to keep the
blade in place right there there's a
hole there too so I suppose you could
put this on a keychain of some sort it
might be the tiniest pocket knife I've
ever held in fact we should probably cut
something open see that Jack look it's a
clean cut right there
like Wolverine with them and then we
have a Styrofoam cup as well let's try
this guy out getting the job done they
look like spaceships to be honest I mean
they just look like nothing else that's
out there I kind of see it yeah the
angular stuff what do you say you be the
judge is that the stealth-bomber of mini
knives
quite possibly obviously the idea here
is not for this thing to replace you
know your combat knife csgo knives
remember that video Jack yeah we had a
lot of knives in that no this is about
utility they can sit in your pocket it
is essentially use the size of a key for
an unboxer a professional unboxer like
myself you always need a blade you need
something on you the best knife is the
one that's with you and they claim that
it's the world's smallest tactical
pocket night everything you're looking
for in a tiny little pocket knife it
feels like I'm going to eat mini steak
with this
wouldn't that be nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
