box virtual reality right you've
experimented with it you may have
experienced it in some form maybe it was
Google cardboard maybe it was a more
elaborate headset but listen there's a
lot of criticism some people just get
fired up and they're not into it but
part of that has to do with suboptimal
experiences certainly at first exposure
where people like dragging around can't
load the thing can't get the resolution
that they want and so on and so on
listen it's growing pains it's not there
yet but one of the things that keeps a
lot of people away is this feeling of
nauseousness this company over here
where allottee sky I mean that's the
name of their product here the companies
where ality they're attempting to
provide a more natural virtual reality
is there such a thing no not really but
through increasing the field of view the
goal here is to give you a more
realistic maybe less jarring less
enclosed version of VR and it's all
supposed to happen right here now you're
still using the cardboard app you're
still playing around with whatever's
available in in the VR spectrum on your
smartphone right now which obviously
isn't everything but you clip into here
you have a few experiences and maybe you
see VR like you haven't before mobile 3d
headset with super wide field-of-view it
features an open lightweight and
foldable design it's less claustrophobic
that's the game plan I don't know how
big the impact is gonna be let's do it
need one is these some wow you see that
sometimes you need one of these who
don't play with knives kids don't play
with knives this immediately looks a lot
different a lot different than any other
VR type of goggles lock your phone in
there install a cardboard app yeah a
scan a QR and they want you to get
started with VR rollercoaster great this
guys what's gonna hold the phone I
assume whoa whoa whoa uh Jack this must
be for extended sessions that's like a
GoPro mount oh man this is this is to
mount it on your head that's gonna be a
good look isn't it it slides in like
this is actually pretty easy now of
course you're gonna have dual images
okay now I need the cue are successfully
paired not that many people actually go
out and get headsets it's the kind of
thing you got to dive in that's it I'm
gonna start with roller-coaster number
one oh oh baby oh man these roller
coaster ones man do you feel it in your
stomach isn't that what you want you
want to feel oh yeah oh my oh maybe if I
went on a real roller coaster I'd be a
disaster as well at this point in my
life the equilibrium is off certainly me
gives you a great view they're not lying
is a super wide field-of-view
but it's doing nothing to circumvent the
fact that my body's telling me one thing
in my mind
is that for like an R&amp;amp;B song the body
says one thing but jihad says no darling
I'm making dinner for you tonight I mean
is it all that different I guess you got
a lot of accessories if you want to wear
the thing I kind of like the fact that
you're not completely closed off so many
of these devices like this are really
for the purpose of experimenting with VR
they're not meant to be on your face
every day one of the things holding VR
back is that many people can't
Behrman or experience it at all and
don't necessarily want to go out and get
a PlayStation VR headset or an oculus
rift and spend a boatload of money so
you end up in this territory what's cool
about this is it can work as a headset
but also just as a quick viewer I don't
know man VR is weird
it's kind of like any emerging
technology where it's like the
technology goes out into the world and
then humans have to figure out how to
make it good or how to make it work
while you guys probably know I didn't
experiment recently with three separate
360 video videos if you haven't seen
that yet you might want to go back and
check it out just to kind of get an idea
that said even that experiment isn't
exactly perfect because the vast
majority of you who interacted with that
weren't in any kind of headset at all to
a certain extent people want to watch
stuff to be lazy to be a vegetable right
to vet you know you should see Jack when
he's watching so I mean the man is
foaming at the mouth I talked about this
with people in the past regarding like
Nintendo we remember when a Nintendo Wii
came out everybody lost their mind
they're like Oh play tennis now what
happened huh
human beings did what human beings do
what just want to get back to that couch
I think the type of VR experience that's
gonna move things push things is one
really plays to that component the idea
that we just want to be a passenger
people want to be less involved they
don't want to be physically jumping
around and moving around for the most
part this is a very antisocial kind of
scenario right somebody comes over to
your place too late Lou I heard the
games on let's have a beer man that's
always been my favorite part of video
games in general socializing a little
bit around it the relevance of
technology still at some point comes
back to its interactivity with people
and that's a place that VR has no clue
how to operate right now it doesn't fit
very easily into that world into that
social sphere the real world keeps
calling and I'm here to pick up that
phone</div></body></html>
