brand new video and today we're taking a
look at these be brand new headphones
from Alpine now you might recognize that
name from car audio in fact Alpine has
been in the car audio business for a
very very long time and now they're
venturing into the headphone space and
this is actually a fairly special
product you've got a transducer that
lives right in the headband which is
going to give you some feel to go with
your sound oh that might sound a little
bit strange but that's because that
transducer is going to improve or
increase the bass response of the
headset so if you are a bass head if
you're looking for a maximum bass
experience this might be the best
headphone for you on the side here you
can see the technical specifications you
have a frequency response from 15 Hertz
to 24,000 Hertz let's jump inside the
box after all this is an unboxing video
and the first thing you're going to
notice here is a very beautiful unboxing
experience you can see the slogan here
feel your music that once again is
referring to this transducer that lives
up here in the headband the headband is
super soft all the way around I'll
remove the headphones first and foremost
you have a unusual design here in terms
of shape so you're definitely going to
turn some heads on the street and as you
can tell me they're very beautiful
looking headphones you have this sort of
metallic finish copper looking finish
here which is glossy and then you have a
matte portion with the Alpine logo
glossy headband and these ear cups
actually do swivel as well that of
course is important for travel or if you
just want to flatten them out when
they're around your neck as opposed to
having them on top of your ears here we
have a power switch because there is a
rechargeable battery inside you get
about 10 hours of usage on the
rechargeable battery but after the
battery runs out you can still use them
as a traditional standard headphone
you're just going to miss out on some of
those extra features when you've
depleted the battery but they are easy
enough to charge over a microUSB cable
the ear cup is adjustable as you'll
notice it goes up and down which allows
for you to fit this on your head if you
have a giant one or a small one your
choice I'm going to put those to the
side for a moment and look at the other
items inside the box of course you're
going to have a couple of cables here is
your audio cable with an inline
microphone and it is braided so it
should do pretty well when it comes to
getting tangled or not getting tangled I
should say and then you've also got this
cable here that's your micro USB cable
for charging up the headphones lastly a
very soft traveling pouch I'm going to
go ahead and throw these in real quick
and this pouch is going to keep your
headphones clean scratch-free
it's super soft like reminds me of some
of the pajamas that I had as a kid I
should try these on right now give you
guys an idea of comfort they are marked
right and left that is important I hate
it when manufacturers don't do that ok
very comfy one of my pet peeves is when
an ear cup is too small for my ear I
don't know if I have big ears or small
ears but these ones fit perfectly so it
goes all the way around my ear super
comfy let's go ahead and try them out so
you can download the level play app
inside the App Store as you can tell
here and it has three different
distinctive colors depending on the
energy level of your music as you can
see here it'll automatically analyze
that I've already downloaded it as
you'll see right here get that volume up
okay so something really interesting
here
the transducer in the headband is
actually not not making you feel like
it's faking in the head portion instead
there's a little bit of extra resonance
around the ear so it's like it's almost
like it's shooting it down the headband
it's actually a really interesting
feeling I suppose the next test now is
to jump outside the application I wanted
to see how these things would sound in a
sort of desktop listening environment so
I have a turntable and I have a
headphone amplifier and I'm going to
check out what these can do in that
environment
okay so determine a couple of things
here having having listened to it now in
a couple different environments you know
if you boost that volume you really do
start to feel that transducer in the
head as well as the ear cups but you can
turn it off there's a power switch so
depending on what you're listening to
you may like that experience or even if
you don't
these still turn into a fully
functioning set of traditional
headphones without the extra immersion
anyway there you have it brand-new
headphones from a giant in the
automotive audio industry Alpine
definitely go ahead and check these out
for yourself they are available in the
Apple store if you want to go and have
that experience and if you want to learn
more here on the web I will have the
