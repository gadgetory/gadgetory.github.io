interesting development it's not
something I would have ever expected to
see when I first started playing with
the switch such as bizarre and odd thing
but that's what's good about it Nintendo
they like to go off the wall sometimes
in the name of fun and that's what I
hope to have today a little bit Lego
it's a little bit video game it's a lot
of cardboard this kid in front of me is
called the variety kit this keyboard
motorcycle game I don't actually know
what that one is
and then there's fishing as well and you
build it make play discover what design
your own toy con using your own
household items this dude turned a
tennis racket into a guitar let's crack
this open toy cons 0-1 the game disk
string some rubber gaskets elastic bands
whoa someone sat down in the boardroom
and they're like I got it stacks of
cardboard what do you think so this is a
stack that I need for the keyboard in
order to get the instructions it happens
bond the actual switch so I'm gonna
insert this oh yeah oh yes make play
discover we're in a make zone right now
because well I haven't made anything yet
so let's do that
welcome to Nintendo lab oh that's
actually kind of nice zoom in like this
and out like that
can I help you or what do you gotta take
a crack at this yeah man have a game let
me know when you finish though I want to
play the keyboard first yes sir
would you look at that it's like a
cooking show you know you put it in the
oven it's ready right away
thank you will thanks for that brother
there's a joy con over here in the back
not really where do I go from here I
guess we're ready to move on to the play
part now the toy piano is bouncing
around it's lit up it looks
three-dimensional because the lab ho is
built where do I put this it goes up
here whoa see we are active what happens
I've hooked this up to a speaker just to
amplify it a little bit more I've been
trying to figure out how this is working
because it's just a piece of cardboard
how is it reading you know the input
from these various notes well had a
theory that the infrared is somehow
reading the location of those stickers
from back here I don't know if he's
right I don't know if he's wrong either
way it's quite magical there's no
transmission of anything happening he
doesn't even need to be in there look
she was a pitch bend over on the side
here what looks to be a record button so
I guess this some kind of sequencer in
here a play/pause button and then these
little knobs over here wow that is
definitely how it works it must be
infrared
who else discovered that that's not what
you're supposed to do with this this
goes in this location here is like a
modifier
it's like base it's like a baseline so
what happens if I twist this knob then
this is the weirdness I'm talking about
with Nintendo
here we go
fives no this is fun this thing's kind
of fun I would buy this for a kid let
the imagination let it flow you got a
problem come talk to me
most of what Jack says sounds exactly
like this oh hey Jack was happy man how
was your weekend you know did you get up
to anything was cool was it fun this is
an entire sequencer holy Bananarama like
what like sequence dots that you're
gonna keep in a ziploc bag and put into
this contraption and then slide it in
and then scan it like this look what
happened it's scanning the note input
pitch Bend I like to see stuff like this
thinking outside the box even when
you're using materials that would
normally make a box here on unbox
therapy oh wow that was unintentional I
do need to give it
so you might have noticed during that
video this slick look that I had on my
Nintendo switch and that right there is
from B brand skins you're flying off the
shelves like hotcakes
you can mix and match it really gets
crazy I promise you would you look at
that boom bam slam there's something to
that black and yellow black and yellow
black and yellow you're also making a
screen protector when you use it on a
regular basis maybe you get a little
aggressive sometimes you can't just drop
it in there like that no one's happy
about it so they got a screen protector
now too so check that out there you have
it in Tendo switch D brand skins thanks
to them for sponsoring this episode
definitely go check them out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
