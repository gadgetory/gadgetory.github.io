mean you all know when you see a
briefcase like this it's got to be
important it's a type of briefcase you
would carry something top-secret this
briefcase was sent to me by Huawei that
means new smartphone I need much more
than intro than that let's do that one
more time oh this always brings me back
to the briefcase in Pulp Fiction to be
honest so no we were watching Pulp
Fiction yesterday
this my friend is the brand-new Huawei
mate 10 Pro and the exclusive limited
edition Porsche
design may 10 this is the first time
I've seen these this is the first time
you've seen these of course there's been
leaks and rumors but now we have the
official units let's jump inside so
we're gonna kick it off with the mate 10
Pro but make sure to stick around to the
end because I'm gonna unbox that one
also alright so there it is you can see
that the bezel like some other devices
has shrunk down giving you this enhanced
screen to body ratio bronze mocha color
to it look at this whoa it's got this
sort of reflective back to it
fingerprint sensor is here in the centre
and above that is a dual lens camera
system this here is in conjunction with
Leica the legendary camera manufacturer
summa Lux 11.6 so f 1.6 aperture on both
lenses that's a relatively large
aperture in fact it's a very large
aperture and what that's gonna give you
a better low-light performance and it
will also create that shallow depth of
field that you're used to seeing in
high-end smartphone photos there's also
a flash on the back here a speaker
grille as well as a USB type-c port SIM
card tray on this side we have a power
switch as well as the volume rocker now
they did something here that I'm very
happy about add a little bit of texture
to the power switch there are fewer
missed presses in your pocket when
you're reaching for volume this is a six
inch OLED display a quick charge power
brick alright you got to have quick
charge these days this one has it a USB
type-c cable you can see there also a
headset here a USB type-c headset so it
will plug in to the same port that you
use to charge they include a case to get
you up and running that's kind of nice
look at that
honestly not bad this device is water
resistant it is ip67 certified okay so
here's what the device looks like booted
up here we go
is now like I feel like I need to give
you a little bit of background we're
down here what's going on this speaker
on the bottom the low end and most of
the volume is coming out but then
there's a little bit of high end in
clarity coming out of the earpiece
collectively it sounds good
look at this hear that that's low-end
having this earpiece the higher end the
treble and so on it acts as better
clarity firing at you for dialogue for
watching videos on YouTube and then this
bottom one for music enhances the
musical aspect by adding back in that
low-end that you wouldn't normally have
on a phone so I think that's kind of
cool I just noticed it alright
the cameras so the way this works is
there's data captured by both in fact
one of the sensors is monochrome the
reason for this is to enhance low-light
performance essentially what this means
for you is you can combine the data from
both to create a better overall image
that kind of portrait look that
out-of-focus that D focused region to
draw your eyes to the center of the
frame look at will has will ever looked
better the background in real life is it
was nowhere near that blurry so Jack if
I just have my hand over here I want you
to look right above there it doesn't
assume anything specials going on right
my hands no big deal if all of a sudden
I frame up this plant here watch that
spot you see what happened there that
plant logo came up the AI built into
this phone is able to distinguish the
type of object you're taking a photo of
automatically adjust settings to best
suit that type of object it enhanced the
vibrancy of the plant there of the green
now let's say I sub in this power brick
here which has some text on it boom
immediately it distinguishes that it's
text that I want to take a photo up
listen we all know what you like to do
on your social media scene your
Instagram you want to take the picture
your fancy food I had Ryan for Perry a
gourmet dish does it qualify as food
oh right away jack you saw that right
comes right up optimized for scenario
food you can take send someone take this
away let's say you're a bit of a
photographer and you like to dive in and
manipulate your settings manually you
can still do that simply pull up
everything from ISO your shutter speed
of course your white balance you can set
to auto they call it pro mode a wide
aperture mode a portrait mode a
moving-picture mode and of course video
as well Wow look at that
AFS AFC and manual focus you can
actually manual focus on this phone by
default also video stabilization
resolution for video UHD 4k sixteen by
nine or you can pick a 1080p mode which
has a higher frame rate at 60fps Beauty
level five let's flip the camera around
with the complexion of a princess look
at that alright now one of the cool
things about this device is it can
connect to an external display and when
I plug it in it prompts me to switch to
desktop mode you can see it will pop up
in either of the two modes either as a
projection of the phone modes a real
time readout go into landscape mode boom
or as a complete desktop experience
which you can see it's loading here look
at that and then you can go ahead and
connect a bluetooth keyboard and mouse
and interact with it much like a desktop
computer or you can use the phone to
become a touch control panel kind of
like a touchpad and you can see I can
move my cursor around with this so let's
take a closer look at the specs here
we've got six gigs of ram 128 gigs of
storage as I mentioned 2160 by 1080p we
can see we're running Android 8.0 the
CPU this is a new one it's running the
karin 970 now that's an 8 core cpu with
a 12 core GPU built into it Huawei is
stating that there's gonna be some
enhanced efficiency as well utilizing
the AI capabilities apparently the
phone's gonna get to know you and then
be able to make adjustments as it sees
fit for power consumption needs and so
on but all that processing is gonna
happen locally on the phone so it
doesn't need to be sent to the cloud
alright now I did not forget about the
Porsche design
version of the may 10 I'm excited for
this one because it's limited you have a
special card in their authentic device
designed by Huawei and porsche design
porsche design is more than just the
vehicle whoa you have a stripe going
down as opposed to a cross so there's
the mate 10 and there's the mate 10 for
SH design the fingerprint sensor is
blacked out also the trim around the
camera lenses has changed ever so
slightly
it's a polished black as opposed to the
chrome look on the mate 10 Pro so this
is the ceramic look here crazy
reflective in fact look at that unboxing
layout right there we have a black
headset to match the Porsche design we
have 2 power bricks two cables type-c to
type a you're a traveling man you get
two cables instead of one with the
Porsche version alright so there you
have it the porsche design mate 10 from
huawei limited edition the mate 10 pro
in this mocha color here there it is the
latest from Huawei unveiled here on
