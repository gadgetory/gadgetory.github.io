another video and very quickly before we
jump into it I want to give a shout out
to today's sponsor who happens to be
Boost Mobile
you probably heard me talking about them
a couple videos ago well the promotion
that they were having is still going on
until the end of the month so you've got
a little bit of time left where they
will give you $50 off of a brand new
phone when you switch they've also got
an amazing number of plans to choose
from that include unlimited talk text
data etc so if you're looking to switch
and potentially get a better value on
your cell phone bill you should
definitely check out Boost Mobile the
link is down in the description so do me
a favor and check it out thanks to them
for sponsoring this episode
alright enough about that let's get into
today's product this is the GDC money
clip from Gerber Gerber essentials and
at first glance it looks like two
separate items but in reality what
you're getting is a money clip with a
hidden pocket knife pretty cool at least
I thought it was pretty cool so I've got
a couple of bills over here too $5
Canadian bills and a presto card because
obviously my credit cards would give
away some personal information and you
can see I'm balling out of control as
well with the dual $5 bills but anyways
the idea here is that you can fit four
credit cards in four folded bills in the
back and then this knife locks into
place right within the money clip so you
can carry around all of your necessary
cards and cash and then on top of that
you get the utility of a pocket knife
hidden in the same object so no need to
carry around two separate items instead
it all fits into one so this is an
interesting item to feature obviously a
little bit unusual I thought that it was
cool so figured hey show it to you guys
I will link it down in the description
as far as pricing availability and where
you can buy it but let's go ahead and
take a closer look at it using a knife
to open up a knife
all right where should I even cut let me
see cut just randomly cross without
cutting my hand off go so we have the
whoa that's cool
got some good way to it okay so there's
the money clip we don't need this
packaging anymore you can see it has
kind of like a textured finish on the
top metal or plastic I don't know it
feels really solid and then on the back
you have the Gerber logo and this is
where the money clip portion is so we
might as well try putting a couple of
bills and this card in there so
obviously just like any other money clip
you're going to want to fold your bills
you could do a single fold like that or
a dual fold the bills in Canada recently
changed and you can notice they're
actually plastic now instead of paper
which actually makes them a little easy
to slide in there so they're you could
put some cash in there as you can see
course card as well hold it all together
so a straightforward money clip as you'd
expect the secret functionality of a
knife just like some James Bond stuff
right here so I assume I'm just going to
slide it in there so and then it locks
into place and even with the knife in it
doesn't look like a knife still just
looks like a money clip as you can see
there and then getting the knife out Wow
that's pretty fast now using it I guess
you put your finger down in there or
maybe you put your finger right inside
that right or thumb no like that that's
that's the most comfortable way for me
right there to hold it with my finger in
this grip and then I guess like I said I
guess maybe you could use that as well
this is not a hunting knife or you know
a serious knife but it's a little bit of
utility inside of something that you
would otherwise be carrying which is
your money and your cards it has good
weight to it
as well this thing feels really solid
and durable so you can probably you know
put it in your pocket for years to come
and not destroy it in any way that's
cool so we should test the blade out do
quick cuts all right so here we've got a
piece of cardboard to test the knife out
on you know pretty simple you'd assume
that it should be able to cut it I'll
just show you guys here how sharp it is
it's actually pretty nice yeah look at
that cuts through really easily could be
a good unboxing knife you always have on
you making a mess now so there you have
it the GBC money clip from Gerber I
thought it was pretty cool thought you
guys might think the same thing so if
