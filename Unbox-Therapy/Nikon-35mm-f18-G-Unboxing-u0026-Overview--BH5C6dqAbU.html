therapy and today we're taking a look at
a very special nightcore lens maybe not
the most special on the market but
special to me nonetheless I feel that it
represents one of the best costs to
performance ratios currently available
in Nikon's product line and the reason I
say that is because you're getting a
relatively useful focal length along
with a very useful aperture now if you
want an even bigger aperture than this
well then that costs skyrockets and the
performance doesn't really change that
much meaning f-14 can't really do that
much more than f-18 so for individuals
getting into creative photography this
is a great way to start so looking at
the unboxing here I'm not expecting too
much from the lens itself but let's take
a look at it first things first it's
very light of course being a prime lens
it's a very simple lens internally and I
actually like that I'm I'm usually
inclined to use primes because generally
speaking they come along with bigger
more useful apertures that are easier to
use in a number of different
environments so let's look at what else
comes with it we've got of course our
nikon paperwork our warranty a little
bit of a manual to go with it to me you
don't really need a manual with this
thing but at least you get it and then
next this is somewhere where Nikon
really steps it up away from what Canon
does and they give you a lens hood and a
lens pouch with a lens that's sub $300
now Canon never appears to do that the
only way you're gonna get a hood is with
an L lens and as we all know those start
around a thousand bucks so thank you for
the love Nikon a little bit of extras
always appreciated we all know what kind
of margins you guys are playing with so
anyway let's take a look at the pouch
and I've had Nikon pouches before so I
assume it's probably made out of the
same material it's almost like a suede
kind of finish although I'm pretty sure
it's not real suede now these pouches
are cool I just find them to offer a
little bit of extra protection before
you go and throw the Land
in your photo bag I always like to have
them now the next thing that came along
with this lens is the hood and I like to
use hoods not just because they help
with sun flares and and some issues
arising from taking shots where you're
pointing towards the light source but
also because they offer a little bit of
extra protection for your glass element
by moving the edge of the lens out
further it's protecting the internal
elements and the glass from getting
scratched so here we can see the
underside of the lens of course it's
made in China so many of these are now
but it's got a fairly tight focusing
mechanism let's try it on the 5100 and
see how she looks there you go a real
nice fit and like I said before being a
prime it's very inconspicuous and also
light meaning you can carry it around
forever and you're not going to notice
it it's really a featherweight anyway
