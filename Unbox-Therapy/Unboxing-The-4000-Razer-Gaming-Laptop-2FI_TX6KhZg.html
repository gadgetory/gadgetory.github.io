laptop unboxing and yet it's been
something that you guys have requested
on multiple occasions the upper end of
gaming laptop space you know who would
like something like this my brother
we've got a guest Oh baby right on time
shout out to VIN today we've got the
blade Pro which is the top range of
razer laptops 17 inches 4k display a gtx
1080 graphics card in here which just a
sliver less performance than the desktop
variant it's all happening in gear but
you're gonna pay a price but like many
things in life you get what you pay for
you're not buying something like this at
the dollar store you're not getting this
at the bulk barn right tom the specs are
over here on the side core i7 7820 HK
this is the newest version geforce gtx
1080 in a laptop because you can and the
monitor is 17.3 inches x old UHD with
g-sync for gaming it's all in here let's
crack it over this I believe is the
first laptop certified for thx all right
now these are the guys in the movie
theater you get that big booming sound
this actually has a pretty nice
headphone amplifier supposedly whoo you
got the logo mmm Wow look at this thing
250 watt power adapter that slim like
that you can actually travel with that
this is what you signed up for right
here Razer logo right in the center
there well we've got a lot of ports HDMI
USB 3 type C and an SD card reader is
that nasty carping definitely over here
we have full size Ethernet port 2 more
USB 3s in a headphone jack see the two
ports for your fans the front edge here
a giant battery 99 watt hour which is
the biggest battery that you can carry
on an airline tom did not know that fact
tell me that's not a good look jack holy
4k eggs oh g-sync
touch display it's also touch capable
this keyboard here is apparently the
world's first mechanical keyboard which
is low profile on a laptop you have the
trackpad in this location but that's
what lets them fit in this giant battery
along the bottom side speaker grilles
over here here we go whoo
is the RGB keyboard and lighting system
maybe we should dim the lights to give
people a better look okay so this app
here allows you to completely configure
this lighting system however you want
you can do it on a key by key basis as
you can see over here whoa
that's called wave that's a party right
there let's check out some okay let's
check out some 4k video on YouTube Jack
you've been replaced by fidgets spinners
Matt and we're gonna toggle it all the
way up to 4k now then we gonna blow
their bird nothing like 4k drone footage
whoa maybe the most juice I've ever
heard
fed to these headphones alright so I
took this laptop home with me last night
I got to put some games on here that's
what this laptop is all about so razor
also sent over the Death Adder
Elite this thing is also completely VR
capable with the GT X 1080 inside of a
laptop a relatively slim laptop like as
you could take your VR station to and
fro oh we got a shock trooper here down
it's too easy Jack I got to turn up the
difficulty this thing represents 100%
Adobe RGB this might be the nicest
display that you can possibly get on a
laptop this is a popular choice for
music producers people who use FL Studio
and so on this laptop actually comes
with a copy of FL Studio you get you get
that for free hmm now another thing to
mention this th X sticker down here you
might be thinking I don't get it Lou it
seems like a gimmick to me it actually
has to do with both sound and visual so
I think this display has a big part to
play with that certification you're
watching movies and so on you're not
gonna get thx out of laptop speakers it
just hangs happenin use headphones there
are so many great headphone throw them
in the bag thank me later I booted up
Star Wars Battlefront I'm not sure I
even hit that guy but he died anyway
what do I notice right away the fans
begin to kick up get the headphones on
not such a big deal all right bud
it's time for you to take a nap so who's
this thing for who's it for gamers
obviously anybody who needs some
heavy-duty hardware that can go into a
backpack think a lot of people can get
excited by this that's the word I'm
looking for
stealth you close this up maybe you're
gaining maybe you take it to a meeting
maybe you're doing some graphic design
in a coffee shop
you're still gonna make it happen some
people who know what's up know what's up
yay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
