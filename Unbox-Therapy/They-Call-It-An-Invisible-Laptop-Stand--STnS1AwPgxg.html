you think that's strange because you're
looking at the table and you're like I
don't what are those these are like the
first run of a product that's currently
on Kickstarter I have not seen something
like this before
this is a product that sticks to the
bottom of your laptop it acts as kind of
a little stand you want a more
comfortable working environment the
early bird was 19 bucks the eventual
retail price I think is gonna be 25 they
come in a few different colors now they
have a kind of metallic thing going on
to them I have a surface laptop over
here it can hold some tremendous amount
of weight what does it say on the
Kickstarter well 18 pounds or something
which is wild for something which is so
thin an adhesive portion now I'm
assuming whatever they're using here to
stick this onto your laptop is probably
not gonna leave a residue you'd have to
think they thought about that this is a
thin and light right that's an ultrabook
I'm gonna flip this upside down adhesive
protector here are using gentlemen I'm
gonna tie this out now you want to get
it close to the back edge as close as
you can get now the magic happens or
what I'm gonna spin this back around
okay
wait a sec let me figure this out real
quick did I get it I got it whew
surprisingly sturdy here on the
undersurface laptop implementation look
at the elevation on this now from the
front you don't even notice the fact
that you're dealing with a stand at all
the lazy dog it is pretty nice if you
really go up here you can kind of wobble
it a bit when you go to the keyboard you
rest as a consequence it creates a very
stable typing experience much more than
I expected I was skeptical actually when
I first saw it then you're ready to go
that's it boom so the other way is like
this so this is the 25 degree angle look
at that so that's even higher that's
your docked setup at home at the desk
the other set up this is when you're out
you know you might be at a coffee shop
there is magnets in here so as you can
see it doesn't come down too easily I
mean you could shake it down if you
really try like
we're gonna pull in Willie do he's got
the MacBook Pro we're gonna get him a
seat he feels like he hasn't been on a
show enough recently and personally I
just don't appreciate getting kicked
around boot it out of my my spot which I
earned from this point forward I just
this is my beef with Dave to Dee it's
exactly right so now you guys are gonna
have to get a fireplace going you
probably want to use this one I'm
guessing so this is a 15-inch MacBook
Pro I mean not the heaviest laptop but
definitely heavier than the surface
laptop like this yes good yep give it
the old one too now see if you can
figure this out real quick in their
video they make it look so slick they're
like they just pop up you know they're
at the Starbucks to just yeah that's it
right there
okay get that baby crack dope Hey ah
that's a bit of a wobble it's more if
you get up towards here order that said
if I'm just quick brown fox in because
there's something that happens when you
place your hands down new you're in a
stable it does it absolutely does you
want a quick brown fox it sure sure
are you showing off right now yeah I
mean it's pretty stable this is the
maximum size laptop that you would want
to place on here right you want to try
the other angle see if you can figure
that one out all right yeah yeah okay
that's it this is the 25 degree angle
you pop that back that's the 15 degree
angle very easy actually to switch
between the two you just got to get used
to how the mechanism works on this thing
right boom you get home more serious the
Photoshop comes out keyboard mouse who
knows maybe you're even gaming probably
not if you're on a mac book if you try
if you give her the shake
ah I was pretty quick there yeah Oh
who's this for we'll is it for a college
student a weekend warrior I think all of
the above maybe not a gamer but
especially I can see this in like a
coffee place you're a big fan of this
yeah it's pretty nice I think I actually
might keep this on you work for the
company yeah on the sides just keep that
on the wraps but immediately when you
pick it up it seems a little flimsy when
you have it installed it's actually
surprisingly solid if I'm here
look I'm there I'm there yeah that's not
a good
Who am I Who am I you don't want to be
closing so you go I mean if you go to
the highest one look at you
ergonomics posture I will say though
whoa okay shows going for me and that's
what you wanted since that's what you
wanted well I was on the outro there I
was fully into the altro there I gotta
say one thing and this you know I need I
told you he's getting fed up getting
kicked off the show Dave 2d super sad
anyway he's got to take over the show
okay it's all yours well um I will say
though four laptops that do have vents
up here maybe it may not work but I
guess you could just move it down and
it'll be all good there you go done done
I'm out
it's all out to say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
