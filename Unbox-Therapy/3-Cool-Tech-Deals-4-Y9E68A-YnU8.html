another tech deals video today I have
some interesting things that I think
you're gonna like that's the idea of
this show deals for you quick and easy
every time I talk about the video being
quick I do this right here I ramble for
a little while so that it's not actually
quick because I'm busy talking about it
being quick so let's not do that let's
instead talk about the damn deals first
up we have this wireless charger from
Rav power it'll work with the latest
galaxy s6 as well as any other phone
that supports qi wireless charging its
$13.99 so if you've been putting off
getting a wireless charger doing some
wireless charging and seeing if you like
it this is a great way to check that out
without spending too much money drop
your phone right on top of it like that
and it starts charging amazing for the
bedside table it'll work with tons of
different phones s 6s v s4 s3 no three
no two nexus stuff four five six seven
blah blah blah blah blah you can read it
when you get there $14 why am i holding
up five I just wanted to - it was a high
five next up we have a ton of storage
that my friends is an 8 terabyte desktop
drive onedrive 8 terabytes this world
has gotten a lot better than the world I
grew up in that might have been an 8
gigabyte Drive that's I'm not even
exaggerating and it would have been the
same size and in some of you old school
dudes you probably even remember when
that was 8 megabytes and you were
working with floppy disks floppy Jack
don't laugh
I said floppy there's nothing wrong with
that word on its own especially when I'm
saying disc floppy anyways it's a
Seagate backup plus not only is it 8
terabytes it also comes with 200
gigabytes of cloud storage and of course
it's USB 3 it's available in other sizes
as well but 249 dollars for 8 terabytes
of storage goodness you can put whatever
you want on there 8 terabytes anything
goes within the realm of the
it's got to be legal next up number
three
this is the real recommendation in this
show because I own this thing it's
actually sitting right here I have the
red version see this
it's the tilt Energy 5k plus you got
micro USB cable built right into it as
well as a lightning cable built right
into it so this thing can charge your
iOS device or your Android device or
other micro USB device fits in your
pocket it's slim big fan of this device
it's on sale on Amazon 48 bucks and the
cables are built in I can't tell you how
much I like this if this is in your
pocket you've got everything you need
for all day smart phoning 5200 milliamp
hours should be good now at 48 99 I
think this is a great deal but maybe
it's a little bit rich for your blood
and maybe you don't need 5000 plus
milliamp hours if that's the case they
have another product that is $7.99 right
now this is the energy to - t4 micro USB
devices so you're giving up the
lightning connector but you're getting a
much cheaper price point here a little
bit less in the way of capacity you're
only getting 1800 milliamp hours so this
is more of a boost its emergency power
when you need it now the cool thing with
this one is that it's also your power
brick it has the prongs built right in
you can leave your power brick at home
and now your power brick becomes an
always charged battery backup that you
would be carrying anyways because
smartphones hardly last then you already
know that look at this I mean what more
could you want flex cable I mean Jesus
what what more could you ask for for
$7.99 I'm getting a little bit fired up
about this thing here I should order a
few these should be all over the office
why would anybody have a normal power
brick when you can have a power brick
with a battery right in it for the price
of a shitty lunch less than the price of
a shitty McDonald's combo still love you
McDonald's that wraps up this video
that's technically for products but I
figured the last two were very very
similar some people are gonna like one
some people will like the other
depending on what your needs are I hope

interesting in this list all the links
will be down in the description so you
