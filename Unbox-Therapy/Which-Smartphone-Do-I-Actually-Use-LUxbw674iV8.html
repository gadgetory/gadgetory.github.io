video in which I gave up on my
experimental time with blackberry key to
this device right here now I didn't hate
it I just hated it in that video told
you not to buy that thing because a
being do enough to justify switching
back to something with a physical
keyboard it's not one tap it's over here
then it's over here maybe it makes sense
for someone who has been stuck on a
keyboard doesn't want to transition and
is looking for something more modern but
one of my criticisms of the device
wasn't just the keyboard but also what
you're getting for the money thing was
around 600 650 that's obviously more
than the one plus six which retails for
less 5:29 whatever now the reason I have
four phones on the table is because
after I was done with my blackberry
experiment I went on to Twitter and I
told people you know I switched back to
a different device and I got a lot of
feedback people saying maybe it was this
one maybe it was that one hey Lou why
don't you tell us what you're using
right now and why don't you tell us why
so I'm gonna give you a little little
unbox therapy history what has been
going on with my smartphone usage the
only experiment in this group was the
blackberry the other three
I could easily recommend to you I could
use on a daily basis and really see very
little change in my feelings so I made a
video a little while back about
switching to the Galaxy S 9 Plus this is
the special edition one don't worry
about that factor because I'm not
talking about the device just imagine
it's a regular s 9 plus but I was using
the s 9 plus prior to the 1 plus 6
coming out at which point I switched my
sim over so I could utilize that device
then I switched to the BlackBerry and
then I switched back to the pixel
actually if I was doing this correctly
it would go like this because I was
using the pixel before switching to the
s 9 plus pixel 2 XL s 9 plus 1 plus 6
then the BlackBerry then after I was
done with the BlackBerry because of
convenience and various other factors I
slid the sim into this guy the pixel 2
XL greatest camera on any smartphone I
wouldn't say it's the best in every
category not by any means but has the
forward facing speakers and the stock
interface of course very nice easy to
use slide your sim in forget about it
and I use that for a little while and
then this s9 showed up times like you
know I should try the s9 again and just
compare the two and that's when things
change because the sim came out of the
pixel to Excel and into the s9 plus and
that's where it lives right now and
something struck me right away this
phone just felt super comfy to hold
looking at them the form factor seems so
similar but look a little closer and you
realize of course the s9 plus is just
slightly more slender compared to the
pixel 2xl until when you pick this up it
just gives you a little bit more
comfortable reach this one on the other
hand bit fatter bit more of a reach
using them back-to-back helped me to
appreciate just how much comfier this
form factor is for one-handed use enough
so that I was like you know I think I'm
gonna stick to the s9 plus you still get
a nice display you get a decent speaker
get the headphone jack back you get the
wireless charging back with Nova
Launcher you can really get quite a
similar experience now the camera I
would say is like a step in either
direction it's not like a massive
difference betwee it's not like
including the blackberry in the list
this camera told me crazy where I was
like I can't believe that's on a modern
smartphone but these two they definitely
are in the same universe of course you
have the dual lens setup over here on
the s9 plus compared to the single lens
setup but the software stuff that Google
is doing is just untouchable right now
just keep that in mind nonetheless I
haven't missed the camera on the pixel
as much as I've enjoyed the comfort of
the one-handed functionality on the s9
plus now I should say at this moment of
course we have new pixel devices coming
out and chances are it's going to adopt
a different more modern form factor and
then I'm gonna have to do this whole
thing all over again
because this is my job but I thought
this would be interesting for you
because you're all asking me what am i
using and why and if I was forced to
choose a device today I think I would
take this one
I think the s 9 plus gives you a little
bit more for your money I am a fan of
wireless charging I do use wireless
charging that is where my SIM card lives
the 1 plus 6 you need to remember it's
in a different price category this is
the least expensive unit and honestly
for the price you're getting oh I don't
know 90% of what
ever you're gonna get in the case of
these other two devices with some
enhancements no you don't have the
wireless charging that you get with the
s9 plus but the reason for me having
this in here is because I still believe
even at this moment in time this one
still probably represents the best value
of the bunch I'm spending my dollars I'm
probably spending them over here so I
feel like it's important to say that
because not always is what I use my
recommendation for others you want to
know where my SIM card lives now you do
it's in the s 9 plus 4 now excited for
the next pixel and the 1 plus 6 it's the
best value of the bunch and the
BlackBerry I'll still tell you to stay
away from it for now so there it is s9
plus being using it been enjoying it
hope you appreciated that let me know
down in the comments what are you using
right now what's your daily driver
smartphone I'm curious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
