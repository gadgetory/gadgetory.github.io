it in my previous video I unboxed it I
tried it out I had my mind blown
shortly after got to thinking like what
about Xbox people Xbox people feeling
left out
so I started experiment with the cinema
mode on the PS VR headset and even
before this headset existed I had
experimented with previous non VR cinema
headsets within the ps4 there are
opportunities to watch video for example
on Netflix the menu system and also play
games that are not natively VR in a
cinema style mode I was like what if I
plug an Xbox into the headset and see if
it defaults to some sort of cinema mode
so I can do this incredibly insane thing
which is have PlayStation components
interact with Xbox as the worlds collide
why would you want to do that it's not
really VR in there it's just a cinema
mode it's a big screen display well
here's why maybe you're in a small space
you're in a dorm room you're in a small
apartment or something you picked one of
these up for your PlayStation but this
is also an Xbox sitting over there do
you need a separate TV or maybe this can
just replace your TV you strap this baby
on you got a big screen in front of you
and now it can handle all your games all
your media the Xbox it's also got
another HDMI input so you could have
like a cable box that goes into there
now all of a sudden this is your output
method this is your TV jack see if you
can pick up this monstrosity this is the
box that comes with the PS VR headset so
you're going to send the Xbox's output
into the HDMI input of this box and then
we have the TV out going into this
recorder right now so you guys can see
what's being seen inside the headset but
then why does the PlayStation need to be
on okay so this is where things get a
little bit weird in this scenario the
USB cable from the box to the
PlayStation actually has to be connected
and powered on for this to work yes you
have to be in an environment where you
own both of these there are a lot of
environments where these dual console
situations exist where somebody owns
both so that's the scenario that will
allow you
to play xbox game on the psvr headset
okay I think that was easy enough to
fall I'm gonna push this back over the
side for now let's find out how it works
okay okay oh wow you know what this is
not bad you know it's kind of like
sitting in front of my projector out
there you can go in and dive in I mean
you could watch YouTube for example you
could do anything you could do on an
Xbox this just becomes a gigantic
display I'm launching the NFL app now
I'm gonna I'm gonna start with like a
video clip before I actually go into the
gaming this is kind of uh kind of nice I
got to be honest it's like sitting in
front of a big screen now something
interesting to mention it's kind of like
a theater so the display stays over here
when I turn away it's dark over here I
turn back the TV's there I turn over
here it's dark it's like sitting in a
movie theater essentially okay a little
bit of trials fusion now cinema mode if
all you have is I don't know a computer
monitor or something smaller you're
limited for space this it's hard to say
that that would be a better experience
in this oh wow Oh remember your skills
here
oh oh oh there we go
who knows if trials fusion is the best
demonstration but ultimately the way it
feels in the headset is that you're
sitting in front of a big display
playing your your old favorites but in a
way this kind of a setup it reminds me
of that original Sony headset looking at
this monstrosity playing xbox on a Sony
headset I gotta admit I'm kind of
thankful that they didn't go with some
sort of proprietary connector or
something theoretically whatever that
HDMI source happened to be as long as
this thing is connected to the
PlayStation via USB that HDMI port it
becomes Universal for you you just send
a video feed in and you're sitting in
front of a big screen version of that
video feed so there you have it I don't
know if it's a workaround I personally
think it was just intended from Sony
you're spending whatever six hundred
bucks on this thing you might as well
have that display available to you
regardless of the input source no it's
not full-immersion virtual reality but
it is a giant screen in front of your
face in the absence of a TV I think
that's kind of cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
