people those of you who make this
possible today we've got the Xbox 360
messenger kit for Xbox Live as you guys
know I recently unboxed the ps3 version
actually that was my last video let me
know if you guys want to see a
comparison between those and I wanted to
give the Xbox 360 fans some love and
unbox this messenger kit for them as
well and uh you know I basically picked
this up from Blockbuster one of their
going-out-of-business sales you know
they're pretty much shutting down their
operations at least most of them and so
I paid next to nothing they practically
handed it to me and said get out the
store just walk just walk right out okay
that didn't happen but but it was
basically like that so let's talk about
the unboxing this is unbox therapy right
we got a little bit of paperwork let's
get that out that out of your way and
we've also got the chat pad as well as a
little you know headset here not
Wireless it's just wired at least to the
controller but that's how Xbox goes
that's how Xbox 360 works right unlike
on PlayStation where you circumvent that
system go back to the system itself in
this case you plug into the controller
now this headset is super basic I mean
it's like the ones that they basically
include with the consoles this is to get
you up and running on live or maybe you
know as a backup who knows now to
connect this thing you see I got my
Gears of War 3 controller here you want
to line up you know this little plug on
the bottom side and it takes a fair
amount of force to get it in there and
on each side of the controller there is
a little recess where you got to click
that portion in and then you're good to
go now the first thing I noticed is that
this is heavy I mean the Xbox control is
heavier than the PlayStation controller
begin with but you throw this baby on
there and it gets heavy but but the
typing experience is probably better
than on the PlayStation 3 controller
only because the keyboard is down below
you instead of up above you have to move
your hands less so as I mentioned you
still have that chat pass-through in a
case you want to do some chatting of
course with your vocal cords instead of
your thumbs and
otherwise it really doesn't change or
alter the controller too much so here's
a better look at the keys and what's
available you got you know some shift
and caps keys everything is really basic
it is not as many buttons or variations
as are on the PlayStation 1 and there's
a better look at that chat pass-through
so if you guys want to see me compare
this to the PlayStation 3 version go
ahead and let me know in the comments
and if you liked this content then as
always please blast off on that like
button let me know you love it so I can
come back with more for you anyway guys
until next time and as always thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
