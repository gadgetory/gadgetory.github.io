and yet another game unboxing is in
front of us this is the game season
after all coming up on Christmas and if
there is a collector's edition of a game
it's gonna be here on a channel this is
Lord of the Rings war in the North it's
one of the larger boxes that I've seen
for any collectors or limited edition of
a game and there's many things in the
box besides the game itself there's also
an art book a big gigantic map of
middle-earth and this arrow holder to
hold all your stuff if you so choose to
keep it in there you can also hang the
map up if you would rather do that or
you can just wear the where the arrow
holder is a bag just rock it you know on
your back take it to school
no I'm just kidding don't do that that
might not be received too well
well hey I'm not gonna tell you not to
though you might be a huge fan who knows
so anyways as you guys can see
everything is enclosed inside of the
arrow holder there is nothing else in
the box besides this big package here
and in the main pouch is where you're
gonna find the game as well as the art
book I'm gonna put those two items to
the side for a moment so that we can get
a look at the larger item inside of the
actual arrow holder this big map of
middle-earth that has arrow tips and
arrow ends on each end there you go I
told you it has a strap you could be a
badass rockin that anyways um yeah as I
mentioned before the main attraction
here is this big map you can either put
that up as a collector's piece or keep
it in the in the sheath in the arrow
holder if you choose to do it that way
and there you go you get a better look
at it I'm not sure how relevant this map
is gonna be as far as gameplay is
concerned I don't know if it relates to
the game but nonetheless a cool
collectible for any fan of Lord of the
Rings so let's get inside the game box
see if there is any DLC love from the
developers here and I believe there
should be most collector's editions have
something so the first thing we're gonna
notice is the manual again these manuals
are pretty many these days and there is
some DLC it's at war in the North themed
pack so let's get a better look at this
art book as well a nice matte finish on
the front I like these art folks it
gives you you know some some background
into the artwork in the game
and it gives you a nice appreciation for
the amount of work that goes into the
development of these things you get a
better look at some of what to expect in
some of the levels here yeah once you
throw this game in a nice little preview
there's also a blu-ray in the back it's
it's I think it's a behind the scenes
look at the music production that went
into the game so that's kind of cool of
blu-ray not an audio CD so here you get
a better look at some of the details on
the arrow holder you can see a nice
metallic emblem there and the embossed
lord of the rings' war in the north logo
there real nice stuff one of the nicer
collector's editions that I've seen in
the last little while anyway guys if you
