me know if you can hear me right now I
haven't done this in a while with the
live stuff but oh there you go it looks
like it's working over here
cool now you're probably wondering what
we're doing out here right now and look
check it out you see that that's the
broadcast live broadcast that's what
you're seeing right now um what we're
doing I'm going to give you guys a quick
preview I don't know if it's a preview
at this point probably not because we're
actually doing it but the space is not
set up yet this is the new unbox therapy
headquarters and you could hear crazy
echo because it's a kind of large place
and I just wanted to show you guys
around a little bit like I said nothing
is really set up yet but if you're
wondering like hey hey Lou where was
that video today it's like hey the space
is kind of in shambles and if the
studios in shambles
then unbox therapy is temporarily also
in shambles so I thought I'd hop on here
live and just let you guys know what's
going on so let's take a walk around
this um let's go this way first and I'll
show you guys I guess the front entrance
now a lot of people you guys can be
going wisely it was the space so huge
dude well listen we're expanding we're
trying to make more videos for you guys
to watch you know more often and and
there's a also a couple of top secret
things that are in the works with this
kind of online video business
opportunities present themselves we try
to take advantage of them but ultimately
it's about you guys the viewers and so
on so anyhow so right here is the front
door look how exciting that is and let
me just flip the camera around real
quick to show you guys the other side
okay so look at that this is a chair
from the racing simulator right there
there's a little kitchen that's upstate
I'm going to turn that into a cool
hangout spot sort of my office will be
up there on that floor and I'm going to
have some music equipment to let loose
to get loose up there and then over here
I mean there's really only one desk set
up right now here's here's the displays
from the racing simulator and as you can
tell that's not set up yet
there's like a bunch of furniture over
there boxes from the furniture I mean
it's a disaster look at this place you
getting a behind-the-scenes look at an
absolute disaster but I ordered some
cool furniture this stuff is going to
make up one of the new sets that is
going to be built out look at this can't
you picture me on here that could be
relaxed on there a little bit of cognac
maybe a cigar who knows I'm like I'm
like Winston Churchill on this thing
over here so there's a couple of pieces
of furniture I don't know how it's going
to be used what the sets are going to
look like but like I said it's going to
be a development the progression of
unbox therapy take it to the next level
you can see this is a bunch of junk over
here from the previous studio that has
to be I don't know organized in some
fashion because this is not ideal now
there's some cool huge doors on the back
as you know we've already had a car in
here so that was kind of amazing that's
that's a cool option to have my previous
office was upstairs so everything had to
be brought up and down stairs and to be
able to move in with that those kinds of
doors was kind of Awesome to be honest
thanks for all the comments everybody
who's in here right now checking this
out now let's go upstairs this is going
to be is it going to be my spot up here
and
like I said it's going to be a bit of an
escape a chill-out zone probably gonna
have a spot for naps don't underestimate
the power of a nap and look at this this
is another huge spot it says it's got
the single chair over there
how how where does that look right now
but anyhow yeah so let me just flip this
back around just give you a sense of
scale up here you can tell it's pretty
large and as I said the agenda this is
going to be like desks and stuff up here
but I'm also going to have some some of
my music equipment which hasn't been set
up in forever so I can get back into
that groove a little bit so there's a
lot of windows up here as well and that
means when you have the blinds up you
could get some decent sunlight here's
what it looks like looking down there
from up here that's the back half look
at all those boxes over there kind of
fitting though unbox therapy
headquarters way too many boxes going on
and my desk my current desk
look at how sad that is certainly not
the last set up but we'll get there
we'll get there soon anyways so yes I
just wanted to give you guys a quick
tour and like I said I mean I'll
probably come back and do another
version of this video when stuff is more
set up and I can show you guys the
progress but ultimately for everybody
out there asking saying lude that's it
that's a huge space what's going on here
you don't you're making YouTube videos
like it looks like you're in a some
white closet somewhere what's true that
that's that is how it looks for the for
the show as you know it right now but
there's other plans it's always with you
guys with the audience in mind trying to
give you guys you know more stuff to
watch that you you might think is cool
so this is the development this is the
progression and to be honest it's a
really cool it's a cool opportunity to
be able to expand
not just in terms of physical space but
also in terms of making more stuff and
different kinds of stuff so stick around
stay tuned and get ready for some cool
videos that come out of the new unbox
therapy HQ you're the first part you
hear right now you're the first people
to see this place at least in some level
of detail so all right thanks for
joining me and I'll see you guys shortly
see you guys soon see you guys on the
next video I can't tell you what it is
but there will be a new video tomorrow
