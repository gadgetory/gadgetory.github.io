first thing I want to say is happy New
Year to everyone and thank you for all
the support and the crazy growth that
you guys have provided for unboxtherapy
over the last year the channel is only a
year old and we've come a long way not
just me but you guys too because like as
I said so many times in the past you
guys are as big a part of this operation
as i am and i just want to say thank you
and look look forward to a new year new
stuff on the channel let's make it even
bigger and better let's take over this
game if you know what I'm saying but
anyways the point of this video is it's
one more video in the series of benq joy
be gp2 videos and this one I'm going to
focus on how this device behaves as a
media player because it does have so
many different abilities to interface
with your media whether it be SD USB or
what else or even an external you know
like an external hard drive or USB key
via that USB port it can actually
playback files it has the brains to do
so avi movs anyways so this the way this
works this contest here is that it's
happening over on facebook and you can
upload once per week a different contest
video now last week I must had a mental
lapse because I forgot to upload
anything I know you guys were came out
and voted but somebody else ended up
winning last week because I wasn't on
top of my game but this is a this is for
this week here and hopefully you guys
come out and support me one more time
because you know anything that I win
through this contest is coming straight
back into the channel and not only
through products that we feature here
but also through the form of giveaways
and that brings me to my next point if I
receive on this latest benq video 500
votes on the Facebook page on Bank use
Facebook page it's really easy to vote
click the link down in the description
like benq facebook page and then you can
go ahead and vote as much as you want
but anyways if I give 500 votes on this
new video the benq as a multimedia
player then I'm going to have a massive
New Year's giveaway I'm not going to say
what it is it's going to be a bit of a
surprise but it's going to be a package
of a number of different things that
I've been talking about giving away a
middle
bundle it all together make one massive
one and as I said that's going to be
coming up real soon assuming that this
video here that you're about to watch
gets 500 votes at the link down below so
uh that's that sounds complicated
believe me it's not so without further
ado let's get into the video and check
out how this thing performs as a
multimedia player I'll catch you guys
real quick hang on one second alright so
I've gone ahead and loaded up a bunch of
video content onto this little SD card
here I've got some avi files as well as
some MOV files i'll show you guys how
those operate the quick second you could
just as easily use a USB thumb drive
instead or even an external USB hard
drive for you media hoarders you could
just carry around the benq joy bgp too
with the hard drive and have all of your
content with you when you travel could
be a cool kind of operation but for the
purpose of this for this demonstration
here I'm going to use the SD card
because that is where my content is so
after you select the SD card on the OS
within the little benq menu there it'll
it'll auto scan it'll look through it
and try and look for video files in my
case it found for the first one I'm
going to launch is actually an MOV file
this is not an unboxing but it is from
the channel regarding upgrading the OS
on your Nexus S but this is actually a
fairly large file i think it's around
700 megabytes so nothing too small and
it plays back smoothly just fine the
next file here is an avi file this is a
an old school documentary well not that
old school but I don't know probably
early 90s or something it's called dark
days it's about it's about dudes who
live in the subway system in New York
City obviously homeless dudes but a
pretty crazy documentary if you haven't
seen it yet you might want to check it
out once again it's called dark days and
then the last video I'm going to show
you here the last sample is actually
some gameplay that I recently recorded
me messing around in Saints Row in horde
mode but this is just just goes to show
you that you can hand it a bunch of
different types of media and it so far I
haven't found anything that it wouldn't
playback this is again an avi file but
it's an h.264 codec so it has no problem
playing playing back stuff that's
encoded in h.264
so as you can see here I'm having a lot
of fun a lot of fun in horde mode this
game is a serious joke i mean it's
hilarious it's a good way to pass the
time you don't to concentrate too much
but especially horde mode that is but
anyway guys as you can see here the
little little projector the little joy
bgp 2 is at home doing a bunch of
different things you have so many
different interface options whether it
be SD USB there's HDMI on here composite
video it's a it's really quite a lot of
fun either to take with you on vacation
to bring to a party I mean you could do
lots of stuff with it or even just to
enjoy yourself so anyway guys if you
enjoyed this content hopefully you can
like and favorite this video as it does
help me out a bunch and as I mentioned
earlier in the video this one is going
to be eligible again to be voted for on
the Facebook page of benq the link is
going to be just below here in the
description so please come out vote one
more time as I said before if this video
gets 500 votes on that Bank you Facebook
page I'm gonna do a massive giveaway
that you're not gonna want to miss and I
really don't doubt that it will because
you guys are badass am i right hard guys
until next time I'll see you around I'll
be I shall be back real quick I got some
more content plan alright see real soon
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
