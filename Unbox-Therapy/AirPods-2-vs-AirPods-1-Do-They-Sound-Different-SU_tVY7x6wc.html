new air pods air pods - some people are
calling them that everybody else is kind
of saying their one point five one point
something else there's a reason that the
new version is similar to the old
version it's kind of complicated how
Apple released it though in the sense
that there's a few different ways that
you can actually purchase the new air
pods so on the far left here the new air
pods inside of the new wireless charging
case I think this is probably the only
product they needed to put out but for
some reason they let you buy the new air
pods - without the wireless charging
case now this one is available for a
hundred and fifty-nine dollars which is
the same price as the air pods one but
without the wireless charging case
there's really like no way to tell the
difference but nonetheless they are the
upgraded newer model to take it a step
further they're also selling the
wireless charge case on its own and this
thing is gonna be $79 and you can then
take your first-generation air pods
these ones and pop them into the
wireless charge case or you could
upgrade the non wireless charge case
version of the air pods - and then pick
this up at a later date although that
wouldn't be a very smart decision cost
wise because when you combine the prices
of these two you got one fifty-nine plus
seventy nine bringing you above the
retail price if you just get them
together right here I've talked about
the air pods in the past if you want a
cheaper wireless charge case I actually
demoed a version of that for this
product here it's like a rubber case
from a company called East Brooklyn labs
it's cheaper than the official wireless
charge case and it adds wireless
charging to this that's a way to go but
the thing to remember here is it's not
just wireless charging there's a bit of
a dispute right now happening online I
watched a few videos if the sound of the
new air pods is any better than the old
air pods
according to marques Apple said there is
no difference but there are some
internal improvements to the air pods -
first up you can now launch Siri with
your voice it's also got a new chip
inside which is apparently a bit better
for battery and is gonna connect to your
devices a little bit faster and then the
other thing that come
along with that new internal chip is the
fact that there's less latency that's
the only way you're gonna know if you're
on version 2 as well as this little LED
light on the front right there let's get
this out of the box now I do like
wireless charging as well so that
functionality is worthwhile to me
especially on a product like this you
already got to charge your phone if you
could have a map actually speaking of a
mat on the wireless charge case only
they showcase the air power mat fresh
pair oh I notice another visual
difference right away on the backside
there
this is glossy reflective this is a
matte finish on version 2 air pod
visually identical to the previous
version okay so for those of you
unfamiliar with wireless charging here's
how that works
this is a basic Qi compatible wireless
charger you can find these on Amazon for
like a few bucks and then you drop your
headphones on there and boom orange
light wirelessly charging how simple is
that for the purpose of this testing in
order to get to the bottom of the sound
issue and whether or not there is a
discrepancy I've got an iPhone here
alright this is the 10 s max let's go
ahead and pair these up look at the chip
go into action the ecosystem Apple on
Apple this is what you get connect it's
all it takes
again another advantage of this chip and
this behavior the connection between the
two Apple products you get this really
nice battery readout though I found a
cool app on the Android side if you do
use air pods on Android air battery
it basically replicates the Apple
experience with a giant ugly add and
look at that you can pretend you have an
iPhone when you pair up your air pods
it's actually very useful because it
tells you your battery as well hundred
percent 100 percent 25 percent of course
it's not official this is official and
this is very quick on the Apple side so
I'm going to remove these this is series
2 and now I guess we should boot up some
music
maybe they're a little louder should I
get another iPhone so I can quickly a be
it his version one remember to get the
Zack same track same source same foam
earpods one air Potts - just one year
okay right year air pause number one
left ear air pots - I'm gonna flip yours
just to make sure my ears are not the
problem here
I wanna take that out do this take this
out do this now I have air pod wanting
left air pod - and right alright I've
concluded though there's no difference I
thought for a moment but that's the
crazy part about this you really need
some strong a/b testing to know for
certain couple different songs couple
different genres if there's any
difference I'm telling you right now
it's minuscule the old versus the new I
don't think the reason to get the new
ones is sound alright I think I could
pretty confidently say that based on my
little test right here there really is
only one major reason to upgrade which
is the wireless charge case that's a
simple little obvious convenience factor
and how big of a deal that is depends
really on you and how much you value the
opportunity to do that but unfortunately
the wireless charge case if you just
want to upgrade your version one is
really expensive it's 80 bucks just the
case on its own so I'm not sure that
that's worthwhile either I would say
you're looking at version two if you
don't have a pair yet or if you're
version one aren't holding a charge
maybe the battery is kind of killed on
them then you could be looking towards
version two this is a convenience thing
it's a form factor thing these tiny
little packages you put in your pocket
you don't even realize or remember that
it's a dare which is good that's what
you want it's so small and so convenient
that you find yourself reaching for it
inevitably that's why I made that video
about the air pod confession that's why
I'm using these things on an Android
phone
it's a very low friction device and
that's why these are attractive to
people and other manufacturers need to
take note so there
his version - you heard the differences
wireless charging slightly better
battery life faster connection and lower
latency but they sound like the first
generation look like the first
generation and basically behave like the
first generation if you have a first
generation I'd say stick it out no need
to upgrade not at the moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
