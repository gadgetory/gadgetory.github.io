interest is piqued I saw this thing the
sensor wait and I was like I'm gonna
order that immediately so that's what I
did this is an alarm clock that rather
than scream at you ain't I'll never
forget the first alarm clock I ever got
and my goodness the noise that that
thing made I'm pushing into it and
insane asylum no wonder they worked so
well I was like gotta be something
better so back then
jung-woo was thinking about the future
think about the future Batman Jack you
need to watch Batman I've been talking
about it a lot
Tom think about the future remember that
now Jack what do you know about Jack
Nicholson no here we go you know you
can't do that multiple videos in a row
consecutively anyhow I was thinking
about the future and I knew there had to
be a better way and this might be that
better way it's the old factory alarm
clock and this thing uses smell to wake
you up what excuse me what a smell
really wake you up now everyone has had
this experience at some point or at
least I hope you have when you wake up
in the morning and you smell something
cooking downstairs maybe it's bacon
maybe it's french toast man I can't wait
to get downstairs Jack what's the smell
for you huh what's the ultimate
breakfast food smell that would get you
out of your warm bed what is it no is it
that's alive oatmeal
this thing here has a bunch of different
smells so no matter what your preference
it's gonna wake you up to that smell
this one in the box includes the smell
of toast fresh toast
the wide variety of scents available
crustle seaside espresso fresh-cut grass
chocolate the toast one is in this box
and peppermint now it's a gradual
two-minute wake up and there's a thirty
awakenings per capsule there is a backup
melody now they're calling it a melody
and that comes after three minutes of
the emission of the scent so if the
scent doesn't do it you got the backup
plan to wake you up and then hey the
scent is in the room so at least when
the melody comes on you're thinking
about fresh toes all right let's crack
this open not not time to wake up happy
is this world peace right here in a
product maybe here is our toast capsule
the power brick it looks like there's a
fan kind of unit on the back it just
booted up it's asking for me to set the
time okay so 346 you have the time
setting and the alarm setting what do we
have your peppermint cut grass chocolate
espresso and then seaside it tears at
the top like this oh wow that's weird
capsules in there oh it's very strong
and potent so I'm gonna drop that in now
let's set the alarm Oh Oh see that icon
there oh oh oh right oh I definitely
smell that now is it really toast though
I can hear the fan whirling inside too
so it's pushing that out there with that
brilliant so the light kind of starts to
glow maybe you're gonna notice that in
conjunction with the smell Tom you're in
the frame if someone just gave me this
smell what would I say I don't think I
would say totes but there's definitely a
scent coming out of it whoo I like that
groove I could add like some drums to
that
and that's it if you're sleeping through
that you're done bud we're going to the
cut grass we're going all the way to cut
grass cool that is boom oh my whoa Tom
get your nose in there
oh yeah Tom come okay there he is you
know what's interesting it smells like
perfume to me this is peppermint now
that now I could go I could get with
that it's like gum it smells like gum
might as well do seaside while we're at
it
woah seaside is kind of fresh seaside
smells like fabric softener which is it
a bad thing chocolate I mean it does it
does smell like chocolate espresso
espresso and chocolate are very similar
and both of them I don't know the food
ones are kind of weird I don't it
doesn't smell like the actual food it's
kind of like sort of the only two that I
could probably get behind is peppermint
and seaside the proof would be in the
pudding as they say like would it
actually get you up it's a cool concept
a cool thought I feel like the sense
could use a little bit of work there's
some chemistry involved I have no
solutions for that but certain things
translate a lot better like peppermint
for example and maybe my favorite part
is just this little tune right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
