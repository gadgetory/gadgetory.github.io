therapy and today we're taking a look at
the joy B GP 2 mini projector from BenQ
now this thing has some features and
functions that are incredibly unique in
this projector space the first and
probably most marketable element is the
fact that it's got an iPhone / iPad dock
built right into it now that is not only
going to output video content from your
iDevice it's also gonna charge it that
can be an interesting feature for a lot
of people but on top of that it's going
to output 720p it's got built-in memory
and SD card slot a USB reader it'll
stream from your PC over USB it's got
HDMI I'm out of breath it's got a lot
built in to such a small package this
thing is only one pound it's the
smallest projector I've ever owned and
on top of that it can output a hundred
and 60 inch image in 720p that's crazy
for something so small I'm gonna put it
to the side for a second and talk about
the other items get them all out of the
box and get the box out of the way now
the reason I receive this device is
because it's part of a big contest that
BenQ is having to promote this brand-new
device of theirs and I'm gonna ask you
guys to come out and support me on it
but it's not until December the fifth
I'm Bank use Facebook page I'll give you
guys the details as that date gets
closer now the very first item we're
gonna take a quick look at here is the
mini remote a nice slim remote control
to go with your portable projector a
full-size remote wouldn't have made any
sense I don't think you've also got some
North American warranty information you
get a cd-rom in case you want to look at
your manual in PDF form if you don't
like the traditional paper version but I
actually don't mind this manual because
everything is diagram based instead of
heavy on language so it ain't like a
novel but you really won't need this
because this thing is dead simple to set
up now here's a better look at that slim
little remote control and the
interesting thing here is you don't only
have buttons to control the projector
you've also got buttons to control the
iPhone or iPod directly so the
integration here is pretty serious if
they've really focused on integrating
with the AI devices now the powered app
there that's pretty
boring you've all seen one of these
before it's got a little velcro strap to
help you when you're traveling we've
also got a breakout style video cable
here that's going to handle VGA
composite as well and that's all going
to be supported via a breakout cable
that looks a lot like Apple's 30 pin
connector as I'll show you in a second
here and I'm not sure why they've used
that that there but it probably has
something to do with the integration of
I devices it doesn't really matter as
far as you're concerned you can input
whichever format you choose now we've
got an extension here for the other half
of the power adapter so you're gonna
have a lot of cable there if you're far
away from the wall or something along
those lines
now here the main attraction the joy bgp
- is housed in this nice microfiber
style carrying case and as I mentioned
before the main feature here is the size
and weight it is one pound it fits in
one hand at least one of my hands you've
got a little bit of extra space in the
carrying case that's because there's an
optional battery pack available for this
thing that will give you up to three
hours of output that could be amazing
for times where you're not going to be
near a power outlet at all like if
you're camping or outdoors or something
along those lines
or or just for convenience so as you
guys notice on the top of the device
you've got this glossy finish and you've
got touch sensitive buttons if you
choose not to use the remote you've also
got of course the iPod dock that I
mentioned earlier that's kind of the the
big selling feature I think that's what
they're hoping people are going to be
looking at most you have your lens on
the front of the device as we get closer
here we can look at the port's we've got
type a USB mini USB we've got that
breakout connector that I mentioned
earlier and then we've got HDMI can you
imagine hooking up your ps3 or your Xbox
360 to this you've also got audio in
headphone out and DC and to power up the
device of course but yeah this could be
a lot of fun for games every so often
here's a better look at the lens on the
front of the device and you've got this
little screw in the bottom here for
balancing it and also elevating the
image depending on the kind of wall or
surface you're projecting onto you've
also got a focus wheel to get the
sharpest image possible depending on the
distance of the projector
from the wall as you guys know if you've
ever used the projector before the SD
card slot is on the front of the device
and this is real cool you can load up to
the internal memory or just keep it on
the SD your videos or even your
documents if you want to use this thing
for work really cool for such a small
little device it's got tons of different
ways of interfacing with it now the
construction is solid there's aluminum
on the top I'm really impressed at this
point as you can probably tell this
thing the fit and finish is real nice
all around look how tiny it is I can
Palm the device in one hand here it's
crazy small and as I said before I've
never personally owned a projector this
size so it'll be real interesting to see
if I'm more inclined to pull it out
because of how small it is so it also
had a tripod adapter if you want to hook
it up to a tripod that'd be a kind of a
weird scenario I guess on the street or
something that might be convenient now
hooking it up to your eye device is dead
simple as well you can see the infamous
pink iPhone from videos before here and
you can output everything from personal
content like stuff that you've recorded
on the iPhone that's in the camera
application as you can see here you get
a nice 720p image up on the wall now
this is obviously not projected huge but
it looks really good in a dimly lit room
this is not a pitch-black room so it's
it's decent you're getting 200 lumens
it's not gonna blow you away but it's
nice for such a small device as I said
earlier you can also play YouTube it's
just as at home playing YouTube videos
here you can see one of the earliest
unbox therapy videos when I got the iPad
2 down in Buffalo if you guys haven't
seen that video which one of my first
unboxing I didn't even have a knife I'll
put a link in the annotations or down in
the description see how nervous I was
now the interface is also really
intuitive it kind of reminds me of the
ps3 interface you just scroll left to
right and if you remember the old
archaic projectors we used to have in
our schools growing up or you probably
still do interfaces do not look this
pretty at all so I'm really impressed
with the work they've done on the
interface they make it look like a games
console or something it's incredibly
easy to operate so anyway guys I mean I
hope you're as interested in this
product as I am as I mentioned before
it's part of a big BenQ promote
general contest they're having and
hopefully once I give you guys the full
details you can come out and support me
in that contest anyway guys if you
enjoyed this content then hopefully you
can like and favorite this video as it
does help me out a bunch and I hope
you've enjoyed this unboxing marathon
box with a lot of stuff lately and a lot
more coming before the holiday season so
if you haven't subscribed yet subscribe
now you might watch it might be
worthwhile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
