another video and today I've got
something that I found very interesting
from the moment I heard about it heard
about it no pun intended I've got a
bunch of headphones on the table here
but really the focus is in the center of
the table
these here are called B tunes and
they're from a company called voxel WA
hope I'm saying that correctly these
little contraptions here will turn any
set of headphones your favorite set of
headphones into wireless ones using high
quality Bluetooth 4.0 now obviously
you're going to need to use a pair of
headphones that has a detachable cable
because this here will connect to the
opening where that cable would normally
attach now they make devices for various
popular brands you know Bose headphones
for example but they also make a
universal unit the idea of being able to
take a headphone that that is not
Wireless and make it Wireless to me is
like the perfect kind of scenario
because then you're not stuck to
selecting only headphones that come in a
wireless variant from the manufacturer
here I've got a pair of JBL
some sure SRH 440s some sennheiser HD 8
DJ's and a pair of Alpine headphones
that I featured a little while back on
the channel these are all wired
headphones we're about to discover this
entire process together so flipping the
box over the B tunes from box WAP box
alarm box Oh wah box wah designed in
California but of course assembled in
China most importantly made for you
Bluetooth 4.0 so power saving features
there NFC touch to pair I love this in
my wireless headphones it'll work up to
10 meters battery is good for 300 hours
of standby and 10 hours of listening at
moderate volume there you have it now
chances are you've already got a set of
headphones you might even be listening
to this video on those headphones so
here's the device you are also adding a
microphone here as well
pretty sleek little unit
they're microUSB cable to charge it up
so that's how you gonna charge it up and
then you've also got a power switch in
that location there paperwork just a
little bit charging charging finish
pairing mode blah blah blah low battery
a little bit of warranty and we are good
to go the convenience of Bluetooth is
amazing and with 400 these new codecs
this sound is actually pretty good so
I'm hoping that this little guy here can
compete with some of my wireless
favorites and I can just carry this
around okay I see it flashing now so let
me pull out my phone hold it up come on
NFC NFC where art thou do I have NFC
turn on I do you're gonna need to be a
little bit more precise in this case
here come on little guy is it user
manual time did I just move the table
NFC please Oh nailed it
moved it up a bit it has to be pretty
precise kind of wish it was a little bit
easier which headphones let's start with
these the sennheiser HD 8 VJ again this
is you know it's kind of a universal
thing but it's gonna depend on your
headphones let's see what's up
oh there we go little adjustment I'm now
in both year cups
am I talking loud I'm a little loud okay
I feel like I should be able to go a
little bit louder
let me try on these guys here that's
actually that's a much better fit look
at that this I mean this one fits great
oh it sounds better to I mean we're
Wireless right now folks
look I don't see any wires Jack see any
wires one thing I mentioned volume I
feel like I could use a little bit more
now this again is gonna depend on your
headphones and how much power is
necessary to drive those uh transducers
did you know that's what yeah we're
gonna move to these JBL's over here okay
now that's a little bit louder on these
guys
ooh these guys okay these guys feature a
3.5 millimeter jacket so you would need
an adapter in this case because this is
a 2.5 millimeter there you have it I
don't know for me like this fit here on
the shores that almost looks like it was
meant to be kind of to be honest for
most people I think that's going to be
suitable volume I wish is a little bit
louder but I think that might be me more
than the actual device I think it's kind
of cool wireless headphones that didn't
come from the factory Wireless you made
on Wireless to be completely honest I
think I'm into it Vox oh ah be tunes
check it out I guess I'll drop a link in
