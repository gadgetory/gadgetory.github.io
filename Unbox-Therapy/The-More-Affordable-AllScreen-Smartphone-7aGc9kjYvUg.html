continues to get more interesting
especially in the department of screen
to body ratios and so-called bezel lists
smartphones one of the major players in
that space vivo who first showed us the
idea in the form of the apex I made a
video about it it was a concept phone
that started to get us thinking about
what futuristic phones might look like
so in front of me today I've got the
vivo necks and this is the retail
version of the concept device the apex
ooh
this carries forward the in display
fingerprint scanner ooh
so there's the phone interesting pattern
on the back there I don't know if you
guys can see that there's a bit of a
color shift it's a glass back so it does
have a glossy finish to it you can see
the camera unit up here so it is a dual
lens setup with a flash underneath
type-c connector on the bottom no not on
the top but first we have a case
included alright very nice let's get to
the main attraction so there it is there
is a bit of a bezel along bottom but it
isn't much
we have nothing no knotch no
obstructions of any kind there's what
your full screen display looks like now
something you'll notice along the bottom
here is these three indicators and that
is how you're going to navigate the
phone you're all curious about the
camera if I flip around to the front
boom
listen to this
that camera is rated to go up 50,000
times see myself
I'm not taking selfies that frequently
50,000 it's a lot of selfies will would
you agree there's something so
captivating about watching that little
camera raise up so I told you already
that this takes you home the simple
swipe up if you push and hold you get
into the multitasking swiping on the
right button takes you back and then on
this side it'll bring up your quick
toggle settings now you know I gotta
test the selfie camera it is so fancy
but does it do the trick detail detail
that is a work of art Leonardo da Vinci
van Gogh ah
Picasso II Rembrandt so that's an F 2.0
eight megapixel image right there okay
say hi
that's a hilly hoo-ha right there that's
his full name it's on his birth
certificate he didn't want me to tell
you check the birth certificate mistake
that 1080 by 23 16 and it's also of
course OLED 12 megapixel F 1 point 8 and
5 megapixel F 2 point 4 okay here we go
register the fingerprint it is scanning
through the display here we go oh man
that satisfied BAM
now it is worth mentioning on the apex I
had a huge region that I could tap on
it's simply difficult from a cost
perspective to put that into a retail
device right now unlocking your device
is a thing that you do multiple multiple
multiple times a day we'll how many
times you unlock your device per day
hundred plus hille who daily do da day
Jack how many times you unlock your
phone daily you do the same as well what
are you doing on your smartphone
man nonetheless here we have an
interesting package now the fingerprint
scanner you're gonna get used to that
location you'll likely get better at it
can't wait to see the full concept
version that I tested on the apex boiled
down into something retail oh how big is
the battery will 4,000 and now of course
the important consideration price can
you tell me the price will he do welcome
to come over here come on come on
okay bitch err this is six point five
nine inches you kidding me are you
kidding me that's a lot of screen will
he do for scale the price well he knows
he does the research he stays up at
night that's him
he knows these things uh they don't sell
in the States apparently that is
terrible the cool part here is that for
998 RMB depending on when you do the
conversion or when you watch that that's
around seven hundred and eighty bucks
but if you don't need the Mac storage
you go to the 128 the conversion on that
700 bucks 700 bucks a Snapdragon a 4/5
you've got the end screen fingerprint
scanner you got eight gigs of ram up to
256 gigabytes of storage and you're
starting at seven hundred four thousand
milliamp hour battery and the screen is
six point five nine inches and you have
Willie do for scale I don't know I might
even put a sim card in it how about that
I might even put a safeguard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
