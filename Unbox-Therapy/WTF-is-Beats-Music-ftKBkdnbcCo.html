to give you a quick look at the brand
new beats music service for both iOS and
Android before we start I quickly want
to mention that the service is currently
on a 7 day free trial there is no credit
card or payment necessary there's a link
in the description so you can check it
out and I recommend you do so what the
hell is beats music from the maker of
Beats Audio a new music service yes sir
dr. Dre and his partners are ready to
compete with the likes of Spotify and
Rdio offering up a next-gen listening
service of their own beats music claims
to have 20 million tracks in its library
already putting it in the same league as
Spotify when it comes to pure quantity
getting set up is pretty easy to do at
least in my case though I was reading
some of the reviews on the Android side
and some users have had trouble with the
setup screen but there are always
growing pains with a brand new
application getting a ton of traffic
I'm usually annoyed by preference
discovery features in apps but this one
is incredibly clean and enjoyable to use
instead of a boring list you're
presented with these joyful little
circles waiting for interaction select
your favorite genres a few favorite
artists and you're done using this data
along with your age you'll have
suggestions and playlists waiting for
your eyes and ears as soon as you launch
the app of course the software is
intelligent and will improve suggestions
and selections as it gets to know you
even better beats music also features an
offline mode giving you the ability to
download tracks locally so you're not
killing your mobile data while you're on
the plane train or dogsled there's also
a sound quality setting allowing you to
adjust fidelity based on your needs or
mobile data requirements so you can
toggle down the quality if you want to
save data and then boost it back up when
you're on Wi-Fi back at home or
something like that like other music
services the goal here is to add
favourites to your library build
playlists follow curators artists and
influencers to tune your musical taste
and collection I have to say the
software here is on point
smooth visually pleasing although that
is subjective of course intuitive you'll
find all of the standard fare in here
Lou
next back like add to library share etc
you'll also get background on your
favorite artists along with their
influencers so you can take a trip
backwards and explore the inspiration to
your favorite tracks you can also listen
to music based on your activity ie
chilling out cooking dancing starting a
riot it's not my cup of tea but it's in
there if you happen to be into it the
question for most will likely have to do
with the inventory of music available in
a particular genre that of course is
tough to map initially the best thing to
do is to get in there and search around
yourself after all 20 million tracks is
a fair number to sift through I happen
to be into hip hop electronic jazz soul
and some indie stuff and so far I'm
having good luck overall I'm impressed
with what they've put together it's
obvious that dr. Dre at this point has
been a powerhouse in the music industry
and continues to be and if he's able to
leverage all of those relationships that
he has with record labels to continue
building the inventory of songs on beats
music the other services might be in
trouble
then again beats music is late to the
game and many have already adopted other
services and migrating all of your user
data all of your playlists and followers
and everything else that is baked into
these new services might be tough to do
at this point so that leaves me with a
question for you guys do you currently
use a music streaming service if so
which one and are you going to check out
beats music and lastly would you be
willing to switch over if you happen to
like the service more or what would make
you switch maybe a particular album that
you haven't been able to find elsewhere
or a series of albums or strengths in a
particular genre anyways let me know
down in the comments your thoughts but
that pretty much wraps this up that was
a quick look at the brand new beats
music service launching today or
yesterday I don't know it's brand new
check it out the links to the app are in
the description of this video and
remember it's free to try for 7 days so
I recommend checking it out alright guys
thanks as always for watching if you
enjoyed this content please remember to
leave a thumbs up down below and
we'll catch you on the next episode
later guys so not only is Squarespace a
great place to set up your very first
website it's also a great place to set
up your very first web store that's
because they've got commerce
functionality built right in no extra
charge
it's there and it's very easy to use in
fact I have already implemented it on my
site on box therapy comm we sell some
t-shirts and some stickers just basic
stuff but it works just as well for
digital merchandise so if you're a
musician maybe a hip-hop producer or
you're in a band and you want to start
to monetize some of your content it's a
great way to reach out to fans and to
actually sell some stuff to them the
interface is incredibly easy to use
trust me I was intimidated at the
concept of e-commerce in the beginning
and having used the Squarespace service
I am not intimidated at all anymore in
fact I've had a great experience
tracking orders taking orders taking
payments it's all right there in one
simple easy-to-use interface full
details in the description as well as a
special promo code just for you guys
thanks again to Squarespace alright
