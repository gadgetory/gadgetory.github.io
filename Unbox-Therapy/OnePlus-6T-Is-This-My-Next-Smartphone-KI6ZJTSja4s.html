from one plus I'm pretty sure you're
aware of it it is of course the 6t and I
finally have it in front of me here so
of course I'll be unboxing it and taking
a closer look as you know I've been a
fan of oneplus devices in the past I
used the oneplus 6 extensively as a
daily driver I may very well do the same
with this one the 60 I am still
currently on the pixel 3 but this device
here it's kind of targeting the pixel 3
it's attacking the pixel 3 have they
done enough here to differentiate from
the oneplus 6 because after all this is
a t model it's not an all new is that a
completely new thing it's still got a
snapdragon 84 5 and so on and so on and
so forth we have a microfiber cloth 1
plus red so proud these are the types II
bullets earphones ok so probably
indicate to you that there's been a
change with the whole headphone setup on
this device bit of a controversial topic
the elimination of the headphone jack
we've been talking about it how much
does it matter I don't know that depends
on you if you use mini Jack headphones
you're now stuck with Samsung LG and who
knows for how long another one bites the
dust another one bites the dust
I say hey another one bites the dust and
we've also got first-party cases I like
this stuff I like that one Plus does it
some of the nicest first party case
accessories in the business what does it
say here jack collection of individuals
possessed of a tremendous understanding
and superior taste the finest technology
what's most important is that they're a
part of what we do and that includes you
look at that now the definition of you
128 gigabytes as you can see Qualcomm
Snapdragon this is what you're here for
yes would you look at that it's letting
you know right away how you're gonna
unlock it your fingerprint will go here
of course this device will also feature
similar face unlock capabilities to the
previous version and if you were
familiar with that or if you caught my
video on that particular feature then
you know it's really fast you'll see a
little S curve
of s pattern in the reflection as well
it's intentionally there and it's to
give it a little extra shimmer dual
camera set up at the top the flashes
below there and you can see the absence
of a fingerprint scanner it is cool to
have it hidden and secret and under the
display but keep in mind oneplus had one
of the fastest rear fingerprint scanners
in the game on the previous version
type-c connector on the bottom
incredibly fast charging the fastest in
the game generally speaking at least
with the previous model I expect the
same they've now moved up to a 3700
milliamp hour battery so there's a nice
little improvement there apparently as
well the chin is a slight bit smaller it
actually looks pretty slim this is the
case that would be included in the
retail package you get like this smoked
look here it's actually not bad warning
I'm a flagship killer all right all
right great all right all right five
years old and a million stories told
here's that charger that I talked about
I assume it's going to be quite quick
the classic oneplus red type-c cable oh
and I almost forgot the adapter type c2
mini jack the headphone jack is gone on
this device some of you will be angry
and upset about it and you'll say you
told oneplus and shouldn't do that that
you really appreciate the headphone port
and so on and so forth and to be honest
with you I feel like they probably could
have fit it in here I think it's more
just a general trend now at this point
in the whole marketplace and so I'm sure
oneplus they probably sat around a table
and they're like look no one else has it
do we need it can we cut it can we get
the price down a little further if we
can skip that part of the manufacturing
process I don't know exactly what the
justification was and these things are
annoying you always forget them I'm
gonna be completely honest and maybe we
have a little discussion here about
whether or not the headphone jack is
fully dead now me you tell me I tell you
you tell me let's look at the phone
would you look at that
so first up we'll test this guy here you
can see how that works
it reads it rather quickly there's an
animation that goes along with it
I think the attempt there is to make it
seem faster than it might be but it's
still pretty quick it might be a few
milliseconds slower than the rear
scanner now face unlock has been quick
it's strictly optical it's just image
based so it's not the most secure in the
world the speed almost makes up for
where you're like that convenience is so
intense it's as quick as you press the
button basically in some cases like it
just it doesn't even show anything it
just goes straight boom boom and now of
course if I look away from it nothing
and then I look at it bang I like having
the two features in tandem versatility
is good here from an authentication
perspective this is one of the few face
unlocks that I continued to use with the
device after the demonstration because
it's just so fast now another thing in
and around the device this is crazy
snappy like animations are toggled back
I turned them off completely now and
this is just like it's instantaneous
there's a lot of like the phone just
feels quick this device is outperforming
some of its competition for example the
phone that's in my pocket the pixel 3
it's a 4 gigabyte device this one is 8
can have a little bit more confidence
with that extra RAM that happens to be
in here and then never mind the knotch
because this to me has to be one of the
most pleasant notches it's a weird thing
to say I've been so against it and to be
honest I'm still not the hugest fan but
if you're gonna have one there's
something a bit more elegant about this
implementation right here now all it has
to house is the front-facing camera
after all so you can show the notch area
or hide the notch area it's completely
up to you and the overall aesthetic just
to me makes a bit more sense there it is
think about the package you have AMOLED
fhd Plus Snapdragon 8/4 5 8 gigs of ram
a relatively Pleasant notch all things
considered
you have an ear stock Android experience
a very fast face on lock in conjunction
with an in display fingerprint scanner
fortunately no wireless charging even
though you have a glass back I'm not
sure the reason for that I assume it has
something to do with them being enamored
with the quick charging 15 minutes all
the battery life in the world bigger
battery from the previous version no
one's gonna complain about that so 3,700
milliamp hours it's around 500 bucks
starting at 550 there aren't that many
options that sort of complete the
package in the way that oneplus can is
it worth spending the extra cash to step
up to something like the pixel 3 pixel 3
XL this guy here starts at 550 the three
excel which has a similar display size
that things 900 bucks to start and then
things get a bit squirrely in figuring
out if you're gonna get that value back
we got to think about the camera talk
about the camera it seems to be so
important for so many users out there I
think it would be hard to imagine that
this is really gonna challenge the pixel
for camera status champion but even if
we concede camera champion to the pixel
device is it enough of a factor for you
to reach into your pocket and spend
almost twice as much a compelling
package tough to ignore you've got to be
paying attention to this device I have a
feeling you guys are gonna choose this
for me to switch to next let me know
down in the comments if you want me to
switch to this or some other device I'm
excited to get to know it just a little
bit more is it your next smartphone is
it my next smartphone am i switching to
this guys let me know in the comments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
