this is the line right here you're on
this side don't you ever come on this
side today I've got a very important
video to share with you essentially what
we're aiming to do here is figure out
the difference between an $8 headphone
and a very similar-looking $80 headphone
now at the time that I purchased each of
these this was $7.99 and this was $79.99
now this brand over here you're familiar
with it's beats and these are the most
affordable over-ear Beats headphones as
far as I can tell it's a wired headphone
sits on top of your ears should these be
worth 10 times more than the headphones
that are on my left over here we have
polaroid whoo
you probably remember that name as well
but like now they're making headphones
I paid $7.99 for them if you're
wondering why I chose these for this
comparison it's just because they look
kind of the same I mean look at for
$7.99 you've got inline controls some
microphone you can answer phone calls
there fold the ball first up let's crack
these open change the way you hear sound
look at this little microfiber bag to
carry them in and I mean listen they
look good a leather like surface that
will touch your ear a flat table so
hopefully it won't tangle up too much
there's a microphone here for answering
calls all right cool we got it not gonna
be anywhere near as pleasant as the
beats not the greatest first impression
but hey you paid 8 bucks what are you
really hoping for here you see that's
that's an $8 package right there okay a
little bit more flimsy the white color
the headphone itself is like almost a
yellowish these are lighter weight no
soft touch material on the top in fact
there's like a little bit of dirt on
there kind of it looks like I don't
maybe these were open before kind of a
bonus on an eight dollar headphone is a
braided cable these plugs look super
similar it's also got a single button
inline there's also a mic in there
they're lightweight you're probably
going to have a little bit of sound
bleed because they're not super tight on
the ears fold them up I mean that gets
pretty small right there
ooh so the adjustment immediately is
more smooth and the external noise kind
of the noise of the room and so on is a
lot less immediately I mean I don't know
I'm starting to think even if we
blindfold Tom he's gonna be able to tell
just from the field what we'll blindfold
them anyways because that's just well
that's fun to do so we've got an eight
dollar headphone we've got an eighty
dollar headphone you probably recognize
this brand you're probably a little more
suspect about this one over here and
what kind of you're usually what kind of
headphones are you usually listening to
music with I experiment all the time I'm
always changing Oh
load it up Google Play Music whatever
you want man whatever you're familiar
with critical listening
what's your request I'm open to anything
you guys pick pick something since what
we're doing right now Tom pick any song
man help me think oh wow see cause it's
gonna represent him too much uh yeah
okay go with the tool song they're not
on app music or Google Play really yeah
you're right they're not percent you
like I do like Derek Lowe genius be cool
okay Gary Clark jr. off of Google Play
Music so this is a standard kind of
listening scenario this is how you would
have your headphones plugged in getting
blindfolded brother I'm gonna make any
phone calls to loved ones oh you can see
through that yeah this is so stupid
there we go it's blocking my ears the
world is depending on you Tom
you want more volume mm-hmm more that's
good the world is depending on Tom right
now because they need to spend eighty or
can they spend eight ready for the next
one's focused Tom what happened there
man tell the people what happened so the
first one was the cheap ones yeah I
think you can name it from the feeling
of them no the sound is a big thing
Oh huge the volume difference was
massive
when you were talking when I was
listening to the first second one to
hear everything things yeah they don't
they don't seal around the ears and it's
like a it's a shallower sound they're
cheap like they're eight bucks
the sound quality isn't bad for eight
dollars do you need to go up do you need
to spend the 80 or are you getting by
with the eight you're spending the 80
aren't you from this scenario right here
you're spending the 80 probably he's
spending the 80 all right my turn
max volume is not that loud I mean eight
eight bucks it's not bad eight bucks
okay hold up I think a key part of this
is just the isolation right away oh you
want to make beats sound good just put
them up against $8 headphone what can I
say pretty much what you expected $80
headphones sound better than $8
headphones that ratio is incredibly
subjective though when it comes to
evaluating the difference and how much
that might matter to you even
seventeen-year-old Tom and McDonald's is
still saving up to spend the 80
what is the difference how much does it
matter we get the $8 headphone $80 if
he's going for an $80 hell I think what
we've discovered here is that most
people need to upgrade their headphones
I'll have them link both down below like
I said I think these went up to $12 but
really if you got the extra cash step
your game up I mean you can go you can
get crazier than this though oh yeah
that's the thing and then that's where
that ratio changes so maybe there's a
follow-up video in which we take the $80
versus the 800 and then maybe you're
like uh I don't know give the people
some examples of things you can get for
$8 the beg candy it won't burn Tom loves
candy send candy addressed to Tom the
addresses on the YouTube about Paige
weird
close out the video me oh close out
that's all you closed out the video
close out the video I don't know what to
say okay Tom's gonna take everything
that happened today and boil it down
into one word go uh fantastic spend a
little bit more on your audio gear your
ears will thank you what is this a
commercial your ears will thank you</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
