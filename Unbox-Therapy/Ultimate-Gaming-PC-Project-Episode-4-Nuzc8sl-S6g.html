to you by Gamefly what's up guys Lew
here and welcome to the latest
installment in the ultimate gaming PC
project for the new subscribers those of
you who are unaware of what this project
is I'll make a quick playlist of the
previous installments so you can get up
to date but I do want to do a quick sort
of recap for you guys in this show right
here what we're doing is trying to build
the ultimate gaming PC as the name of
the project implies we've raised over
five thousand dollars that is correct
we've gone over our goal of five
thousand dollars to pump back into this
ultimate gaming PC every single
component every single piece of hardware
is gonna be chronicled on unbox therapy
unboxed individually and I'm gonna go
over why it was selected for the build
for the ultimate gaming PC and this will
culminate in a official build video
where we place all of these items
together and come out with this beast of
this creation which then I'm going to
give away that's right I'm gonna give it
back to the community and there's a
couple of reasons for that because it's
fair to do because I appreciate your
viewership and also because I'm so busy
with all my work I wouldn't even know
what to do with an ultimate gaming PC
once I built it and I think one of you
guys could definitely make better use of
it so yes the exciting news is of course
the fact that we've gone over our goal
of $5,000 and there's still 10 days
remaining on the campaign now 5000 bucks
is plenty of money to build in ultimate
gaming PC as you guys likely know but I
also know that this could get even
bigger and better there isn't really
much of a limit when it comes to
component hardware customization of the
chassis water cooling there are still
things that can be integrated that cost
a bunch of money so I do want to say
that the project and campaign is still
open if you want to get involved in it
the minimum contribution point is $5 a
$5 contribution it grants you access to
the project it's the price of admission
perk as it's called on the actual
project page that project page is going
to be linked in the annotations as well
as down in the description so if you do
want to get involved you've got 10 days
left
there's even $15 perks left which allow
you to get a little bit of channel
promotion for your
YouTube channel and that that perk will
get you a credit at the end of the
official billed video so that's the way
that works but but look at this I mean
we reached over 5 grand so it's time to
celebrate
I'm yesterday during the livestream I
had a bunch of people come in I saw
contributions come in at that point to
push us over the $5,000 goal and I'm
just really excited and amazed at what
we were able to accomplish and can't
wait to start creating some of this
amazing content and also to get into
this big giveaway which is especially
exciting coming off of another big
giveaway which just ended so very cool
stuff all around in very cool news all
around now as you guys know I've been
starting to make some component
decisions on what is going to go into
the ultimate gaming PC which makes sense
because now it's definitely go ago it's
a big-time go with over 5 G's to spend
on it but something very exciting happen
in the meantime I was sitting there
trying to piece components together had
a lot of ideas I've been having really
sophisticated discussions with you guys
on what kinds of components we should be
looking at and leaning towards and in
that mayhem
I actually got contacted via email from
a company you guys are probably familiar
with in the gaming component space
saying hey Lou we checked out your
ultimate gaming PC project we saw how
excited all the users are all the
contributors and we decided we wanted to
contribute as well so who is the company
this is the first time you guys are
hearing about this the company is asus
yes asus the legendary asus wants to get
involved in the ultimate gaming pc
project now in terms of context and and
what they're going to be contributing
that's still not a hundred percent
determined so I can't go into too much
detail there but their contributions
should help free up even more cash to
pump into even more outlandish gear to
completely kit out this ultimate gaming
PC so shoot a big thanks at Asus on
Twitter or something like that and as
you watch this thing progress you're
gonna see how their involvement evolves
and get and how they get involved in in
particular because I haven't given you
too much details right now but let's put
it this way they're gonna supercharge
this build big-time and this thing is
going to be even crazier than we first
expected so if you're not in on the
project yet like I said before jump over
to the IndieGoGo page there's going to
be a link in the annotation
as well as down in the description to to
make this thing as great as possible and
also to make sure you're involved in the
project because after all like I said
before I'm giving this thing away at the
end of it after it's all said and done
so much appreciated guys to those of you

pushing us over that five thousand
dollar goal once again it's a staggering
incredible number to the hundred
thousand plus subscribers that are now

r-dot 2.0 whatever it's called the the
the second AR Drone which I went out

really cool footage including using the
720p camera on the front of it the lower
facing camera I'm gonna give you guys an
unboxing and a review that's coming up
really soon on the channel I've also got
a cool set of headphones that you guys

of what those are so those are coming up
