for gadgets especially gadgets that can
solve problems you recently heard about
these Apple wireless ear pods they're
calling them ear pods these things that
are completely wireless earphones and
I've also been making videos about these
fully wireless earphones for a while and
truthfully the vast majority have sucked
I'm talking about things that go on each
ear independently and have no cable
connecting the two of them so when Apple
announced these air pods I immediately
had some apprehension regarding the
design regular ear pods don't really fit
in your ear that tightly to begin with
it got me to thinking and searching and
wondering what had been going on then I
stumbled on these guys right here from
Amazon just over 40 bucks but they have
good reviews and I was like wow could
these be a good inexpensive alternative
to not just those air pods but other
contenders in the fully wireless
earphone space ax geo - Wireless I'll
link them down in the description so you
don't need to remember that weird
product name travel case with the
earphones inside of their cable to
charge them up and then some
interchangeable ear tips so you can get
the right size also tiny little user
manual I'm going to leave that out for a
moment because man in the past I have
had some nightmare pairing experiences
and one thing you're going to notice
about these it's much different than the
air pods is they have an ear hook on
there so these guys are going nowhere
so for fitness these ones are going to
be a lot more reliable I would assume so
it's a charge port on each one the cable
is a single USB on one end but then two
micros on the other so it's a single
cable mini user manual may in for a
nightmare or not volume up and down the
middle button is called a multi-function
button there's also a microphone which I
almost missed so you can speak through
this in the event that you do get a
phone call choose one of the two
headphones randomly as a main headphone
press mfb for 2 to 3 seconds ok that's
this middle button here there we go so
when this guy flashes blue and red then
it's in pairing mode so you want to pair
one up and then move
to the other axe geo - okay cool paired
can I heard it say connected okay now
second headphone there's no need to go
into pairing mode it just has to be
powered on and then when you want to
power them off all you need to do is
power off one and the other one will
automatically power off as well if this
works that is light years better than
the last time your hook goes over the
top same thing on this side and that's
not that's not going anywhere with the
ear hook on there attempt to play some
music here these are way louder
my biggest complaint on that last pair
was volume the volume here is way better
how about that fully wireless you could
share give one to your friend give me a
second Jack I just need to hear a few
more give me a second are you try tell
me I'm too loud I'm gonna check the
range
these things are sick these are sick
like in a good way I mean to fit on
securely they so good for what what
you're paying lots of low and lots of
all you what can I say I would tell you
son I think these are gonna be out of
stock real quick because this is the
promise right here the fully wireless
earbud the fully wireless future we're a
step closer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
