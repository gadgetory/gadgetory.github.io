here and the reason for this video is to
address an issue that a lot of my
subscribers have been communicating to
me about and then I did a little bit of
Investigation I found out it's actually
more widespread than just my channel
basically a lot of subscribers are
having issues with new videos showing up
in their sub boxes basically YouTube has
acknowledged the problem they haven't
said why it's happening or how long it's
going to take to fix other than the fact
that they're trying to fix it but I
thought it was a perfect opportunity to
talk about the different social networks
that my content is available on so that
whatever you guys like to use whether it
be Facebook Twitter or even the new
Google+ you won't miss a video that way
and you can sort of guarantee yourself
that you'll stay up to date regardless
of these issues that constantly arise
via YouTube and their subscription
platform so I'm gonna get straight to it
I'm not going to waste very much here
time 3 places you can find me and a
place where I'll publish all of my
different videos Facebook facebook.com
slash unbox therapy Twitter twitter.com
slash unbox therapy and Google Plus
Google Plus does not have very pretty
URLs so I can is that me tell you what
it is but there is a link in the
description you can follow my public
profile there and as I mentioned before
every time a new video comes along it's
going to be published to those three
places so whichever one is most suitable
for you whichever one you use
then go and check it out and what if
it's Facebook that like my page if it's
Twitter just hit that follow button and
the same thing goes for circles on
Google+ so very simple very
straightforward for your benefit I hope
just because I've had so many messages
and so many emails about people not
getting my videos I thought rather than
respond to each individual one I'll just
do a little video explaining the problem
and a way to circumvent it even if it's
just temporary so one more thing I want
to talk about is I got more videos more
content coming up tonight I'm gonna get
in front of the camera or get the
products in front of the camera
should say and you know get some new
content for you guys you know that's
that's what you're looking for and I
also want to ask you guys a question
I've been thinking about the concept of
getting a capture card you know video
capture card for my consoles for ps3 and
xbox360 and maybe recording a little bit
of gameplay footage and possibly doing
game reviews so you know since you're
already watching so many unboxings of
special editions and epic editions and
so on and so forth of all these
different games I thought hey maybe
they'd like to see me do some reviews of
those games too so if you like that idea
then definitely click that like button
and leave a comment and let me know that
you want to see me do that and I'll
probably get it started off with Gears
of War 3 since I'm almost finished a
game and I really wouldn't mind giving
you guys my take on it so that's
something you're interested in then
definitely hit those buttons down below
anyway guys until next time until later
tonight I should say thanks for watching
and I'll see you around later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
