you guys could probably go what's up
guys Lew here back with another video
and today I've got something very
exciting to look at but before we get
into it I want to apologize a little bit
for my voice I know you're going to
comment saying Lew
you're sick you're under the weather why
are you here making videos it's because
I care I got to bring you the hottest
new stuff in this particular case some
new headphones showed up at the unbox
therapy studios bees are the odd Izzi
el8 and if you know anything about the
world of headphones and you know these
are very special from a very highly
regarded company the back of the box
lists some of the specifications
including the driver type single sided
plane are magnetic the driver size is a
hundred millimeters and the impedance is
30 ohms the box has this really nice
soft touch material making for a
pleasant unboxing experience and if
anyone would know that it would be me
then you lift up this flap here another
flap oh my goodness return of the flap
you have this box on the left hand side
let me open it up first before we talk
about the headphones these are very
beautiful linking I can tell you that
right away do not force connectors into
socket never force no need for force
these have very specialized connectors
and this could be a good thing or a bad
thing depending on where you stand but
it allows for a very low-profile cable
holy smokes look at this certificate of
authenticity inspected by and signed in
pen you do not see this very often these
days model open back serial number
inspected by Taylor something what's up
Taylor and the date of inspection as
well as a little thank-you from the
odyssey team that is legit that's
big-boy stuff right there welcome to the
major leagues you've also got a little
user manual with some really nice
illustrations actually look at that
design works this is actually a good
time to touch on one of the
collaborations for the design of these
headphones with BMW design works these
are the same guys who designed the BMW
i8 and here they are with a boutique
headphone manufacturer Odyssey this is a
really cool collaboration you've also
got
a carrying case here here are those
specialized cables that I mentioned with
this flat design on each end that's
what's going to plug into the actual ear
tops here you can see the cable is flat
and it terminates into a mini jack
connector but of course with the quarter
inch adapter for using with your
headphone amplifiers and various home AV
equipment time to get to the main course
now these are the lightest Odyssey
headphones ever produced the drivers are
gigantic these are an open back design
you're going to get a very wide
soundstage which is going to replicate
the experience possibly of live music or
a live performance some people are
really big fans of open back designs but
of course there are drawbacks as well
they're going to be more sound bleed
these wouldn't necessarily be as good to
use on public transit for example or on
an airplane but if you're an audiophile
that's really into at-home listening
then in my opinion open-back is the way
to go these are constructed of many
lucious material that's right I said
lucious but everything feels super high
quality from the padding on the ear cups
to the metal in the headband this wood
trim here with the grain and whatnot my
goodness so here you can see the
location for cable connection you just
want to make sure that you're using the
right side of the cable for the right
ear cup and so forth for the left-hand
side it really only fit in one way it's
not super complicated let's go ahead and
do the test fitting here whoa
okay so super comfy large ear cups all
the way around my ears should be the
same for most users that's something I
usually look for I can hear the ambient
sound the next important thing to do is
to go and listen to these damn things so
let's go do that
this'll work
brilliant beautiful awesome super
clarity the vocals and whatnot are very
upfront present there's a lot of
subjectivity of all people determining
whether they like the sound of one thing
versus another but in this particular
case very cool experience
Odyssey awesome more details down in the
description thank you very much for
watching if you enjoyed this content
make sure to leave a thumbs up down
below and I'll catch you on the next
episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
