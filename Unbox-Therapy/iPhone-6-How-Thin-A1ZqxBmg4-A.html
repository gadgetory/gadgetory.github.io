another video regarding the next
generation iPhone or the iPhone 6 or
maybe the iPhone err regardless of what
it's called I got my hands on this case
right here which may or may not be for
that next-gen device but based on some
of the leaks that are out there and some
of the component pictures and also just
general speculation on what Apple will
do with the next iPhone I'm led to
believe that this is something like what
the iPhone 6 is going to look like now
after a inspection of this case and
other devices etc the most striking
thing about the design of this case is
how thin it is it's incredibly thin it's
thinner than the current generation
iPhone and it is an external dimension
so the next gen I phone is gonna have to
fit inside of this case meaning it must
be even thinner so I was thinking to
myself maybe just maybe the internal
dimension is exactly the same as this
right here which is the current
generation iPod Touch I didn't own one
so I went out to the store and bought
one just for this comparison and I think
the results might be surprising so let's
go ahead and get this iPod Touch out of
the packaging and test it out inside of
what might be the iPhone 6 case so from
left to right we have the iPhone 5s in
the center is the current generation
iPod Touch and then on the far right we
have the purported iPhone 6 case now as
I said before the most striking aspect
of this case for me is just how thin it
is I understand of course the form
factor here is larger in height and
width to accommodate what we believe
will be a larger screen in the iPhone 6
but the thinness of this case as well as
the curved design reminded me a lot of
the iPod touch so when comparing the
iPhone 5s to the iPod Touch you'll
notice that the touch is not only
thinner significantly thinner it's also
curved in design as opposed to this flat
edge and the more squared-off design
that exists on the iPhone it's curved
it's thinner and on top of that you have
the newly designed volume buttons which
will remind you a lot of that case I was
talking about
it also features but
in this style here as opposed to the
older circular design that's found on
the iPhone 5s iPhone 5 and iPhone 4s and
iPhone 4 even going way back so there's
no doubt to me that this would make a
lot of sense for Apple to move in this
direction here
when it comes to volume buttons to match
up with the other products in its lineup
including the iPads so as mentioned this
case is obviously much larger than the
current iPod touch as we expect a screen
increase is the reason for that but
there's one dimension that we are here
to test and that is the thickness I
really want to know if it's possible for
the next generation iPhone to actually
be as thin as the iPod Touch which is
very very thin as I've shown you here so
let's go ahead and slide it into the
case here now obviously it doesn't fill
out the case because it's much smaller
in terms of screen size but something
very interesting here if you turn it
around you'll notice that the thickness
is exact it is exactly the same
thickness as the iPod Touch the case
that I'm talking about and on top of
that these volume buttons line up
exactly so they actually function you
can actually click through and use the
buttons assuming you've got it up tight
here but there you go the buttons
function you won't be able to hear that
click but they click through perfectly
and they line up perfectly and if you
peek through where the hold switch will
exist on an iPhone doesn't exist on an
iPod Touch but if you look through that
little hole you'll see that the
thickness is identical between the case
and the iPod touch so this may point in
the direction of a thinner iPhone 6 with
the new design so that the design
language across devices is a little bit
more consistent so anyways there you
have it guys we have I guess determined
to a certain extent that if this case is
legitimate it points at an iPhone with
the same thickness as the current
generation iPod Touch the moment that I
first held the iPod Touch I thought it
would be really cool as a phone just
because of how thin it was but on the
negative side a
birthing device generally means a small
battery so we may not be seeing gigantic
improvements in battery life with the
next generation iPhone if it does happen
to follow this particular design right
here anyway guys that wraps up this
quick video if you enjoyed it please
remember to leave a thumbs up down below
and if you're interested in more Apple
related leaks leading up to the launch
of the next iPhone or iPad this is the
place to be so make sure to subscribe if
you're not a subscriber yet once again
there they are the current gen iPod
touch the current gen iPhone and the
significantly thinner form factor that
exists on the iPod touch that could be
what the iPhone 6 looks like we will
have to wait and see and time will tell
alright later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
