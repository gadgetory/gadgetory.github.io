LastPass so here's one that I didn't
expect you know bouncing around the web
looking around looking for stories
trying to figure out what am i doing
today I'm gonna help you out you watch a
lot of YouTube you watch unbox therapy
you watch it on your smartphone but is
your smartphone the best way to watch
YouTube or is your smartphone the best
smartphone to watch YouTube what are you
talking about loo it's working really
well I hear you I see you what more do
you want from me here well here's the
thing not all smartphones are created
equal when it comes to interacting with
the YouTube app I didn't know this at
least not to the degree that YouTube is
now sharing they recently published a
list of devices that they're calling
signature devices in other words YouTube
themselves went out of their way to hand
select certain devices that are the best
at taking advantage of all YouTube's
features including but not limited to
HDR video immersive 360 video fast video
load time and less bandwidth usage so
better video higher bit rates higher
frame rates where available higher
resolution where available but then also
with less of a hit to your data usage
you can utilize less of it while still
getting the same quality through using
YouTube's more advanced video codecs vp9
profile to decoding this will give you
the same resolution with 30% less data
usage ok not all phones can do this now
part of me feels like when YouTube put
this list out they were also looking at
other attributes of devices the device
they have at the very top of their page
is this brand new device on the far
right that's the reason I have it out
the new note 9 nice AMOLED display 1440p
lots of resolution big battery
Snapdragon 845
according to YouTube themselves the best
phone to watch YouTube on is the new
Galaxy Note 9 but there are other
signature devices and I've got a couple
of them on the table here this is a 1
plus 6 it's also considered a signature
device by YouTube but in this case of
milliamp hour battery another thing
these also have in common is Android
Oreo 8.1 I've also got an S 9 plus over
here it's another signature device for
2019 and then on the far left here has
some bad news the iPhone is not on this
list not capable of taking full
advantage of all of these features it
may be able to do some of them without
checking every single box it can't be
selected as a signature device for
YouTube so YouTube actually physically
tested all of these they had to verify
that the device has met or exceeded
their performance expectations now one
thing that kind of bugs me about these
signature devices is audio they didn't
really talk about audio performance and
I know of course there's a huge variance
in in speaker quality across smartphones
every year YouTube publishes a set of
criteria required to achieve the
best-in-class video experience YouTube
has to offer they invite all qualified
device manufacturers to collaborate
directly with their team to pass
rigorous testing criteria let's go ahead
and see if we can spot a difference here
so I have a video here suggested by
YouTube on the signature device web page
4k HDR content at 60fps the iPhone is
capable of playing it back in HDR at 60
frames but at 1080p confusingly the
oneplus which is on the list
it also taps out at the same resolution
because it is a 1080p display not having
the iPhone on the list but having the
one plus 6 is a little bit strange
neither can possibly be the champ
because they tap out lower resolution
then the other two smartphones here the
s9 plus and the note 9 these ones on the
other hand go up to 1440p which
surprisingly you have to enable
entertainment mode so 1080p60 HD are on
the iphone we can switch the s9 plus two
1440p just like the note on the oneplus
device will do 1080p 60
one thing I can say is that all these
devices look great though I will
probably agree with YouTube themselves
if I had to pick one I would probably
select the note series just looking at
it just straight glance but they are
more similar than they are different
okay should we do audio now now I know
on the YouTube device report page they
don't mention anything about audio but
if I'm gonna say or suggest that one of
these smart phones is the best way to
watch YouTube or media in general then
the sound coming out of it is gonna be
big for me from my ears in this
particular scenario I'm gonna take the
the Samsung stuff I just find that
there's just a little bit more detail
there I like the little punch that's
coming out of the iPhone but there's
certainly more clarity on these two
devices you could even argue Jack was
trying to argue that the s9 plus may
have sounded a little better than the
note 9 it's possible I mean I know
YouTube themselves they didn't state
anything regarding audio but it'll be
hard to imagine they wouldn't take that
into consideration at all I'm definitely
taking it into consideration so I think
I'm gonna agree with them the YouTube
watching champion the media consumption
champion smartphone is in the middle
here that's this guy this is the note
the new note the note 9 it also has the
advantage of being the newest device
it's very expensive too when you stack
it up against something like the 1 plus
6 so not exactly a fair fight in that
sense you're spending more dollars here
but if you want the biggest baddest for
watching video you get a six point four
inch screen you can playback 1440p
content with the low data consumption
codec the latest stuff you can go check
out their entire device report and all
of these signature devices you can see
if your device is listed on there or not
there you have it you want to watch
video on a smart phone you want to watch
on box therapy in all of its glory 1440
key a couple inches from your eye
