another video and today I have something
for you which I think I hope is the most
advanced possibly the greatest car
charger for your devices car charger Lu
what's the big deal here a charge in my
car been doing it forever the drawback
in many cases is that those Chargers are
not powerful they're not fast not like
your wall chargers that's where this guy
comes in this is a smart car charger
it's called Zeus and it comes with an
app ensures that you don't misplace your
car this on the app has a tracking
device on top of that it has a parking
time alert if you're like me you tend to
forget you're having a good time you're
out to dinner you tend to forget that
that meter might have run out and now
you're getting parking tickets and one
single parking ticket and you're
basically paid for this thing think
about it jack
the app is available on iOS and Android
this is originally a crowdfunded device
charged to iPads at full speed that is
supposedly 2 times faster than your
average car charger this is the kind of
thing where you just take it everyday
device like a car charge has been around
forever and you just amp it up a little
bit you just improve it a tiny bit well
done on the simple packaging Lee I think
the way it's in there what do i do just
Oh serious packaging holy smokes they
said military-grade they meant it
military-grade stop yelling at me so it
powers up and it charges itself and the
battery necessary for the Bluetooth via
the port that it's inserted in a couple
of LEDs up at the top and then 2 USB
ports so two people can charge off this
beauty all right so I'm going to go plug
this baby into my vehicle outside come
on back with the app boot it up see if
we can lose my truck okay so this is
kind of cool I went outside plugged it
in left it there so it's in the the
little charge port right now grab the
location then I walk away and it tells
me exactly how far away I'm so you can
see the truck is in that direction
park right out from the office so that's
like 75 feet right now it'll lead me
back if I want to go there but the
coolest part for parking I select this
little icon here and I can say I paid
for 30 minutes an hour 3 hours or I can
set a custom time and then 10 minutes
before that time is up this app will say
to me even even running in the
background it'll say hey you're running
out of parking time head back and put
some more cash in the meter and I can
also add multiple Zeus's if I click this
little button on the bottom it'll show
me a map and I can either use this area
here just to like guide me manually like
that or I can use Google Maps to bring
me back to that location I'm not showing
you where that is at the moment because
we are currently in the Batcave so let's
do let's go ahead and set a little
parking timer here this could charge up
to iPhone 6s is in two hours whereas
most car charges would be three to four
hours oh there we go
we're running out yet nine minutes left
to go cars nearby okay so go and yeah
deal with your business put some more
money in the meter of course parking is
free here but anyway there you have it
the Zeus charger I don't know I think
it's the perfect gift for Father's Day I
think your father's gonna love you just
a little bit more like I said you skip
one parking ticket you paid for the damn
thing right you got to pony up the
dollars in the first place of course 30
bucks for a car charger but I think it's
worth it
it's a thumb from one of our videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
