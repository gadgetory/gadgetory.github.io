going to show you some earbuds that look
nothing like anything you've ever seen
before
they're from a company called Odyssey in
front of me I have the eye sign 10 and
they are plain are magnetic earbuds
which as far as I know this is like a
first right here there's a bigger
brother as well over in this box without
the retail packaging yet is the I sign
20 now these are just a little bit more
expensive 600 bucks
and new ones are 399 400 I believe so
it's a little step up both obviously
incredibly expensive he's saying an air
pod or an ear pod there's no pod in the
name at all now obviously that comes at
the expense of having a bigger headphone
but if you care about music you're
willing to make that sacrifice if you
really care if it hits you right in the
right word right in the loins the
concept here is that by using the
Lightning port the brand themselves
Odyssey can have their DAC inline you
can end up with a far more pleasing
sound in some cases than what the
traditional 3.5 millimeter connector can
provide now both of these come with
options so you can still use an analogue
connector if you don't have an iPhone
the mini jack is still there how are you
going to drive a substantial enough
signal to take advantage of the
headphones and that's what they're
aiming to do all of a sudden it's
euphoria 3,000 MW flux are in 50 magnets
super efficient for two times the
driving power the lowest distortion of
any headphone anywhere that's that
crunchiness that's that stuff that
wasn't meant to be there now these are
30 millimeter drivers as well and the
material here on this one is going to
cover even more of the diaphragm of the
earphone there are four separate patents
inside of this earphone
apparently they are handcrafted in
California which that can't be said for
many products these days so if that's
significant to you that is another thing
to think about nice little travel case
whoo Wow that's the actual earbud look
at that thing this certificate
guarantees the Odyssey product was
thoroughly tested and burned in and a
certificate of authenticity so two
separate cables here one using the light
connector and has an inline DAC in it
the more traditional mini-jack connector
no DAC built in a number of different
ways to fit these things on your ear now
obviously actually you know it's not as
heavy as I expected it to be ear hook
type scenarios to get it in there and
that's it and that'll fit into your ear
and it actually I know it looks big and
unusual right now but it's very secure
on there so a couple of little pins
there to the corresponding earbud you'll
see L and L represented there there's an
app for these so when using the
lightning cable you can tune your sound
you can see you have a various stage
equalizer here so even if the sound
attributes out of the box don't meet
your criteria you go in here and tinker
with this thing I'll start with some
mellow jazz this is it ton of juice
right away I can discern these things
are incredibly full from a clarity
perspective I was getting I was getting
tingly it's getting a little tingly
there which is always a good sign I'm
gonna switch to something more
electronic here oh whoa thick the
thickness you want to talk about a
tingle factory that's where I just was
alright
holy smokes it really has a vibe and a
feel a lot closer to an over ear
headphone it's the most and cleanest
bass I've ever heard on earbud the
craziest part here is that these are not
the most high-end version of this
particular design that's the twenty oh
my goodness I think I like them even
better it's like a copper kind of look
now the question is should you pony up
the extra 200 bucks and go all the way
to the 20s because you're already
spending 400 on your buds we're about to
find out
focus loo focus
these things are making me emotional
right now
it's a whole body thing right now
they're a little bit thicker I want to
jump into the EQ there's a kind of like
happiness associated with hearing music
you know in a in a super crystal-clear
kind of way like when it almost feels
like the veil has been lifted off of it
and like it's the way it was intended to
be heard you can kind of go in and
create a dynamic environment that's
perfect for you can make these even more
dynamic than they already are even
though out of the box they're going to
give you shivers all right you're going
to be chilled out different type of you
to be sitting there like I don't know if
you're ready for that 30 millimeter
drivers are terminating down to this
tiny little ear hole right now and I'm
sucking it all in today's a special day
