another video and today I'm gonna talk
about something I think is fairly unique
possibly limited edition you might know
that I was recently in New York for
something called the creator summit very
special event to do some summiting not
like a mountain a bunch of different
speakers and events and we talked about
YouTube and then more YouTube and Aziz
Ansari was there you know Aziz Ansari
this was in my hotel room as you can
probably tell it's a nest cam but it's
like a special edition big fan of the
nest cam I have a bunch of them here at
the office the limited edition YouTube
creator summit edition nest cam now I
just got to get it out of the box hmm
Wow look at that guy look at that
handsome face right there
Jack recognizer this guy here huh not at
all it's your boy all right cool so this
is redesigned so it used to be called
the drop cam then nest bot drop cam and
now it's the nest cam and they they
redid the mount so now it pivots in a
bunch of different directions so you can
get any angle you want you do 24/7 live
streaming simple time lapses night
vision on it 1080p HD up up to the cloud
whatever that means
warning for would-be perpetrators that
want to rob you put that on your door a
nice long USB cable circular power brick
right here and then this is the mounting
plate really cool a couple of screws
included you can see in there and then
this has a magnet on it it just kind of
magnetically attaches and so when
individuals are walking around your
premises they know what's up the idea of
sending it straight to the cloud
straight to server farm somewhere means
that it's already more redundant than a
local recording application open so I do
I have five setup right now this will be
number six so I can select any camera
here in the space and take a quick look
also I can go back in time see
action motion events so we've got them
set up all over the place here do this
and you can have fun with it by adding a
bunch to them setting them up is crazy
simple to integrate with your other
nests and stuff if you have the
thermostat and whatnot
I'm a fan of these things I use a bunch
of them check them out if you need a
little bit more security because you're
a grown-up now secure yourself look at
you your James Bond proof Jack wrong
use your thumb</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
