gotta have them triple cameras yeah my
phone it's interesting you know because
it's not that many triple camera devices
out there and when I saw the original
render image which you could switch to
the tab there when I saw that image
floating around I was like man it
doesn't look it just doesn't look like
it's gonna happen he doesn't have an
iPhone feel to it yeah at this point it
just doesn't feel Apple ish in its
current form considering it's been done
by other brands this is kind of a an
indication the Apple feels like they
want to target Huawei specifically cuz
they're the other player with the triple
camera setup it's like are we in a
situation now where where the devices
that have reigned supreme the champions
of the space are potentially taking
inspiration from the newcomers by adding
more lenses you know I've been reading
so much about this situation in China
with the iPhone doing poorly they feel
like at least on paper
those Huawei devices are offering more
features and options for the price do
you want to be able to say you have one
extra camera unit no do you want to say
I got three cameras you got two you got
one I'm better than you are you know
thinking about Google and their pixel
line they're going for one camera but
concentrating on software but there's
something about hardware that sends a
message of like we're changing we're
adding something that is hard to do
strictly via software where a person can
hold onto the thing and say oh this is
new this is different this is better
with the pixel devices you try to tell
people oh it's got a great camera and
they're like oh but it's a single lens
like I think there is this issue right
now of upgrading to new devices or not
upgrading to new devices because you
don't feel that all that much has
changed versus this kind of approach
which is like what will always been
doing like slap another camera on and
then people are going to look at the new
device and say oh I got it created it's
new I want you to know I have the newest
phone that's becoming harder and harder
for Apple to do if you look at a lot of
their previous versions
ten 10s we're at a stage now where it's
becoming harder to prove to people that
these new devices are worth upgrading to
you need a way physically for people
around you to know when you place it on
the table or hold it to your head that
it's newer better and you had the money
to buy it and there's only so much you
can do via hardware like what can change
right now we talked recently about like
bending screens that ain't ready yet
what can you do that's cheap that's an
immediate indicator that you've done
something new slap another camera on it
seems to have worked relatively well for
wall way now another thing that they're
mentioning in this report on the Wall
Street Journal they're talking
specifically about the iPhone 10 are not
necessarily matching Apple's expectation
for demand and also the potential that
Apple will drop the liquid retina LCD
that they talk so much about in the
keynote and in exchange just go for an
entirely OLED lineup maybe the savings
in going with LCD wasn't enough to
justify the shift in workflow or maybe
Apple has figured out that people want
all ads the speculation is that for
20/20 the LCD could go bye-bye okay now
I know there's gonna be a lot of people
out there that can be saying you don't
need three cameras like it's unnecessary
it's it's not the answer to apples
problems but I think people need to kind
of shift their perspective on why this
is important for Apple to do it may not
improve things very much for your actual
photo performance on your iPhone but it
does indicate that Apple is taking a
major stand in markets like China where
the Huawei products p20 Pro may 20 Pro
have become sort of the aspirational
products they have been successful at
establishing themselves as sort of the
top of the food chain and then they've
gone and added features like this to
kind of enhance that positioning by
Apple adding that extra camera unit it
kind of indicates that Huawei is their
target and if Huawei's their target than
it means China's their target and
they're looking for a solution to their
China problem which has been
hovered I mean in so many places we've
talked about it I don't know if this is
going to be enough because I think the
problems you know the the macroeconomic
problems of what's going on in China
specifically with Apple I mean it's like
there are layers and levels of
complexity here but this looks like a
move to go directly at Huawei to say hey
we have a third camera unit as well
seems like apples copying Huawei some
people are gonna say that people are
gonna say that in the comments keep in
mind this is just a report this is not
official do you think that Samsung will
follow suit as well it really is
starting to feel like if one player does
something they're all gonna have to do
it especially when software you know you
just have Android you have iOS there's
no in-between and this is another way of
a brand saying hey you have a new device
and everyone's going to notice it
because look at all these cameras on the
back that said it's hard to implement a
bunch of cameras while maintaining
decent aesthetics you tell me does this
something look a little off about that
implementation yeah definitely I think
there's no Apple feel to it
maybe there's another implementation
that looks better than this but there's
something about the iPhone design the
way that we've known it that doesn't
really lend itself to this type of
implementation right here we'll have to
see how it shakes out I don't think this
is the answer I think Apple has to play
in the price territory they have to do
some real work with that 10r that
they've created to create something
compelling for less the savior is paying
more attention to emerging markets with
products that make sense for those
markets cheaper iPhones is really what
matters right now but this is not the
solution to the problems they're having</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
