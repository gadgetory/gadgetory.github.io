you know folding phones they've been all
the rage talked about it a lot here on
the channel but it turns out the folding
phone of the future may not be something
that you're already aware of instead it
may be a device and a brand name
synonymous with folding or flipping
should I say of course that is the
Motorola RAZR believe it or not Motorola
they're not done they apparently are
working on their very own play in a
folding phone marketplace in the form of
the Motorola RAZR 2019 this is a totally
different take from what the other
manufacturers are doing it looks like
what they're gonna do is have a device
that folds out into a smartphone form
factor and then folds up into an ultra
compact flip phone like form factor so
what does that do for you well it gives
you a smaller package to begin with by
not having to fit a typical smartphone
display on the outside of the device but
it also gives you less weirdness when it
comes to software and folding you know
the same interface from a small display
on to a bigger one and then how all
that's going to map out within Android
instead this will be a kind of dumb
phone possibly something you interact
with via voice something like Google
assistant in its folded format then when
you fold it open it sort of takes the
shape of a typical smartphone now if
you're unfamiliar with the Motorola RAZR
you're probably pretty young because
this thing was a hit once upon a time so
because of that there may be some clout
associated with the Motorola RAZR brand
name now another interesting point to
make here is that Motorola isn't aiming
this thing at like the premium hardcore
high-horsepower type of smartphone
market it's actually rumored that
they're gonna put a Snapdragon 710 on
the inside so not a flagship chip by any
means fold it out it's supposed to be a
6.2 inch display not particularly high
resolution possibly only four gigs of
ram although only on a device like this
that may be fine also considering that
the compact nature of the device is one
of the main selling features the
batterer
likely won't be large either just over
2,700 milliamp hours speculation right
now is that this next-generation
foldable razor could cost around $1,500
so still not cheap by any means but
definitely less than the other two
products is there a market for a stylish
compact device that could fit more
easily into your pocket in exchange for
possibly some functionality especially
when closed could people move back
towards an older form factor after all
the folded up version of this looks like
it could be very compact are people
ready for style phones again because
once upon a time the battle was actually
for the smallest devices not the biggest
ones there's a rumor that the outside
display could act as a touch pad when
you have it opened up so you could
possibly scroll with it or experience
some other functionality via the
external display of course this is all
speculation at the moment but it does
look like this as a product that will
happen and I think it's an important
play for Motorola especially at this
stage right now they were the major
player once upon a time when flip phones
were ubiquitous not so much anymore in
the smartphone era but maybe a device
like this could reclaim some of the
popularity that Motorola has experienced
in the past we just have to find out if
customers consumers are interested in a
style oriented crazy compact
ultra portable smartphone are you more
likely to pick up something like this
than the other foldable options for
myself I'm not sure that the
functionality drawbacks would be worth
the portability gains but that said I
could see a particular customer who may
go for that nonetheless this could be a
disruptor in the smartphone space after
all it represents a completely new form
factor that's different than what the
other manufacturers are looking at for
folding devices it's very futuristic you
have to admit that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
