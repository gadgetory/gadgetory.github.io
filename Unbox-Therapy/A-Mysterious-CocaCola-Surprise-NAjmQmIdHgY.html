here every time I come here and I tell
you guys this stuff just shows up I
think it might be the last time I say
that but of course it isn't
this is unbox therapy boxes are never
going to stock syllabus that says
coca-cola on it I don't know about you
but I have a few ideas of what might be
inside here did I order this no and who
doesn't want a soda machine but then I'm
thinking like is it like a fridge
is it some kind of use what is it who
has their own soda machine I'm not
really sure but this brand right here
that got me excited on his home am i
pouring my own fresh coca-cola like that
what's happening in the studio now
because if so guys like Jackyl never
leave Tom forget it does that guy look
like he's left anytime soon I feel like
it's Christmas morning because you know
how when there's two boxes connected to
one another like maybe it's one of like
some sort of combo chip I mean in case
you didn't realize either look how
fragile it is full boy oh boy
Oh
official coca-cola brand product
American retro LLC is this what it
wouldn't look like once upon Tyne it's
like an old-school retro fridge do you
plug it in like what's happening then
this thing goes on the outside here and
it catches the bottle cap and then the
power cable this guy goes out here all
right let's check the other box Oh
whoa it's unblocked therapy coke I never
thought I'd see the day I only feel like
I could drink this
looks like there's one more thing in
here the custom unbox therapy coca-cola
we've got some coca-cola glasses Oh
check it out the opener as well because
you got to do it classy when you're
doing the classic welcome to your new
home and best wishes for 2017 from your
friends at the coca-cola company never
thought I'd see the day unbox therapy
coca-cola it's official
the classic with your boy the classic
I'm not sure why they pick that
expression right there I mean you can
tell I've seen better days I did a
little bit of reading from the note that
was inside of here this thing is a
replica of what these machines would
have looked like in the 1930s and 40s if
you walk into a store to buy a coca-cola
a small convenience stores I mean this
is where you would have been buying your
coke from just like that now they made
two versions one is that you would put
ice into so it wouldn't have any kind of
extra options to keep it cool with just
the ice inside of here and then
insulation and they made another version
that would actually circulate ice water
underneath of it now this one is
modernized so it plugs in there's a
refrigeration unit on the bottom and
even mention how these screws in the top
of the liner we're part of the original
so they went the extra mile and putting
those in as well so it's like this is
like a piece of history inside the
studio now side I appreciate that I
think it's a cool gift for the new
studio you never mind the added touch of
the unbox therapy limited edition
coca-cola classic itself so that's me
smells like regular coca-cola
mm the real deal I promise you that is
actual coca-cola with my face on it is
so bizarre I never thought I'd see the
day
Jack never thought he'd see the day
maybe next time is gonna be Jack's face
or just be a face with a question mark</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
