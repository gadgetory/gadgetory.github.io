smartphones and it's kind of my job it's
kind of what I have to do here on the
channel I got a tryout as much stuff as
possible which smartphones are worth
your time your money the last time I
switched it was to a not very current
device or at least not a recently
released device I switched back over to
the Galaxy Note 9 I got some feedback
from people I got a few messages that
there was a problem with the camera unit
on the note 9 so I wanted to go
investigating I thought what better way
than just inserting my SIM card to see
if I could encounter the problem that
people were describing to me I did not
have that issue I've used this camera
unit now for God it's probably been like
a month I have not encountered that
issue
not even once in fact I should just tell
you before I get on with switching to
the next device the my experience with
the note 9 was great I even started to
use the pen a little bit this little guy
right here in the past I wasn't you know
I wasn't too pumped up about it's kind
of like a I don't know this time around
I really wanted to make an effort to use
it in certain circumstances and I
actually enjoyed it the battery life on
a device was awesome I utilized the
wireless charging all the time the
camera a great performer a fine
performer I started use Samsung pay a
little bit it can simulate the the
magstripe so you can tap it even on
machines where vendors are like that's
not gonna work and you're like yes it is
even used the headphone jack at a couple
of different occasions it's a worthy
flagship device course still has the
dedicated Bigsby button and Bigsby
launching just randomly sometimes you
know that's not something I want as you
can see I have configured the entire
interface here through Nova Launcher but
I can't sit on this phone forever
I need to experiment with the other
stuff that's out there and somehow
someway the one device that slipped
through the cracks because of these
extended scenarios in which I've been
using other devices is this one right
here this is the latest one Plus which I
just grabbed cracked it out of the
package this of course is the special
mclaren version with the crazy fast
recharge but it does come at a cost I'm
giving up wireless charging come on one
plus let's do it let's just throw it in
if you look at the back you can see
subtle carbon-fiber look underneath the
glass back and then of course the orange
accent around the bottom I figured if I
was gonna switch to the 1 plus 60 why
not just do the McLaren version since I
had it the thing about these devices is
that the software is modified by the
vendor of course one plus but generally
in a manner which is more acceptable to
me to my taste buds the modifications
that they make typically improve my user
experience instead of detracting from it
and that's a rarity in the smartphone
space generally speaking I just want
stock Android like you would get on the
pixel devices but if I can't have that
this one here what oneplus is doing is
kind of my next choice of course I'm
always curious about the camera unit
this model does not have a fingerprint
scanner on the back so it'll be faced on
lock or the front fingerprint scanner
under the display that'll be a bit of an
adjustment also very quick face unlock
previously not the most secure in the
industry but rapid very quick so maybe
I'll go back to using that a little bit
or at least testing it out
is this still considered a budget device
I guess it depends on where you're
located this is the more expensive
special edition oneplus has been
incredibly popular in certain markets
like India I want to see how this thing
stacks up immediately after having used
one of the more expensive devices in the
world of course this guy right here
Willy do found the note 9 for 800 bucks
on Amazon unlocked and what about a
regular 65 49 ok so so a fairly
substantial difference it is time for
the experiment to begin 1 okay there it
is it's official you see that Jack the
SIM cards in there what do you think if
you could switch to any smart phone
right now which one would it be and why
leave a comment down below I'm curious
of course the switches don't stop here
I'm gonna use this one for a bit and
we'll see what's next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
