of things here today I got something I
really I have no idea what it is all
right it's from Mophie so I'm assuming
there's a battery type of conversation
we're about to have about all the cool
batteries for your various gadgets check
out the artwork here is dude in the
middle he's obviously the savior
everyone needs a little bit of juice
from the man
this doesn't look like something you
could buy in a store I think Mophie went
to the next level here like this is made
out of some it's a series box it's heavy
whoa it looks to me like we are working
with the latest in battery pack solution
so this is called the power station it's
got that rose gold you can see here a
couple of USBs a USB in for charging it
up battery indicator on the side very
slim what's this guy over here the
charge for power station that's a bigger
boy now this one is 10,000 milliamp
hours this guy over here is 6040
next up ooh this one has a nice little
curve to it and one of my favorite
things ever built-in cable oh let's take
it a step further what micro USB and
lightning Jack picked that up this is
important this is what should have been
done a long time ago all right these are
some of my favorite packs the ones that
have the cables built-in line up your
phone alongside pull the cable out put
it in like that and then just have them
both in your pocket charging at the same
time ooh this is like Christmas here
power station USB see so they took the
words right out of my mouth there so if
you're on oh I don't know any of the
number of USB C devices that are out
there maybe you're on one of these new
MacBooks you get the idea all right okay
so those are the new packs but look at
this Christmas is not over yet
I almost missed that Jack pick that up
number four out of ten this is super
limited right here whoa
holy moly
just when you thought they were done so
this goes over the product line a little
bit
or over here we're looking at 20,000
milliamp hours in a space grey that's
going to match a Space Gray iPhone or
iPad now there's two separate outputs on
here one amp 2.1 amps
I just realized okay this one the charge
force power station this is actually oh
now this I'm going to use this is
actually a wireless charger as well so
it's a battery backup but also a
wireless charger
you've got your wireless charger that's
always with you but then you've got the
extra juice that's already in it as well
that is a slim version of this guy it's
again it's that Universal adaptable
cable micro USB or lightning if you're
all about portability I mean that is
smaller than your phone so that's power
station mini again no cable but super
slim so this one comes in this blue pink
there's a purple white and black so this
one here ah okay so I'm starting to get
it now this is part of the plus series
like this alright so two smaller sizes
then the big boy with the cable built-in
those are the different series now okay
hahaha they hit me with the cables too
look lots of little short ones I get way
too excited about short cables little
short micro USB cables couple of USB C
cables but there you have it let me know
in the comments which is your favorite
is it all about wireless charging for
you is it about having the built-in
cable do you need a big one do you want
a small one it looks to me like they've
really expanded their product line here
I'm gonna go with the wireless cuz I've
been using an s7 you guys might not know
this but I've been using an s7 with the
juice pack on it okay on this device
here it's giving me twice as much
battery life I carry this with me and
I'm on some kind of ironman level boom
boom wireless charging on the backup
battery be the juice man your gadgets
depend on it so does your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
