brought to you by Hulu Plus for an
extended free trial head over to Hulu
Plus comm slash unbox what's up guys Lew
here back with another unboxing video
and today we have something interesting
to look at this is the drone controller
from evolution controllers it was
originally a Kickstarter project and it
now exists in the real world as you can
see it works with either your tablet or
smartphone to bring some tactile
controls to your favorite games it is a
physical controller it comes in a couple
of different colors even though we're
looking at the glossy black version
right here also inside the box is a
little bit of paperwork or a card I
don't know what you want to call it but
it gives you the directions on how to
operate the controller power on pair and
power off it uses bluetooth so it's
actually pretty simple to pair with your
device then the back here just a little
safety notice they've also included a
microfiber bag here which is kind of
nice
since the controller itself is pretty
fingerprint prone also inside the box we
have a standard micro USB cable that's
because the drone controller uses micro
USB to charge which is nice nothing
proprietary if you lose that cable you
can always grab some other micro USB
cable and you will be operational so on
the front you'll notice two separate
analog sticks these kind of float a
little bit on the surface there now
you've also got a d-pad which is clicky
a select button a start button X a B and
Y there are some shoulder buttons on the
top and then on the back you've got two
triggers right trigger left trigger in
kind of an unusual location but fairly
easy to reach obviously the controller
is meant to be portable so it's smaller
than what you would get out of an Xbox
360 Xbox one PlayStation 3 PlayStation 4
type controller to encourage taking it
with you for it to being more portable
than a full sized controller so let's go
ahead and pair this thing up to my Nexus
7
over here so pairing up the device is
actually quite simple to do you're just
gonna want to go into your Bluetooth
settings and look for the device here
you can see we've got the drone I've got
to connect it already or you can see
there it says that it's connected so for
compatibility reasons there's a few
different modes to choose from you can
also use this controller with your PC so
there's a mode for that as well
operation is basically what you'd expect
just like a games console you're going
to use your controller to interface with
your player and depending on how good
you are how much practice you've had
you'll have varying results but it's
nice for racing games because usually
you kind of have to tap the joystick or
d-pad just to make little minut
movements and maybe not such gigantic
ones that you might get out of a
gyroscope accelerometer based game or
even an on-screen d-pad that's a little
tougher to deal with I suppose the other
benefit here is that you can place the
tablet down in one static position or if
you have a case or a dock that puts a
good angle on it then you can just sort
of stick it in one place and then use
the controller to interact with your
game only one star guys that's pretty
depressing of course there are competing
products on the market so more and more
games are starting to offer a Bluetooth
controller based interface so you don't
have to use that touchscreen so if you
don't have a games console or you want
to play games on the go you know
portably this is a really interesting
way to achieve that because you get a
nice big screen that you already have on
your tablet or using the horsepower
that's already built into your tablet or
smartphone one thing I will say is there
is a particular competing product that
has a clip on it for your smartphone
which might be an interesting addition
for individuals who want to have an
all-in-one solution as opposed to having
two separate devices but if you have a
case for example the Nexus 7 case that I
don't have on here but the official case
you can actually prop up your device in
such a way that it doesn't really matter
and I think that the experience of
playing
on a tablet is a little bit better than
a phone obviously so I don't know it's a
toss-up depending on which one is better
or worse for you you'll have to try that
out and see if you're interested in
pricing and availability on the drone
controller from evolution controllers
make sure to check out the description
where I will put a link but an
interesting product nonetheless it works
as advertised you will have varying
degrees of success depending on the game
that you're trying to use it for but as
I said think about racing games
first-person shooters anywhere where you
want a little bit more tactile control
and you can sort of envision a
controller interface it's likely
supported it will work on Android it'll
work on PC to work on Mac it'll work to
a limited degree on iOS with iCade
titles as I understand it so you know
that's going to be hit and miss alright
