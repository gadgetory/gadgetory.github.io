friendly this guy is now I know a lot of
you are Android fanatics out there so
today I'm showing you some love with the
pal bot help you show your Android pride
he's also a speaker look at this guy

switch to awake turn my volume up plug
me in and I'll be happy to show you what
I can do when I'm charging my eyes will
be purple and when I'm fully charged
they will turn to blue feel free to move
my arms around it's fun for both of us I
only do this whatever floats your boat
in the privacy of your own home I'm very
happy to meet a new friend
that's us Jack let's turn them on are
you there brother
a little dangler or he's plugged-in look
can you see the blue eyes now he's happy
he's plugged-in it's a retractable mini
Jack what do you think about the mini
Jack Jack it'll lock in a particular
place and then kaboom Oh chill out
many favorite right
he gets friendly with a with the hand
right shot do you think about it
give it some thought
for your old pal
look at that face could you love a face
like that Jack not blowing you away
volume on is it a gimmick yes of course
it's a gimmick it's a little tiny green
Android but it does have a speaker
built-in so it's a mascot that you can
put somewhere for 15 bucks that actually
does something I mean even if just eyes
glowed truthfully if you get this it's
for the novelty with the glowing eyes
and the arms that move next up this
little guy right here USB - a USB type-c
card reader that little diagram kind of
shows you what's going on this thing is
$6.99 $6.99 and it's kind of interesting
it takes a micro SD card or a full size
SD card like this one which slides in
there like that it will then be
accessible via USB type-c traditional
USB and then with the little flick of a
fingernail there you have micro USB so
that is going to work for OTG capable
devices a galaxy s7 for example kaboom
and then SD card into here move those
files over to my device or just watch
them off of there do whatever you want
it can interface with almost any device
because of the connectivity and it's
tiny
super portable and seven bucks that's
what I'm doing I'm bringing the utility
to you here expand your storage or just
move files around you know what I'm
saying last but not least this one looks
like fun or possibly incredibly
frustrating one of those little ball
maze games on the back of your phone so
you can play it all the time navigate
the ball through the maze it just slides
in it's a soft style case kaboom pretty
straightforward stuff this one is to
drive yourself and your friends crazy
trying to get this little ball from the
start point to the end point oh my
goodness - just give it enough juice
okay we're on our way I kind of cheated
because it wasn't at the start point but
kaboom now I'm going to try to get back
to start now
back that way or come on bud we don't
want to be in there
okay the frustration is beginning yes
yes oh you know how this goes
it's like that flappy bird syndrome you
remember that game ha ha ha you're
sitting around you're sick of social
media you're sick of seeing photos on
Instagram of God knows what you turn it
around you do a little brain teaser here
you try to stay active you try to keep
the brain ticking you do a little puzzle
all right and you drive your friends
crazy here you go bet your five bucks
that you can't get from start to finish
in three minutes am i recommending that
they hustle their friends it sounds like
it all right well that's what I used to
do we used to play Monopoly for real
money that's not a lot that is the end
