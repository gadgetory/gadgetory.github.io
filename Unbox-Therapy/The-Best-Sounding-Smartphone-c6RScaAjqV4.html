another video and today it's a bit of an
unusual one as you can tell I have all
the different flagship devices in front
of me or at least many of them look at
the LG g4 the galaxy s6 and iPhone 6
plus as well as an HTC One m9 then on
the Left I have a new device which I
haven't even unboxed yet this is from a
company called ZTE who are new players
in the smartphone space at least here in
North America and at this price point
and this is the axon which is targeted
at individuals looking for a high
fidelity sound when you think about
sound sometimes you think about the
speakers on the phone like you would
with the HTC stereo sound believe it or
not more often you should be concerned
with the sound output from the headphone
jack because usually that's how you
listen to your phone now in the case of
the axon you have supposedly improved
audio characteristics with a higher
quality built-in DAC that is your
digital to analog converter which will
take bits and bytes associated with an
audio file whether that's an mp3 or an
uncompressed audio file and then turns
it into something that you can hear so
the purpose of this video is to take
this supposedly hi-5 phone playback the
exact same song on this device as well
as these other flagships and figure out
if I can tell the difference
now ZTE is touting 32-bit playback but
whether or not that is an actual
impactful thing is up for discussion the
more interesting thing here is the
amplification and the avoidance of
distortion that can come from
low-quality Dax not that the ones in
your average flagship are bad it's just
that there are better ones out there
nonetheless let's jump inside the box
and take a closer look at what might be
the best sounding smartphone currently
on the market the ZTE axon you see it
has dual cameras on the back one of
these is going to be used for the
background color you could take two
shots and get the perception of a
greater depth of field also to Flash's
their footprint wise is almost identical
to the iPhone
six plus you've also got a dedicated
shutter button power switch in this
location over here volume rocker on this
side and a SIM card tray now the other
exciting part about this phone is the
headphones it ships with they're from
JBL they sit a little bit further in
your ear canal we have small medium and
large and a flat style cable I'm gonna
go ahead and get this set up and we will
begin the audio test to determine which
is the best sounding smart phone alright
so I'm back I have all the different
phones set up with the same music same
song and same service it's Google Play
Music across the board can the ZTE axon
improve the listening experience for
normal people who aren't gonna go out
and download a bunch of gigantic FLAC
files so let's get this started
okay I'm gonna really quickly move over
to the next device this is the galaxy s6
okay immediate feedback s6 temple sounds
better than the LG g4 for me it's a
little bit crispier somewhere in the
mids and the highs the the vocals just
pop out a little bit more iPhone
six-plus very similar sound from the six
plus to the s6 right away I know notice
more emphasis on the low end here on the
HTC if there's certainly more punch in
the low end here but really what this is
all about is this new ZTE product over
here on the left and this is the one
claiming to have this
HiFi capability a little bit nervous
right now oh wow
so my ears this thing sounds better it
doesn't feel like this have any emphasis
on the low end especially coming from
the HTC One m9 anything it's like it's a
kind of Chris penis at the top and more
detail in general the thing I want to do
since these headphones these JBL shipped
with the ZTE I want to try something of
my own so I have those SRH 440s
these are a relatively flat over the ear
style headphone hang on one second
I'm gonna go back to the iPhone real
quick no nope no way this does not sound
as good as that phone whatever they're
doing on that device from a hardware and
software standpoint Wow I'm gonna I'm
gonna have to do more testing with it
but this was the thing that caught my
attention immediately when stacked up
against these much more expensive
competitors now they're more expensive
for various other reasons but if music
is your jam but I mean music is
everybody's jam but you know what I'm
saying if you're an aficionado you might
want to do a little more research and if
you can even listen to this axon from
Zee TV very cool all right thanks very
much for watching guys if you enjoyed
