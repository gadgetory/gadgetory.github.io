these ones have something do something
that I've never seen before and that's
saying something because I've probably
made more videos about headphones than
any other type of gadget I probably made
50 or that's actually an interesting
trivia question right there
how many headphone videos have been
featured on unbox therapy these ones do
something different and they're from a
new company in an emerging company what
are they called Ashdown engineering
these are called meters headphones let's
crack this open and find out what makes
these headphones unique and whether or
not they are your next high-end
headphone a little bit of paperwork here
you see a nice image deep dynamic
articulate tone full these are just a
few of the words that describe the old
v1 that's the name of this particular
model they feature active noise
cancellation that guy is like a
punk-rock version of me System of a Down
seat do you see this Jack that it
follows a little more hardcore that's
what I would be alright system of it
down Jack's a fan okay good
you can see it's got this traditional
meter that's like old-school music
equipment used to have that there we go
forty millimeter dome and see driver
82.2% reduction active noise
cancellation 1.2 meter cable there is
the classic vu meter some stickers
manuals and the headphones are here yes
sir that is a nice cable right angle
connector gold-plated this is the same
cable with the addition the third point
of contact there now this one is going
to have an inline microphone for your
phone this is the better table to use
micro USB to keep them charged up
quarter inch adapter to go from mini
jack a quarter inch kaboom
next up we have boom there they are you
see this wobbly little needle in there
this meter I assume that this is going
to react in real time to the music
that's being fed into here these are
made out of metal you can see the way
that the ear cup pivots so even if you
have a weird-shaped head and the ear
cups or woo those are supple Jack you
ever used the word supple you touch
something like this and you will micro
USB to charge these up because they are
active noise-cancelling this guy just
goes up in here like so oh my goodness
gracious these are like ear muffs like I
very isolating from noise like this is
you know the stuff that drummers where
you're a drummer Jack you know
oh look at that just like the old school
music studio Jack are you seeing that
how cool is that
ooh you hear any bleed right now you
hear nothing max volume right now you
hear nothing wow it's like another
universe in there these are some of the
most sealed headphones that I've ever
listened to even at full blast volume
Jack can barely hear the vu meter just
jumping around all pretty and whatnot
like you're gonna you're gonna get some
attention with these obviously this
isn't just just not something you see
frequently I think I kind of prefer the
EQ setting on there how about mellow
jazz hmm here's the thing to consider
okay you've got headphones out there
wide variety headphones
certain ones attempt to give you a flat
or close the flat frequency response so
you have like this accurate listening
and then other headphones are more
targeted at giving you a dynamic
experience these ones are in that
category even this mellow jazz it's like
the low end is it's in there it's deep
it's in the loins as Jack likes to say
where he feels most things according to
Tom Tom remember this Oh family-oriented
advertiser friendly Tom's in a mood
today you want to cheer him up the only
response to one thing and it's thumbs
he's looking for your thumb love how
many thumbs you need Tom Tom almost had
a hundred thousand the other day when I
asked on his behalf but he getting hit
it
it's very depressed he's in a bit of a
mood he is ultimately that's what
matters to Tom the love of others you're
taking it back to the old school cuz
you're an old fool who's so cool if you
want to get down let me show you the way
let me hear you say</div></body></html>
