recap of the Apple event that just took
place regarding the iPhone 5s 5c and iOS
7 I'm gonna try and break down what
happened for you as quick as humanly
possible okay one we have iOS 7 becoming
available on the 18th of September so
that's two days before the launch of the
actual devices the iPhone 5s and 5c so
if you've got an older device you can
expect that update to roll out on the
18th of September the iPhone 5c which
stands for color not China as some
people had rumored is going to be
available for a slightly discounted rate
from the 5s though the internals will be
from the iPhone 5 so performance wise
you're going to be getting what you
would already be getting in the iPhone 5
the 5c plastic and colorful will be
available on the 20th of September $99
for the 16 gigabyte and $1.99 for the 32
gigabyte but that of course is on a
two-year contract term those prices get
elevated significantly when you want to
buy the devices outright I'll put a link
in the description to the most current
pricing and availability on those
different options the iPhone 5s probably
the most compelling feature is this
fingerprint scanner sensor on the front
of the device which takes the place of
the old home button which is going to
allow you to unlock the device
incredibly quickly and securely this was
rumored so everyone pretty much knew
about it but now we got to see it and it
it actually looks pretty elegant it
doesn't look too terrible you're also
going to get an improved camera the new
camera has AF 2.2 lens letting in more
light it also has a slightly bigger
image sensor but many of the features
are actually software based so you're
going to have the ability to do some
metering where it will take multiple
photos up to ten frames in one second
and then it will automatically you know
pick out the best image in the bunch or
you can look through and pick out the
best image depending on what you're
looking for there's also an improved
flash it's actually a dual flash now
each of those two flashes has a
different color temperature that it
outputs in terms of light traditionally
in flash photography
you have trouble matching the flash fill
light with that of the room that the
surrounding color temperature these two
flashes will mix to try and match the
color temperature of the of your room so
that flashes look less harsh and you'll
get something closer to a representation
of what the light already looks like in
that particular environment the gold
iPhone 5s is a real thing again it was
leaked in so many videos but it will be
a real thing the other two colors are a
slate and a silver so no more standard
white and black iPhone 5 it will launch
in a number of countries on the 20th and
then it will follow through on a bunch
more about a hundred more countries
before the end of the year or by the end
of the year the first 25 countries will
be listed down in the description so you
can check out if it's available to you
in your geographic region hopefully your
country gets the launch right away and
if not hopefully before the end of the
year we also got to see the announcement
of Infinity Blade 3 for iOS which takes
advantage of some of the new graphics
features within the a7 chip so there is
a new processor in this device said to
be 40% faster than the previous
generation with some improved graphics
performance as well lastly the iPhone 5
has been discontinued and before us will
remain on as an option it will be free
in the 8 gigabyte variation on a number
of carriers once again with that
two-year commitment anyway guys that
wraps up this recap nothing too
surprising here in this particular
presentation it seems that everything
leaked out beforehand but at least we've
got some official stuff now I suppose
some of the camera information wasn't
necessarily out in full detail
beforehand that's probably the most
exciting part for me is the new camera
software which looks much improved over
the simple interface from previous
generation iPhones and also possibly
this fingerprint sensor which can
hopefully save us some time unlocking
our devices which we tend to do a lot on
a daily basis if you're not a subscriber
yet you might want to click that button
right now because the iPhone 5s / 5c
coverage will be continuing this month
so if you're interested in tests on any
of these new features then
sure to subscribe thanks as always for
watching guys and I'll catch you on the
next episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
