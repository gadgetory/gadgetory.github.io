miniature drone it was orange it was a
lot like this one at the time they were
calling it the world's smallest drone
today I've got the new world's smallest
drone CX stars you can see it's 14 + you
know there's moving parts propellers
don't slice your eyeball it is available
in a couple different colors a big drone
is pretty smart you know what the
sensors and whatnot but these guys here
this is a good way to train because if
you crash this little thing well what's
the consequence really yeah I'm gonna
take out a power line ruin a family's
barbecue if you know what I'm saying
look you can see a reflection of Jack
there oh that is tiny this little thing
fits inside gives you a place to store
it so that these two components aren't
left apart but when you want to charge
this up
you're looking at this little USB
connector holy that's tiny got a couple
of analog thumb sticks here oh yeah also
drone people are freaking out in the
comments right now going start a drone
it's not a drone Lou okay fine yeah cool
it's a quadcopter all right fine the
world seems to refer to anything with
four rotors as a drone alright so let's
just chill out with our terminology here
drone sounds a million times better
all right there's my rant on drums and
droning and you don't want to run it
into your TV can you see that Jack
that's not what you want to do unless
you're one of these destruction people
and that somehow gets you off okay so
that has juice look blinking juice this
guy does not because this guy requires
triple A's Duracell you're not
sponsoring me yet it's a gadget channel
when it makes sense listen you guys need
the market share everything's
rechargeable these days this is your big
opportunity Duracell whoa did Duracell
just get a bunny as well that was an
energizer thing did they rip off the
bunny they got their own weird-looking
bunny the Energizer Bunny and Elmo had a
child
you got the Duracell bunny this surgeon
is using a flashlight inside the
flashlight are batteries from ders
ding-ding-ding got some juice here whoa
boy
easy boy oh yes
come on hover whoa ah I never table yeah
okay
no oh that lens
I was not intentional gonna be a shot of
decade over there come on you can do
this find that hover zone there you go
Hey
then go on a trip he's gonna come back
home I did a lamb I even did it what can
I say look how cute that is how can you
not like that you have no experience at
all with quadcopters you get one of
these little things I don't even know
how much it cost I'll put the link in
the description but it's like 30 bucks
something in that neighborhood and all
of a sudden you're flying know what I
mean take a look at it I think you're
not gonna regret it it's a lot of fun
these things are fun that's the bottom
