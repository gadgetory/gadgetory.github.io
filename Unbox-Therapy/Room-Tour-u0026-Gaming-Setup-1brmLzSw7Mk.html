reason I'm making this video is because
I want to address a question that gets
sent to me all the time it's maybe the
most requested thing or second most
requested thing I'm not sure but a lot
of people have asked me to do a room
tour they've asked me to do a gaming set
up a room tour they want to see I guess
how I've got everything set up and
whatnot and I don't mind doing that I've
just never done one before and I'm not
sure if the messages I've got our
representative of the entire viewer base
or if it's just like a few people so I
just wanted to do this video here to ask
if that's something you guys want to see
because you know my style is to put a
lot of effort into anything that I do so
if I do do a video like that it's gonna
be fairly epic so I just want to be sure
before putting all that time into it
that it's something you guys are
interested in so if you want to see an
unbox therapy style room tour slash
gaming setup video of how I run
everything how my TV is set up how my
consoles are set up how you know the
speakers I use the headphones I use most
often how I edit all that kind of stuff
then either hit that thumbs up button or
just let me know down in the comments
that'll help me to figure out exactly
what the demand is and to go ahead and
do it and something else I want to talk
about might as well being that I'm here
in front of the camera I've been
thinking about a feature on the website
where I would actually have users that
behave as limited editors and that
sounds complicated I know but basically
what it would allow for it's for you
guys that are members over there to
actually contribute content so say for
example you get something new or you're
trying to start an unboxing channel of
your own and you're just starting out
and you want feedback and stuff like
that there would actually be a page a
section dedicated towards you know that
kind of user driven content people could
comment on your stuff it could be
pictures images text or even embedded
videos and what will happen is as you
create content that'll get sent to me to
my mailbox and I'll have to approve it
after taking a look at obviously to
avoid some unsavory content
as you guys know online there are a lot
of spammers and stuff like that so and
then after I you know check it out and
make sure there's nothing vulgar going
on I approve it it goes live on the site
and you can actually get real feedback
about what you're doing or you know
about the the stuff that you just
purchased you can see what people think
about it so you can kind of share in the
unboxing experience even if you've never
done unboxing videos before it's not a
hard feature to implement I'm pretty
lucky that the back end of my website
makes it pretty easy to implement that
feature so that's something you guys
want to see or something you think you
might use even if it's only a few of you
I might let it go live and see how it
works out and then another thing the
forum's right now on the website they're
pretty basic I know some people like
that it's obviously easier to take care
of if it's if they're simple but I have
been looking at some more complicated
options that allow for more multi media
you know statistics tracking on your own
posts and things like that so if you'd
like to see a more full-featured forum
even if it might be a little bit more
complicated let me know as well down in
the comments if you want to see that so
anyways we covered a few different
topics here and as you guys know I'm
hard at work trying to maintain the new
website make all these kinds of changes
make sure everything is operating
correctly on the back end as well as do
unboxing videos as they come in speaking
of unboxing videos I've got a big
surprise for you guys that's in the mail
you guys can guess take guesses down
below on what you think it is but a big
surprise hopefully before Christmas
that'll be out so anyways that's just
been a quick update covered a lot of
different subject matter if you want to
see the room tour slash gaming setup
video done in my epic style then I hit
that thumbs up button and that'll tell
me more than anything else that that's
what you guys want to see if there's
enough of you if there's enough thumbs
up then then that's something that I'll
take the time to do you guys are the
bosses not me I create content for you
am i right alright guys until next time
thanks for watching as always thanks for
supporting me as always thanks for
coming out on the BenQ contest one more
time anyways I'm gonna get out of your
way now and until the next unboxing stay
tuned
alright let's see how this goes let's
see how this voting goes if you guys
want to see this this a room tour video
