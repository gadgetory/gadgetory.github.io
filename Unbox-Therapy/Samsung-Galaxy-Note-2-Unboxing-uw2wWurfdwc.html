to you by the national campaign against
drunk driving what's up guys it's Lou
from unbox therapy and first I want to
apologize for my voice here I'm a little
bit rundown it's that time of year but
hey I'm making a video so thumbs up for
fighting through battling through a
little bit of sickness today we're
looking at the Galaxy Note 2 and as you
can tell it's a really powerful device
got a quad-core 1.6 gigahertz processor
you have the s-pen included here you got
a big 5.5 inch Super AMOLED display in a
huge 3100 milliamp hour battery that's
all beautiful this phone's been out for
a little while now but I haven't
actually played with one haven't
actually got my hands on one and so I
thought hey I'll bring you this video in
my first impressions I do want to give a
shout out to tell us for making this
video possible and sending this device
out to me if you guys want to show them
some love as well I put their Twitter
link down below so go ahead and tell
them that you're grateful for the
devices showing up on unbox therapy and
maybe you guys can request different
smartphones that you want to see on here
and you can convince them to send me
some more so definitely go tweet at
TELUS and tell them you want to see more
gear on unbox therapy so let's talk
about the unboxing here we got a little
bit of paperwork
this is French in English because it is
a Canadian version you've got your power
brick this is pretty straightforward usb
on one end power prongs on the other for
charging your device from the wall and
then of course your cable this is a
microUSB to USB it's a done up in white
so all the accessories here with the
galaxy notes you are white at least with
this specific model on the right-hand
side of the device is where you'll find
the power switch now this is important
because had the power switch being on
top it would be pretty hard to reach on
such a large device this after all is a
5.5 inch phone on the top is where
you'll find a headphone jack as well as
a microphone and on the left hand side
is where your volume rocker is this is
pretty self-explanatory up and down to
increase and decrease volume the device
is very slim and surprisingly it doesn't
feel as big in my hand as I thought it
would it feels pretty reasonable pretty
manageable on the bottom is where you'll
see a microphone as well as a micro USB
port that's going to be used for
charging advice of course and you
also got your s-pen that's what
separates this device in one other way
so it's huge but it's also got a pen so
it fits somewhere between a smartphone
and a tablet and I was actually
pleasantly surprised with the pen not
only is it basically undetectable when
it's inserted into the phone but it's
also pretty nice to use and surprisingly
functional the back the device features
your rear facing camera surprise
surprise as well as the LED flash and
then towards the bottom is where your
speaker is you'll also find the s-pen as
I said before in the bottom corner it's
incredibly smooth to extract and at the
same time it doesn't feel like it's
going to come out accidentally I
wouldn't personally worry about that and
something else to mention the device as
a whole if you're looking at specs you
sort of think damn is this thing too big
can I really carry this around on a
daily basis well I have to say at least
in my jean pocket it doesn't really feel
all that much bigger then my Nexus 4 for
example even though on paper it's quite
a bit bigger I don't know what it is
maybe it's the way it's curved maybe
it's the fact that it's got such smooth
finishes maybe it's because it's so thin
but anyway it doesn't feel much bigger
and even in my hand I'm pretty
comfortable holding it so that's a
pleasant surprise as you can see here
this is one of the killer functions the
fact that you could take notes right on
the device and it's fairly precise in
fact I've used Wacom tablets in the past
and maybe it's not quite as precise as
that but for something that is
essentially a phone or a slightly larger
phone it is impressive the kind of
feedback you get it's leaps and bounds
better than those third-party styluses
that you can get for smart phones you
know the ones with the soft tips that
aren't very precise at all and they
really don't have any levels of pressure
sensitivity like this one does so
depending on how hard you press on the
screen it can sort of figure it out what
you want to do so if you're sketching or
doing drawing or something like that
that's imperative because then you can
get a different weight on the stroke as
you come across the screen so anyway
getting a little bit technical there but
as you can tell the device is pretty
snappy too that's another thing worth
mentioning moving around the web browser
the interface etc it's surprisingly
snappy you guys know in the past I
haven't been
huge fan of having a skin put over
Android but this one at least for now
feels like it's kind of not inhibiting
the experience all that much you can see
I'm taking a look here at the new site
trigger pulled calm you guys should go
check that out if you haven't yet now
while we load up the YouTube page I do
want you guys to check out this quick
and very important message from the
sponsor of this episode and then we'll
be back with a little bit more the
national campaign against drunk driving
has an important message to share this
holiday season and I want to help them
get it out there don't drink and drive
chances are you're going to be hanging
out with family and friends it's going
to be a good time you'll probably have a
couple of drinks I know I will myself
but that doesn't mean you need to get
behind the wheel of a car try to get
home unfortunately this time of year
there are more fatal collisions than
many other times a year it might be the
maximum in fact and what that means is
if you get behind the wheel under the
influence there's a great chance that
you're going to end up hurting somebody
getting in an accident getting caught
under the influence with a DUI that
increases your insurance rates there's
going to be cops all over the country
all the way up to New Year's Eve and you
don't need to take that risk it's going
to affect you in a number of potential
ways and it's just strictly not worth it
there are many ways to get home or you
can just crash on the couch you could
use public transit you could use a taxi
or you could wait till the next morning
like I just said so I know you've heard
it a million times but please listen to
me this time around you don't want to
have to be looking back saying you know
you wish you had done things differently
or having regrets
so stay sober drive safe alright so as
you can see we've loaded up youtube.com
slash on box therapy and using a 5.5
inch device to browse YouTube is
actually pretty nice it means
everything's a little bit bigger you're
getting bigger thumbnails bigger text so
using it as an entertainment device
that's another killer use for it since
it is somewhere between a tablet and a
smartphone I could totally see like
lying in bed watching YouTube tweeting
etc with a device like this as you can
tell I'm a pretty big fan given my
limited use with it the main thing here
is that it's not nearly as big as people
have been saying I could totally see
myself using this on a daily basis it's
not big to the point where I feel that
it's awkward in any way
that might have something to do with the
fact that I've already used somewhat big
phones I'm using the Nexus 4 right now
but this one here I could totally see
myself getting used to it and hopefully
I can play with it for the next couple
of weeks and maybe you guys some more
feedback on Twitter etc if you guys are
interested in pricing and availability
