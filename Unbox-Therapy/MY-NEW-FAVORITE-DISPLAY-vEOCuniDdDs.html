another video
and as you can tell I've got a giant
thing on the desk here today this my
friends it's a very premium piece of
equipment the new ultrawide monitor
thunderbolt ultrawide monitor 21 by 9 34
inches from LG now if you have seen mine
if you've seen my setup video in the
past then you know I love these ultra
wide monitors this one makes some tweaks
to the version that I have three of on
my desk power brick power cable this
stand that's the cool thing the stand
has actually changed some height
adjustments of tilt
look at that guy right there that down
you've got this little look at that
semicircle I really like that aesthetic
hdmi displayport
Gucci mama a very nice look especially
with the curve on there whoa maybe I
should've done Y me some peanuts and
cracker jack so its root root root for
the home team oh yes that was easy oh
well that looks insane on the camera
hello anybody home and as you can tell
we are now height adjustable here and
quite a bit too so if you're like maybe
you're on a desk you like to stand and
work sometimes one of those standing
desks look at the size of this guy
99% srgb color
coverage here IPS is important on
something this wide because you don't
really want to stress the viewing angles
too much on on other display technology
it's nothing like fresh gadgets you know
I have to believe this is probably the
most comprehensive set of inputs and
outputs to thunderbolt ports two USB 3.0
charging ports a USB 3 input display
pour in two hdmi ins a headphone out and
of course your DC now with Thunderbolt
Thunderbolt 2 might I had you have the
opportunity to daisy chain these
monitors together if you choose to or to
have other Thunderbolt peripherals that
need high-speed connection every sticker
has its own removal sound just notice
this little guy as well that's for some
extra cable management it fits on to the
back here clips in and keeps everything
neat and tidy you're thinking right now
I've heard of Thunderbolt Thunderbolt 2
I understand okay it's cool connector
this cable has an enormous amount of
throughput right you can send a
wonderful 34 40 by 1440 image to this
display but at the same time have enough
leftover bandwidth for high-speed
storage connected right to the display
Thunderbolt over here on a laptop
connection activated so yeah you can see
your input selections here look at this
beautiful image of the Toronto skyline
taken by your favorite Jack you've gone
from this little thing here to this
entire real estate an iPad pro the big
enchilada
mr. burrito Oh charging I don't know
maybe the ultimate set up if you're
looking for like a single monitor set up
huge field-of-view expandability through
the port's the ability to interface with
your peripherals whether it's a desktop
or a laptop that you're connecting to it
this might be for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
