to you by Gamefly what's up guys welcome
to the second episode of in review this
is my weekly show happening every Monday
here on unbox therapy if you missed the
first episode I'll give you a quick
recap on how this show works I go back
over the past week of unboxings and I
give you guys a quick concise casual
style review having had more time to
play with the items that were unboxed so
first and foremost the last video that
was featured was on these right here
that Beats By dr. Dre
mixer headphones I also featured this
week the jam box from jawbone the
original jam box which of course is the
wireless Bluetooth speaker and lastly
during the beginning of the week I got a
chance to take a look at the 2012 Nissan
gt-r black edition I'll get to that last
let's start with the headphone since
they're right in front of me if you guys
saw the unboxing video then you'll know
something I highlighted in that video
was the superior build quality these are
some of the toughest looking and
toughest feeling beats that I've ever
personally handled to be honest with you
if you guys haven't seen the unboxing
video definitely go check it out links
to everything i talked about are gonna
be down in the description so you guys
can go do that things that I like about
these headphones real quick build
quality like I said I like the fact that
they're incredibly portable when folded
up I mean for a headphone like this I
really haven't seen such a sturdy
headphone that actually folds up the way
that these do for travel another thing
that I like I like the fact that they
included two cables including a DJ
specific cable I like the fact that
you've got the pass-through
on on the ear cups and that you can
choose which side either left or right
you want to connect the cable to
obviously removable cables is always a
plus sound I was actually surprised to
find out that they don't sound that bad
I shouldn't say I'm surprised to find
that a lot of people are hating on beats
these days but they're actually pretty
pretty decent in the in the low end for
bass heavy music and things like that
but a couple of things that I didn't
like and maybe this is part of the
reason why the sound was impressive to
me is the fact that for an on the ear
style headphone meaning it doesn't go
all the way around your ear
there's not any leakage or external
noise that gets through with these but
the reason why I think is because of how
tight they are these are an incredibly
tight headphone I don't know maybe I
have a big head here I'll go throw a mom
for you but basically after I don't know
say an hour I mean not even maybe 30
minutes I start to feel like my head is
getting squished and wearing glasses
doesn't help either and you know I for a
headphone like this it's got to be
comfortable I'm sorry I mean the whole
intention of upgrading your headphones
is the concept that you're going to be
listening to music a lot so that's a big
no-no a big issue for me
of course that's subjective not
everybody has the same size head also
these might eventually Bend a little bit
and inform themselves to your specific
head shape I don't know there are
metallic components that's the kind of
thing I'd have to follow up on months
later I felt like the ear cups another
con here I felt like the ear cups didn't
have quite enough padding I feel like
they could have been a little bit soft
or at least compared to some of the
other stuff that I use and then like I
said before sound is comparable to a lot
of headphones at a lower price point so
in this case I really do think you're
paying the premium once again these are
249 on Amazon right now I think you're
paying that little premium for the
specific design if you know that you
want a DJ headphone that's portable and
that you want a headphone that allows
you to rotate an ear cup in any
direction you want in order to monitor
the sound that's going on around you
then this is definitely something worth
looking at but like I said something to
be worried about is whether or not
they're gonna be comfortable for you if
you have a chance to try them on
definitely do it although I know most
retailers definitely online retailers
don't let you but then again you can
always return stuff so that's not such a
big deal and if any of you guys own
these headphones and have owned them for
a long time longer than I have let me
know down in the comments if you found
that they stretched out over time or
form themselves to your head I'd be
interested to know now in that video
this unboxing sorry
in that video I did mention at the end
that I would be comparing those
headphones to the SMS audio street by 50
headphones because I've been using those
ones I recently unbox them as
well and I got a good feedback from you
guys good response let me know down in
the comments if you still want to see
that video but I'm gonna make it anyways
later this week you'll be able to see
that comparison so definitely stick
around for that
the next item to talk about but I really
went on about those headphones didn't I
but the next item to talk about is the
jam box from jawbone the little portable
bluetooth speaker pumping out some
pretty serious bass for something that's
that form-factor
a little bit expensive I'm not gonna lie
170 bucks for a portable bluetooth
speaker I mean it's a pretty specific
scenario that you're going to be using
it in at home I have better audio
already wired audio that's plugged into
the wall of course and on the road I
have high end headphones so it sort of
has to fit in between those spaces now
maybe you're on the couch around the
coffee table with your iPad you can
upgrade your audio there parties I
mentioned in the video jokingly picnics
to the beach you know that kind of stuff
so 170 bucks might be a little bit much
for people just for those uses but in
those uses it's incredibly powerful
given its size as I said before you can
get a lot of bass out of that thing it
surprised the hell out of me now granted
it does jump around the table a little
bit when you feed it a bass heavy audio
signal but nonetheless the actual sound
quality surprised me for something
that's a streaming wirelessly over
Bluetooth and be that small so if you're
looking for something to fit those
circumstances where you need an audio
upgrade on the go it's pretty tough to
beat that particular device but once
again as I said before it's a little bit
pricey for something that only addresses
a small set of needs the last thing to
talk about on the show right the Nissan
GTR 2012 that was an absolute blast to
make that video now before I talk about
it I just want to say one more time
thanks to you guys a bunch of milestones
were hit this week on unbox therapy
first I believe it was the views I think
or maybe yeah I think it was the views
that were hit first so we went over 10
million total views next was we hit the
three hundredth video which of course
was the Nissan GTR video and then the
last thing that just happened recent
I guess a couple days ago or maybe that
was yesterday 70,000 subscribers so
three very big milestones that occurred
within the last week and also my
birthday anyways a bunch of things that
happened within the last week and I
really owe it all to you guys I know
I've said it before and you're probably
saying Lou it's getting old but I do
really appreciate your guys viewership
the fact that I get to do this for a
living is incredible and I owe a bunch
of it to you guys you guys keep watching
I'll keep making and believe me I'm
gonna only get better and better I'm
gonna keep pumping cash back into the
production of these videos and they're
only gonna continue to surprise you so
definitely stick around I hope that
you're in it for the long haul but
anyhow enough about that enough of a
speech there the Nissan GTR 2012 an
absolute beast of a car insanely fun to
drive surprisingly easy to drive as well
as you guys know it's got a what what
were they calling it they were calling
it a automatic manual transmission
something along those lines it's got the
paddle shifters and a very smart
computerized transmission the car
basically only does what you wanted to
do an incredible amount of grip
four-wheel drive I was expecting
something that was tough to keep control
of no chance at all I felt like I was in
complete control even though I'm no I'm
no fancy-pants driver or anything like
that I know a bunch you guys were
cutting up the fact that I forgot to
wear my seatbelt and and all the rest of
it but anyways no a bunch of fun to make
that video if I know you guys enjoyed it
because you guys were liking that video
like crazy so I'm definitely gonna be
looking at some other supercars in the
future to review for you guys because of
how much you liked it and I'm even going
to take the GTR out on the track to give
it a little bit more of what it of
what's necessary to look into what it's
capable of you know give it a little bit
more throttle etc you spin it out a
little bit whenever I got a do to show
you guys more what it's capable of
because on the city streets you know
obviously you can only take advantage of
a very small amount of its capabilities
anyway guys that has been your second
episode of in review let me know down in
the comments what you think of this show
if you appreciate it if you enjoy it and
so on and so forth also give it a like
and favorite as you guys know that helps
me out
