man we're without a thousand videos oh
yeah back with the much requested tech
under Ceres grab a few gadgets that are
on the Shelf looking cool and include
them in a tech under episode today it's
gonna be tech under was it fifty fifty
bucks I'm not going to tell you what it
is right now but this thing's about
fifty bucks this one in the middle is
about forty summer net neighborhood and
then the one on the far right is between
thirty and forty so let's jump right
into it lever lever whichever way you
want to say that do you guys sent this
over I'm not sure if they're on
kickstart if they were on kick no
they're not on Kickstarter these guys
have this little tiny tool multi-tool
that doubles as a card meaning it'll fit
into your wallet
I've actually been carrying one of these
around because they sent two but I
thought you guys might find it
interesting now you can see there's a
clip on the front so you can use this as
a dedicated money clip and multi-tool if
you like which will slide into a card
slot on your wallet regardless of which
type of wallet you're using I've
actually used this one already in an
emergency situation that will replicate
a Phillips screwdriver you've got a
little pry tool here there's the various
different sizes for wrenches you also
have a bottle opener on here
can opener rulers I mean it's all the
stuff you you might need at a certain
point and not have on you of course a
bottle opener on its own in your wallet
well that's useful it's not gonna
replace your toolbox but having this in
your wallet at all times is kind of cool
tsa compliant and made from 420
stainless steel they have a few versions
of this on their website cord cutter
that's what they're calling this one
here that's pretty cool cord cutter so
you see here I told you I got one in my
wallet right now still actually using
this phantom wallet from previous video
if you wanna know more about this go
watch that video I'll link that in the
description as well anyhow I'm really
carrying this thing here's what it looks
like without the clip on it it just
replicates a card it fits perfectly into
any wallet that fits a standard card
it's anywhere between like 28 and 33
bucks and this thing is very solid so
next up this case now
yes it's an iPhone case for an iPhone 7
plus although they do make it for a few
different phones from a company called
pitaka but they do also sell on Amazon
this one is made out of a very unusual
material which is called aramid and this
is the same stuff that they use in body
armor incredibly durable fibers but at
the same time very lightweight and it
can be very thin because of the strength
and as far as I know these are the only
guys using this material in phone cases
it's apparently flame resistant as well
so this material seems to have some
pretty cool properties for a phone case
and it's not too too expensive but it's
hard to open oh wow oh man that's nice
it's soft touch but it's crazy thin
check out how thin that is jack so much
so that they've even elevated the camera
cut out a little bit to keep your glass
from your camera up off the table
alright so clips down wow that's got to
be the thinnest case I've ever tried
onto an iPhone you will hardly even
notice it there so for your money you're
also going to get a tempered glass
screen protector that is a glass screen
protector turns out it's a pretty cool
accessory for under 50 next up you may
have heard of this it's called phone
soap and one of the things a lot of
people don't know is that their phones
are disgusting I'm looking at you okay
you start to look at that phone all
those smudges all that grime you're
eating you're dropping things on it
you're going to the bathroom with the
font like you're disgusting and you know
there's actually a way to disinfect your
phone which is safe oh yeah and what
does it use it uses UV there you have
your disgusting phone bacteria on the
left and then after it sits in a phone
soap just while you're charging it
anyway bacteria free look at this look
at this visual representation over here
it's disgusting tom you'd be shocked
your phone's disgusting but here's what
it looks like not bad looking put it
beside your bed wherever you charge up
power brick to USB also as far as I know
there's a way yeah see down here where
you will feed your phone cable up into
the box which is completely fine so
that's how you're gonna
have the device charging while you do
this whoo you can see you're real nice
UV light over there this is a crazy
concept to think about like light is
cleaning but yeah UV lamps will sanitize
until clean and then shut off
automatically
your phone's charged cable will go in
there so it's only one cable to the wall
which is kind of convenient if you open
the device up it turns the light off you
close the device it comes back on take
your phone drop it in there close it
down and all of a sudden you're
germ-free it's really bright blue light
bulb this thing actually does work it
gives you a cleaner phone and your phone
believe it or not it's probably the
dirtiest thing that you interact with so
it's actually kind of surprising that
more people don't use these things
maybe you skip a virus or something
maybe you're just cleaner Tom can you
brush those potato chips off</div></body></html>
