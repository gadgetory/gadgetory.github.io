unbox therapy starting today what's up
guys Lew here back with another video
and today I'm checking out a VR headset
it's more of a holder because it still
requires your phone in order to operate
but it's pretty cool it's definitely a
step up on the Google cardboard concept
you slide your phone in I've got the
holder here for the iPhone 6 but they
have holders for other popular phones as
well and you get a more ski dog alike
type fit that's comfortable and stays on
without the need to hold it there like
Google cardboard this one from zeiss is
about 99 bucks
I believe links in the description to
all of the relevant information
it supports smartphones four point seven
to five point two inches simply put your
smartphone into the tray slide it into
the glasses let's go ahead jump inside
the box I always say jump inside like
I'm gonna physically jump in there but I
like it sounds more exciting then open
the box up a little bit of tape trusty
blade wow this is more serious than I
expected woah look at this that thing is
solid here's a manual for how to get
started you can use the headphones
that's cool so you still have access the
headphone port very nice very cool a
little box for the augmented reality
experience I'm gonna go ahead and make
this little box right now cuz I'm crafty
like that now this is the headset ski or
snowboard goggles that's what comes to
mind when you see this thing and this
channel right here is where your phone
slides in a legit headband head strap I
guess is optional and as you know Zeiss
is known for their high quality lenses
you have this padding here kind of like
a microfiber on top of a foam should be
comfy it's not too heavy
which is good here is the attachment for
the iPhone 6 but as I said before you
can use this with some other devices
well that's simple and then you simply
slide it in like that oh wow
so comfortable even with my glasses
that's a big plus
that's actually pretty comfy I probably
look pretty cool right now too right
Jack don't lie to me it's time to
install the Zeiss apps what if I do is I
CR that must do it there we go vr one
cinema get that VR one media let's get
that hmm let's do the cinema first you
have a stereoscopic image here so
there's a left channel and a right
channel
essentially when paired with these
lenses that's what creates the immersive
experience
here we oh wow it's an actual movie
happening in here what play but how do i
click is there a click on here how do I
click to do it Jack Jack oh I have
nothing to play I have to pick something
oh wow okay so I pick a movie oh wow
this is the experience of like sitting
in a movie theater we're talking about a
huge screen out here how do I exit out
now though one side oh there's a door
Wow now I'm in the media launcher and
there's all kinds of apps here AutoTrack
VR roller coaster VR zombie shooter
install by the way I think I need that
top strap because because otherwise this
is a little tight little pinch there we
go oh yeah money in the bank this is
zombie shooter VR which apparently works
with this headset so of course that's
the next thing for me to try oh my
goodness this is a little much I'm
picking an 8k 47 right now well how do I
shoot it oh jeez man I got him I got a
zombie sighting oh man this one's coming
quick that's a female zombie right there
haha oh I gotta wait for me man oh no
keep shooting no Jesus I died man well
anyway I should try out that one one
last dice app that's an amazing VR
experience as you can get just with the
simple contraption like this in your
phone okay so the way this interface
works is the apps that you have
installed in this universe are all
managed from this interface so you don't
actually have to back out so say I
installed VR fitness VR player Tuscany
froggie all these things they would show
up here in the top and instead of having
an install button it would have a launch
button like it does for the AR and it
does for the cinema I'm gonna try this
VR
exposition whoa whoa I'm in an art
gallery right now guys it's just I'm
just in an art gallery
Oh what the that's how you exit I'm
gonna launch the augmented reality right
now with this little box it's somewhere
over here this little box this should be
fun okay so right now I'm seeing my
setup the whole studio thing here I see
you know Wow hands and heal my knife
look at that without even seeing my own
hand super smooth Oh what what there's a
dude right now standing I just poked him
he's about that big I just poked him
again now I have like a space shuttle
over here and there's a battle going on
warrior princess type girl with a staff
this is the kind of thing that you need
to experience in real life and I
recommend you do alright so yeah man
like it's so hard to explain it you guys
can see sort of there
you can get an idea to different images
there when you're looking at them
through these lenses augmented reality
headset VR headset they're merged
tricking your brain into seeing
three-dimensional space and here comes a
sharp oh not good
this is not good can you imagine like
loading up a bunch of movies putting
this on in an airplane or something or a
bunch of TV shows a binge watching and
not having to hold your phone in front
of your face and getting a way bigger
field of view look at this you still
have access here to your charge port as
well as your headphone lenses are
crystal clear obviously this is a step
up from Google cardboard and Zeiss has a
history of making beautiful glass so hey
jumping into VR why not so there you
have it the Zeiss VR one inexpensive
relatively speaking VR headset if you're
looking to experiment with this stuff I
recommend checking it out for sure if
you haven't tried VR yet it's time
there's very little holding you back you
could be swimming with the sharks just
like me or of course getting attacked by
zombies probably not gonna do that again
oh I'm gonna wait for me then I've said
it all thanks very much for watching
guys appreciate it very much if you
enjoyed this content make sure to leave
a thumbs up down below subscribe if you
haven't yet and I'll catch you on the
next episode or maybe some like nature
stuff like planet Earth type stuff
that'd be pretty wild in here as well
alright I'm actually out of here now
what are my glasses
later guys oh no keep shooting no Jesus
I died man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
