coverage what's up guys Lew here and
I've got more cool stuff to show you
here on the show floor at CES 2013 what
you check it out right now is a
transparent 3d LED display now you may
recall I did show you a transparent
display last year at CES 2012 this year
this one adds 3d functionality but it
still remains to be seen exactly how one
might use these things in real life in
the real world as you can see here you
have a model that sits behind the screen
and then it becomes superimposed on the
image when staring at it from the front
since this one is 3d it does require
that you wear glasses which might also
make it more difficult to understand
exactly how this thing would be used in
real life they're suggesting that you
could use it for real-estate demos
window ads or showcases so maybe in the
future some kind of interactive
advertisement might utilize functions or
features like this but it seems like
that might be hard because of the fact
that you've got to wear those glasses
now Hisense was showing off some more
practical stuff like this 84 inch Ultra
HD LED TV and as you guys know Ultra HD
or maybe you don't know but a lot of
manufacturers are using Ultra HD as
their terminology to to say 4k instead
of using the term 4k I'm not 100% sure
why but it's basically the same thing
you're getting 8 million pixels the
exact same resolution as 4k but the
manufacturers want to call it Ultra HD
something else I noticed walking around
the show floor is that most of these
Ultra HD televisions or 4k televisions
are a little bit thicker and a little
bit heavier than their 1080p
counterparts that's not really a major
trade-off when you consider all those
extra pixels you're getting high sense
also showed off this 110 inch ul u HD
LED TV see I'm not I'm not loving that
terminology I prefer 4k personally but
they also showed off this 110 inch
version and they're claiming it's the
world's largest 4k television but as you
may or may not have heard Samsung also
released released a hundred and ten inch
version so it's probably not the world's
largest or at least it's in a Thai there
seem to be a couple of manufacturers at
this particular form factor right now
with UHD TVs and you guys if you enjoyed
