what are we doing today I don't know I
almost forgot it's a new iPhone a new
planet a new universe of smartphone
enjoyment look at that right on time
check out the new Apple headquarters
spaceship looking thing it's
unbelievable so they're doing a little
intro video right now that gives me a
chance to just tweet out this live
stream real quick this is the place
we're gonna find out are the rumors true
the leaks is the iPhone X gonna be what
we expect it to be will it even be
called the iPhone X all right let me
just tweet out this link real quick so
everyone knows exactly what's going on
uh I don't know you guys let me know are
you excited are you gonna buy this phone
what if it's $1,200
just give me a meeting here
okay now I just have to mute this so I
don't have any issues here a little lag
here we go there's the link I need and
if you guys want to talk to me if you
want to if you want to make a comment or
ask a question do it on Twitter please
instead of on YouTube where the chat is
just flying so go over to my twitter at
unbox therapy and I'll be monitoring
Twitter during the event it's just a
little easier to answer questions on
okay and then we add an image here
what do I need
mmm
still hasn't started yet
here we go this will work
everything looked good
okay it's been tweeted so we should be
good to go I see everybody coming in on
Twitter right now look at this right in
time mm-hmm if you're watching this
after the fact I hope you fast forwarded
that intro there but look people aren't
even sitting down yet you know how this
is they make you wait they said 1
o'clock but of course they make you wait
it's what is that fashionably late makes
it seem more important more special so
in the meantime like I said I could take
some of your questions on Twitter it's
gonna be the easiest place to kind of
manage that until we have some actual
action going on up here
so let's see here even Twitter is moving
quickly right now did I have any
problems with a Nintendo switch no no
mine is not warped mine is in good shape
oh wait a sec the lights are off let's
turn this up a little bit here here we
go guys there's lots of ways to be as a
person and some people express their
deep appreciation in in different ways
but one of the ways that I believe
people express their appreciation to to
the rest of humanity is to make
something wonderful and put it out and
you never you never meet the people we
never shake their hands
you never hear their story or tell yours
but somehow in the act of making
something with a great deal of care and
love something's transmitted there and
it's a way of expressing to the rest of
our species our deep appreciation so we
need to be true to who we are and
remember what's really important to us
that's what's gonna keep Apple Apple is
if we keep us us yo will can you hit the
Lights to the place
thank you
I love hearing his voice and his
inspiring message and it was only
fitting that Steve should open his
theater
it is the honor of a lifetime to be the
first to welcome you to the Steve Jobs
theater Steve meant so much to me and so
much to all of us there's not a day that
goes by that we don't think about him
memories have expecially come rushing
back as we prepared for today and this
event it's taken some time but we can
now reflect on him with joy instead of
sadness
Steve's spirit and timeless philosophy
on life will always be the DNA of Apple
his greatest gift his greatest
expression of his appreciation for
Humanity would not be a singular product
rather it would be Apple itself we
dedicate this theater to Steve because
we loved him and because he loved days
like this where he could share our
latest new products and new ideas of the
world and we do so not only to pay
tribute to Steve but to inspire the next
generation of creators and innovators
Steve was a genius and one of the many
ways that he showed that was in the his
uncanny ability to unlock the talent of
everybody that he worked with he thought
deeply about our workplace and its
surroundings and he believed that they
should inspire talented people to do
their best work
so over a decade ago he began to work on
a new campus for Apple his vision for
Apple Park was to create an incredible
workplace of the future where engineers
and designers could all be together
collaborating on the next generations of
Apple product to change the world
Steve's vision and passion live on here
at Apple Park and everywhere in Apple
today and always we honor him
we're here today to talk about some
incredible products but before we get to
that I'd like to take a moment to talk
about what's happening in Florida and
Texas southeastern United States and
across the Caribbean our hearts go out
to all of the people whose lives have
been disrupted by hurricanes
Irma and hurricane Harvey you're in our
thoughts we send you our strength you're
in our prayers Apple is working closely
with relief and recovery efforts through
hand in hand and the American Red Cross
and in addition to Apple's direct
contributions we're making it really
simple for the entire Apple community to
donate via iTunes and the App Store the
handed hand benefit for hurricane relief
airs tonight on all of the major
broadcast networks and I encourage you
to watch it and however you choose to
give I hope that you open your heart to
this important effort thank you
now let me tell you a little bit about
our new home
we'll start movin an apple park later
this year but of course such a large
move it's really more of a process and
the first big step is the opening today
of the stage' of Steve Jobs theater it's
the most state-of-the-art purpose-built
theater ever built or events just like
this one
Apple Park has been built to reflect
apples values for both technology and
the environment
it connects connects extraordinarily
advanced buildings with a rolling Park
land to form an open and inspiring
environment for our teams to create and
collaborate the park itself was
converted from a sea of asphalt into a
hundred and seventy-five acre green
space with over nine thousand trees
Apple Park is designed to be seamless
with nature it's open transparent it
brings the outside in and connects
everyone to the beautiful California
landscape
it's powered by a hundred percent
renewable energy thank you
and in fact we have one of the world's
largest on-site solar installations
right here and just like everything we
made apple parkas that has been designed
with extraordinary attention to detail
incredible precision and really
beautiful materials we've got a great
visitor center which will be open later
this year where we will welcome everyone
and inside the visitor center you'll
find an incredible augmented reality
experience or you can learn more about
Apple Park its design and its
innovations you'll also find a fantastic
new Apple Retail Store as you know Apple
Retail has always been about more than
selling it's about learning inspiring
and connecting with people
now our stores are also the best place
to go discover explore and experience
our new products so before we get to
some incredible products we'd like to
give you an update on retail and to do
that I'd like to invite Angela Angela
you know they're not gonna give you a
phone right away right they got a cover
being this first thank you it's great to
be here and I love the fact but the same
team that designs at the park also
designs our largest retail stores around
the world it's funny
Jackson will call them stores anymore we
call them town squares because they're
gathering places for 500 million people
who visit us every year places where
everyone's welcome and where all of
Apple comes together
but what really brings it all the life
as Tim said are our incredible teams
we've always said that our people of our
soul and they're Apple's greatest
differentiator because they bring
personal connection to communities all
over the world they humanize technology
but along with our amazing teams our
commitment to design also sets us apart
to make things simple
beautiful and that's why we think of
Apple retail as Apple's largest products
and like all of our products we design
new features to take the customer
experience even further in our largest
cities where we can we create a plaza a
space open to everyone come in and relax
meet up with friends or just listen to a
local artist on the weekends inside
we've designed a forum a place for
customers to come and create collaborate
or just connect again with one another
for local entrepreneurs and app
developers we had a quieter space in the
larger stores called a boardroom where
they can learn more from our teams or
again share with each other and the
genius growth a redesigned more relaxed
servic service experience now in the
heart of our largest stores and lastly
the avenues have a like shop windows
around a town square they're carefully
curated
and they change seasonally to always
teacher our newest products and services
and this summer to turn on these new
features we've launched today at Apple
our in-store experience designed to
inspire customers to go even further
with their past
I just noticed uh ten to ten dollar
Apple's DNA live chat things
unbelievable what's going on here for
and they trust us to teach them like
photography music gaming and app
development we've created new programs
like photo walks where customers can
perfect their photography skills with
features like portrait mode and memories
and we do all of this in a really fun
social way by taking them out to the
neighborhood to explore with each other
or Swift playgrounds where the next
generation app developers can begin to
learn the basics of coding and one of my
personal favorites shout out to calling
ping we're at 10 bucks assessing their
to stay updated on the newest
technologies and acts in some of our
larger stores sessions are led by local
artists like this music lab called the
art of beat making with RZA and the
Raleigh team in Brooklyn these sessions
in all stores are led by our creative
team and a new position we call a
creative pro so the creative Pro is now
the liberal arts as the genius has
always been the technology and I would
love to show a quick video to show you
how today at Apple is coming to life
learning about photography you have tons
of good ideas in your head
when you do something for the first time
you have to be completely fearless

are so movie and a big one right as well
showing what it feels like to receive
these know I'd like to thank everybody
in the video for sharing their personal
experience with all of us we have some
great news about the future of Apple
watch and to share it with you I'd like
to invite Jeff Oh Jeff
thanks Tim thanks dad those stories are
really great and it's it's really
inspiring to us that so many people are
getting healthier with Apple watch with
watch OS 4 they're gonna be able to do
even more we're adding smart activity
coaching which is gonna help more people
close more rings more often a completely
redesigned workout app with high
intensity interval training new features
for swimmers like Auto sets and gym kick
an industry-first
it's really simple you just tap your
watch on the machine get going
and all your metrics are insane one of
the things that enables these fitness
features is the apple heart rate sensor
and it's been at the core of Apple watch
since the very beginning and today it's
the most used heartrate monitor in the
world and we want to use it to help even
more people so we're doing three things
first we're making enhancements to the
heart rate app to give you more
information now you'll see your heart
rate right on the watch face so you can
keep an eye on it with just a raise of
the wrist and when you launch the heart
rate app you'll see new measurements
like resting heart rate Apple watch
calculates this daily by correlating
background heart rate readings with
accelerometer data and recovering heart
rate which tells you how quickly your
heart rate drops after workout a lower
resting heart rate and a quicker
recovery rate can be signs of improved
fitness and now you can keep a better
picture of your heart rate you'll have a
better picture throughout the day the
second thing we're doing is inspired by
many of the letters we received from
customers who noticed an unusually high
heart rate when they wouldn't expect one
so Apple watch has been helpful for them
but we realize most people won't notice
so we're adding a feature and now Apple
watch will notify you when it detects an
elevated heart rate you and you don't
appear to be active
and the third thing we're doing is
focused on heart rhythm a regular heart
rhythm has a familiar pattern but when
your heart beats irregularly is called
an arrhythmia it doesn't mean it's
beating too fast or too slow it just
means it's beating out of its normal
rhythm and that can cause problems the
most common form of serious arrhythmia
is called atrial fibrillation or afib
and it affects tens of millions of
people and is a leading cause of stroke
but the challenge is many people with
afib don't feel symptoms so it often
goes undiagnosed we've been looking at
this for a couple of years and we think
Apple watch can help in our initial
studies Apple watch has been effective
at surfacing irregular rhythms so we're
expanding that work and today we're
announcing the Apple heart study whoa
100 bucks
it will use data from Apple watch
hundred-dollar super check what's up
dude shout out to you and notify users
this study is being conducted in
partnership with Stanford medicine and
we're working closely with the FDA and
they've been great to work with so later
this year the first phase of the Apple
Park study will be available in the US
on the App Store those are the updates
focused on fitness and health and they
join the other great features of watch
OS for we have a completely redesigned
music experience an intelligent Siri
face fun new characters from Toy Story
and more shout-out to Abraham as well as
that's Nigel razor it will be available
to all Apple watch customers on
September 19
and now I'd like to introduce the next
generation of Apple watch what do you
guys are you here for the Apple watch I
doubt it you're probably here for the
next size phone but anyway you got to
talk about the watch
shoutout to aim farm
shut it again to Marcelo Kenzo
introducing Apple watch Series three and
it has cellular built-in
now you have the freedom to go anywhere
with just your Apple watch this this has
been our vision from the very beginning
and we believe built-in Cellular makes
series three the ultimate expression of
Apple watch now you can go for a run
with just your watch and still be
connected you can leave your phone when
you go to the beach or just run a quick
errand and it's really nice to know you
can be reached if needed while staying
in the moment you can receive an
important call is just your watch and
and the number is the same numbers your
iPhone you don't have to manage a
separate number the actual ion like
messages just work and series at your
beck and call anytime anywhere you can
use maps and get directions and the
location for find my friend
automatically switches to your watch
when you're away from your phone and
third-party apps like WeChat work over
cellular as well
and coming next month Cellular is going
to change the way we listen to music
because with Apple watch Series three
and Apple music you can stream 40
million songs on your wrist okay
fitness for fitness I can see that
that's pretty cool right
you'll have access to all your favorite
music you can listen to beach one live
or any Apple radio music station you can
even ask Siri to find you the perfect
track now the best device for staying
motive before staying active has all the
music you need to stay motivated what to
enable these features on Apple watch we
have packed Series three with the most
advanced technologies ever in a watch
inside is a new dual-core processor
delivering up to 70% more more
performance it's really really fast Siri
is quicker than ever and thanks to the
new processor for the first time on
Apple watch Siri can talk it's 64
degrees right now in South Lake Tahoe
it's actually it's really convenient to
not have to look at the screen when you
ask you the question for Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi connectivity we developed a custom
wireless chip we call w2 there's nothing
else like it it delivers up to 85%
faster Wi-Fi while being 50% more power
power efficient for both Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi and we've added a barometric
altimeter so now you get flights of
stairs climbed and elevation gains after
a workout we're also releasing an app
for developers this can be great for
skiing and snowboarding apps of course
got a snowboarder out there of course
the biggest challenge of all was adding
cellular you see our little watch is
already packed and you have to add
antennas radios power amplifiers a SIM
card and if you don't do it right it
gets so big it looks like a house arrest
bracelet and you're not gonna want to
wear it so our engineers have been hard
at work and it's learning really it is
kinda crazy Cellular in your wrist
rather than add an antenna the display
itself is the multi frequency antenna
for both LTE and
ts and of course you have to have a SIM
card but even a nano SIM would be way
too big so instead we integrated an
electronic sim in its interaction of the
size embedded SIM so I don't think I've
seen where we ended up even with all
these new features faster dual-core
processor w2 altimeter all the stuff
you've got to put in for cellular the
case for series 3 is the same size as
series 2 the thing for me though and
when a bigger Apple watch in general I
need a bigger display on me
I got these big lists you know that's my
issue the only difference is we extended
the back crystal amir 0.25 millimeters
that's as thin as 2 sheets of paper it's
it's really magical to make a
stand-alone call on a device there's our
first like magical you are you know used
isn't sure there's plenty more where
that came from
I'm gonna switch watches so you guys can
see what's going on
this watch is connected over the AT&amp;amp;T
cellular network this is our new
Explorer face and I'm gonna tap on the
the phone app and I'm gonna call Deidre
who's a colleague on the watch team so
the question is here how does this
integrate with your carrier are you
having a separate plan is it subsidizing
is a purchase subsidized hi hi Deidre
hey I'm calling you from the new Steve
Jobs theater how are you doing oh yeah
sure sure you are why don't we pull in
some video and show everybody where you
are
this has been a merriment but you know
me I'm playing yeah that's you Deidre

danger hey I should probably cut it off
before something goes awry but be safe
out there and thanks for doing this yeah
okay okay that sounds great teacher so
activities Fitness you don't want to
have your phone you just have to watch
embedded SIM card kind of interesting
gonna be attention I'm telling you right
now it's gonna be expensive
I'm gonna go roll over for a minute I
you know you got you guys get it but
sometimes people take technology for
granted and just just for perspective I
might in fact I'm actually double Mike
in just the right location so you can
hear me teachers out in the middle of a
windy blade showed up an obsession for
the super Chandra if you guys do a super
check out below a beanie pops up on the
way out
she's very shadowing and the signals
being sent over cellular coming in and
that's just darn close to magic
series three comes in a wide variety of
cases and bands we have a beautiful new
gold aluminum finish along with silver

carriers and they're each off have a
special introductory offer for seriously
this is what I was talking about we we
subsidize the series 3 without cellular
in these 26 countries at launch orders
will begin September 15th and
availability will be September 22nd
that's the update on Apple watch and now
back to Tim okay kinda cool me having
more functionalities a good thing
everything was kept saying I don't know
I don't need the watch just does what my
phone does now it actually does what
your phone device or helping like in the
series 3 takes that to a whole new level
now Jeff showed you some very cool
things you can do with the cellular
function series three and one of those
is to strain 40 million songs right on
your wrist we've made a great ad showing
just that shout out to angry ginger boss

I'd like to turn your attention
ordinary gamer you're right he be but
I'm gonna be unboxing all this stuff
apple tree has changed the watch the new
film television simply the addition to
end the TV yes we enjoy movies TV shows
sports news games absence and so much
more
in fact we've just been awarded our
second Emmy for Apple TV thank you the
semi was in recognition for how Siri
makes it so easy to search discover and
interact with your TV content we're
really really proud of the efforts we've
made to improve the TV experience now
throughout the history of TV there's
been a few key inflection points that
have changed the way we experience
television it of course all began with
black-and-white and it was first
transformed with the introduction of
color it took a huge step forward with
the advent of HD each stage brought with
it a more true to life experience a more
immersive experience now we're at the
next major inflection point one that has
the most stunning visuals ever that are
ideal for the large TV screens that are
coming into our living rooms
this will bring cinematic quality to
virtually everything that you watch
that's why I am so excited to introduce
Apple TV 4k Apple TV 4k
4k at the heart about time to be honest
are two key technologies that are
driving this next evolution of the TV
experience and to tell you all about
them I'd like to invite Eddie to the
stage Eddie
thank you Tim it is really great to be
here tonight Apple TV 4k is incredible
and it starts with two big advancements
in picture quality
first is forte let me show you this is
an image in 4k it's got incredible
detail that's possible because 4k has
four times the number of pixels of HD
but resolution isn't everything there's
an even bigger advancement that's more
important and it's called high dynamic
range or HDR while 4k is about the
number of pixels HDR is about better
pixels let me show you here's that same
4k image shout out to aw interesting
camera our look at the color HD oils
apples or zoo this because it supports
the industry standard HDR 10 as well as
Dolby vision up to us I though your
experience you tap TV forecast you are
killing Moe livers the highest picture
quality ever and asking where we are
Dolby 4k HDR cinema projector in the
theater
so let's dim the lights and let me show
you the new Apple TV
and we remastered our screen savers our
customers love these to take full
advantage of 4k HDR those are cool I use
those you just lead the Apple TV onyx
here we are Dubai those are nice and
even at night you can see incredible
details in the buildings and the cars on
the road now here's a city shot that
really shows off the crispness and
sharpness that's possible in the new
Apple TV I own so many Apple TVs I got a
revelation they replace them all now
Apple every single in 4k the Texas
sharper the images are brighter and more
vibrant but let's take a look at a 4k HD
art clip this is from the new spider-man
will be coming to iTunes later this
month this high-tech stuff makes it too
easy
with your father
America no secret chat thanks D whoa
you're the Avengers what are you guys
doing here more handsome in person
honestly they see the trouble with this
with the 4k Apple TV to me is that it
took so long and I've already
accumulated so many of these things now
at the heart of the Apple TV we've got
the powerful a 10x fusion chip this is
the same chip that's in our iPad pro and
the new Apple TV isn't just slightly
faster it's remarkably faster CPU
performance is more than twice as fast
as the current Apple TV and graphics are
more than four times faster and of
course it runs the latest version of TV
OS the best operating system for the
living room now to experience 4k with
HDR you also need great content and
we've been working with the large
Hollywood studios to bring all of their
4k and HDR movie titles to iTunes so now
you'll have the biggest releases in the
best picture quality all on iTunes all
available for the same price as HD ok
and if you bought one of those movies in
HD from iTunes we're gonna automatically
upgrade them to 4k HD are at no
additional charge it's cool that's kind
of thing now in addition to iTunes we've
been working with leading streaming
providers like Netflix to bring their 4k
HDR titles to Apple TV and later this
year Amazon Prime video with all of
their 4k HDR titles and originals as
well now last year we introduced the
Apple TV sandwich I don't really have an
easy way to watch your favorite movies
and TV shows in a single place it's been
available in the US and today I'm happy
to announce that we're bringing it to
seven additional countries Canada and
Australia later this month and the rest
by the end of the year we'll get a
candidate Love Dare for us now for each
country it's really important that we
have the content that those customers
know and love and that's why we're
adding all of these local services to
Apple TV now later this year Apple TV
will do even more because we're bringing
live sports so you'll know if you're a
huge sports fan like I am you're really
gonna love this wait a second if your
favorite team is planning on ESPN it'll
automatically appear right first in the
up next list you'll even get
notifications when a games about to
start
or there's a close game so you can start
watching instantly and if you scroll up
you'll see even more games and in
addition we're bringing live news to the
TV app now let's take a look at those
games as you can see we show you the
score and the time remaining to help you
decide which game to watch that's cool
what does he know my name judo yeah ok
Balu straight unit actually wouldn't be
here at another score you can turn the
feature off now we also have a dedicated
sports tab where you can see every live
and upcoming game and as the seasons
change so will the sports tab always
showing what's you what's best for you a
sports in the TV app is a real
game-changer for sports fans and of
course the new TV app is available
your iPhone and iPad as well if you own
an iPad or iPhone there's no better
choice than Apple TV you can now share
your photos on the big screen including
live photo effects 4k video memories you
can play from the over 40 million songs
and Apple music including the music that
your friends are listening to and
because Apple TV is always home you get
anywhere anytime access to all of your
home pet accessories and of course
you've got access to choose from the
thousands of games and apps on the App
Store and with the 8nx fusion ship
there's so much more that Apple TV can
do check out the gray scenes and what's
possible we'd love to show you a new
game from that game company they're
known for making artistic and critically
acclaimed games as a matter of fact
their first game called flower was
chosen as the first video game ever
to be in the permanent collection in the
Smithsonian it's very very cool so with
that I would love to welcome their CEO
Jenova Chen at SETI
at that game company we treat games as
an art form today many of us play games
alone we believe games is a medium that
can bring people together
gaming and that should be not something
I've ever wanted to do participated I so
that was not a big way let's put it that
way
why don't we take off sky is a romantic
social adventure game when you fly above
the clouds to explore the wonders of a
mysterious world the game is designed to
be adaptable to the most casual players
the control is simple and intuitive
everything can be done with one finger
on the Siri remote oh hey that's a max
friend Jeff and he's asking us to follow
him let's see what he has discovered
compassion and generosity are key to
unveil hidden areas of the world as well
as growing your character so by lighting
all the candles Jeff and Mike was able
to summon the spirit and he's about to
teach Mike the knowledge of how to sever
a magical creature
the sky we really tell you see here's
the thing like I mean maybe for a
certain audience maybe for a certain age
group this type of game on the Apple TV
could be compelling but it's so hard to
take a device targeted at specifically
passive content in other words Netflix
and and movies and so on and then and
then also have it game versus the other
way around where you have a game centric
device that can then do those things
like a Playstation or an Xbox because
the control hold you back I mean the
little you can't put that little remote
up against a proper controller not in my
world
not yours probably this guy could talk
about romance all he wants let's oh
there you go check it out like - well it
is needed the most
where's the light Mike was able to free
all the butterflies and together they
can move on to the next part of the
adventure with a live orchestral
soundtrack and cinematic experiences you
can expect to be immersed in
ever-expanding world so join hands with
your loved ones and play sky exclusively
on Apple TV I pad an iPhone this winter
thank you thanks Jennifer
we can't wait for you to get your hands
on sky we're so excited about the new
Apple TV 4k it's got powerful hardware
that delivers stunning 4k HDR video live
sports along with live news TV shows and
and and movies all in the TV app and the
perfect big-screen companion for your
iPhone or iPad a new Apple TV 4k starts
at $179 it joins the existing one you
can order it starting on September 15th
and it ships just a week later that is
the new Apple TV 4k thank you and I'd
like to turn it back to ten it's the
phone now all right excited
don't panic at least I think it has to
be it's the beauty and the magic of the
cinema right in your living room for the
Apple TV 4k
next up iPhone
Apple has always believed that
technology infused with humanity could
improve people's lives and changed the
world no other device in our lifetimes
have had the impact on the world that
the iPhone has nothing else has become
so essential or put so much power into
so many people's hands than iPhone it's
truly amazing how much iPhone impacts
the world each and every day our
intention with iPhone has always been
able to been to create something so
powerful so immersive and so magical
that the hardware addict account to
virtually disappeared maybe there were
more over the last ten years we've
reimagined or invented numerous
technologies to create just that
experience the first iPhone forever
changed how we interact with technology
by introducing multi-touch and that's
true I agree with that most infamous
time you are actually touching the
software instead of buttons it's magical
old magical stairs changed the way 3play
learn communicate spawning new companies
and new industries along the way which
of the viewing experience to places
literally never seen before
with technologies like the retina
display we change the way people
communicate with features like iMessage
and FaceTime that allowed us all to
connect in more meaningful ways and with
Siri we used artificial intelligence to
make our voices more powerful iPhone
even revolutionized security and privacy
with touch ID and our wallets with Apple
pay and of course I firm put amazing
easy-to-use cameras into our hands
becoming the most popular way to capture
the image
of our lives over the past decade we
pushed forward with innovation after
innovation after innovation bringing us
to this moment
when now we can create devices that are
far more intelligent far more capable
far more personal than ever before we
had huge iPhone news for you today oh
and it gets started right now Oh drama
iPhone 8 okay so we have an 8 iPhone 8
this is the confirm step forward for
iPhone and to tell you all about it I'd
like to invite Phil to the stage Phil a
good morning everyone I am so excited to
tell you all about the new iPhone 8 and
the new iPhone 8 plus these are a new
generation of iPhone and they improve on
everything we love about iPhone the
design is all new it has glass on both
the front in the back the aluminum band
beautifully matches the finish of each
iPhone 8 it comes in silver space grey
and a beautiful new gold finish
it's made from an aerospace grade 7000
series custom aluminum alloy the glass
is a seven-layer color process making
sure there's a beautiful precise view
and the glass is further reinforced by
an internal laser welded steel and
copper structure hmm we're so excited
because this glass is the most durable
ever in a smartphone iPhone 8 and 8 plus
it's also microscopically sealed for
water and dust resistance and they have
a new retina HD display in each model
there's a 4.7 inch Retina display in
iphone 8 and a 5.5 inch an iphone 8 plus
now Apple Retina displays are renowned
for their incredible color accuracy and
they have great wide cinema quality
color gamut we've built in our 3d touch
technology into the display and for the
first time an iPhone display it is our
true tone technology now with true tone
it adapts the color temperature and
intensity to the ambient light around us
along with the displays iPhone 8 8 plus
of new stereo speakers as well the 25%
louder than the speed I like you more
than I like in a deeper bass 2 and this
is pretty incredible
inside iPhone 8 mate plus it's a brand
new chip and this is a breakthrough
performance in a mobile device we call
it a 11 Bionic whoa Nonnie
this is the most powerful and smartest
chimp ever in a smartphone the 64-bit
design 4.3 billion transistors six core
we're gonna geek out therefore because
it is so awesome it has two
high-performance courts the 25% faster
than the Explorer CPU okay it's
industry-leading attention is for high
efficiency cords through up to 70
percent faster than the ones in the a-10
chip they're managed by our second
generation performance controller that
now can use all six cords at once
it could deliver up to 70 percent
improvement in multi fitted workloads
and they have our first ever Apple 2
design graphics processing unit or GPU
this is a three core design it's 30%
faster than the graphics in the previous
a 10 the GPU is designed to accelerate
3d apps and games especially those that
use our new metal 2 framework and the
GPU also is incredible for machine
learning apps and those kind of tasks
get a big speed-up if these are our core
machine learning frame or - this more to
it the 11 Bionic includes a first new
generation image signal processor or ISP
so you know this is using photography
the delivers faster autofocus in
low-light as new pixel processing for
sharpness and texture and for the first
time to help reduce noise that is
Hardware enabled multiband noise
reduction all this helps to improve
performance and helps us take better
pictures perhaps the most beloved
feature of every new generation of
iPhone is the cameras and people love
taking photos and customers sent us
their photos for our shot an iPhone
campaign like this one this is sent from
Jeremy Perez Cruz is shot it with an
iPhone 7 plus and people gonna love
taking pictures with the iPhone 8 camera
there's an all-new 12 megapixel sensor
it's larger and faster it provides 83
percent more light and it provides warm
it's more power efficient at the same
time it is deeper pixels and a new color
filter so this adds up to having better
color
a wider dynamic range of color and lower
noise in your photos and videos i phone
eight bus has two new sensors in its
dual camera the wide-angle camera is an
F 1.8 aperture and optical image
stabilization the telephoto camera has F
2.8 aperture so as always we want to
show you the kind of photos you can take
off of our new cameras now these are
photos we're going to show that have not
been retouched in any way they're
straight off the iPhone 8 and 8 plus so
here's the first one this is absolutely
beautiful now that's not the Golden Gate
Bridge this is taken in Portugal it
shows the beauty of wide color gamut as
great dynamic range sharpness and
incredibly low noise just look at that
blue sky there's another example it
shows incredible Y quality color again
just look at the skin tones and the
detail in the hair in the eyes if you
look closely in her eyes you can
actually see the photographer reflected
there holding an iPhone to take the
picture it's a great example of the
amazing textures and depth and
photography and really feel the fabric
and you can see details in their face
behind the fabric here's a great example
of low-light photography texture detail
and very subtle colors in this darker
environment last year we introduced
portrait mode iPhone 8x fantastic
portrait modes and people flip over
taking these photos and now with the
iPhone 8 plus you're gonna get sharper
details more uses in low-light and even
a more natural bokeh in the background
with the photos so this is a big hit we
had a surprise in the future last year
of portrait mode we brought it out in
beta and it just got better and better
over time and customers send us photos
they love this so we challenged the
engineering team to do that again
to make it easy for all of us to take
advantage of an advanced photographic
technique and they're doing it and it
has to do with lighting if you've ever
had a professional portrait taken you
know the Pro photographers use advanced
equipment and have a great understanding
advanced techniques to literally sculpt
the light on your face to create the
perfect mood for a portrait photograph
our team is making as possible for all
of us using the new dual cameras in the
11 Bionic chip and the iPhone 8 plus the
team has come up with a new feature
called portrait lighting and this is
beta but it will ship with the iPhone 8
plus and here's how it works you compose
a photo in the camera using the portrait
mode the dual cameras in the isp sense
the scene they create a depth map they
separate the subject from the background
and then you see machine learning a
cream facial landmarks and actually
changes the lighting of the contours
over your face that happens while you're
composing the shot
it's super easy to use right when you're
in the camera app you use portrait mode
and there's a new menu to select the
lighting effect you well you just swipe
to pick a different effect or whatever
you want to shoot and these aren't
filters this is real-time analysis of
the light on your subjects face in fact
you can go in later after shot a
portrait mode photo into the Photos app
and change the lighting effect so soft
which one you want to use in your
photograph
that's a cool implementation they share
their team has done an unbelievable job
on this and so here's an example of a
photo that's taken not touched in any
way this is portrait mode using portrait
lighting it's actually using the setting
and portrait lighting for stage light so
it drops away the background to make
this stunning dramatic photograph it's
absolutely beautiful
so iPhone eight eight plus four
incredible for taking pictures they're
also amazing for video as well
in fact iPhone 8 as the highest quality
video capture ever in a smartphone
along with the ICT we have an apple
design video encoder this enables faster
frame rates and higher quality video it
does real-time image and motion analysis
to predict changes in the content and
optimize the video encoding algorithms
so while you're shooting video let's say
for K 60 frames a second shout out to
Michael and divides each frame into
individual thanks for your chance to
million of them and we analyze the two
million tiles every second looking for
details like texturing edges to predict
whether that tile has grass sky water of
movement in it so let's say you're
shooting 4k 60 frame of video and look
like this it's beautifully optimized for
quality and for compression level and
this video was shot on an iPhone in 4k
it's amazing and if you're one of the
many people who loves shooting slow-mo
videos that's got a lot better - now you
can shoot a 1080p HD 240 frames a second
let's double the frame rate of previous
absolute beautiful
so now iPhone 8 is incredible for
shooting photos it's incredible for
video there's a third category of use of
the camera that's gonna become
increasingly important in our mobile
devices and that's augmented reality he
this is an incredible area for us to
advance in in our teams of work together
hardware and software to make iphone le
the first camera the first iPhone really
created for augmented reality in the
first smartphone designed for it as well
we custom tune each iPhone for augmented
reality the cameras actually
individually calibrated in the factory
and that makes a huge difference in the
performance for a are there new
gyroscopes new accelerometers an AR kit
software is tightly tuned to all this
hardware to deliver the best experience
for motion tracking an AR greatly
benefits in the new a 11 Bionic chip the
CPU handles world tracking the new Apple
GPU renders a mirthless mersive graphics
at up to 60 frames a second the new isp
does real-time lighting estimation
this stuff is amazing that it happens on
the device in the palm of our hands so I
want to show you some of the work that
developers are starting to do with AR
apps on iPhone 8 but here's one example
it's a game Warhammer 40k free blade
from pixel toys and now use the photo
mode to bring the free play night into
the real world and play it right where
your friends are standing around you
here's another from Major League
Baseball's advanced media team they're
enhancing the app that out with a art
kit so when you're at the game you can
hold up your iPhone and see real time
player information and stats so on top
of the guys kind of cool
I can't stuff it down that's a cool he's
a art kit with this out to actually
superimpose the map on top of the sky as
you're looking at it around you this
isn't some generic sky this is the sky
around you
so now we want to show you a sighting AR
out right here live on stage playing on
an iPhone ad
it's from Directive games this is a new
startup based in Shanghai spawned by
developers who have worked on some of
the biggest franchises in gaming
so please welcome at Lamar CEO and
co-founder of director games at Lee and
that AR Stephanie's kind of impressive
earlier the summer with the introduction
of a arcade Apple changed gaming forever
what we're about to show you is one of
the world's first competitive
multiplayer games designed to be played
entirely in augmented reality shout out
to attend the mistakes for the super
chair in the game players battle their
friends in real time either online or
around the table in the same room my
friend and co-founder on that is
preparing a match for us where we play
the rebels against the dominators
what's really cool is that they are kit
the metal tool on the new iPhone we are
able to experience games in an entirely
new way since players are able to view
the game from any angle our content has
to be incredibly detailed with the power
of the new iPhone an unreal support for
metal - we are able to render the entire
level on screen and amazing 1.2 million
polygons while also allowing you to move
in close to really appreciate the high
visual fidelity I just look at those 4k
section gorgeous now shall we go into
the game AR allows us to use our
position in the real world to gain a
tactical advantage just look how long
but as moving towards this cave lining
up his target this is something that
would have been hard to do which makes
it soon
it's like you're not just controlling
the game you're in the game another
awesome addition to the experience is
spatial audio if you go close to the
action the sound increases and if a
solid object gets between you and the
action the sound is occluded perfectly
well the stereo speakers this is truly
amazing that's kind of cool it looks
like we're getting it pretty hard dare I
say magical yes the foil to protect our
heroes now let's lean fire on our
enemies but post it to their base I get
ready for the fatal blow with our super
wet oh the duck ship is there did you
take it up to the same time
what you just saw is an amazing
evolution in how games are played and
experienced thanks to the combination of
bayer kick and metal 2 on the brand new
iphone we can't wait for you to play it
look for the machines on the absolute
this month exclusively on IRS thank you
guys I don't think this iPhone 8 is is
everything there will be some X or
addition but don't think this is the
only next time drill I'd be very
surprised let's talk about Wireless
they're just saving it for the end
we've once said that the future is
Wireless boy we rewrite that's becoming
more true than ever before with iPhone 8
it supports LTE advanced for fast
networking connections bluetooth 5.0 for
the latest accessories
of course it supports our great beloved
air pods and the beats X headphones that
use our w1 chip and the new Beats Studio
threes as well and now with iPhone 8 but
it's glass back or enabling the freedom
of wireless charging big fan wireless
charging use it all the time woman it
makes a simple thing we do this every
day we use our phones in the day and we
charge them at night off and on it's
totally by our bed stand in our homes or
our hotels and words can't describe just
how much nicer is to just put it down
and pick it up whatever you want to
choice a you there for years nothing to
plug it in say well again gonna want to
do this by your bedside I don't want to
do this in a cafe or restaurant as they
start to support wireless charging I
want to do it in an airport so you can
top up your charge before you get on the
next flight and perhaps the best use
case of all in your car you can get into
your car wirelessly connect and start
using carplay put your iPhone in the
center console and it's charging all
without ever having to plug in a cable
again yes what makes this possible yeah
Nate plus why was charging with Qi
and she is the leading openness wireless
charging standard and we hope to help
chief by increasing adoption of it in
creating new use cases for it thank
goodness it's not proprietary good jobs
airports cars have started to build and
support for qi wireless charging and the
work with iphone a beauty companies are
offering cheap charters and those that
are chief certified should all work with
iphone 8 and we've worked with some
developers are creating cheap charges
and we're gonna offer them in our stores
and online for our iphone 8 customers
like this one from Mophie and this one
from Belkin
so that's iPhone II it's a new
generation of iPhone
it improves on everything we love about
eyes I told you guys not Iike it's not
everything technologies from the glass
and aluminum design to the retina HD

your iPhone 8 it's gonna start with
twice the capacity at 64 gigabytes and
of a second one at 256 gigabytes and the
price will be six hundred and ninety
nine dollars iPhone 8 plus will have the
same two configurations 64 gigabytes and

September 22nd and we can all upgrade to
iOS 11 starting on September 19
so that is iPhone 8 I like to turn it
back to Tim
iPhone 8 a new generation of iPhone and
a huge step forward but we're not
stopping there what did I say we do have
one more thing pulls out the Steve Jobs
one more thing though pulls it out we
have great respect for these words and
we don't use them lightly our teams have
been hard at work for years on something
that is important to all of us the
future of the smart phone the first
iPhone revolutionized that decade of
technology and changed the world in the
process now ten years later it is only
fitting that we are here in this place
on this day to reveal a product that
will set the path for technology for the
next decade big words
yep
like like we said like we said and he's
called the X and as expected
this is iPhone 10 it is the biggest leap
forward since the original iPhone and to
tell you all about it I'd like to invite
Phil back up bill book is fired out in a
hole leak he never raises his bull I can
imagine there are a lot of people at
Apple that didn't get much sleep last
night preparing for this is this this is
so exciting and it is all screen
it is beautiful to look at it is
incredible to hold the display fix edge
to edge talk to bottom it goes into each
corner where it follows the tight curve
of the design it's glass on both the
front in the back using the same
super-strong formula as iPhone 8 the
beam is made from a surgical grade
stainless steel it's both durable and
polishes to a beautiful finish and look
how the glass and the stainless steel
fit form a continuous surface from front
to back there has never been anything
like it it's engineered to be water and
dust resistant at a microscopic level
comes in two beautiful finishes space
gray and silver each has incredible
depth in a pearl essence to the color in
the glass iPhone 10 has an all-new
display it's called the super Retina
display super maintenance
amoled for our quality and
responsibility and wonder does it easily
work really quite a breakthrough in
mobile displays start with the super
Retina display is five point eight
inches on the diagonal which will be
done same size as the galaxy s 86 by
1125 resolution that's over 2.7 million
pixels
there's 458 pixels per inch now this is
the highest resolution and pixel density
ever in an iPhone it's remarkable how
this larger display can be packed on the
phone that fits so comfortably in our
hands the super Retina display uses OLED
technology this game's first OLED
display great enough to be in an iPhone
traditional OLED displays have had great
benefits like high contrast and
resolution and no backlight means you
can make them thinner but they came with
trade-offs and brightness and rich
colors and color accuracy at least
compared to our retina displays but the
super Retina display overcomes all of
these deficiencies and lives up to all
that we expect from an iPhone display in
addition the new super Retina display
she Samsung more neatly though those
vision and HD more nuts it has an
incredible a million to 1 contrast ratio
there's the best color accuracy it
integrates our unique 3d touch
technology right into the display and
like iPhone 8 includes true tone now all
this innovative super Retina display
technology is great but it's the point
of it that matters and the point of it
is to enable an entirely new experience
that's more fluid more intuitive so
let's start with a simplest thing how do
you wake up your iPhone 10 well
certainly you can raise to wake just
like before but now you can also just
tap on the screen and it wakes up now
with the display going edge to edge and
top to bottom bottom there's no more
home button now this is an important
part and a big step forward in the
iPhone user experience hmm something we
use hundreds of times
today for so many tasks is an
opportunity to rethink how iPhone should
work and how we can make it better so
now when you want to go to the home
screen you simply swipe up from the
bottom you go home it's that simple
it's that easy it's incredibly smooth
and once you do it for the first time
you'll know there's never been a better
way he and it works the same way across
the system you're running an absolute
like mail and you want to go home
what do you do you simply swipe up from
the bottom and you go home you can not
intuitive so much nicer now the same
fluid gesture also works for multi
tasking so if you're in an app and you
want to multitask you just swipe up the
bottom you pause for split second and
you're a multi tasking and then you can
tap on any app and jump right to it we
also use the home button for Syria so
how are we going to do that now well of
course you can just</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
