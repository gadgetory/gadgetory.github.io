here together the last time I receive
something from these guys zv e it was a
good time
these guys make very unusual cases for
iphones and they finally got their
product ready for the iphone 7 so what
did i do i did exactly what you expected
me to do bring it to you because you
need to know what's happening in the
world of weird iphone cases this is no
exception what made this company famous
with the iPhone 6 version they have as
far as I know one of the only cases
that's ready for party mode so there it
is now zone of variety and excellence
that's what the zv stands for i think
it's available on amazon as well now
right now you're saying lou it looks
like a bizarre black iphone case that's
chunkier than it should be ok there's
good reason for that below this little
trapdoor right here is a coil like a
heated coil and you'll see the flame
icon there you can light something I've
got the dawn Thomas is back
alright from the original video the Don
Tomas is back for the iPhone 7 version I
just want to put this out there I don't
smoke right I don't recommend that you
do either but there is a purpose I think
beyond just smokers for a case like this
specifically with those people in the
survivalist realm as a fire starter look
at that you lift that up boom oh they
read they change the design of that a
little bit
watch the coil just heat up boom so if
you're a survivalist type dude you get
yourself a little twig you've got a
light now you make a fire I don't know
use you survive an extra 15 minutes in a
zombie apocalypse if only if the Bears
don't get you did you hear their story
about the bear with the dog the bear is
getting the dog oh you're being
sentimental about it you don't have a
bad value dog man a polar bear only
knows how to kill there's no berries all
right there's no rummaging seals
penguins you name it arctic fox
it'll take what it can get you
don't want to mess with especially if
you're a dog things you're getting pet
let me tell you something not getting
pet you're getting massage like a piece
of sweet veal she's getting ready for
dinner time we just want to believe some
alternate reality beyond the one that we
actually have in which polar bears and
bears and other dangerous creatures are
these friendly things that only exist in
storybooks and have a voice all right
story time is over it's time to grow up
anyway so you got a lighter on it now
they took it a step further all right
for the iPhone 7 since it's party time
you've also got a bottle opener in the
top let's give them the warning jack
tobacco smoke affects everyone all right
listen kids out there
iPhone 7 I got a matte black version
over here it's about to get upgraded
just clips right in actually kind of a
nice little grip on it oh wait this is
an upgrade it looks like they've put a
lightning oh my goodness so you don't
need a separate cable
ZV either you've outdone yourself in
this model now the question is does it
work let's crack it gon Tomas here
moment of truth here we go they did it
again I'm about to set up the fire alarm
again hmm look it worked okay hang on
there just Barney tied over here
oh brother nice one that's actually a
good bottle opener the schnitzel brow
German like my last name schnitz a bra
somebody tell me what that means in the
comments are here we go
Jack that's uh hmm that's very unique
flavor there's almost like a sweetness
to it go ahead jack have yourself a swig
drinking on the job giving thanks right
now one more all right Jack here you go
we're giving thanks enjoy it the party
case I mean it's pretty self-explanatory
is it perfect for Thanksgiving is it
perfect for Christmas is it perfect for
Hanukkah and everything else that people
celebrate
yes I think it is I'm definitely gonna
set off the alarm though that's the
thing and I'm gonna blame gve designs to
the non-smokers just think about it
campfire style outdoorsy types maybe
you're one of these guys with all those
scented candles like Jack hey what's he
got going on a little scent it
how smoky isn't he right I gotta put
this out I can put this out
oh the candle smells like chamomile we
love it we love it the iPhone lighter
case where'd you see it unbox therapy
that's cool I'm not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
