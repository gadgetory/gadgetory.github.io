4d sneaker the the future craft 4d
sneaker this one is the ZX 4000 this
actually has like a back to the future
look style vibe to it
so today I've got some some futuristic
sneakers some high-tech sneakers now
I've showcased some in the past I showed
you the nike hyperadapt what was it the
name of those will the self-lacing ones
adapt bv who was the basketball version
of the adapt lineup from nike they've
been working on self-lacing sneakers for
a while and that has kind of been the
the perception of like what the
futuristic sneaker would be of course
all based all the way back to back to
the future when what's the his name
infant Marty McFly had the self-lacing
sneakers Nike continues to go in that
direction with a battery and a recharge
base and so forth it's all very cool in
that department but I'm just not sure
how practical it is as a futuristic
sneaker like what are people really
looking for what is futuristic about
sneakers I take a look at myself I'm
like the sneakers I'm wearing these days
ultra boost from adidas it's like what
do I like about them why are they and
how are they different than the older
more traditional stuff lighter more
comfortable so the futuristic mist the
advancement the progression there has
taken place in material science through
the way that they are manufacturing the
soul and through innovation in from
design and manufacturing and maybe less
so from your typical traditional idea of
like let's just stick a battery in it
and some electricity and now we have the
future so anyhow that brings me to this
sneaker that's in front of me I've
wanted to check this thing out for a
very long time I just never pulled the
trigger and purchased it I of course did
so now this is a 4d sneaker it's called
the ZX 4000 it's a 3d printed sole on
this sneaker with the potential in the
future of even doing full-out custom
soles for an individual foot a human
beings foot if you look at the footage
of how this thing is manufactured
I mean it's like if you've seen a 3d
printer before but apparently this is a
bit more rapid considering the fact that
they have to deliver a significant
number of these I think when the whole
project started it was like 500 on the
first run and they're up to thousands
now many thousands of these things
they're out in the world in public it's
all very cool and like I said to me in
my mind as far as practicality goes this
is closer to the future of sneakers this
one is the carbon color there's a couple
different colors that is so whoa that is
look at this okay so as you catch a
glimpse of this this webbing in here is
the special stuff the shoe less so I
mean I'm sure there's all kinds of
high-tech materials in the shoe but this
is the difference maker this is why
you're spending the money and this is a
completely new take on how cushioning
should be done within a sole now of
course the silhouette the style of the
shoe very similar to something like an
ultra boost sneaker but a completely
different implementation and this entire
sole along the bottom popping out of a
of a 3d printer in the form of liquid
originally liquid using some form of
light synthesis it's a it's an amazing
process to see now of course I have
questions
how will this sole match up to something
like ultra boost air max or something
like that that's already out there
because it has to be more comfortable it
can't just look cooler it has to serve a
purpose also durability I have questions
about the durability since it is so new
age one thing I'll say it does feel a
little bit heavier maybe then an ultra
boost shoe hang on hold up yeah it's a
bit heavier straight away but there's a
ton of material there in the mid section
it's like this web of strands it's hard
to believe it's even standing upright
unboxing experience is pretty
straightforward
shout out to gulp by the way that's
where I got these sneakers from you can
see you have the old-school digital kind
of font in there like a calculator might
have ZX 4000 underscore 40 and on the
bottom side you can see the same design
language following through to the bottom
part of the sole what is that era it's
kind of like it's like video
from the 90s or something n64 I don't
know why it's bringing me back to that
but this is the most tame by the way of
the different color options I know that
seems crazy cuz you got all these yellow
stitching and stuff this is the most
tame one anyway let me get it on oh by
the way did you guys they didn't even
see the shirt yet Jack
Raptors Game one I mean I'm not trying
to celebrate yet but this this shirt
they gave out I'm just wearing it
proudly that's all don't ask me this is
just a nice game one am i right jack
hey little demo here so the construction
issue itself feels very similar
it's uh it's very cool it's comfortable
it's not ultra boost level comfort all
right so that's this guy right here
I got a lot of these ones it's so
ridiculously comfortable and light
granted this material here it just sort
of looks like it looks like foam I mean
it looks like styrofoam let's be honest
it's not to everybody's taste this is
not on that level it's still an early
version and they didn't try to make a
claim that that's the case this prospect
of potentially turning this into a
custom program in which this thing
because of through 3d printing and a
whole new manufacturing process that you
could have this lined up to your actual
foot specifications the shoe itself is
kind of you know it's it's pretty
typical what's sitting on top of it and
even with the special sole it's there's
no custom attribute to it this is just
this is like everybody will buy the same
one
it feels supportive I would say it feels
more supportive than the ultra boost but
because of that added stability it's a
little bit less squishy all I said I
feel like this is aiming in the right
direction when I start to think about
the future of sneakers and the fact that
you know a lot of clothing and other
items that you put on your body haven't
really changed all that much and then
you have those small little outbursts
like a self-lacing sneakers but there is
room to grow and improve and these
materials can change maybe there's
another way to look at it another way to
do it and to me this is the most
interesting kind of promising new tech
that I've seen in a sneaker in a long
time I'm hopeful but as it stands right
now I'm not sure it's gonna replace my
ultra boost it's still very cool I don't
know if you're into the style or not but
you want to wear something that looks
futuristic I'm telling you that's
definitely it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
