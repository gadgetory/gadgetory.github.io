incredibly popular series here on unbox
therapy gadgets under a particular price
point today we're back to gadgets under
$10 let's go ahead and get straight into
it so first things first on the far side
here we have a light bulb obviously I
wouldn't show you a standard light bulb
this one is a little bit fancier so it's
kind of like a budget version of the
Philips hue or one of those other
programmable Wi-Fi connected bulbs now
obviously this one is a little bit more
low-tech for 10 bucks but you do have a
remote control and you can change the
color of it so for a basic type of
installation you can have all the
ambience of a colorful light without the
expenditure of a Wi-Fi connected one all
right so I have my famous IKEA lamp here
with wireless charger built in I did a
video on this very interesting you can
charge it can lamp you can do it all so
I'm gonna put this in seems right and
now my magic lighting remote controller
I'll pull this tab out we might need
some lights off would you look at that
all the basic ones white blue green red
and then of course the different
sequences the flashing the breathing
cycle look at how look how gentle that
is okay so a simple way to add some
ambience to your light fixture or to
your room
maybe your bedroom without the
investment of a whole setup that's
connected to your network maybe this is
on your bedside table and it's under ten
bucks all right so next up we have a
couple of items here that are kind of
connected this guy here and this guy
here this is for people who drink beer
could work for a coca-cola doesn't
really matter but this one over here is
specifically for bottles look at this
this was like four bucks for both of
these I think this is a bottle cap
remover which also happens to fire the
bottle cap why I don't know for fun I
guess
they give you to include it and they
also give you a ring which can open a
bottle as well a bottle cap opener ring
you got to be a serious drinker to wear
that at all times but it looks like it
should function it's way less fun than
this unit here before I use that I do
want to mention another gadget here the
beer chiller
dick this is for a warm beer in order to
instantly chill it and keep it cold this
little unit here rather than having to
be filled with water it has some sort of
frozen fluid in there you stick this
thing in the freezer and if you get
stuck with the warm beverage you slide
this in and instantly it's cold now in
the package it came with two and just
like on a fancy cooking show I already
have the other one frozen so I'm gonna
crack the beer and then I'm gonna test
this up see how quickly this guy can
cool down a warm beer so you can see
this is frosty very cold we're gonna use
that in a moment first let's try this
bottle opener see how this functions
here alright so this I get in there like
this ooh
very nice look at that comes off quite
easily and then what do we fire it you
ready for this you're gonna lose an eye
here I do not do not fire this at people
okay it's still a metal projectile let's
try it could be fun
oh I've had some good distance to it you
pop the bottle you fire it into the end
there's no mess it is you don't get
these bottle caps lying around
everywhere it actually has some utility
to it it's also kind of fun let's slide
this guy in and see what happens okay
here we go
there's like a gasket a rubber gasket in
there so it's secure
so the beverage itself enters that
chamber and then comes up the ice-cold
contraption it's definitely not ice cold
yet maybe this thing is targeted more at
keeping a beer cold as it says on the
top here but then again if you have a
nice cold beer how long are you holding
on to it what are you doing you hold on
to it for a couple of hours or what you
need to keep it cool to gene to make it
cold let's find out
I mean it's definitely colder but it
ain't ice cold it's not like the hyper
chiller this is more to keep it cold
alright if it's a really hot day you're
out there but it ain't an ice cold beer
alright so next up we have this thing
here zag gadget cleaning foam let's go
ahead and try it let's see here now
you're gonna get fingerprints on your
device no matter what but the thinking
here is you can get it back to a
reasonable cleanliness and then do it
all over again here they are right in
there those guys nobody wants that
nobody won't look at it right there so
we're gonna come with the foam here put
it on the microfiber ooh
okay it's like a car wash up in here and
we're gonna hit the device it does the
trick very nicely in fact oh my a nice
and fresh display it works I didn't
expect otherwise like I expected it to
work the question is how much better is
it then spray one area where I think
this could be real nice is on laptop
displays on the display of your laptop
you're like how did those I never touch
the display on my laptop yet when you
turn off the screen it's like there's
inevitably fingerprints on there I have
no idea how it happens but it always
happened so the last one of the day it
is the arctic breeze mobile it's a USB
fan they're super cheap now this is
under ten bucks and what I liked about
this one it has this maneuverable neck
to it so you can direct your breeze plug
this into the laptop let's do it alright
so you got a USB port on a laptop here
like this one you know you want to have
it kind of up like this I'm gonna twist
it like this look at that
I'm cooling down that's a decent little
breeze going on there you're getting a
nice little breeze staying awake and
what I like here is there's no separate
stand it sits up on this arm here and
there you go alright so there you have
it that's five cool gadgets you can get
right now for under ten bucks and here
is the crazy part this episode has been
sponsored by privacy calm and they are a
site where you can actually set up
virtual credit cards to shop online
while protecting your identity let me
give you an example of how this works
let's say there's a site you want to
shop from but you don't want them to
have your credit card info of your
actual credit cards you can set up a
virtual card think of it like a burner
card and you can move funds from your
actual card to that one so if something
were to go wrong you haven't compromised
your main card and your total balance
you only put into that place what you
want to use for that exact transaction
you can also use these virtual cards for
description services that might be
pulling money directly over time and
then they might give you a hassle when
you go to cancel well who cares they
only had access to a virtual car plus on
certain sites you might not want to give
up personal information you might not
want them to know your address and
things like this that's where privacy
calm comes in it allows you to shop
online without giving up your personal
data or your personal financial info
it's actually really easy to use and it
works like a regular credit card and
because they're sponsoring the show
they're gonna give you guys ten bucks to
star ten free dollars go to the link in
the description sign up try the service
out by any of these gadgets I just
mentioned or any other gadget for that
matter it's free I'm serious it's
actually free shout out to privacy comm
for the cool promo and for sponsoring
this episode now go go spend the cash
I'm serious get one of these gadgets or
maybe there's something better I don't
know comments here's a good one from
Donald Trump something tells me that's
not actually him but very original
username there what one gadget would you
take with you for the rest of your life
this is easy right I think I don't know
am I gonna have battery life am I gonna
have electricity because if so I'm
taking my smartphone okay you can do the
most things I can stay in contact
communicate I could play games on it
I could watch YouTube assuming the
infrastructure stays up and running a
smart phone is that one gadget that's on
you all the time it's the one that gives
you access to everything else so the
rest of my life gadget would have to be
a smart phone here's a good one how do
you get so amped up every episode your
videos are the loudest i watch at times
I've got to reduce the volume but man
it's fun to watch keep up the psychie
you know what that is it's a good
question because I feel that it's
important to bring my a-game to the
table I try to remember what it's like
to get some new gadget because
ultimately I'm an enthusiast first I'm
interested in tech like naturally
without this channel that's why I got
into this channel so if I come on here
and it's just like ho-hum here we go
another product another gadget and I'm
not really doing service to the thing
until what your experience would be like
if you were interacting with that thing
I've done like 1200 videos there's so
many products that come through they
start to just look like a stack it
starts to look like a pie who would want
to watch that if I get pumped about a
product whether it's all
camera or otherwise this is me oh man
I'm like look at that thing that thing
is cool you need to go out and get one
that's me to you and it's me in my
regular life to people who ask me that
question
they say Lou what do I need I say you
need to listen to me right now alright
here's what you need to do that's that's
what I do that's who I am if you can't
get passionate about it why are people
asking you for why are you the one that
people are asking for advice if you
don't even care so the reason I'm amped
is because I care oh here's a good one
hey Lou I've got a question how much
time does it take to record a video do
you get to enjoy your life to believe
yes believe it or not I have a lot of
time left so one thing about my videos
is that they're never scripted ok
there's there's I'm not sitting down and
I'm like formulating how I'm going to
express something I want it to be
organic you know I want to just I want
to go off the top like what is this
thing making me feel how am i
interpreting it what is the impression
what is the reaction those are the
important components to me so because of
that it means I for the most part I get
to sit here put a product in front of me
and see what happens and the good part
about that is it means I can make a lot
of videos I don't need to necessarily
invest my whole life plus I work with
great people who are able to take
certain tasks off my plate when it comes
to editing and other things so I can
have a pretty decent balance between how
often I'm at work how often I'm at home
and how often I'm doing things that I
enjoy there you go three questions
answered for you remember leave your
questions in the comment section of this
video and you might show up on the next
