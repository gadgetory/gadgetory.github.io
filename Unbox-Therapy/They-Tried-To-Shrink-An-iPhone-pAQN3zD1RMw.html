it's growing there's something new all
the time where does it come it comes
here if it's new if it's interesting if
it's cool or if it sucks it probably
shows up here at some point in time
today is no exception
this package is weird-looking it came
from halfway across the world as I'm
told many phone baby cell phone
something or other look I mean it's like
taped up you know it's gonna be good 2.4
inch IPS display it might be the
smallest bone that's ever been featured
here now that keeps changing because
small phones keep showing up but what's
special about this small phone is that
how you're supposed to this small phone
where's that piece this small phone
looks like an iPhone
what's up Apple think about that that's
the phone baby there's an iPhone se I
don't know I think you could say that's
probably step more than inspiration
anyway of course it's not running iOS
it's a it's a knockoff it's running
Android probably with a skin on it I
don't know but that's what it looks like
little camera up there speaker over
there volume buttons a lock switch on
the top it's even got the fake antenna
lines micro USB cable to charge it up a
little power brick a headset definitely
not air pods two batteries 2.4 IPS
display Android 4.2 quad band Bluetooth
0.3 megapixel front camera that's gonna
be fun what's up look oh my okay alright
we are booted up they have made it kind
of look like an iPhone in terms of the
wallpaper here but then it's it's
basically Android when you get into it
although the browser icon is like Safari
same with the people icon music icon
phone icon
so the icons look like iPhone versions
but once you click on them you'll see
it's pretty basic Android here's the
dialer oh my goodness
that is mini you still got a headphone
jack or say about that Jack somehow they
fit it into a phone this size
crafty this one from a company called
posh mobile and I showed you this in a
previous video I called it the smallest
Android phone if I hold those beside
each other I'm not sure I mean it's
pretty comparable if anything though I
probably say the phone baby is a tiny
bit smaller the unveiling of the camera
capabilities of this mini iPhone se
knockoff so I'm gonna load up the camera
here whoa there's definitely no Beauty
mode on this selfie right here here we
go three two one you know what it
doesn't look that bad granted there's
very nice lighting in here and you're
looking at it on the world's tiniest
screen even though this phone is so
small it's actually got dual SIM card
slots it's actually kind of amazing what
they could pack into something this tiny
oh my god typing on this you too
surprisingly I'm able to actually hit
those keys as tiny as they are but how
small YouTube is okay so the speaker's
not the best a little bit garbling who
is this for I have no idea maybe a kid
maybe this is like you're going out
phone when you get all pretty and fancy
and you maybe you hide it in your
cleavage it's a spy thing you want to be
discreet it's a conversation starter I
will say maybe you just want to have
some fun yes it looks almost exactly
like an iPhone se I think something
tells me that's what they were going for
nonetheless they've taken some
inspiration and they've created what I
guess she's one of the world's smallest
Android smartphones</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
