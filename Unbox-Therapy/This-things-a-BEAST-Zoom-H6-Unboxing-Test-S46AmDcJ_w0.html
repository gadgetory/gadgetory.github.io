another unboxing video and today we're
taking a look at a very interesting item
this is the h6 from zoom and as you can
probably tell by the appearance on the
box this is a heavy duty and very
serious audio recorder I've been using
zoom products for a little while now in
fact I'm recording this audio into the
h2n which is sitting right behind me
here this thing is more robust more
intense it includes a number of
different options for getting good audio
whether that be for video or for just
straight-up audio recordings for music
or anything like that so let's go ahead
get inside the box and I'll give you
guys a closer look at what to expect if
you pick up a zoom h6 so Before we jump
into today's video I want to talk a
little bit about my official website
unbox therapy comm I know some of you
have visited it and asked questions
regarding how I built it who's hosting
it etc it's been a little bit of a
secret up until now but I can finally
share it with you I've been using a
service called Squarespace and they make
it incredibly easy to get your own
website up and running just like it was
for me I invested very little time and I
got something that looks pretty damn
decent in my opinion they've got so many
templates to choose from that you can
set something up to your taste I'm
pretty much certain of it and they got
in touch with me they reached out and
said hey listen we'd love to support you
we'd love to sponsor your show and I was
like really man I'm using the service
anyways that's how I built my site so
anyways it's just with some great
synergy there and so they reached out
and said listen if your audience wants
to get a quick little trial we want to
make that available to them so there's a
link down in the description so you can
check out Squarespace for yourself or
you can just type it in you can go to
squarespace.com slash unbox and then
from there in order to sign up and get
your free trial of the service and I
think 10% off as well just go ahead and
type in the offer code unbox 8 I know
you guys are going to be impressed by
the service so do not hesitate
so as I just mentioned I've owned pretty
much every zoom handy recorder that has
ever been on the market this is supposed
to be the best ever so I'm very excited
to take a closer look and find out if
that's the case the back of the box
might look a little intimidating to some
but it's really actually quite
convenient as you can see it's a modular
design meaning you can mix and match
whatever you need depending on your
particular application this box here
includes two different microphone
capsules but then you can go out in the
future and buy some extension capsules
if you need them so for example there is
a shotgun mic there's also an extra two
XLR inputs if you're using a lot of
outboard gear and you need six
multitrack channels this is just really
really cool for an audio guy like me on
the inside of the box you have some
paperwork actually quite a bit of
paperwork you've got a manual in a
number of different languages there's
also a copy of Cubase le 6 so if you
don't have an audio recorder for your
computer then you can go ahead and use
that that's because this device also
functions as an audio interface and in
case you're wondering I'm using it as an
interface right now I've got a shure
sm7b into the device and the audio you
are listening to is coming straight
through the zoom h6 I'm actually really
impressed with it at least what I'm
hearing in my headphones right now you
can let me know down in the comments if
you're happy with equality as well I
think it's an improvement over my
previous setup inside this nice little
hard case that you can travel with
you're getting a closer look now at the
first microphone capsule this is the
stereo capsule you see it has gain
control right on there I'll install it
onto the recorder in a moment but first
let's take a look at the other items
inside the box the next is a mid side
pattern microphone this is very popular
for indie filmmakers when you want to
get a little bit of ambient noise to go
with say some conversation or if you
just want to get I don't know street
sounds or something like that this is
really popular for sampling it also has
a gain control right on the module as
well next there's a USB cable included
this will be used when powering the h6
as an audio interface or if you just
want to use it as a file transfer cable
assuming you don't have an SD card
reader you just don't want to
they've also included a 2 gigabyte SD
card to get you up and running recording
audio straight out of the box there's
some batteries in here and I've heard
some pretty good news on preliminary
reviews that people are getting 10 11
hours of battery life on just those four
double a's when using this as a
stand-alone product there's a foam
windscreen included this will help with
some of those pops and things that come
out of your mouth when you're recording
in close proximity whether that be for
interviews or otherwise that will fit on
to the stereo capsule if you choose to
use it so here's the main attraction the
zoom h6 you've got the battery
compartment on the back of the device
you can also see a tripod mount there
that can be used to mount you know
directly onto a tripod or if you want to
mount on top of a DSLR in the hot shoe
or something along those lines this
thing is just really really versatile
the top of the device is where most of
the controls are you have a nice big
record button you also have these gain
knobs for each of the four XLR inputs
and a minus 20 DB pad on the side of the
device is where you'll find those XLR
inputs that I just mentioned those will
also work as instrument inputs too you
have an SD card slot volume up and down
headphone jack and the power switch is
also on that side flipping it over to
the other side you'll find your USB port
as well as a menu button a jog wheel to
control the menu interface on the device
and two more XLR slash instrument inputs
on the bottom slash front is where
you'll find your line out port as well
as a remote control port the remote
control is not currently available at
the time of filming this but it will be
available shortly and will give you the
ability to stop and start recordings
without actually being right beside the
device the microphone modules feel
really secure to me actually you press
these two little buttons on each side
and you can remove the module or install
it the first one you saw there was the
mid side pattern and here is the stereo
one which is probably a little bit more
common more people will probably be
using this on a regular basis but once
it's installed it feels solid and how
like it's not really going to go
anywhere the foam screen appears to have
a cutout specifically for the stereo
microphone so if you're going to use
this thing for field recording and
interviews this will likely be what your
setup looks like the next thing I want
to do is power up the device install the
four double A batteries and
then boot it up in order to show you the
screen that's included it has a nice
sort of angle to it so if you install
this device on top of your DSLR you
don't have to be right over top of it to
take a look at your levels instead
you've got a nice little angle to glance
at and that's especially important when
you're doing multitrack recording so if
you've got four different sources going
into the h6 you can monitor each of
those four levels and see if you're
clipping you know if you need to turn
down the gain etc so as you can see here
there's a quick little setup process and
after that you're ready to start
recording whether that be the SD card or
straight into your computer which is
what I'm doing right now as I explained
earlier I've got the USB cable connected
I've got a microphone going into the
first XLR port and it's the shirt sm7b
if you're not into audio very much you
might not know that microphone it's a
very popular broadcast microphone but
it's notorious for needing a lot of
power from the preamp on your recording
device in order to sound good I've got
the preamp on the h6 set to seven out of
ten right now and I'm getting a nice
clean signal with very little background
noise so anyways I'm impressed at this
point alright guys that wraps up this
unboxing and first look at the zoom h6
audio recorder if you're interested in
pricing and availability I will put a
