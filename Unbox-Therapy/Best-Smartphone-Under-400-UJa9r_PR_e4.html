another video and today it's comparison
of versus video if you will and possibly
a bit of a guide for what you should be
looking for in your upcoming smartphone
if you're hoping to spend somewhere
between three and four hundred dollars
in front of me I have two devices that
are representations of that I have the
oneplus 2 newly released hotly
anticipated and I've also got the Moto X
play which some of you might not have
heard of yet it might actually be called
something else in the US as a Verizon
exclusive here in Canada it's the Moto X
play it's more about meshing two phones
together that base models will retail
somewhere around 300 bucks we know that
the oneplus 2 starts at 329 and I'm
thinking that the Moto X play will be
around the same these things are right
in each other's wheelhouse they are
they're doing this right now spec wise
not so much this is where things get
interesting as much as they're both
great choices in this price range
they're great choices for different
reasons so let's go ahead and get into
those reasons starting with the oneplus
2 this is the 64 gigabyte sandstone
version I've got the cool D brand skin
up on here carbon fiber two-tone if you
want to customize your oneplus you want
to do it in an inexpensive fashion you
should check out deep brand their link
will be down in the description a cool
looking charge break look at that red
white a nice little cable as well but
this actually brings me to one of my
first points this one features USBC
while the x-play doesn't now you might
not think that is a major advantage
because right now there aren't too many
things that utilize us PC and you'd be
right I think this depends on the
individual whether you see this as an
advantage or a disadvantage but since
this is a channel with a heavy focus on
technology I'll give some props to
oneplus for being on the cutting edge
with that brand new interface and as
things become more widely available that
take advantage of it you'll be ready for
that future moving on to the second
feature that the oneplus 2 has that
motox doesn't is a dual SIM card slot so
you can carry around two different
networks with you so next up we have the
guts of the device and this is where
oneplus takes a step ahead you've got a
faster processor here as well as more
RAM you can get three gigabytes or four
gigabytes of RAM depending on which
configuration you go with next let's
talk about the camera while the oneplus
2 has a 13 megapixel sensor
unlike the Moto X it's capable of
shooting 4k video and it's also got
optical image stabilization on the rear
camera so if you're a video shooter
you're probably going to want to look at
this device as it has those extra
capabilities fingerprint sensor this one
has one and the Moto X does not if
security is a big thing for you or you
like the convenience of unlocking your
device with your finger you can't do
that on the Motorola you can do it on
the oneplus 2
lastly exclusiveness you have to get an
invite there's all these cryptic ways of
securing a oneplus 2 for yourself but
for those who actually get one there is
sort of a point of pride of like yeah
that's my oneplus 2 oh you don't know
what it is that's cool just me and my
oneplus 2 you know you walk around like
it's some kind of achievement that you
even got one let alone an invite I mean
on Twitter
there are giveaways for invites there
are giveaways for the opportunity to buy
something
think about that real quick so the
scarcity or at least the perception of
scarcity here gives you a sort of
exclusive vibe when you have this phone
I'm going to call it an advantage but on
the other side when I get to the
Motorola I'm gonna turn it into a
disadvantage
let's get that part started okay so here
is the Moto X play if you're unfamiliar
with what Motorola has been doing
recently with their devices they've been
emphasizing a sort of pure Android
experience the unadulterated version of
Android and I'm a fan of that now as
mentioned before you're looking at
slightly less horsepower he
in the x-play but how about a bigger
battery this one features a 36 30
milliamp hour battery
how about quick charge like 50% of your
charge in half an hour or whatever it is
now while this model only ships with 16
gigabytes of storage it has
expandability got a micro SD card slot
so you can go ahead and stick a 128
gigabyte card in there a little bit more
durable at least from a water-resistant
standpoint this can take a splash or two
you don't want to dunk it let the Moto G
don't go Duncan other items included in
the box a USB cable as well as a power
brick and a SIM card tool no fancy USB
see now this one is a tough one to
evaluate this could be an advantage or
disadvantage depending on where you
stand it said that Motorola has made
major improvements to the camera here on
the X you now have a 21 megapixel sensor
which is apparently going to be far more
capable than the previous version and
this to me is an advantage granted
cameras attributes are not all about
resolution and that's it it's not all
about megapixels we all know that by
this point in time there's a low-light
sensitivity sensor size
you've got more resolution out of this
camera than the oneplus 2 NFC or the
lack thereof on the oneplus 2 for
whatever reason it doesn't ship with NFC
it could be a deal-breaker
you got NFC over here while you are
gazing at the screen here of the
Motorola there's something you're going
to notice it's not the forward facing
camera that's on every single phone no
it is speakers oh my goodness
front-facing speakers Lou are you
serious is this something that we can
come to expect here in 2015 well in some
cases yes it's actually kind of amazing
that more phones don't feature
forward-facing speakers as you'd imagine
if you use your phone as
your primary device your primary
computing device or even not as your
primary maybe it's just a consumption
device for you while you're lying down
on your couch or something there's
certainly an argument to be made that
the multimedia experience is far better
with forward-facing sound theoretically
it should be clearer should be nicer
easier to deal with you won't cover up
the ports okay so that brings me to my
very last point with the oneplus 2
because an exclusivity and air of
exclusivity about it granted this device
is currently not available everywhere
but once it is it'll be the kind of
thing where you walk into a store and
you hand them money and they hand you a
phone bag it's going to work like any
other smartphone you can just buy it so
long as there's inventory available
there you have it oneplus 2 Moto X play
I hope this helps you guys make a better
decision when trying to figure out what
phone to get next those were the things
that popped out to me when I was looking
at the differences and it's actually
kind of surprising the two phones in a
very similar price point actually have
significantly different attributes and
reasons why you would want one over the
other if you want to check out pricing
and availability I'll drop links to
these two devices down in the
description thank you very much for
watching if you enjoyed this content

below and I'll catch you on the next
episode later guys oh me to purchase
