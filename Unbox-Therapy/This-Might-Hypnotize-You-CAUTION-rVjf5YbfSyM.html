whole spinning thing those spinning
fiasco was over this thing shows up the
ring spinner now this is a different
take it two different things what I kind
of like about this one is it has a a
little bit of practicality to it this
kind of combines two products into one
is the spinning aspect for the maniacs
that are out there but then there's also
a phone stand and a little loop you know
it's kind of like that pop socket thing
where you might want to get a slightly
better grip on your phone that's in
there as well and it's also magnetic so
it supports magnetic holder so you can
just slap your phone up against anything
in and it's not even ten bucks it's
under ten bucks all right sold oh I
almost forgot to take things a step
further there's an app that goes with
this product you can create some crazy
spinning visuals let's see there's a
gold one that's like a rose gold bronze
ish this is silver over here Oh what is
this they give you a graph here oh they
tell you where to put it to get the
perfect spin I guess I'm supposed to
take my seven plus and what like line it
up so it sticks in the right spot open
it up this packaging is actually kind of
genius here you remove the sticky part
let's see if we can get this to line up
perfectly looks about right oh wow that
was that that's actually smart right
there look oh I'm guessing that this
part flips up look at that oh now I'm
holding it you see that the phone
doesn't drop people love this stuff and
then it's spinning that's important to
you it can act as a stand right you guys
gotta check that one's crazy you got to
check that one out a little kickstand
essentially where this one gets crazy is
that the whole thing folds down and then
it spins like that and
I mean I don't it is kind of mesmerizing
naturally just watching it go there well
you're supposed to do is get the app and
apparently it's supposed to turn into a
a real party it's interesting people are
holding it and spinning it oh I guess
look at that there you go just when your
friend said they had the most expensive
fidgets spinner you were like nope here
I am spinning my iPhone 7 plus ok so
it's got these really trippy patterns
I'll grab one here let's get started
whoa what is it doing there what's going
on whoa oh my goodness that is feel like
a minute
you stare into that and I believe that's
how you that's how hypnosis works you
are getting very sleepy now I'll bark
like a dog
how about these stairs this staircase
here Oh whoa there we go whoa how does
it spin for this long what's going on
here jack it just keeps going and going
we've created a monster
man if you look at that on the monitor
for too long oh we have the flashing
light now to go with it
[Laughter]
if the fidgets spinner wasn't crazy
enough for you if it wasn't driving you
crazy enough today's your lucky day
oh whoa look at the depths if you stare
into the center of it I believe we just
created a black hole in fact have you
heard of the Higgs what does that call
Tom we're the particle accelerator
what's the name of it Tom we have
officially created a black hole right in
front of us here and all we needed was
to spinch why is this suggested to me
this photo jack what happens when we
spin them what is happening is there a
secret message in there somewhere if I
go to library I get my own photos I
guess here we are and Oh what happened
to my face that is well then that's a
rough one this look that's outer space
so maybe that will create an actual
black hole there you go that's uh see
that's where you came from Jack yeah you
always ask me the hard-hitting questions
he's like glue but where do I come from
now I finally have the visual
representation for him the answer is
right there stare deeply zoom slowly and
the truth may unveil itself to you
probably not no this is not there's
nothing truthful to what I just said
so is this product insane yes of course
it is it's a spinning phone I
what can I say Jack is seasick now as an
actual holder for your phone that also
acts as a stand and then what I don't
know your your board but your phone is
always with you so maybe you're just
like every so obviously hmm does this
solve that for you or does this just
make you seasick or motion sick like
Jack is right now I'm not really sure
it appears that no one and no thing is
safe from this fidget spinner take over
it is the ring spinner for those that
must spin I was in Paraguay visiting one
of those tribes that's never been
contacted before by the Western world
clothing was sparse spinners were not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
