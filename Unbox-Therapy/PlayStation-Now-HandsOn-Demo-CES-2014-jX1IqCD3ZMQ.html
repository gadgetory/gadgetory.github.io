brought to you by Squarespace what's up
guys Lew here i'm back with more from
the show floor at CES 2014 i'm in the
sony booth right now checking out the
brand new playstation now game streaming
service I'm with Matthew Harper Matthew
Harper and he's going to tell us a
little bit more about how it works and
when we can expect to see it in our
homes right so PlayStation now is our
game streaming service if we just
announced this morning cool at our
keynote what it allows you to do is
allows you to access PlayStation content
from the cloud across the variety of
devices to start we're offering on ps3 a
PSP for PS Vita and 2014 waters about to
get sick cool so in this case what we're
seeing right here there is no
PlayStation involved there is no
PlayStation involved however there's
nothing going on underneath that you
have a dualshock 3 controller right and
a bravia TV and those are plugged
directly into the USB ports on the TV
that's correct amazing and so what we're
watching is being streamed from the
cloud yes promo and I can or to your
device so I suppose you probably need
some significant bandwidth at home to
support something like the
recommendation is 5 mega decks 5 mega
video that's not a bad it's pretty
common cool yeah and so what games are
you guys demoing on the service right
now so for a tech demo purpose only
today we are showing the last of us got
war ascension puppeteer and beyond two
souls very nice I've also noticed that
the PS Vita is sitting over there can it
take advantage of any of these features
yes the PlayStation Vita is an enabled
device and it's supported at launch
you'll be able to access PS or games on
your playstation vita wow that's awesome
so once again just streaming from the
cloud and it's just remember fashion
yeah so just connected via Wi-Fi yes
amazing awesome cool so PlayStation now
is going to be in closed beta at the end
of January and then commercially
available summer of 2014 I can't wait to
check this out once it becomes available
in my house alright guys more from the
show floor coming up very shortly here
at CES 2014
I know
so not only is Squarespace a great place
to set up your very first website it's
also a great place to set up your very
first web store that's because they've
got commerce functionality built right
in no extra charge it's there and it's
very easy to use in fact I have already
implemented it on my site unboxtherapy
calm we sell some t-shirts and some
stickers just basic stuff but it works
just as well for digital merchandise so
if you're a musician maybe a hip-hop
producer or you're in a band and you
want to start to monetize some of your
content it's a great way to reach out to
fans and to actually sell some stuff to
them the interface is incredibly easy to
use trust me I was intimidated at the
concept of e-commerce in the beginning
and having used the squarespace service
I am not intimidated at all anymore in
fact I've had a great experience
tracking orders taking orders taking
payments it's all right there in one
simple easy-to-use interface so one more
reason to check out Squarespace our
official sponsors here at CES 2014 full
details in the description as well as a
special promo code just for you guys
