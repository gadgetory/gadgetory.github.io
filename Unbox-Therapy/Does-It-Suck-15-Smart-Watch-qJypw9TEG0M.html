up guys Lew here back with another video
and I'm very excited yeah whoa because
it is a fresh episode of does it suck
one of my favorite things to do here on
unbox therapy I look at an unusual
product generally an inexpensive product
that proclaims to do something and may
or may not do that thing this my friends
is a $15.00 SmartWatch 15 not fifty
fifteen I'm having a feeling this is
gonna be a fun one it's got Bluetooth
built in kind of important for a
SmartWatch hands-free notifications
micro USB as well as a music player to
be honest this thing goes by a number of
different names on Amazon this one is
called hop century at least that's what
the sticker says a lot of Chinese
writing on the Box gonna take a wild
guess that at one point in time this
device was in China I have to admit my
expectations are pretty low you never
know maybe a $15.00 SmartWatch is the
best bang for your buck in the entire
gadget industry ah the user guide which
appears to open right-to-left thank you
for choosing our u8 devices with a taste
of the function and simple method of
operation a taste of the functions
active the taste the device is used as
long as the brand of intelligent
machines are adapted to use intelligent
machines that sounds amazing
whatever that means I believe this is my
intelligent machine right here so let's
get to it
whoo very well protected for $15 you
know what not too shabby
so far a microUSB cable and then what
the some kind of tool let's see if this
tells meaning about it the whole machine
institutions to introduce
okay I'm on my own here to remove the
strap maybe in here anyway I don't think
it's important for the purpose of what
we're doing right here but you got it
appears to be protected here by some
stickers some kind of screen protector
on the display looks like there's a
speaker followed by the USB port to
charge it up this next one beside might
be a microphone this is probably your
power there's like some goo left on here
look at this from the ah this strap just
maybe I can use my tool now not off to a
good start folks fingernail works better
to be honest with you screw you tool to
debacle already we are still not booting
so that means oh my strap came off I
can't even hold the thing without the
strap coming off come on here okay so um
I charged it for a little bit and now
it's the moment of truth
welcome that is some high resolution
right there I am so worried oh that was
a sick tune not super-bright I can
scroll on it you cannot see the screen
you had power saving now it's much
brighter isn't it settings language
clock okay cool ringtone well it's a
pretty strong vibration
mmm different icon time date fine phone
that's of course since it'll be
connected to your phone on Bluetooth
it's weird like the touchscreen
should we put lights back on I mean I'm
in the complete dark right now
the way you interact with it you have to
be sort of swiping right away I need to
connect this to my to my device real
quick
Samsung connected now connected okay
function and call log now what else
temperature 86 Fahrenheit doesn't seem
idea is it my body heat it's your number
Oh dialing jack
right on here yes you are on the watch
now Wow I mean this is just a cool
little toy for $15 it has a microphone
and speaker in it any and they work
we're having a phone call right now
analog check out that classy style right
there can I send him a text oh I have to
install an app for that okay trying to
stay away from the janky apps little
sketch I'm gonna watch a podcast this
one against me Tony Ferguson Edson was
the one to replace you I mean this is
basic Smart Watch stuff I suppose the
reason I'm a little bit shocked is the
fact that this is $15 are you surprised
a little bit you're not impressed
oh how about this feature and he lost
hang on I'm just gonna walk away to see
what happens yeah okay so look it's
notifying me right now Jesse that
Bluetooth connection lost remind again
question mark no I'm good
probably try it on it's a watch I mean
it's not terrible really I mean I like
all the regular Smart Watch features
that are included in here I would still
say buy a real not real but maybe a more
reputable watch I think it's pretty
surprising I didn't expect it to even do
what it did in this particular case I
would say it doesn't suck it doesn't
suck for 15 bucks some places in the
world you can't even get a milkshake for
$15
I expected greater suckage than what was
delivered so therefore I am confident
I'm going back to my statement doesn't
suck 15 bucks there you have it another
episode of does it suck if you're new to
this series there's a whole playlist
