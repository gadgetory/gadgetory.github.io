products keep coming through the door
can't seem to stop them today we got
some sweet little speakers from Lissy
they're called the sound two speakers
and they're like two little pieces of
Modern Art sitting beside your computer
or laptop and what's special about them
besides the design is the fact that
they're USB bus powered and four bus
powered speakers that consider to be
powerful they got 30 watts of power
without any wall involved so that's
impressive but for me this purchase if
you're considering it should be about
the design because they're gonna make a
statement wherever they sit here we have
our mini Jack connector this connects
one speaker to the other next we'll look
at the manual which you're probably not
gonna need but we got it anyway and if
we grab the next speaker here this is
where all the magic happens you can see
that these speakers were designed in
conjunction with two bass one of the
world's most respected HiFi sound system
companies been around since 1950 you can
see that speaker has the USB on it and
here's just a mini jack to mini jack
cable in the event that you want to hook
up an iPod or something to the device
and the device isn't bus powered that's
what this is for this is the power
adapter in case you want these speakers
in your kitchen or somewhere where there
isn't a computer power adapter looks
like it's an international version
because there no power leads coming out
of it which means we're probably going
to have a bunch of tips for everywhere
in the world I was right
get a closer look here here we have
North America Europe not sure where this
one's from if you're from this country
let me know in the comment section
pretty sure this is the UK now let's see
how they fit in just snap right down in
here anyway
