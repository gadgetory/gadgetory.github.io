there's all kinds of new and exciting
smart phones constantly hitting the
market the Galaxy s8 and si plus very
shortly we're gonna have the new note
series and then beyond that the new
iPhones but today I'm bringing you a
smartphone that you probably have no
clue about you've probably never heard
of it it's a Chinese phone it's from a
company called do G da Jie do G I
ordered it straight from China I ordered
it from Aliexpress but it's emerging now
and available on Amazon so this thing
it's it's making some moves here in
North America and I think most of it has
to do with the ambitious design this one
is unique and the best part of all this
is that this thing is around $200 this
one is the Aurora blue and here we go
we're off to the races here's the device
also in the package
screen protector cloth in there and a
case if you want to use it pretty basic
plastic case now this device happens to
be glass on the front glass on the back
Gorilla Glass in fact stick in whole
feel the world
Jack Tom come here for a second this is
serious man come here for a second can
you please for the people out there
please just read what's on the front of
this stick and hold feel the world whoa
Wow
I don't think I've ever been this
speechless in a smartphone unboxing
stick in the hole feel the world and of
course you can tell what the package is
meant to look like so this look at what
they included in here you have your own
little grip slash stand go on the back
ear device and that kind of pops socket
grip effect micro USB a power brick it
looks like we have the European one the
anticipation what I think might be one
of the more interesting smartphones as
you've never seen or heard of the do G
mix here we are
check that out the doogee mix mmm
basically no bezel a little bit of a
chin there you're telling me that's not
a nice looking foam for 200 bucks
fingerprint sensor on the front and
oddly placed front-facing camera will
test that out in a moment as I said
gorilla glass on the front and back a
dual lens system your microUSB as well
as your speaker and microphone SIM card
tray in this location over here
a traditional headphone jack as well and
once we have this display on you're
gonna have a much better idea of the
effect of this bezel list design alright
so let's go ahead and add a fingerprint
let's test out the fingerprint scanner
here okay sweet look at that now let's
test this fingerprint out whoo
pretty snappy there's a pretty heavy
skin on this unit I mean there's a
little cat dangling around there that's
a very slick looking device around 200
bucks alright now the next thing to be
concerned with is the camera obviously
this is the rear facing camera kaboom
pretty snappy there I noticed there is a
beauty mode for that forward facing
camera let me check that out now this is
odd because you're used to looking up
here at the top the cameras down here so
that's gonna take some getting used to
but anyway the under there you go Jack
what you've been waiting for
duh-duh-duh
no bezel on the top more to enjoy I want
to see how the dual lens thing is
working here so we have the Selective
blur kind of functionality blur out the
background and keep the foreground sharp
it's not the best implementation I've
seen but it is in there a mono mode
panorama and a pro mode where you have
access to all the various camera
settings you might want exposure
aperture and so on what is this little
guy coming down what do I pull that down
its themes I think this launcher is
probably not for you right but that's
the beauty of Android go in you hit the
Play Store okay so just like that Google
now launcher always continue and look at
this I'm back in a very familiar place
I'll pick YouTube
throw it down there maybe I changed the
background I have the Google now
launcher you have this device that
you're gonna show off people can be like
man what are you using what did you pay
for that you got the nice-looking
Android on there
in reality you pick this thing up for a
couple hundred bucks Jack look at that
is that slick or what that's a good look
cheap phones are getting much better
you're gonna get fingerprints right it's
a glass backbone that's gonna happen
the speaker listen the speaker is mad
let's just do a quick comparison to the
Galaxy s8 louder that's a lot more money
your expectations you have to adjust
them a little bit for a $200 device I
think if you have two hundred bucks to
spend on a phone and you want to own it
outright and you want it to be unlocked
I don't think you're gonna be
disappointed just remember wipe that
software off it looks like a high-end
phone it feels like a high-end phone it
does not have a high end price this
might be the coolest phone that you've
never heard about but now you have cuz
