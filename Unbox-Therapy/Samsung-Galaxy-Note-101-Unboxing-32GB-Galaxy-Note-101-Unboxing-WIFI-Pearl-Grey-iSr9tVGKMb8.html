therapy and today we're taking a look at
the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 this is a
1280 by 800 resolution Android tablet it
features a quad-core processor at 1.4
gigahertz you've got full HD playback
and recording capabilities that's gonna
happen through your 5 megapixel rear
facing camera or the 1.9 megapixel front
facing camera now those specs sound good
and most people would be happy with that
on their tablet but that's not really
what makes the note series famous what
does is the fact that you're gonna get
something called the S Pen included and
you're gonna get legitimate pen input
pen entry into this device and I'm not
talking about an aftermarket stylus that
you use on like an iPad this is
legitimate you're getting an active
digitizer and what that means is a lot
more precision much more similar to
actually using a pen in real life
instead of an afterthought like it is on
the current generation iPad so I'm
really excited about testing this thing
out and getting a better idea of just
how that functions if you guys are
interested in pricing and availability
on this product I'm gonna put a link
down in the description so definitely go
check that out if this sparks your
interest at all if you want to see the
full specs etc so let's do the unboxing
you saw the device first we're gonna get
back to it in more detail but first we
have to cover the other items inside of
the box
you've got your usual paperwork from
Samsung there's some user manual stuff
as well as warranty information you've
also got a number of extra tips included
these little nubs can be installed into
the pen if you happen to wear wear down
the one that's pre-installed next we
have a USB cable this is obviously going
to be used for charging the device as
well as syncing it to your computer if
you choose to
it has Samsung's proprietary connector
on one end unfortunately but that's what
they've chosen to use you've also got a
number of different ear tips that's
because this device includes a set of
headphones now that's a positive reason
I say that is because most manufacturers
have given up on including headphones
and even though I've got so many
headphones lying around and so many that
I could choose to use it's always a
positive to see them included for
individuals who might not and also
people who buy the device and hope to
get it completely up and running right
out of the box
the next thing is probably the most
self-explanatory aspect of this unboxing
you've got your power adapter mine
happens to be North American because of
my location so here's a closer look at
the actual device and I think it's
pretty good-looking the first thing that
catches my attention are these speakers
they're forward-facing and I really wish
tablet manufacturers all did this it
just makes sense your ears are in front
of the tablet not underneath it not
behind it you've also got a couple of
cameras one on the front that I just
showed you and then this one on the back
right here this is the better one I have
five megapixels as I mentioned earlier
in the video you've also got an LED
flash and then your s-pen it lives in
the bottom of the device it's got a
metallic finish on the top there's also
a button there which you can use for
modifiers and whatnot and you've also
got a nub on the bottom as I mentioned
before a very precision tip that's the
part that is user replaceable if you
happen to wear that one down now it
feels really solid once its installed
doesn't feel like it's gonna come out
accidentally on the top of the device
you have your power button volume rocker
there's a microSD slot you've got an IR
transmitter which is really interesting
and you've also got a headphone jack
once again here's a closer look at the
s-pen in terms of size it's about 3/4
the size of a standard everyday ink pen
just to give you some kind of scale I
probably should have held one up at that
point there's also a microphone on the
bottom of the device as well as the
proprietary connector that I mentioned
earlier to go with that proprietary
cable now booting up the device it's
obviously gonna take me into the setup
but rather than make you guys sit
through the boring setup I'll go ahead
and do that off camera and then come
back and show you guys how this thing
works how the pen entry works and how
responsive it is it might be hard to get
it across to you in video but anyways
I'm gonna boot up Samsung's application
that you know is designed to take
advantage of this s-pen but first I'll
boost up the brightness so you get the
best look you can this screen does go
very bright for the record my
environment is very well lit so boosting
a screen to full brightness sometimes
doesn't give you an accurate
representation of how bright it is but
believe me it is bright it is bold it is
beautiful it is a nice screen so here is
the application S note and this is where
you can do a couple of different things
you can write notes regularly like I did
right there of course the first thing
anyone ever writes is hello how
cleeshay and the erase function works
really well this is all really really
responsive I'm sure you can tell that
right now everything happens quickly and
precisely as I said earlier that was my
expectation and I'm just gonna write a
few goofy things here it also does
recognition so you can write something
out and then it can turn that into text
otherwise you're looking at a pretty
standard Android tablet of course
Samsung has skinned it so they've put in
a few of their own special features but
it still is a very similar experience to
what you're used to on the Galaxy Tab
lineup of tablets but this does have
some features like you can do split
screen you can have a couple of apps
open of course those do have to be some
very specific apps you can't just use
like YouTube on half the screen that was
what I was really hoping they would add
something like that
they've also included a copy of touch
based Photoshop which is really cool
although I was terrible at it I'd
there's a bit of a learning curve I had
to go through some of those tutorials
anyway guys if you enjoyed this unboxing
of the Galaxy Note 10.1 please leave it
a thumbs up it does help out a bunch and
otherwise thanks as always for watching
my content it really does help out for
those of you that are waiting on you GPC
