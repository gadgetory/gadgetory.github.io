the Apple earpods these are headphones
earbuds that have gotten a lot of
attention there's people who love them
they're in their ears all day long then
on the other side of the spectrum
there's people who are not happy with
these at all they say I don't like the
way they look I don't like the way they
fit they're falling out of my ears now
to me I'm not too offended it is an odd
design I agree with that in order to
satisfy those naysayers those
individuals who are upset about this
product or are not convinced yet that
they should pick it up I decided to make
a video on the various accessories that
have arrived here to make that product
better and maybe fix the things that you
don't like about the Apple earpods so
the first product product called ear
hooks and this is gonna be for
individuals who just don't like the fit
these clip-on to the air pod and give it
a more robust grip on your ear goodbye
earbud frustration great for any sized
ear a little diagram of how to figure it
out so there's two pairs inside here
they're very soft actually they're
different sizes has a slightly longer
ear hook and then this one here a little
bit shorter the earbud is now
transformed there you'll really that
look at that there so the material
itself it grips your skin better than
the smoothness of this one slightly more
seal yeah that's true too from a sound
perspective but definitely if these
things don't fit your ear canal well to
begin with this is going to be a huge
change you have a problem when you go
into the charging unit obviously no dice
these are gonna be a go-to if you're
into fitness you absolutely need this
earbud to stay in there or this is just
a terrible fit for you that's the ear
hooks it's about 10 bucks next up this
might be my favorite one this is the air
pods charging station from a company
called a Lago I think this is a little
more expensive than the other remedy
it's basically a little dock this is a
simple place to drop your air pods into
if you are a regular user the
expectation here is that you'll install
your own lightning cable there's cable
management
down there at the bottom so I'll just
feed this up and through and then
there's a cutout on the back where you
feed the cable up so it sits flat like
this you take your air pod and I guess
you just look at that pull it off drop
it in and then of course I lift this up
you can see you have the orange light in
there a simple contraption maybe
something that would have been nice to
have in the box a really convenient
little spot to charge up your air pods
maybe you're a rugged individual and
you're worried about your expensive
Apple headset that's where this comes in
the catalyst for air pods a waterproof
air pod case up to three point three
feet 360 total protection and is dropped
proof from 4 feet access to your
lightning connector to charge it another
fairly simple design here slide them in
like that and that's about it it's tight
enough fitting that you don't completely
need to cover the top and of course this
carabiner goes through this hole here so
you could clip it to something oh you
fold that back and you get access this
little lip here intentionally folds down
like that and then you flick that up and
you have access to your ear buds there's
another flap this orange portion so you
can charge them up with the case on if
you've ever had a phone that's lived in
a pocket or a purse or something the
port the Lightning port you know the
lint gets in there it's disgusting it's
terrible let's see mine right now how
bad is it
is it brutal it's actually not bad so
moisture dust crumbs and things can't
get in there that's pretty cool
ok so the last accessory is this one
here I really have no idea about this
it's called the air buddy buds and
secure cord for air pods and they claim
that this little unit will enhance the
sound as well
I'm skeptical on that never lose your
air pods although it kind of turns them
into wired headphones like that traction
earbuds so it looks like they're gonna
have a little more grip on them cable
and buds organization and a lightning
for attachment ok ah this actually could
be kind of convenient to be honest so
you slide the air pod in
the other end goes into the other side
like that and then this
I'm guessing goes behind your neck and
then like that and now if I want to have
a conversation if I want to take these
off temporarily
I can just drop them down here like this
and they stay in place what's the other
element here ah each of these little
doors opens up and then in there are
these guys and these are kind of like
the ear hooks without the hook component
so you can see what that looks like
there oh that's quite a bit more grip in
there actually I like that fit there
claiming is a sound enhancement that
might be a consequence of just having a
slightly better seal I mean its marginal
like it's maybe just think it's tiny bit
more I'll do one in one get one with one
without yeah I guess so I mean it's
slightly better with the cover on it's
still not the best sounding earbud that
exists not by any means but it becomes
slightly more sealed which is it a tiny
bit more bass or the interpretation of
bass that's what the cover on it's also
got this little placeholder you can
connect it to the case look at that look
at that deal right there so you can
remember to bring this accessory around
do these little gadgets these little
accessories didn't really fix completely
fix to the airpot I don't think this
thing is broken I find it to be
convenient at times I have so many other
headphones and for me they actually fit
pretty good so it's not a huge issue but
there are improvements that could be
made and here's a couple of accessories
that can help to do that the marketplace
for completely wireless earbuds is
expanding rapidly but if you're on the
iOS side these still might be the most
convenient so why not use some of those
options to make them a little bit better
for you yourself some ear hooks get
hooked up don't drop these in a sewer
grate you'll thank me later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
