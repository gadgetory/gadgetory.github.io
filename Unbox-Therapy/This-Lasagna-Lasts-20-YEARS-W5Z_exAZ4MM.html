another video and today I've got another
kind of mystery unboxing I suppose you
could call it I've done something like
this before from a different company and
inside supposedly is a set a variety of
survival things they don't write zombie
apocalypse on here but I know that's
where your head is going crack this baby
open oh my
this baby is packed holy what do we have
okay cotton ball waterproof match case a
key to survival put your matches in
there it's waterproof you get dunked in
the river you're still good first aid
very important unboxing can be dangerous
I have like little cuts on my hands I
got to keep these nearby
sticker I'm not sure that really
probably wouldn't help you in a survival
situation a raft would that's it no a
bag it's a bag heavy duty cord paracord
the real survival dudes know what's up
when it comes to paracord now this
firestarter I've experimented with this
before go back I did a different box I
started a fire in here
it's probably dangerous what do we have
here
ah no survival box would be complete
without a knife obviously some more
paracord
wrapped around the handle heirloom seeds
post-apocalypse and now your china reset
tomatoes cucumbers and squash get her
started up again like the pilgrims oh
this is important little LED flashlight
probably needs a battery or something
definitely add a battery before you
think you're gonna survive with it okay
whoa emergency drinking water 4.2 to 5
ounces of water in a bag recommended
life five years another thing I've
noticed in these survival boxes always
got the start a fire anywhere anytime
ooh look at that waterproof matches to
go with your waterproof case that's
double waterproof so kit you got a good
look at that there jack
little dunkaroo you remember dunkaroos I
cracked it Oh baby
yes sir money in the bank
Jack this is uh what are we
am i eating this right now oh man
bring four cups of water to a boil add
the contents turn it off and let it
stand for 12 to 15 minutes and then
you've got lasagna oh my look at this
best buy day up here
that's 2036 my friends I'm gonna be 150
years old teriyaki rice I find this to
be a little more trustworthy for sermon
I feel like water rice what are we doing
are we really boiling water in the
microwave I'm gonna test some lasagna
capable of living until 2036 2036 so I
have some boiling water here
I'm a guy who likes lasagna but stir I
guess this isn't all that different from
like instant noodles or whatever except
I don't think instant noodles lasts as
long as this does cover for 15 minutes
what's gonna happen in 15 minutes it's
not gonna be soup anymore it's gonna be
actual as anja the rice would have been
safer but no jack it's gotta be the
little Anya cheesy lasagna I'm concerned
right now okay it's been 15 minutes
brewing in here fairly strong dog food
vibes going on really soupy still as
well I don't know how hot that
you know what not that bad no no but let
me go back for a second it's edible I
mean it ain't gonna surpass you're known
as lasagna no in fact you're known as
you probably gonna kill you if you bring
this home a little chewy forgot be
honest I just ate 20 year lasagna</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
