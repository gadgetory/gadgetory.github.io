therapy and today I'll be showing you
how to upgrade your macbook pro it's a
little bit different than usual you know
normally it's unboxing videos but I
thought this was going to be really
useful for you guys you can heavily
improve the performance of your macbook
pro whether it's a 13 inch or 15 inch
just remember this will not work on the
retina models so this is one of the
reasons I'm still a big fan of the non
retina models because you can go in
there and put whatever SSD you want put
as much RAM as you want and then swap
them out switch them at a later date
you're not tied in to only having one
configuration SSD technology has come a
long way and it changes very rapidly so
having that ability is a big deal we're
also going to be putting 16 gigabytes of
Corsair memory in here in terms of SSD
we'll be using the Samsung 830 series a
really high performer this is the 128
gigabyte model if you guys want to put a
bigger SSD or you want to use this exact
one all you got to do is check out the
links down in the description everything
that I use in this video in terms of
this upgrade will be linked down there
so you can not only check out pricing
and availability but you can actually
replicate this upgrade if you want to do
the same thing I've done here in terms
of the actual process it's pretty easy
at least to me I don't know I've done
this a couple of times and it can be
intimidating at first you can get this
little bottom plate removed and then
when you get inside the MacBook Pro
you're kind of like oh where do I go
next but ultimately it's just about
confidence and it's about being gentle
and not forcing anything and just you
know making intelligent assumptions I
guess that's how I want to put it but if
you guys need more detailed information
than what's being provided in the video
which is kind of vague I'll put a link
in the description to full high-res
photos and a teardown so you can follow
that along with the video hopefully that
can help you get this process done
yourself it's easier than you think so
the first thing to do is to remove the
battery power from the logic board
that's the first thing I did you just
unclip it pretty easy to do that just
make sure that you're not having any
power getting pushed through to the
logic board while you're working on it
in this particular upgrade we'll be
keeping the traditional hard drive and
using an adapter like this this fits
into the optical drive bay and allows
you to install a two and a half inch
drive whether it's an SSD or even a
another traditional hard drive so that
you can keep a bunch of storage while
really upgrading your performance with
an SSD like this Samsung 830 this is a
128 gigabyte drive as you guys know in
the SSD world things are a little more
expensive so getting your operating
system and applications onto an SSD can
really improve the performance of your
system it's an amazing upgrade
comparative to the price and then you
can still keep your traditional hard
drive for media and larger files that
performance doesn't really benefit in a
big way if you guys know what I'm saying
so what you want to do here is remove
all the ribbing cables connecting the
optical drive and the traditional hard
drive to the motherboard or logic board
in the Apple world then you're going to
need to remove the traditional hard
drive even though it's only going to go
back into the location where it came
from as I said earlier guys you are
going to want to look at the high-res
photos provided through the link in the
description if you actually do this I'm
hoping that you can use this video along
with those sort of as a companion to
make you feel more comfortable about
doing this upgrade yourself so if you're
like me and you rarely use the optical
drive on your system removing it and
using one of these adapters is a
fantastic way of improving the
functionality of your system in many
ways like if you want to go with two
SSDs you could get a performance raid
you could use it for redundancy by
having a backup drive that's actually
right in the system there's just a
number of ways to really improve the
functionality of your system by doing
something like this I'm a really a big
fan of this and it's the main reason
that I still like the older design of
MacBook Pros yes it's a little bit
thicker it's not quite so thin but
having this ability to pick the latest
and greatest in terms of SSDs and
install them whenever you like with just
you know half an hour of time and
removing a couple of screws to me that
is invaluable especially for a pro user
who is constantly looking to upgrade
performance and also looking for
redundancy and backup on the adapter you
will need to install two screws to
secure the SSD on the bottom other than
that it's pretty simple you want
reinstall it the same way as you took
out the original optical drive and then
you'll tighten down the traditional hard
drive back into the location it came
from so as you can see here we're
completely finished we have two quick
drives installed well one
thicker than the other but both running
on SATA 3 and what this means is that
we're going to get great performance and
still have a bunch of storage so we can
use that for backup media files
everything that I said before you're
going to want to reinstall all the
components so that they're tied down
tightened down back where they came from
and you're also going to want to make
sure to plug in all the ribbon cables
that originally came off the board when
you were removing the optical drive the
next thing to do is install the RAM
upgrade as I mentioned earlier we're
using some Corsair values select great
value as the name implies in the RAM
world this is 16 gigabytes of ddr3 and
as I mentioned earlier if you want to
replicate this upgrade you can use the
exact same Ram and I'll link it down in
the description so you can be sure that
it works in my case I've booted the
system after this video of course and
made sure that it's performing as it
should so definitely check out the link
in the description if you want to pick
up some value select 16 gigabytes or
otherwise now after everything is
installed and you boot up your system
remember you can still boot to your
traditional hard drive because it's
still got your files in your OS on it
then you'll notice that there's a new
Drive in Disk Utility the SSD that you
just installed now you do need to set it
up to install your OS to it you have to
give it a name as well as format it this
is for obvious reasons in this case will
be formatting it Mac OS extended
journaled and at this point I do want to
mention that the easiest way I found at
this point here once you get to the end
of replicating your installation is to
clone it over to the SSD so I used a
program called super dooper and all you
do is you do a straight clone from your
traditional hard drive to the SSD
assuming it will fit and then what you
want to do is delete or wipe out your
traditional hard drive and then you can
organize files after the fact so you can
move media files etc over to the
traditional drive while maintaining the
important files that you want the OS the
applications you know files that can
benefit from the performance
improvements you're going to want to put
those on the SSD or keep them on the SSD
so anyway guys I know I didn't go into a
terrible amount of detail here but the
purpose of this was just to make you
more comfortable with upgrading your
MacBook Pro this will work for either
the
13 inch or 15 inch I've linked in the
description the SSD as well as the RAM
that I used and the drive bay adapter so
you can get rid of that old-school
optical drive and actually start using
that space for something
mission-critical like an SSD more
storage a raid a backup drive there's
really so many things you can do so this
is a major reason to pick up one of the
non-retina model MacBook Pros anyway
