another video and today I'm actually
going to be talking about something that
was featured a long time back on a show
called three cool tech deals this was
one of those cool things that I
mentioned was really interesting to me
I'm like you know what I'm just gonna
order it up it is a mini Bluetooth
keyboard with a built-in touchpad
interacting with your gadgets from the
couch lean back style lean back position
which believe it or not it's a great way
to enjoy unbox therapy videos launch the
unbox therapy marathon playlist if you
didn't know that playlist existed it's
over four hours of therapy
it'll probably solve most of the
problems in your life so I think the
company is called like QQ or something
it doesn't even say it on here you could
check the link in the description if you
want to check it out yourself it'll work
with your laptop your desktop iOS and
Android that continues working times
about 20 hours uses Bluetooth 3.0 you
guys know when you're on the couch and
you have to input text ah drives you
crazier look tick tick tick tick tick
tick anticipate Pizza ticket today click
click nightmare it's actually sleeker
than I expected wow that's really that's
really slim you can see that there Jack
you've also got a micro USB cable to
charge it up tiny bit of paperwork we
don't need it let's see maybe it has
some power right right now power out the
gate
it does bluetooth LED fires up kinda has
a video game controller footprint to it
on the bottom micro USB for charging it
up multimedia buttons on the top here
Bluetooth button volume controls mute
play pause fast-forward and such a
search button so that that's pretty cool
of course you've also got a left click
right click for the mouse buttons you
can either use these ones down here or
the corner buttons for mouse clicks see
if it does what I hope it to do
that make any sense oh action I'm in so
now I'm navigating unbox therapy of
course I love it I mean this stuff like
this it's so simple but useful you just
don't realize it so you have something
like this in your hands man I have had a
Mac Mini hooked up in my living room for
years now I've always had some kind of
media center there just because no
matter what streaming box I came across
there was always something I couldn't do
without a full browser or full OS so I
have the full-size keyboard sometimes
with the trackpad on the side I've had
the earliest like Apple wireless
keyboards and stuff but inevitably those
things get put away cuz other people
that I live with
does that why am i doing that
other people like to put away those
things like big things messing up my
living room blue something like this
though it fits into the realm of like
remote like a remote control closer so
now it's like that can live in the
living room no one's gonna give you a
hard time if somebody gives you a hard
time about that being in the living room
that person shouldn't be in your life
okay that's a little extreme sometimes
you find little gems like this on Amazon
sometimes it doesn't need to be the high
profile thing that's what we do here on
unbox therapy we uncover it so you don't
have to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
