even a couple different versions of
similar items in the past this this
package just overall package looks the
most polished so far we're seeing so
many phone manufacturers packing extra
cameras put more lenses on their devices
then there's this thing it's called
shift cam it turns your your device into
a digital SLR essentially it puts all
these various adapters on there to give
you even more opportunities from a focal
range perspective all the way from 120
degree wide angle up to 20x macro now
that's not something you can do just
with your phone camera so if you if
you've got if you want to get really
creative like go out in the wilderness
you want to try to take a photo of a bee
or something up close or you want to get
an ultra-wide this is a way to get even
more photography versatility out of the
current device that you've already got
you have a front-facing 120 degree wide
angle lens that gives you a field of
view similar to what the current
generation pixel can do on the front
facing camera and one of the only times
I I would ever consider using a selfie
camera if there's a group setting
they've also got these other adapter
over here I don't know if this thing
screws on I mean maybe you even want
more maybe you're getting crazy let's
take a look at what's inside so we have
that piece that's the main component
look there's it that's that's huge act
as you and Casper is this a genuine
leather wrist band no absolutely not
the front adapter man this is pretty
wild this clips on to the front camera
and that's what gives you the wide angle
in that department does this go on to
protect it let's see oh that's a magnet
that's well-designed
hmm oh it's a kickstand does that make
sense yeah
yeah any sense right little kickstand
option I'm not sure why you need that
who needs a digital SLR that's all I
have to say oh my God look at this lens
Wow holy ultra-wide 12 mil this for me
as cool as this is it's it's like at
this point is getting a little out of
a lot of you are like cheese get a real
camera at that point there are still
some advantages though to using a smart
phone which is the fact you're connected
so you can share immediately and that's
kind of the place and way that people
are consuming user-generated content now
maybe you won't be out there shooting
video streaming it broadcasting it
immediately after then you could use
something like this to get a look that
is much different than what a typical
smartphone is capable of but for me this
is a step a step maybe a step too far in
this situation whereas this I feel like
it's a lot more practical and you're
carrying the whole package around it's
still pocketable alright so I mean it
fits on like a typical case so this guy
just slides in and you can see it kind
of clicks at different points along the
way what are we looking at I mean we're
looking at the two standard cameras and
then we got another six that's an eight
camera setup jack and then this guy I
guess would slide like this and it
clicks in so there you go front camera
also wide now let's take a look at some
of these focal ranges all right we have
our favorite model here he's ready for a
ready to fight Jack give them a deal
from a new contract all right so this is
one X standard iPhone camera boom done
2x standard iPhone camera boom done and
now we're gonna slide on the first lens
situation oh you can tell right away
that's wider that's quite a bit wider
we'll move to the two on this same
module go to the next we're into the
zoom range significant zoom range here
that's probably a minimum focusing range
somewhere around there the one X or
we're fully in fisheye territory here in
the 1x and the last option here oh this
must be the macro it's basically
touching and the detail is there oh my
god holy iPhone look at this you see the
grooves in a paint okay so the macro
very nice to have you know what let's
try and get this text on the Starbucks
that's one of the coolest things about
these adapters is the macro in my
opinion can actually see the way it was
printed on you can see the stamp there
you see the way to ink dry how about
this knife unbox therapy knife actual
letters grain of the steel Jack you
gotta be impressed no look at that come
on now and oh my goodness is this a 2x
macro now so that's the 1 X which is
already like super close you can see the
grain in the object here well you go to
the 2 X and you're like in your in the
grain remember it's 120 degree wide
angle which we showed you it's way back
from this guy there was the fisheye as
well
which gives you the black border around
and that circular appearance also very
wide and interpretation 10x macro 20x
macro which we just showcased to you and
then a 2x telephoto that's useful that's
sort of a more traditional or typical
lens adapter it's also the most common
implementation we've seen for a
secondary camera unit on most
smartphones it's just like throw the
zoom in so that's a little less exciting
a little less interesting to me we might
as well slide this on and see what we're
working with
now that's giving you a lot more weight
at that funny enough this seems to have
changed the whole like color of the
frame as well so it's a wide-angle shot
so it gives you this cool kind of
perspective and it's just one of the
benefits of having a bigger piece of
glass you can just get you can produce
sharper images yes it's an adapter
you're still using the lens on the
camera but this is just giving you an
advantage over some of the smaller
adapters on the travel piece you guys
can see there you're sharing this stuff
on social media for the most part
anyways and a discrepancy between the
wide adapter that exists on the travel
unit and this one
once you've shared it once it's
compressed chewed up by the various
social media it's like I don't know if
it's worth the headache of carrying
around the actual bigger adapter okay
last up we have the selfie unit and this
gives you the wide-angle on the front so
first things first I should just shoot a
front selfie without the adapter alright
regular focal range
they go typical stuff kind of boring and
then we slide this guy on
oh yeah that's whiter it's not crazy
wide but it didn't really do the thing I
was hoping for it to do which is give
you enough leeway to fit other people in
the frame I mean this is you're still in
the territory of like fitting one other
person really I think this piece is what
this unit is all about I think is what
makes it cool it's small it has a
magnetic cover you can keep it on a case
permanently and you get this wide
variety of possibilities for shots you
can really get creative with it because
part of the thing is with photography on
smartphones these days is the
smartphone's themselves are doing such a
good job algorithmically of letting you
leave it in automatic mode and then
referencing and changing the dynamics of
the photo based on the neural network
and all this wild technology so it's
kind of taking you the photographer out
of the equation to a certain extent you
bring something like this on to here and
it's kind of the best of both worlds
where you can still get creative you can
still make certain choices for focal
range which then changes perspective and
changes an entire image and then you can
still utilize some of the smarts that
exist within the smartphone to then kind
of enhance those creative decisions or
there you go is the travel set edition
flimsy bucks right there what's the
price well lay it down let us know
$69.99 you know what $69.99 hmm
catch a shot of a mosquito or something
straight to National Geographic I used
to have the National Geographic
subscription as a kid I had yellow the
yellow books set up in these holders so
you could save them you could go back
there was a lot of you could read it at
a later date it was still interesting
I had stacks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
