you do now you do it's the blade stealth
13 from your friends at Razer they've
done something super duper the inside of
this box is a pink laptop pink pink I
never thought I'd see the day it's a
subtle pinkish hue what a time to be
alive anyhow oh my goodness gracious
look at the box within the box you can
already tell it's a party in there holy
smokes that's a tiny little power brick
look at that guy the old box in a box
trick oh wow
it is it's actually more pink than I
expected is that coming through on the
camera it's pink but it's a metallic
light solid feeling some stickers also
pink you got the foam on the inside of
the box okay that's a big deal a couple
extra bucks they spent on that that's
for your pleasure all the crinkles the
build is promising right now standard
USB port as well as a type-c connector
other side more of the same as well as a
headphone jack you do have some fans on
the bottom also got some elevated rubber
feet that'll keep it from slipping
around too much okay kind of MacBook
esque but so strange to see it in this
color combo chiclet style keyboard
fairly generous trackpad in scale matte
display not glossy I think it's pretty
good looking actually check out the
background the wallpaper to match with
the mosaic pattern and the color combo
bit of a chin a bit of a chin on this
guy okay so this is available in a few
different configurations but if you do
want this model the quartz color scheme
that I've got here you have to step up
from the baseline model you do need to
get a dedicated graphics card not the
integrated Intel one that the base model
has to begin with this is not a cheap
laptop in fact the base model with Intel
graphics starts at $1400 us the minute
you step up to the MX 150 graphics you
go to like sixteen hundred bucks and
then you can go step further to a 4k
touch display and that brings her price
to $1,900 though at the time of filming
this video that particular model is sold
out now since Razer is kind of a gaming
brand it does seem odd to pick up this
laptop without some form of graphics
inside of it that said you could do
expandable graphics through the outboard
unit that hooks up via thunderbolt this
model that I have in front of me is the
i7 85 65 u processor from Intel that's
eighth generation i7 and one of the
things that I didn't like that much in
the past was the keyboard okay it's a
chiclet style keyboard not a ton of
travel it's very quiet I will say the
thing feels solid like there is not a
lot of flex to the keyboard itself so
quick look at the display so again what
ends up happening with these matte
displays I mean you either love them or
you don't
I do enjoy them I like having them as an
option as well because they cut down on
the glare so much but what ends up
happening is they supply a little bit
less perceived contrast I mean it's a
decent display it's fhd there is a 4k
touch version I'm really surprised
actually that Razer went with a matte
display you know it's not a lot of
manufacturers that are doing this right
now
of course it gives you more pink as well
if that's what you're into now what
about the speakers does get a little
speaker action going here thing is this
comes with the shades and the shades
already send a message that like your
dare clear like they're firing at you
which is a good thing maybe one of those
long bike rides you know those guys over
50% volume you know I'm getting a little
bit of clipping now let's do some music
real quick this one is called trail
blazing oh hi Lou he knew it he knew it
was going to happen it was destined to
happen
I mean it's a beach I mean I said I mean
it's a beat you know so hot I'll send
you a high back like this is the high
back these speakers are not doing it you
know you know gamers are they're gonna
put a headset anyway call me crazy but I
just wish laptop speakers were better
this leaves a lot to be desired when you
have to hear your music or your dialogue
like this
let's get uncle Lew on the phone let's
demo some stuff let's have the speaker's
match the caliber of the other stuff the
keyboard I feel like I can live with the
trackpad is a nice size I like the fact
that they're making a pink laptop you're
gonna think I'm crazy like what are you
talking about why you would never use
that loo it's true I wouldn't but it's
becoming harder to differentiate all
kinds of products and segments in the
consumer electronics space and it's just
like how are you gonna hate on more
choices is it worth the price tag you
know me if I'm spending that kind of
dough I'm probably looking at something
else but Razer is a distinctive brand
making distinctive products you could
probably argue it's the best looking
Windows laptop you will pull this out in
a Starbucks you'd be all set
it's thin it's light and now it's in
pink there it is Razer Blake 13 is the
new one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
