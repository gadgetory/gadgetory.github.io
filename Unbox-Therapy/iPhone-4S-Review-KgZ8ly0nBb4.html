therapy here and this is the
long-awaited iPhone 4s review I wanted
to take a few minutes to play with the
device or hours or days sorry guys but I
wanted to give you guys an honest
opinion and the number one question that
is being asked is how much different is
it from the iPhone 4 and the truth is
I'm going to be honest it's not that
different you know physically if you
were to look at the two you'd think they
were the same but this one has a much
improved camera and that's the most
compelling feature as far as I'm
concerned as well as the other feature
that's getting a ton of press this Siri
feature now I'm probably get some haters
on my next comment but I don't really
believe that Siri deserves the amount of
press that it's got you know it's voice
recognition yes
series a little bit smarter a little bit
more sophisticated understands context a
little bit better but deep down at the
root of what this feature is is it's
something that was available on
different platforms for a long long time
something that's been in the works for a
long long time yes this is Apple's
version and as we know Apple does very
pretty things they they make everything
run a little bit smoother so on and so
forth but does it deserve all the press
that it's gotten I'm not sure and this
and here's another thing that kind of
pisses me off about it is that I don't
believe it's Hardware limited you know
I've heard of people already hacking it
onto their iPhone 4s and it works
properly so what is Apple really doing
here are they are they trying to you
know designate you know or create a
better reason to upgrade trying to put
features in even though they could be
available through a software update who
the hell knows but in truth to me this
is more of a novelty than anything and
on top of that it has terrible
performance in Canada some of you guys
know that I'm up here in Canada and what
that means is that finding things like
restaurants and getting you out of a jam
if you lost or even trying to find
directions all that kind of stuff does
not work in Canada
apparently Siri is an American employee
only
or maybe maybe it works in other
countries but here she's constantly
responding saying hey that's not
available in your area it's probably the
most annoying thing and it probably has
contributed to my hatred alright enough
of the hate let's talk about what's good
this device has moved the antennas
around a little bit and hopefully the
outcome of that is improve reception so
if I've got really good Network speed in
using it very good speed around the
device yes there's an a5 chip in here
now and what that means is that we're
getting improved performance and the
device is behaving very quickly
responding very quickly the web browser
just moves right along and I'm going to
go ahead and say that this is definitely
faster than my Nexus S which I've been
using pinch-to-zoom so on and so forth
this thing behaves exactly the way that
it should and then some so definitely
not complaining at all about the speed
in and around the device again though in
comparison to the iPhone 4 is this a
deal-breaker are we talking about saving
an entire afternoon while browsing the
web because it's that much faster no
we're not talking about that level but
now let's get to the good stuff the
camera this is the best camera I have
ever used on a phone in my life and I am
not exaggerating I say that for a couple
of very specific reasons yes it's got a
flash available it's got HDR available
it's got a grid available if you if you
want to use that to line things up but
most importantly it fires off shots like
it's going out of style this thing just
pops them off rapid fire and the reason
why that's important is because
photography is inherently about
capturing the moment and moments are
fleeting they don't last forever they're
there and then they're gone so if you're
sitting there waiting for your camera
phones autofocus you're out of business
you didn't get what you wanted to
capture and you really didn't make the
photograph you could have made so this
particular device is is it's an
experience to use it you guys know I'm
into photography I'm into making videos
here but it's a real experience to use
you got a physical button now when
you're taking photos and and that has a
big impact hey it also just 1080p video
now you notice some beautiful Double
Stuf Oreos here
I just had to take it to the supermarket
lots of colors and things to look at the
focusing distance is a is is not too bad
actually can't bring things super close
but you could you can actually get items
fairly close while keeping them in focus
and you've obviously got that improved
aperture now a two point two point four
aperture so you can actually blur the
background in images and get a get a
sort of more professional you know
effect that you can get out of obviously
bigger aperture lenses when you're using
digital SLRs and the like the other
thing that's got is actually to get the
forward-facing camera for those of you
that like to look at yourself or those
of you that like to look at my camera
setup in and around the device I mean
it's it's it's fine I mean it's good to
use if you've used an iPhone before you
you know what it's all about here's a
physical comparison between the iPhone
4s
there was the iPod Touch and then it's
sitting there on top of my Nexus S and
here's something that's interesting you
know the Nexus S is a four inch device
right and and everybody was thinking hey
maybe we're gonna get a four inch device
out of out of the iPhone this time
around and then I heard some people
arguing hey 3.5 inch is a perfect size
for a screen you know because you know
your thumb can reach all the way across
so on and so forth now I agree yeah 3.5
is nice I mean I can easily get from one
site to the other but I never had a
problem with four inches you know I've
been using this Nexus S for well a while
now and and I never had a problem
reaching across the screen at all I can
reach the far corners the bottom corners
so I think that this question has more
to do with the size of your hand then it
does necessarily with which size screen
is right for everyone I don't think
there is a size of screen that's right
for everyone and as a result I think you
got to try these devices out if you
can't use it with one hand if the screen
is so big that that one-handed operation
becomes difficult than I'd say it's
probably too big for you and you got to
look elsewhere but I've never had a
problem with for inches so you know if
Apple did release a 4-inch iPhone I
don't think things would change that
drastically I think I could still very
easily operate it and probably enjoy it
more because of that fact so anyway guys
I don't want to come off sound like a
hater this phone is is beautiful to use
and
you know I would totally consider
replacing my Android phone if it had a
couple more things like I've grown so
used to the back button on my Nexus I
just couldn't imagine living without it
but if you're a photographer if you're
into taking images on the run with a
device that is always on you you cannot
beat this this phone I mean this thing
is is unlike anything I've used before
in a phone so if that is the number one
thing that you use your phone for
besides making calls and texting then
then I would look I wouldn't look
anywhere else I mean that thing is
beautiful so anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed this I hope I didn't come off
too critical like I said it's a
beautiful phone and and you're not going
to go wrong if you purchase it and
otherwise until next time I want to
thank you for watching thank you for
your support if you enjoyed this content
hopefully you can like and favorite this
video as it does help me out a bunch and
until next time thanks for watching
later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
