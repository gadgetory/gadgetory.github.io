therapy and today we're gonna have a
little tablet showdown the iPad 2 versus
the Galaxy Tab versus the HP TouchPad
hopefully I can help you guys figure out
which tablet is gonna work the best for
you and believe me it's not the same for
everyone so first let's look at her go
Nam --ax the iPad 2 was very thin very
light it sort of set the standard for
what we could expect as far as the
tablets concerned now it's got that
traditional aspect ratio meaning it's a
little bit shorter and a little bit
wider than the Galaxy Tab 10 one as far
as thickness is concerned they're almost
identical but the edge for weight
actually goes to the Samsung Galaxy Tab
which is the lightest of the bunch
now this 16:9 aspect ratio takes some
getting used to if you're used to an
iPad but if you're into a lot of
multimedia and you watch a lot of movies
then this is gonna be your choice
because it's gonna display the whole
frame as opposed to chopping it like any
of these traditional aspect ratios
here's the touchpad and it's the fattest
of the bunch I mean it's not so fat that
you can't carry it around or anything
it's just these ones have set the bar
for ergonomics that's all here's a
better look at how close they all are in
reality is not a huge difference between
them but when it comes to weight it's
actually a little bit more significant
the touchpad is quite a bit heavier than
the other two competitors and I'm not
really sure why I guess it's just the
way they designed it so next we're gonna
take a look at the operating system and
some of the features the iPad has a very
basic operating system that most of us
are used to and most of us can operate
very little in the way of multitasking
but everything is smooth and how it
should be the Android Honeycomb
interface on the Galaxy Tab is a little
bit more customizable I guess you could
say it's also got this little
notification section down here along
with some quick settings that you can
access without sort of leaving what
you're currently doing you've got a
software back button as well as a
software home button that home button
will take you back to your
homescreen obviously from wherever you
are and you've also got this little tab
button that will show you all your
different applications that you've got
running so it's legitimate multitasking
for those of you who are power users on
your tablet you've also got your app
drawer up here where you can host all
your apps and you can just pull any one
of them and throw it as a shortcut onto
any one of your home screens next you
can select your own apps these are the
ones that you've installed that aren't
included by default lastly we've got the
touch pad touch pad has probably the
most unique interface where you don't
actually have a cons on your home screen
- the little bar on the bottom the way
it works is by setting up these stacks
where you can basically configure
whatever it is that you want to use at
any given time it's also got a
notification bar up at the top along
with some quick settings including
brightness etc that's actually similar
to what the Android tablet has you've
also got this app drawer here and it'll
also allow you to navigate your settings
etc from within that window you always
hit the home button to get back to your
home it's a physical home button similar
to the one on the iPad as far as sound
is concerned I'd probably give the nod
to the HP TouchPad it's got stereo
speakers and their significant size
these are the ones from the Galaxy Tab
10 one they're also stereo but they're a
little smaller a little bit 10 year in
the quality of sound and of course the
iPads only got the one speaker so I
can't really give it the nod you got to
have stereo I guess if you want to
compete with these other two next we're
gonna look at the web browser I'm gonna
try and simultaneously launch unbox
therapy com look at that that was tough
to do and as you guys will see the iPad
2 actually loads the page the fastest
but there's a reason that's because it's
not loading any flash and flash is of
course gonna bog down the CPU on any one
of these tablets now when it comes to
the flash based tablets the ones that
can load it the Galaxy Tab was
significantly faster than the age
touchpad but if you don't use flash
you're not interested in flash then the
iPad 2 is not only going to be quicker
but it's also going to be a little bit
smoother when scrolling up and down and
also when pinching to zoom etc not that
the other ones aren't smooth they
definitely are but I guess there's a
little bit different fit and finish when
using the iPad and it's subtle but
noticeable nonetheless here I'll give
you an idea of the pinch to zoom and
just how reactive it is actually pretty
nice on all three devices I'm impressed
with all three to be honest with you and
there's probably a lot more in common
with these three devices than they have
apart you've also got the double tap to
zoom in and the double tap to zoom out
now each of these tablets allows for you
to open multiple browser windows but
they handle the process differently on
the HP TouchPad you're forced to launch
a new window in its entirety and then
from there that new window is going to
be stacked on top of your previous one
where you can only see a bit of it
behind the new window on your home page
the Android browser and honeycomb is
basically the same as Chrome so you've
just got tabs that you can see all the
time in relationship to what's open and
what isn't on the iPad you've got a
slightly different scenario where you do
have to back out to see what you have
opened and from there you basically get
thumbnails of the different windows that
you have open at any given time but you
can't see them well in the browser so
next let's talk about YouTube and as you
guys know the iPad can't play flash so
if you go to youtube.com it's basically
useless to you unless you want to leave
comments or I don't know login to your
channel page or something but the other
two devices can actually play videos
right on youtube.com and that's a
feature as far as I'm concerned that's
something that is very interesting to me
now the Galaxy Tab 10 1 is actually a
little bit better performer on YouTube
you can see it's got a quicker response
etc but to be fair the touchpad is
loading a flash ad along with the flash
video so once it gets that loaded up
it'll smooth out
now as far as the iPad is concerned
you're gonna have to launch the YouTube
app that's your only way into YouTube
and it's okay I mean it's really smooth
you get nice big thumbnails etc but
there are a number of features and
functions that don't exist within it the
biggest one as far as I'm concerned is
the ability to browse by category or by
top rated or top favorited you're kind
of stuck with their selections for
featured videos and their selections for
most viewed and if you guys are like me
I like to avoid the most viewed on
YouTube like the plague there's really
nothing I'm interested in in the most
viewed category so on the Android tablet
you actually got a dedicated YouTube
interface to go with the ability to use
youtube.com in its native form and this
one is actually a really nice YouTube
interface because you can browse by
category you can you know use some of
the functions available via the web page
right within the app it's it's a better
substitute as far as I'm concerned even
if it might not be as smooth as the iPad
version now the galaxy tab also offers a
fairly unique interface for viewing your
subscriptions you can actually look at
them in this three-dimensional sort of
interface which isn't the quickest thing
at the moment but cool nonetheless and
as far as the HP TouchPad is concerned
it doesn't have a dedicated YouTube app
so you're just going to go to
youtube.com now but it would be nice to
have the option between the app or the
website so next we'll look at the
settings menu or menus of each device
and you can see that the iPad and the
Galaxy Tab have very similar looking
layouts text-based layouts whereas the
HP TouchPad has more of an icon-based
layout not a big deal
next is the app stores and this is
really where the iPad dominates and has
dominated the selection available within
the app store is unreal it's it seems
untouchable although I'm sure it isn't
the android marketplace has been
catching up a little bit at a time and
this is really where the HP is gonna run
into trouble is can their App Store
exist coexist with these other two
giants if that being said they've got a
really nice layout and they set up the
groundwork for what could be a really
cool App Store I really appreciate the
way they've laid it out here it's really
clean and easy to use but like I said
before it's going to be a matter of
getting the inventory of applications to
compete with two very mature app markets
and in the iPads case an absolute
behemoth the next thing I want to talk
about is the screen quality as well as
the brightness and in this particular
category the Galaxy Tab 10 one
absolutely dominates it's by far the
brightest with the most resolution and
significantly more contrast than either
these other two screens I'd probably put
the iPad 2 in second place to it but the
blacks are significantly darker on here
and the lights are significantly whiter
what else could you ask for in a screen
anyway guys let's talk about the
keyboards too because that's important
gonna be typing a lot on these things
and to be honest with you they're all a
lot more similar than they are different
but one thing I do want to mention is
that when using the Galaxy Tab 10 one
that interesting aspect ratio allows for
your thumbs to be closer together in
portrait mode so thumb typing is a
little bit easier it's still possible on
the iPad 2 but if you have smaller hands
you might not be able to reach those
middle keys in my case is not really an
issue in landscape mode they're all
really nice big keyboards really easy to
use an ultra responsive I think that the
honeycomb tablet actually has the
biggest keyboard in landscape mode
that's obviously a byproduct again of
that unusual aspect ratio or at least
unusual for the time being it could very
well become the standard in years to
come who knows and here's the iPads
landscape keyboard big giant buttons
pretty difficult to miss pretty sure
you'll find any one of these tablets
easy to type on so next I'll talk about
the cameras the touchpad only has a
forward facing camera for video chat the
other two have a rear facing camera but
honestly guys don't buy these things for
the cameras they're not great quality
you're gonna be better
pulling your smartphone out of your
pocket you know or or your dedicated
camera for that matter but just for the
sake of comparison the galaxy tab does
have a shitload more features than the
iPad 2 it's got a bunch of different
configuration utilities here you can you
can pick out a bunch of different stuff
and the iPad camera is basically
point-and-shoot and that's about it
so even though you even though these
cameras suck I guess I had to mention it
so lastly let's talk about the email
clients after all email is a big part of
what you'll probably end up doing on any
one of these tablets the iPad email
interface is very straightforward very
simple to use and as you see you get a
slightly different look from the
landscape interface you can delete or
archive messages and you can also run
multiple mailboxes when you go to
compose an email this little window
comes up here fairly easy to use fairly
straightforward and actually
surprisingly similar to the Android
email app the Gmail app over here except
for the fact that you get an older and
newer sort of way to scroll through your
emails on this particular app but again
you have multiple inboxes and when you
go to compose an email it looks almost
identical to when you do so on iOS this
is where the touch pad is sort of in its
own zone I think that it's email app is
probably the best out there that's
because it allows you to work on
multiple emails at the same time and if
you're like me you got emails flying
left right and center that's a useful
feature so maybe if you're a business
guy and this thing is going to be an
email machine for you then the touch pad
could could easily become your first
choice just based on this email
functionality right here anyway guys
here's the way I see it if this is your
first tablet you're coming from a
traditional computer
I say go for the ipad2 the reason I say
that is because the transition is going
to be the easiest and you're going to
get the most mature tablet experience
that's on the market right now if you
want to be cutting-edge and you want the
latest in hardware and you want a more
customizable experience maybe you're a
little bit more savvy then I say hey go
for the Galaxy Tab 10 one or an Android
platform tablet and lastly if this is
all business if you're going to use this
thing mainly for email then I would say
go with the touchpad because I do
believe it has the most sophisticated
email client if you guys found these
