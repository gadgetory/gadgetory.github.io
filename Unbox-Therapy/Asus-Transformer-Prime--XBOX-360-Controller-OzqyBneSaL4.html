everything's about the Tegra chip of
course and it's graphics prowess here

transformer prime but he's also
outputting via HDMI incredible graphics

some really impressive stuff that's for

light tablet there you can see the
transformer prime hooked up to the
docking station super thin and light and
they've got a xbox360 controller
going into it yeah there you get a
better look at it just so just your
regular everyday transformer prime out

regular console style gaming experience
