life god damn it this is gonna be fun I
ordered this thing here in front well
that's I mean what I do sometimes people
send me things other times I'm like I
have to order that because I need to
find something out this is one of those
moments this phone the x5 from doogee
it's an Amazon phone a phone that I
bought on Amazon and he costs $58 a $58
Android smartphone what are you talking
about you $58 I can't I saw the iPhone
10 released a thousand bucks what do you
mean I'm not 58 I can barely go out for
lunch
58 the whole smartphone marketplace it's
gotten more competitive there are
companies like the recent device that I
featured here the razor phone I've been
using in my SIM cards in it I promised
you was gonna be and it's in there 600
bucks 700 bucks it's in that range okay
I see what they can do at that price
point the essential phone just went it's
$500 now the essential phone there's
always gonna be people that just want
the best and that's fine
there's a convergence in expensive
phones have gotten a lot better and a
lot closer to the expensive ones period
no ads so there are devices in Amazon
that are subsidized by ads you boot them
up you watch an ad this one no ad 5.0
inch 720p display in mt6582 are first of
all the fonts here we need to do some
work on that not a kind of contrast from
the black and the gray Android 6.0
gigabyte of ram 8 gigs of storage 5
megapixel camera 2 megapixel front
alright listen we're not competing on
specs here that's not the goal 58 bucks
power brick USB cable as well a standard
microUSB no fancy USB type-c alright and
then the device that's pretty much
that's all there is
ok so that's the back of the phone matte
black finish camera up in the corner
everything looks to kind of make sense
there there's the display the x5 ok some
capacitive buttons on the bottom
obviously something of yesteryear as far
as devices are concerned you don't see
this so much anymore let us remove this
screen cover here ooh
all right when it comes to budget
devices for whatever reason they will
install a screen protector to preserve
the lifespan volume rocker over here
speaker is on the bottom there is a
headphone jack surprisingly an
off-center microUSB port on the top of
the phone that is not common at all I
remind you 58 dollars so I noticed we're
dealing with a removable back situation
here and again this was common on phones
once upon a time you hardly ever see
this anymore
a 2400 milliamp hour battery 2 SIM card
slots and a micro SD card slot
unbelievable 3d stereo sound
where are the stereo speakers I guess ok
here we go a little bit of a laggy
opening sequence there why was there no
setup they set it up in advance that
always freaks me out a little bit the
app button is a little different than
usual but it works there's a couple of
things you wouldn't normally see like
app lock up there and parallel space but
otherwise it's not overloaded what are
you supposed to do with this button oh I
see quick toggle lockscreen game mode
etc a screen recorder right in your
quick settings there by default it's
taken me to do GCC it is not the
brightest display boys and girls the
sound is not that bad the display is
darkest so if you have a few more
dollars to spend you definitely need to
go check out this video I'm using it
right I'm using that phone right now
alright it's made an impact on me
because it does basically what an
expensive one does at one tenth of the
price once upon a time a phone in this
price range will be like unusable but
you could tell already like I'm doing
something though I haven't launched the
camera yet the camera ain't gonna be
good I know it
and the lag from when you hit the button
the leg you're out you're with your
friends and why not oh good we're young
we do stuff we go out we're out cool
yeah yeah wait wait your friends who
feel let me see what you got how do I
look you see that looks like you're half
in the bag yo look what we did last
night
blur factory I'm gonna really try here
not the worst thing I've ever seen it's
I mean it's a five megapixel image it
kind of reminds me of images from phones
about four years ago maybe now the
front-facing camera Oh actually better
than I expected although I think they
buted me I think I got beauty but in all
honesty at 58 all right it's not gonna
be for everyone okay I'm not trying to
convince you to throw out your Galaxy s8
I'm trying to show you the landscape of
what's happening to inform you about the
fact that $58.00 phones are a thing and
they're kind of decent for the price you
can watch a video on YouTube alright and
that's the main thing so you can keep
watching unbox therapy so I could keep
doing this good night this episode of
unbox the P has been brought to you by
go extreme action cams these are little
guys that sort of operate like GoPros
but at a fraction of the cost in fact
this one in front of me here which is
called the blackhawk shoots 4k on the
same sensor as the GoPro Hero 5 of for
significantly less money and even less
right now because I've got a coupon code
for you guys so the code is unbox Doc's
for 15% off not just this product but
there are other products as well I've
got a couple more of them over here this

blackhawk this one comes with a bunch of
accessories as you can see here a
waterproof case helmet mount bike mount
orientation arms monopod adapter tripod
adapter battery USB cable and manual
that's all inside of this
package and the waterproof housing is
good 260 meters now this is not fake 4k
its 4k all the way up to 30 frames per
second so that's completely usable you
don't need to make any adjustments for
framerate other 4k action cameras that
are out there might only shoot at 15
frames and that's not exactly usable in
places like YouTube now their other
products I have over here as well you've
got the full dome 360 action camera and
