under the weather still got a bit of a
sore throat kept me out of the videos
for a little bit and what did that mean
well it meant I had to put Ryan in this
seat and you guys saw that video and he
gave him a lot of thumbs up his head it
began to inflate like a hot air balloon
hey loo look 150,000 thumbs up guess
who's the new host of unbox therapy and
I said well what do you guys think are
you ready for a new host you want to
kick it with your old man loo I'll tell
you how to let me know we got to smash
that like button we got to destroy his
figure we don't beat 150,000 likes I'm
gonna have to go into retirement like
Michael Jordan did you hear that Jack
it's not often I ask you guys for your
help
but I'm afraid right now very afraid all
right what are we talking about today
I'm gonna show you how to add wireless
charging to your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7
plus another thing that I missed
switching back to iOS was the
opportunity to wireless charge at this
point I've got wireless chargers all
over the place beside my bed in my car
so to not be able to interact with them
and be fiddling with cables was not the
ideal scenario so I went on Amazon I
started looking around and I realize
there's no truly official solution for
adding wireless charging try Phone 7 7
plus at this point in time so I'm going
to show you how to do it MacGyver style
over here I have these Qi receivers this
one over here is from spigen this one is
I Qi mobile this is the one that I
recently purchased I'm gonna have these
things linked down below so this will
sit on the back and then this guy fits
in there like that now you're thinking
damn dude that looks pretty ugly the
idea after doing this is to stick your
device into a case so I do have a few
case options over here now not every
case will work and some cases will work
better than others when I ordered up
this charge pad right here it also came
with this wireless charger a Qi wireless
charger on this side over here it's not
gonna be for everybody ok for me once I
started doing it it was like men
there's just something about sticking
cables in that's just bothering me these
days so I'm addicted you might become
addicted yourself that's my little spiel
spheal spheal if you hope to use wired
headphones this might be a hassle to
pull this in and out but of course Apple
wants you to use Wireless anyways this
shouldn't be too much of an issue so
snap it in and there you go think about
this case it's too thick the wireless
transmission won't happen through it so
that's where I had to get crafty and
start trying some different cases some
cases like this you AG one not going to
be great for your contact point so the
two that I found that work well are
these ones from spigen essentially the
thinner the case the better this one's a
little bit softer and this is a slightly
harder shell but they're both super thin
just have this plugged in like that
pretty simple and then you just take
your device and drop it on maybe you
don't check new discovery this little
charger here not quite as effective as
the one I have in my car I have a
samsung one and what I noticed is that
this hard case that I just spoke about
is actually not transmitting nearly as
well as the soft one if you want maximum
compatibility I'm gonna go ahead and
fully recommend this case now when I
drop it on there boom so with this kind
of a setup you do need to be a little
bit more aware of where you place it so
my recommendation is don't mess around
go with this exact setup if this is
something you feel like you need to have
also remember we got a crush Ryan's
number crushes dreams at the same time
we got to beat it in this video right
here or else I'm retiring I'll go play
baseball like MJ you guys don't believe
me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
