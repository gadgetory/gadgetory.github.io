what that's from do you use a deer and
end dananana net or is it no no nono
not-not-not and that was it done oh no
no no is there a dirt at the beginning
or is it all none I've got a smartphone
today and there's been an influx in
smartphones recently you know they get a
little less attention some international
smart phones every company every brand
every variation and I like variation is
good selection is good a little more RAM
or I like a slightly bigger screen
smaller screen something close to a
stock OS or less or maybe in this case a
bigger battery who doesn't want a bigger
battery will you want a bigger battery
no you want a bigger battery Jack you
want a bigger battery Lou you want a
bigger battery we all want bigger but
you want a bigger battery batteries are
good okay we can imagine a universe in
which unlimited battery life exists a
sort of battery utopia fancy seeing you
in here until then to get better battery
life we have to have bigger batteries I
did a video recently on this oukitel
device that is a beast which had a
10,000 milliamp hour battery in it but
that thing was huge that was like a
weapon so today I have a phone it's got
a six thousand milliamp hour battery
it's from you the phone he's never
6080 milliamp-hour 18 by 9 aspect ratio
so it's got the new the slim design that
everybody wants 2160 by 1080 display six
gigs of ram 64 gigabytes of storage in
8-core processor android seven one and
quad cameras what it looks like it has a
case installed also this phone is big
but not crazy like it's manageable I'll
show it against a pixel to XL it's
definitely thicker it's a little bit
heavier back the device you have the
fingerprint reader probably my favorite
spot you see the dual cameras right
above there a textured power button USB
type-c as well as your speaker it does
look like you have a dual camera setup
in there one two cutouts and if I move
over there should be your sensor over
here a screen protector a Type C adapter
an OTG cable type see one of these
robust charge cables and then also a
type C two mini jack connector SIM tray
features dual SIM / microSD expansion
also alright so I might as well go ahead
and test out the fingerprint sensor here
so I'm gonna add one there it is boot it
up it's not an OLED display or anything
like that
I don't even know if I told the people
what the price is what was it well 219
219 bucks for this I mean you saw the
spec list fingerprint how fast is it oh
it's very slow it's not the fastest
finger print reader I've ever used
not even close actually I'm really
curious about these dual front facing
cameras the one lens is responsible for
the the bouquet effect in the background
and the first lens captures the
foreground yeah we've seen better we've
seen worse the key factor is the beard
hair test now of course you've got your
favorite Beauty modes as well who needs
that in their life know what I know when
it comes to the blur mode you can adjust
it in real time now the rear camera same
deal right dual lens 21 megapixel and
five megapixel sensor
and now I'm gonna test it with the blur
mode I don't know man the blur mode it
works well it doesn't it just keeps the
center of the frame in focus in the
surrounding area blurred I don't think
I'd be buying this thing for the blur
mode that said I've seen very few of
these blur implementations that actually
looked good to my eyes it's not terrible
considering the price point at 219 that
is a usable photo right there oh how
about this recent video the mind-blowing
33 million pixel display this thing is
insane and it's just a mono speaker it
more pixels than anything I personally
it works it's not strong at least it's
not crunchy but it's just not very loud
go check out my tests of razor phone
speaker against a bunch of other ones
it's actually there's some interesting
results there they haven't gone
overboard with the tweaks to the OS this
is pretty standard stuff so apparently
it'll shoot HDR video all the way up to
1080p you are hearing my voice through
the microphone the focusing distance is
not super close oh and I guess it is
actually there's me there's you there's
Moe I'm kind of impressed for the price
and just the fact that they were able to
cram six thousand milliamp hour battery
in a package that's this smooth it's not
a crazy difference in a pixel you're
looking at like 3,500 milliamp hours
compared to 6000 ah you look at the
package it's kind of surprising that's a
feat of Engineering will it explode I
hope not that's a normal form factor
just with a huge battery well done I
think</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
