believe is an exclusive video this my
friends is what the iPad 5 is going to
look like it's thinner it's lighter I'm
going to compare it to the previous
generation right now so let's not waste
any more time let's check out the
differences so we're going to get
started on the front of the device this
is obviously a last generation iPad when
I go ahead and put the front panel from
the new iPad on top of this one you can
start to appreciate the changes in
form-factor
it's obviously more narrow and it looks
a lot more like the iPad Mini but you're
getting the exact same screen size it
fits in there perfectly and we'll of
course likely be that same Retina
display that you had on the previous
generation so you're giving up some
bezel but you're not giving up any
screen and you're getting an overall
smaller form factor how much you ask I
will show measurements towards the end
of this video so don't go anywhere but
as you can tell it is fairly significant
taking a look at the side you'll notice
that the layout for the volume buttons
has changed a little bit instead of
being a singular piece you now have a
separate up-and-down similar to that of
the iPad Mini on the top everything is
in a similar location though you can
tell that the curves are a little
different on each of the two devices and
now you have these upgraded speakers
once again taking cues from the iPad
Mini holding the new form factor in one
hand is very comfortable and easy to do
and I can even wrap my entire hand
around the device as I'll show you in a
moment here that's just not possible on
the old form factor it's just a little
bit too wide where I was on this one as
you can see here I mean I guess I have
average to large sized hands but still
they can get around there so that little
change in dimension is definitely a
positive thing and noticeable next we're
going to check out how thin or thick the
devices are they're very very close to
be honest with you guys I guess the new
one is a tiny bit more thing if you take
your measurement from the widest point
of the current generation iPad but very
negligible those differences the big
difference is this dimension here as I
mentioned earlier where the old one
measures in at eighteen point five
centimeters and the new one has a width
of 17 centimeters so 1.5 centimeters
total in width so this new one is
trimmed down as I said before the
this is the most important dimension
change here maintaining the exact same
screen real estate
but boiling it down into a smaller form
factor speaking a small form factors
this my friends is the iPad Mini 2 and
in the next video I'll be giving you
more details and a comparison on this to
the old model so subscribe if you
