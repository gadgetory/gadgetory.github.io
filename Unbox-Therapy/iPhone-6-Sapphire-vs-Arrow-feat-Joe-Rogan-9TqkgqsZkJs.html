pal Joe Rogan because we're going to do
something very special today some
destruction when my right hand is what
is likely the upcoming Sapphire display
for the iPhone 6 and in my left I have a
mock-up of the 5.5 inch iPhone 6
supposedly this glass is pretty strong
so when I heard about that I decided to
give Joe Rogan a call to find out just
how strong it is we're going to test it
and we're going to test it with this
what this is is a Hoyt carbon spider
turbo it's very light extremely powerful
it is an 80 pound draw weight it shoots
446 grain arrows at 288 feet per second
this is the arrow Easton Full Metal
Jacket deep 6 injection arrow it's got
carbon fiber and it's wrapped in
aluminum and it blows through
this is a bow if you're going to hunt
grizzly bears or water buffalo
Oh smell the burn
it's briar food barbecue you smell it
arrows burn through the plastic oh
yeah exactly exactly
the same hole so it's time to do the
real deal now we have the sapphire glass
we're going to tape it over top of the
target here holds bull's eye
that's the money shot right here if he's
gone all you have is the portion I was
protected by the tape holding it
together look at that
and pretty good accuracy I need
something L to happen to leave all right
further proof next fall iPhones don't
mean now here in the range out here
in the real world</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
