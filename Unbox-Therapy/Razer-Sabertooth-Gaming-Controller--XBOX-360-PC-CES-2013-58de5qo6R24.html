coverage what's up guys Lew here and
I've got more cool stuff to show you
here on the show floor at CES 2013
it's another product from Razer and it's
their brand new controller called the
saber-tooth it looks a lot like their
previous generation the anza this one
will work with Xbox 360 or your PC you
can see on the top here you've got a
couple of extra shoulder buttons they
are user programmable as well as a
braided cable on the bottom there's two
more user controllable buttons it
actually totals four buttons those are
removable if you prefer not to use them
now programming the device means putting
in a couple of different profiles and
there's an LCD screen to help you
understand which profile is activated at
any given time you can also wipe
profiles out and reset it to factory
defaults using these buttons as well the
button on the right just puts it back to
the Razer logo for when you're playing
and you don't care which profile you're
in as you guys can tell it's got a
really nice design to it it does look
similar to an Xbox 360 controller at
least where everything is laid out your
thumb sticks etc and of course all the
rest of the buttons but as I said before
it does have that extra functionality
and of course the fact that it can be
used cross-platform either with an Xbox
360 or a PC and in this case right here
they're showing it functioning along
with the tablet their brand new tablet
that I featured in my last video I'll
probably link that down in the video
responses so this is a very cool way to
dock the tablet which is a fully
functioning Windows 8 PC and you can put
it into their multi media dock I'll put
that video to a flat panel display like
this one sit back on your couch with
your razor sabertooth controller and get
an almost console like or maybe exactly
a console like gaming experience but
using PC games anyway guys if you
