and today we're taking a look at the ocz
vertex 3 solid state drive this is the
hundred and twenty gigabyte model and if
you guys follow the channel you know I
recently installed it inside my macbook
pro in fact I'll probably put a link in
the annotations above for that
installation video now the reason you're
seeing the unboxing in reverse is
because well it was sitting on my SD
card and I guess I forgot about it
anyhow it's worth sharing so you guys
can get an idea of exactly what to
expect if you invest in this solid state
drive having used it for a while I can
give you guys a little bit of insight
since I'm using it on OS 10 Snow Leopard
to be exact there were some concerns
that it might not function as expected
but in my case it's been perfectly fine
perfectly fast everything I expected and
then some so if that means anything to
you if that's any kind of vote of
confidence at least on my front it's
working the way it's supposed to no
problems anyway let's talk about what
we've got here this is a three and a
half inch adapter plate so you can screw
your two and a half inch SSD onto there
if you want to use it in a desktop that
has a three and a half inch Bay no
problem see a lot of people are starting
to install these SSDs in their desktops
as boot up drives in order to take
advantage of the improved speed so
they've also got some screws included
which is nice again this will help you
to mount it wherever you see fit and
then we've got the drive of course in
its anti-static bag let's be very
careful here now these things are
lightweight lighter than traditional
hard drives it's basically just a
shitload of RAM jammed inside of an
enclosure well fast solid-state RAM
penny how plastic on the other side and
some sort of an aluminum finish on the
bottom side so is there anything else
included where is the documentation
there's got to be documentation is
always that there we go we got some
there's a little bit of paperwork and if
I can ever get it
I'll show you what it is so we've got a
little manual and we got a sticker that
says my SSD is faster than your hard
drive well that's not too impressive all
thats a paddlin hard drives for the most
part and here's a little bit of
paperwork anyway guys check out the
channel we got new stuff coming up all
the time and be sure to check out our
