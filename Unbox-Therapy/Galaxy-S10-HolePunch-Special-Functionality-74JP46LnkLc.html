the galaxy s 10 made a video recently
kind of recapping my experiences people
are they're hitting me up I'm getting
all kinds of questions suggestions and
so on it's just a hot foam people seem
to like it so far one of the things that
showed up in my inbox the app that can
do something very special with the hole
punch it's a unique aspect of this
particular device the s 10 s 10 plus so
you saw all these wallpapers come out
specific to take advantage of the hole
punch but there's something more useful
than any of those wallpapers that people
have been hitting me up about in my
inbox and it's an app it's an app that
takes that hole punch and turns it into
a battery indicator energy ring battery
indicator for galaxy s 10 s 10 ysou this
will not work with the plus it's
specific to the circular cutout which I
personally think is the better-looking
cutout so far so good I mean they got
some reviews on the app let's just
install it let's check it out real quick
so you do have to enable it in here
that's fine allow permission and I don't
know if you guys can pick that up it's
not super thick right now you can see if
I slide this all the way over it gets a
lot bigger but as you can tell the
representative of the percentage of
battery life remaining and it's very
visual like you can spot it quickly and
easily let's give Kirk a quick look at
it you know you're in the sort of three
quarter territory with a quick glance as
opposed to your typical battery
indicator which you kind of got to
squint that a little bit anyhow I would
probably use it somewhere around 15 for
the thickness I think that is a slightly
better look in my opinion you can change
the ring direction as well clockwise
bi-directional anti-clockwise you can
auto hide on full screen apps the
charging animation oh my goodness linear
no animation acceleration deceleration
oh cool look at that you see it spinning
around so you're on like the home page
or whatever it's spinning around let me
just go back real quick because there
are some other animations available
linear acceleration oh you see that one
there okay slightly to deceleration
Oh boom boom okay anticipation go don't
go go speed-breaker I hate almost all of
them I just want linear but it's still
nice to have linear you just to know to
have the confidence okay I'm charging
sweet it's a nice little functionality
does not interrupt your camera
functionality at all do you know you're
charging you pull it out
it's static it's back to whatever
percentage you have you plug it in you
know right away you're charging
wonderful okay nice little functionality
there then to take it a step further as
a color configuration so you think
you're just glancing at the amount of
charge based on how much of the circle
is filled but there's also color coding
from a hundred to seventy six is going
to be green seventy five to fifty one
blue 5226 yellow and twenty five to one
will be in red again this idea of just
being able to glance at it and quickly
understand which battery territory
you're in first step you're just gonna
recognize the color and then the second
is how much of the ring is filled up in
total this is a cool little thing I
think it's a good idea I'm starting to
understand why so many people sent it to
me this whole punch has been for some
reason it's inspired all kinds of people
in the smartphone space whether it's a
wallpaper or an entire app I guess the
aesthetic of it was just appealing to
people they wanted to do things with it
this is by far the most useful
functionality I've seen so far there is
that LED that's in there typically only
shows up during face unlock or I guess
when yet maybe when you're using the
front-facing camera now you can put it
to use on the daily in a way that can
actually impact the way you use your
device and let you know sooner than
later that you're getting low on battery
or also let you know that you're
charging in case for whatever you're
plugging into a faulty setup and you're
not getting a charge you would know now
it looks like the app itself is ad
supported so it's free I mean you just
get it and you got a look at like an
Amazon ad every so often it's really not
terrible thank you for the tip for those
of you that sent it in and I think it's
a nice little improvement on a design
element within this particular device I
think it's pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
