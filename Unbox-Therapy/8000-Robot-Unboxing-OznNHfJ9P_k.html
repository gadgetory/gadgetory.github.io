big development and probably not what
you'd expect to find here on unbox
therapy today we're gonna unbox a robot
more specifically the now robot now this
thing isn't cheap but it's dropped in
price recently you can get them for
somewhere around 6 or 7 thousand bucks

amount of money but these are usually
used in institutions at schools for
learning let us unbox V now robot I'm
referring to him as he normally it's a
product that has no personality but I'm
calling him he because he's a humanoid

notice his ears are actually speakers
that's where he's gonna be able to
communicate with you and make noise you

believe he tapped his head there's also
a button on the front of him kind of
what you would expect a robot to look
like alright now let's go ahead plug

something uh-oh alright he's plugged in
