new information regarding the next
generation of iPad or the iPad 5 you
probably recall my previous video where
I gave you a first look at this back
casing done in the silver finish with
the white front panel well today I've
been lucky enough to get my hands on
another variation this is the space grey
finish that you probably recognize from
the iPhone 5s which just launched and it
happens to have the black front bezel so
anyways let's go ahead and do an
inspection on this over in the studio
area so here you can see them lined up
you've got aluminum Space Gray and then
for good measure on the far right hand
side you have the previous generation of
iPad in this video we'll be looking at
the aesthetic differences between the
space gray and the aluminum but if you
want to see detailed comparison where I
give you measurements and things on
these new leaked components compared
with the old iPad you can check out my
first video through the link down in the
description one thing I noticed that's
different about the space gray backing
is there are no magnets installed on the
hinge portion to connect a smart cover I
don't know exactly what this means maybe
they're working on something new that we
haven't seen yet a prototype
anyways that's just something worth
mentioning this space gray back casing
also happened to ship with a black front
cover around the bezel of the front
panel
unlike the silver version which shipped
with the white front panel this leads me
to believe that the color combinations
for the next generation of iPad will
likely follow in line with that of the
iPhone 5s where you will see a black
front to go with a Space Gray back a
white front to go with the silver back
and then we will also likely see a gold
version similar to what we saw with the
iPhone 5s the thing that's been so
popular that they can keep in stock we
have leaked images pointing in that
direction and it would only seem to make
sense that they would carry the same
thing through on the iPad lineup that
they've got going on with the iPhone 5s
lineup otherwise you're looking at an
identical back casing here just in a
brand new color so as I mentioned
earlier in this video if you are
interested in seeing how this new iPad 5
might stack up to the previous
generation in terms of dimensions make
sure to look at my initial video that I
uploaded on the channel I will link it
down in the description anyway guys that
wraps up this particular video and first
look
the brand-new Space Gray backing which
will likely ship with the next
generation of iPad very shortly if
you're interested in seeing more videos
like this remember to subscribe also
leave a thumbs up down below if you
enjoyed this and I will catch you on the
next episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
