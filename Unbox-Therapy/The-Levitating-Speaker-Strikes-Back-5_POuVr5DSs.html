reserved for the magical folks David
Blaine type characters but recently it
has found its way into electronics and
gadgets I have shown you various
levitating devices including a
levitating lightbulb that dangerous they
get people's attention
can't help it sitting there's floating
the oohs the AHS it's got it all but
today is a combination of things that I
never saw coming together the Star Wars
Death Star Bluetooth levitating speaker
kind of a Death Star sitting on the desk
that's no good it's got a float and it's
gonna play music what a combination of
things gravity defying or rotates above
the magnetic base up to five hours of
continuous playback on Bluetooth and a
powerful five watt speaker and look at
that it's even a winner of a 2015 CES
award the company is called plox and it
is fully Disney licensed here you know
Disney's got to get a cut I mean that's
a villain right there you see that mask
you know what's going on you let me know
in the comments who's the most famous
villain ever
I think I'm just saying that I'm gonna
be reading through them can't remember
who did you say yeah Jack Torrence from
The Shining forget it forget it it's
either gotta be Darth Vader or the Joker
once again I'm looking for a knife check
out this knife alright if you're new to
the channel you don't know what this is
go watch the video this is the most
elaborate Swiss Army knife possibly ever
go watch that video it's a fun one I
even cut myself in that video and I'm
still recovering
alright let's crack this baby open here
we go whoo some foam power brick micro
USB cable here is the Death Star itself
whoo nice weight to it look at that how
they they got the speaker grilles on
there that's a nice-looking little
that's a little death star right there
this is somehow gonna make sure that you
line it up correctly so it's not slam
down onto the basis it uses incredibly
strong magnets and this is the base this
is the magical part of it here's what I
think it's like this and then you like
this Oh see that's what I'm talking
about with the whole this thing needs to
be turned on for you to get that I don't
know this is certain there's a charge
that takes place to the magnet which
then allows the levitation make sure you
make sure that you won't be yeah yeah
because if you see what I'm saying
you'll ding up your desk star don't ding
your desk star don't thing it all right
get her juiced up yes oh that obviously
was not I know the problem the power
switch of course Jack jeez man get your
death star floating brother okay all
right now you like I'll see any magic
what's the big deal here Lou that just
helps you line it up now let's guess Oh
guess what
that baby is levitating right now now
let me see
bluetooth are you there brother it's
called dead star in the bluetooth
preferences area Oh tan tan tan tan tan
tan tan tan tan tan tan
are you a Don guy or a nun guy like Don
tanta or Nana
now the thing is since it spins around
you've got to have these little grills
around the outside Oh me how many
bluetooth speakers can you play baseball
with alright don't play you're not
supposed to play nevermind the base here
nevermind the guide where you at where
are you at brother whew I feel you kind
of pulling away from me
you would think that you could find the
point without a guide no way I don't
think it's happening with this one no no
chance man
you just got to nail that location it is
not the loudest Bluetooth speaker I've
ever tested then again it's the size of
my palm Vic Grimes
nightmares check the man out I mean
listen listen
is there a certain novelty factor of
course the best sounding Bluetooth
speaker I've ever featured well I think
you know the answer to that because I've
blown you away with some stuff the
microphone here got boo
but you're not going to purchase
something like this with Strictly sound
quality you're after so novelty factor
maxed out on this one if Darth Vader was
a real thing this would be on his desk
you would like propose an idea you'd be
like listen man I think we can go with
the the cheaper paper towel save a few
bucks in the Death Star and he's just
he's choking you out and meanwhile this
thing is just spinning around playing
some vic rhymes and and that's how you
die this thing is fun it's about fun
lighten up have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
