another episode of three cool tech deals
you guys seem to be loving the show so
if you do if you're one of those people
make sure to leave a thumbs up down
below that just lets me know that you
know what's up today's deals three
different price points I wanted to mix
it up a little bit here one thing is
incredibly affordable the next thing is
sort of in the middle and then finally
we have something that's a little bit
more expensive so we're going to start
at the low end this thing is a charger a
travel charger it's very small it's from
a company called Aki I believe a UK ey
and as you can see here a number of
different ports what's cool is that
couple of them are 5 volt 2.4 amps so
those are faster charging of course for
devices that can take advantage of it
then you have your standard 5 volt 1 amp
ports as well but then it's also got
something called OTG and actually use it
for a little bit of file transfer
storage on external devices that's
pretty cool even though you're only
using your phone and you get all this
for 10 dollars what ten dollars what can
you get Jack what can you get with ten
dollars hey Jake this is what you can
get for ten dollars or you could go to
our favorite chicken spot around the
corner and you could get a a meal to go
they actually have a drive-thru which is
a little bit crazy for rotisserie
chicken and you get it on top of a fresh
bun it's called chicken on a kaiser you
could get one of those for $10 one
problem with the chicken sandwich no OTG
no file-sharing okay real quick before I
finish up this is thirty-nine watts
seven point eight amps and I looked at a
bunch of these different chargers on
Amazon lots of them are 25 watts this
thing is not only inexpensive but it's
also one of the most powerful packages
in this price range next up we have a
rugged little boombox from a company
called Eaton I actually did a video on
this a while ago it's 50 bucks right now
list price is 130 you'll often see it at
100 but at 50 bucks this is pretty cool
it also has a built-in solar panel for
all of you survival freaks so you can
actually charge things
using this speaker which is using the
Sun think about it so as you can see in
this picture here it is sitting by a
pool charging up a phone so not only
does it play music and charge stuff it
also is somewhat resistant to water I
believe ipx4 rated so it can get
splashed on a little bit it provides
roughly eight hours of listening
according to this page here and it
actually has stereo speakers two
speakers in it which is unusual in this
space and unusual at this price point
the Eton rugged ruckus solar-powered
Bluetooth smartphone charging speaker
quo a little bit more expensive this is
the the silver we had the bronze this is
the silver and now it's time for the
gold deal of the day now you guys
probably saw my reason does it suck
video on the $15 amazonbasics headphones
which are actually pretty decent but
maybe you want to step the game up a
little bit and maybe you want to
experiment with an open-back audiophile
grade headphone the HD 5 v 8 from
sennheiser killers in the headphone game
killers in a good way like killing the
game so what you have here is an open
back design as I mentioned before gives
you a wider soundstage that's the way to
enjoy your your uncompressed audio files
or your vinyl records or you know maybe
you just want to venture into this high
quality audio space this is a cool place
to get started now these headphones can
be used still with an external amplifier
or DAC but they're ok to also use
without what else is there to say it's a
relatively high-end pair of Sennheiser's
for a lot less than their list price if
you've been in the market looking for a
moment this might be your moment your
moment to shine
Sennheiser style that wraps up this
video thank you very much for watching
hope you are enjoying these three cool
tech deals I've also made a playlist of
all these videos if you want to go back
and and watch all the deals you may have
missed out on or just get introduced
products you didn't even know you wanted
if you want to check out that playlist
I'll drop a link in the description
thank you very much for watching and
I'll catch you on the next episode and
also don't forget that thumb love
not that kind of thumb love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
