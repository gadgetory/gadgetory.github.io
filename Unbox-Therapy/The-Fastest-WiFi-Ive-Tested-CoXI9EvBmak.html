probably using it to watch this video
right here that said there are a lot of
sort of subpar Wi-Fi scenarios out there
that exist in houses Wi-Fi is always
competing with obstructions and walls no
up until this point I've been using
off-the-shelf consumer-level networking
equipment okay
but I've had my eye on some of the more
enterprise type stuff because I am a
Wi-Fi enthusiast when the company
ubiquity reached out to me found out
that I'm actually moving studio spaces
into one that's much bigger they said
Lou let us sponsor a video let us send
you our hot new networking equipment
this is called amplifi HD and this baby
claims to have solid coverage over
20,000 square feet and I said you know
what let's do it
you've got the router itself with a
touchscreen
I mean they've even got the speed test
on the box they know who they're
speaking to and then you've got these
two mesh units now these are going to
place in various locations and these
three units will then speak together
here is a diagram of just what I'm
talking about you see the router unit is
in the center of the house here and
those mesh points are on the fringes
creating a blanket like a warm blanket
on a cold day so hot right now
you're still a wire into this guy you
can set it up I like this part
via bluetooth and an iOS device or an
Android device so whoa look at that
unboxing experience Wow factory-fresh
power USB number of Ethernet connection
points these here are the mesh points
log of that oh so it's got the the power
built straight into it that's foolproof
Jack could set this up
Jack has a hard time tying his shoes I
usually recommend velcro oh my that's
Wow
that's a magnet haha so a cable to go
from your modem to the router there's
also a power brick here so the first
thing you're going to notice when you
plug this in is this display lights up
and the next step is to launch the
application it finds the router so we're
now connected little glowing light along
bottom alright so now I have the router
plugged into the modem and I've got the
mesh points distributed as well so it is
time of course for the critical testing
let's let the testing do the talking you
can see the reception of each of the
mesh points now there is a built-in
performance test as well you can see
here now this is going to vary based on
your location but that's the whole point
of these mesh points whoo-hoo 150 point
2 megabit per second I saw it peak at
there you can see there it averaged out
to 113 by 20 with a 19 millisecond ping
now if I go out to speed test here 120
megabit per second on the down now on
the old network again just a standard
high-end router in one spot and that's
it I mean no glare I don't even need to
say I mean to result the results speak
for themselves right you're paying for a
bigger pipe so you might as well invest
in the networking equipment that
supports it this is really something
that I wish existed a long time ago
every so often a company reaches out to
me and says hey please check out our new
thing and then every so often there's
something you really wish had existed
when you were a kid all right so you got
to check these guys out that's the
bottom line better Wi-Fi the proof is in
the pudding I don't need to say it
because you saw it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
