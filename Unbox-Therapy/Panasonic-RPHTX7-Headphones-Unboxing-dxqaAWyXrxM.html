therapy and today we're taking a look at
another set of headphones now if you
know me and if you know the channel then
you know I'm really into headphones and
I've unboxed a bunch of them over there
now these are a little different they're
not quite as high-end as some of the
other stuff I've unboxed and by high-end
I guess I mean high price tag these are
only about 89 bucks and really the
reason I was attracted to them is
because of the retro styling these
remind me of some of the old-school
headphones we used to see back in the
day and the unboxing is actually pretty
old-school too the only thing inside the
box is one sheet of paper here so
definitely don't buy these for the
extras but don't let the unboxing fool
you these things do have some high
quality materials in use they've got
some real genuine leather as well as a
number of different brushed aluminum
accents so let's get a closer look at
these here's how that adjustment
mechanism works rather than have some
sort of a mechanical aspect to the
headband these ear cups themselves just
slide up and down these rails it's
actually a fairly robust style although
a lot of people might not like the
appearance of it here you can get a
better look at those brushed aluminum
accents as well as the glossy black ear
Cup now these do come in a number of
different colors of course to suit your
personal taste here's a better look at
that perforated leather headband as you
can see it's stitched this is really
timeless design right here we have a
three and a half millimeter headphone
jack which looks like it's gold-plated
and here's a better look at the
comfortable leather ear cups these are
an enclosed style headphone so there
shouldn't be too much sound bleed and
they should do a decent job of isolating
sound from the outside coming in anyway
guys if you haven't checked out the
channel yet go ahead and do so and if
you want to do one better then click
that subscribe button because hopefully
I'll have a number of different products
to suit your tastes coming up in the
future until next time guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
