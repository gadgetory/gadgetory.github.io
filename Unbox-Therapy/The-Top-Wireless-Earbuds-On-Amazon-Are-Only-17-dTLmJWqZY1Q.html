for value for you of course so you can
get more for your money all right
hard-earned dollars those are and today
I feel like I hope that I've uncovered
some value in the tech world this thing
here the mpow sport wireless earphones
these are the best-selling wireless
earbuds on Amazon and they have a four
star review with eleven thousand is it
11,000 reviews well 11,000 reviews holy
moly I mean I haven't tried of yet but
this is the best part these things are
like 17 or $18 wireless fully wireless
17 or 18 dog plus IP rating waterproof
for the fitness folks ipx7 waterproof
rating for the fitness what 17 or 18
bucks what's going on here man people
are spending hundreds of dollars on
wireless earbuds do they need to be
should they be I don't know I've tried
them all you know I have but the thing
is 100 200 $300 earbuds or headphones
are not a reality for everyone and and
some people might even be wasting some
cash on them and not getting the cost to
performance ratio they possibly could
have now granted we're gonna need to
approach this video with the the correct
expectation right now this moment that
I'm shooting is it might be different
after this video goes up but these are
$16.99 so we just need to keep that
framework in our minds when evaluating
these things they are cheap and they are
fully wireless so they don't need to be
as good as a $200 pair of earbuds they
need to be good enough and save you a
boatload of cash that's the idea that's
why we're looking at this anyhow true
high-definition sound and deep bass
advanced noise cancellation well I'm not
sure that there's actual noise
cancellation happening hopefully some
isolation comfort and stability design
we now know where we're saving the cash
for sibility made for sport built-in
microphone for hands-free operation a
cool and handy carry evie a box included
operating range 10 meters is bluetooth
for one
by time 220 hours charging time 1.5 and
the talk / playing time apparently seven
hours now I gather that some of those
eleven thousand individuals who decided
to review these things have had that
criteria at least somewhat met so
they're not just making stuff up and
throwing it on the back that's my guess
at least anyhow let's crack this open
and see what we're working with it's
amazing can you imagine fully wireless
earbuds $16.99 what's going on here okay
travel case included a little bit of
paperwork and that's that all right
everything is in here oh all right
presentation it's okay so far a flat
cable that goes behind your head we have
some ear loops which are kind of
important for you know the fitness types
runners and so on you might like this
style this is kind of flexible and
hopefully it's going to stay on a little
bit better with that extra added ear
loop around the outside of the ear now
it does have interchangeable ear tips
they've included a bunch in here ohm
comply style ear tips and then we have
three sizes of your typical ear tips
small medium and large and lastly a
microUSB cable to charge them up pretty
self-explanatory and of course the case
to keep it all in when you're not using
it now the earbuds fit in like that like
this we'll go behind here and then this
will go in like this I don't know if
Kirk can see that there now I guess the
medium is pre-installed that's actually
the medium already feels these are
comfortable that's a comfortable earbud
right now it's got decent sound
isolation with the medium tip on it and
then you get the the added security of
having the hook over the ear so I could
be that could be at the basketball court
you know I could be I could be you know
Steph Curry need to pop a shot Steph
Curry downstairs and stay mobile
with no issue no in all seriousness
these are these are on their in their
and they're on you see what I mean more
comfortable than I expect it okay now on
the earbuds there's a little door here a
little rubber door that covers up the
charge port
it also has volume controls somehow so
yeah they fit volume up and down on
there as well so you can quickly adjust
the volume oh and this button actually
clicks this big see that so that's your
play pause and answering phone calls and
probably your power switch as well I'm
guessing let's see if these have any
power okay they do I got power on right
now your headset is connected okay let's
go ahead here and a couple tunes
honestly like okay here's the thing
ladies and gentlemen every so often you
figure something out you find something
like this for the money that is just
like such an easy thing to recommend
these do they sound good they sound
better than I expected the sound I I
think the Internet in this case might be
right with those 11,000 reviews I don't
expect them to be like crazy battery
performers or anything like that but
this package like with the comfort and
the sound and the price it's a bit
ridiculous if I'm being honest it's like
one of the best purchases in tech right
now 1699 what do you got you got wired
earbuds I don't know what's your Excuse
like you don't want to spend a 17 you
spent 17 on lunch this is a Wednesday
afternoon this is a Taco Tuesday this is
a champagne breakfast this is some bacon
and eggs you know this is some real
maple syrup because we'll trying to make
the argument on Aunt Jemima and I just
I'm sorry you know that's just not where
we're coming from on that we're talking
about Quebec we're talking about Ontario
we're talking about maple trees that's
what we're talking about for $16.99 guys
it's like now I realize there's a job to
be done here I need to be investigating
this stuff I need to be out there on the
internet uncovering finding the deals
that are worth paying attention to and
evaluating those you're not gonna get a
big brand name in fact you're gonna get
something quite the opposite your
headphones are gonna be called em pal so
you gotta be comfy with that you might
even want to own that on another level
and be like look Lou told me about the N
pal I don't even care like what you got
beats okay fine 1699 yo you just wasted
a party and a parka and some ping pong
and a pizza and some popcorn and I got
all those things and my tunes so maybe
it's gonna be em pal for me the wireless
earbuds that probably most people should
own and most people are probably
spending too much on these things to be
honest myself included most of us need
to be a little more kids
because you take a peek around and
there's some stuff out there you could
save some cash and get some decent
performance and if somebody tries to
make fun of you you know I mean somebody
at school you're in high school they
like wet it what's these empowers you'd
be like okay keep chatting
go watch Luke they'll let you know it's
all good it's fine you're in great shape
you're better off check the reviews it's
not just me it's the mpow flame seems
like the real deal 1699 cheeseburger
fries ice cream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
