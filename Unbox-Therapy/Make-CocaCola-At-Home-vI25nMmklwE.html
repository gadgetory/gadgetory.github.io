I don't normally say pumped up that's kinda new. Me and Jack have been talking about this thing since it arrived
We have a serious problem here at the office with keeping cold beverages or actually any kind of edible material
for very long. We consume it. This thing here is like a solution to all of our problems
All the problems in our lives. Keurig has asked me to check out their brand new KOLD. Keurig KOLD
A variety of your favorite beverages made in this machine right at home in a little pod
And it's licensed! You have Coca-cola products in here. Concept is you have a little pod. We see a picture of it there
Stick it in the machine. Hit the button. Boo-ya?
Cold beverage? Let's jump inside the box and find out if that's exactly what goes down
First thing I see here: A prime and care pod. Do not discard. Required for setup and maintenance. Okay.
Coca-cola, Sprite, Red Barn, Waterful
Looks like a little tray for the bottom.
So this is it. This is the Keurig Kold. Now it has a refrigeration unit built in
So this is the reservoir for water. Ohhh! This is glasses
Drink maker chills beverages to an ideal temperature of 39 degrees farenheit
This whole thing feels pretty robust man. Plug her in and let her go. Alright we're gonna plug her in
Plug it in
So I think you guys can probably hear that
As I've said sort of around the same volume as a mini fridge. So we left it for a little while and we're actually not going to have to do that again
That's just the initial setup. And now it's time to prime it
There's a little thing here called a Prime and Care Pod. Fill the water reservoir with room temperature or cooler water
That's what we have in here right now. It's filled up. Insert the Prime and Care Pod
Put it right in here I guess
Done. Place a glass here on the drip tray. So we have the included glasses here
Alright let's go here. This is exciting
K next up make a drink. This is what it's about right now!
Ok Seraphine Passion Fruit. Natural Flavor seltzer mix. &amp;quot;Lifts you to a place of breezy effervescence&amp;quot;
What a combination of words there. No calories, low calories, zero calories
Zero calorie flavored water.The classic Coca-Cola at home. Seems impossible
It's happening here! What! Look at his thing!
Ohh this looks fancy too. Flynn's soda shop root beer. Mmmmmm
What! Diet coke too! Course you do! This is another flavored carbonated water
This is one is persian lime. Flyte &amp;quot;Red Rush&amp;quot;. Natural fruit punch flavored sports hydration mix
It's time to do a taste test. Oh my goodness the pressure is on
The pressure is on right now. So I'm gonna get started with one of these. Sarafine Persian Lime pods.
Just place this guy in. Close the lid down. Now let's push this button for the magic part
You see that carbonation right now. Look at that
oooo!
Quite refreshing.
Gotta be honest quite refreshing! A little bit nicer than a standard water beverage. So I believe these little beads
inside are what allow for the carbonation to be added to the flavor
Next up I have Zero Calorie flavored water so this is a non carbonated-similar idea but non carbonated
Mmm! You came here for the OG of the soda business. You came here for the Coca-Cola Classic
Everything hinges on this little guy right here
The future is now
Don't laugh Jack.
Ooouuuuhhhhhh ho ho ho hoooo
That looks like Coca Cola
That is Coca Cola
Gotta bite. Gotta little bite to it.
I don't think I've ever been this excited for Coke in my life. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
So there you have it. Keurig Kold
