another video and today we're checking
out another device from blue this is a
more premium offering called the pure XL
a 6-inch wqhd AMOLED display a 2560
resolution Gorilla Glass a 2 gigahertz
octa-core processor Android lollipop LTE
a 24 megapixel camera 8 megapixel selfie
camera from facing 64 gigs of memory 3
gigs of RAM fingerprint sensor a big
3500 milliamp hour battery with quick
charge and it's relatively thin as well
so as you can tell a pretty impressive
spec list it's around 350 bucks one of
my favorite features is that big battery
even on flagship phones you don't
necessarily see all the time you see the
fingerprint sensor is on the back right
like that it appears to feature a
removable back as you can see so you've
got some expansion a couple of SIM card
slots many of their phones feature dual
SIM card slots and in this case micro sd
so flexibility continues to be a key
function here this looks like your power
slack hold switch here volume rocker and
then another button down here guessing
it's a dedicated shutter button probably
for the camera that's sort of right
where your hand lines up so satisfying
some capacitive buttons on the bottom
here menu button home button and back
button forward facing camera and speaker
power brick quick charge as I mentioned
before and get that 3500 milliamp hour
battery charged up in a reasonable sum
headphones here oh these are cool okay
so you've got an in-ear style with
interchangeable tips so no matter what
size your ear canal is you should be
good I've always wanted to do those
custom ear buds that are molded to your
ear canal Jack knows what I'm talking
you probably need them
Booya we are a PITA
we are rapido in other words the quick
guide this is interesting we have some
NFC stickers that's cool we can set up
certain behaviors based on wherever we
put these maybe on the nightstand in the
kitchen in the car so that the device
can now this cable this came with that
mega battery blue phone that I unboxed
recently but it also works as an OTG
cable so use it for file-sharing whatnot
and just like the other products from
these guys they're giving you everything
you've got a screen protector even
though you've got Gorilla Glass 2 cases
jeez and one of them is a flip style
like this standard I believe that
material is called TPU let's boot up the
phone oh hello there
very nice yelling pretty responsive
actually look at that mm pretty quick -
guys never get to see this camera you're
always looking at the other camera
teaming up there in the corner
see me right in front and then you guys
you guys are in the lens accord these
pictures look pretty good not too shabby
the old selfie you know what man this
beard is getting out of hand 3 - selfie
saturated colors dark blacks I'm done
done and Anna that the camera app is
actually fairly configurable options for
resolution and there's a countdown you
have control over everything
focus shutter speed white balance ISO
beauty shall I try a beauty Jack alright
fine you've convinced me
oh yes smooth me out baby
slimming oh hello there hello there slim
Lou Ready Set beauty
huh I do like having this dedicated
shutter button it's just a little bit
more satisfying than tapping the screen
okay can you just go with that for a
second yeah as you know in this
environment okay this is bright
whenever I film a video in here I get a
little bit of a suntan
actually I don't tan very well I'm gonna
be completely honest with you
genetically that's not me you probably
saw my hockey video recently genetically
that's me you shovel a little snow you
become a better man Jack tell them we're
now at full brightness and I hope you
appreciate that in this super bright
environment
you're actually still easily able to
make everything out can you hit one of
these lights I just want them to see the
difference of how bright it is again
yeah do have a tool that's you happy
couple things to note real quick on your
first bill don't so the speakers on the
bottom but it's actually pretty loud
you're basically gonna get super dark
blacks here very vibrant saturated
colors if that's your thing probably
should be the fingerprint sensor scanner
what do you say scanner a sensor I don't
know add fingerprint okay finger print
what man have they gotten quick
sometimes you forget so there you have
