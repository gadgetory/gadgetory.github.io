another video and today I've got
something exclusive for you as you know
there's been an enormous amount of hype
around the brand-new Apple watch but in
advance of actually receiving the watch
I actually got the opportunity to check
out the surface material that will be
used for the face of the Apple watch
sport which will likely be the most
popular version of the Apple watch so I
received these two components here from
the legendary Sonny Dixon and as you can
see they represent both Apple watch
sizes the 42 millimeter as well as the
38 millimeters now the Apple watch sport
version does not feature a sapphire
coated display or glass instead it's
using a new product potentially new or
rebranded product from Apple called ion
X glass now this ion X glass claims to
be significantly harder and more durable
than standard glass somewhere in the
neighborhood of Gorilla Glass some are
even speculating that this ion X glass
is just a rebranded version of Gorilla
Glass that Apple has been using on
devices for a long time that said it's
nowhere near the hardness of sapphire
which will be used in the more expensive
Apple watches so of course the question
concern is will the Apple watch sport
stand up - scratching from various
materials so in front of me I have a
couple of different items in order to
experiment now you might be wondering
what's with this name ion X well the
name is actually referring to the
process by which the glass itself is
fortified on a molecular level this is
what creates this tougher surface layer
when compared with normal glass now
there are actually a couple of upsides
to using this style of glass when
compared to something that sapphire
coated not only is this cheaper and
lighter it's also a little bit more
flexible so in theory it should be less
prone to shattering when compared with
sapphire okay so I have a number of
objects in front of me here that would
normally concern you if they got near
your brand new device or Apple watch for
that matter I've got a key a knife some
steel wool some sandpaper and some
more hardcore sandpaper this one is
using aluminum oxide as the abrasive
material this should probably do some
damage to this glass aluminum oxide
okay so first up we're going to try out
the least dangerous of the items I'll be
testing this is a simple key for a
mailbox I believe so let's go ahead and
attempt to scratch up this 42 millimeter
face alright I'll push as hard as I can
here pretty impressive so far absolutely
no scratching more fingerprints than
anything else okay a key is not going to
be sharp enough hard enough to scratch
this ion X material there you go next up
we have my trusty little knife here
let's go ahead and check this out
probably scratch my table long before
I'll scratch this surface no not at all
just sliding right on top absolutely no
problem
inspect this again nothing nothing from
the knife either so let's step the game
up and move on to the steel wool
not a chance steel wool better go back
to washing dishes son
next up the first sandpaper whoo now
that seems like we are making some
progress here yes indeed ladies and
gentlemen now I want to give a shout out
real quick to my good friend mkbhd about
a year ago he stepped the scratch game
up with some sandpaper on what was the
original iPhone 6 display set in the
benchmark for scratch tests but this is
demolishing yeah scratching it up like
crazy see it there so yeah with some
sandpaper we're definitely scratching it
up let's go ahead and grab the hardcore
sandpaper oh god listen to that noise
okay now we are completely marked up I'm
gonna put this orange back underneath so
you can see that we are completely
marked up there now something to note
here if we were dealing with pure
sapphire neither of these two surfaces
these two sand papers would be capable
of scratching it so as suspected ion X
material the Gorilla Glass like material
nowhere near as scratch resistant as
sapphire we didn't expect any different
and it's on a $350 watch compared with
some of the far more expensive ones in
order to get into the sapphire coating
you'll be looking at the much more
expensive Apple watch or watch Edition
don't keep sandpaper near your brand-new
Apple watch sport or Apple watch for
that matter but as you can see it did
very well against keys and knives and
certainly coins so in everyday usage
this will not necessarily be how he
watch turns out that said when you're
talking about longevity there is a
reason why watch manufacturers have been
using sapphire crystal for a very long
time if you look at any expensive watch
the vast majority of expensive watches
have a sapphire crystal and those things
can go scratch free for 15 plus years so
there you have it all right guys that
wraps up this video I hope you
appreciated it if you did make sure to
leave a thumbs up down below also as
mentioned I've got an Apple watch
shipping to myself on Friday so expect
some coverage on the device as soon as
it arrives if you're not a subscriber go
ahead and click that button so you don't
miss out on any of this new or exclusive
content thanks again for watching and
I'll catch you on the next episode later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
