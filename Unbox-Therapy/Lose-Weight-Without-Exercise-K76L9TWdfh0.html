be the weirdest product that's ever been
featured here on unbox therapy I don't
know for sure but it's quite possible I
saw this thing on Amazon and I was like
man I gotta test this out this sounds so
crazy I don't even know if it can be
real I don't know
is it safe like I start asking all these
questions this is called Moe Deus you
put this on your head and apparently you
lose weight Oh what this was true what
did wouldn't everybody just be rocking
one of these things like their claim is
no change in diet no change in exercise
and you drop in body fat this is the
headset these are the little electrode
things that connect behind your ears
like this this right this is the
important piece this is the piece it has
to make contact I don't know a little
bit nervous guys if I'm being honest I'm
a bit nervous if it actually works why
aren't more people talking about this
why have I not heard about this
opportunity lect roads ECG electrodes
and actually make Willie do do this
instead wipes
we got wipes ah there's like a power
brick probably to charge the thing up
yes little USB power break you charge it
over microUSB it's a fat user manual
it's probably like caution caution
caution do not put on other body parts
you know what I mean this product raised
around two million dollars on IndieGoGo
at five hundred bucks a pop so a lot of
people spent a lot of money on these
things as far as like the testing is
concerned it's been a really small
sample size of people that have seen any
kind of results so I'm really skeptical
diverges skeptical there's some reviews
on Amazon where people say this thing
doesn't work at all it just makes me
feel nauseous I'm a little concerned to
be honest as I probably should be so
because of that I want to bring in the
one and only Willie do he has agreed to
submit himself to whatever terror this
thing is going to supply to his brain
here he is our
very own unbox therapy guinea pig mr.
Hilley
hoo ha hoo da who that that's him
we got the wipes it's very medical this
whole thing is very medical these are
the wipes you'll be wiping yourself so
make sure you're white
look how medical this stuff is man it's
not freaking out look at that these
smells so medical smell is oh yeah it's
Hospital fresh give this a smell how
medical is that yeah we're in a big
leagues now boys reviewing medical
equipment next up we're gonna be
evaluating MRI machines my understanding
is that there's multiple levels of
intensity that you can utilize on his
device on this app will says he's
willing to go to level 10 he's willing
to go there for us oh my goodness
gracious
give will thumbs up or something I don't
know man the guy he will he's doing this
for you at the beginning of the videos
that I was gonna do it for you I'm only
gonna do it if he doesn't you should
well I'm thinking about it we only to
opinion I'll think about it but here we
go
Will's gonna start losing some weight
okay Oh power level one do you feel
anything are you seasick no not I don't
feel anything
okay we're gonna go no nothing
level three do you feel it in your
hypothalamus yet hmm
still nothing okay yeah level four
nothing I mean you're not oh you oh oh
boy his hypothalamus is being tickled oh
it does yeah I do feel something I do
feel something to be honest
it feels like disorientation whoa level
5 level 6 oh yeah yeah what what my fuel
I feel kind of dizzy now like gross
yeah not good you want it off I'm not
gonna throw up but it's like it's very
disorienting that is so weird just these
little guys to have you feeling mess
right up do you want to go up down pause
what do you want to do well let's bring
it up a little bit we're gonna bring it
on we're gonna go I want to see the mass
7 8 9 level 10 level 2 okay Jack wanted
it all the way up this wasn't me this
was Jack no pressure here hmm
you feel gross yeah it it honestly feels
like it's the world is kind of like
shifting its it's like rocking oh I'm
serious the world but yeah could you get
up and walk could you walk a couple of
feet I I could I got see if that's true
or not okay when I sit down I feel like
something's not right
it's like some sort of vertigo or
something now what about the appetite D
are you hungry right now
Kouji right now mm-hmm
if you could have anything in the world
any food right now what would you go for
I can go for some Popeyes
some chicken although I feel like
there's some sort of stinging sensation
back here it's kind of like a prickly
kind of thing yeah he doles I mean wills
obviously he's four minutes into this
and the suggested amount is one hour
they want you to sit back watch some
Netflix for one hour yeah I can't do it
like I would probably just feel so
nauseous
I would probably maybe throw up after an
hour I mean you're four minutes in this
is not comfortable not worth it no
matter yeah you gotta try this
okay I'll pause it for you this is
interesting you're not looking forward
to it like I don't really feel like
being nauseous right now I got to be on
it am i peeling this off right yeah I do
this right well where did you put it
right there actually you know flip it
the hypothalamus yeah yeah I'm trying to
prepare myself psychologically here
okay reserve where zoo reserve I got no
word I'm dying already will okay level 2
level 2 I already feel level 2 I feel a
little jittery genus yeah I'm going I'm
going I'm going
3 3 is prickling me for sure
nauseousness not really there yet
4
five
six is this safe what are we doing is
this safe I mean oh you're dead I know I
feel it six seven eight ten all right I
went all the way up oh yeah I feel what
you're saying oh that's my expression if
I can emote but it's like it's like
seasickness is like a boat yeah right
and it happens like instantly see some
people in the reviews or whatever we're
saying like maybe it just makes you
nauseous you don't to eat and then I'll
sudden you're dropping pounds do you
believe that
oh man imagine trying to concentrate on
like a show for an hour that's going on
I could live I could survive at like a
level three for one hour like this
suggested yeah I could do an hour yeah I
feel okay right now like I could focus I
mean I don't get the nauseous feeling
the key thing is it has to deliver on
the promise otherwise why are you
wearing it like is it gonna is it gonna
improve your your fitness are you gonna
lose weight are you gonna lose body fat
like they say you were reading the
IndieGoGo comments what did you discover
well most of them actually said that it
didn't work and they've been using it
for months some of them actually wanted
to return them or sell them this could
be a case of too good to be true
everyone wants the shortcut they want
the easy way they want technology to
solve all the problems yeah they want it
to be quick and electronic and they
don't want to they don't want to do it
themselves mm-hmm they want the magic
trick and this thing claims to be but it
looks so far like it's not delivering
yeah on the original promise does anyone
else want to wear it for science
sure Wow ladies and gentlemen
Willy do you heard it here will do has
agreed to undergo the very first medical
study ever in unbox therapy history one
month we're gonna find out if this thing
can do anything up against
will he do and his habits staying the
exact same are you gonna wear it every
day I'm gonna try he's gonna wear it
every day ladies and gentlemen
oh my goodness this is exciting yeah I'm
I'm excited to hear the results that's
it you guys are gonna have to stay tuned
it's this the future of weight loss I
don't believe it but Willie dudes gonna
