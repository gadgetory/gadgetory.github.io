another unboxing video and as you can
probably tell this one's a little bit
special a little bit bigger than usual
if you've been around the channel for a
while you probably saw my original
unboxing of this item the Coors Light
refresh rate err a very cool talking
fridge for your beer well this is
similar with a little twist and if
you're a sports fan you're gonna want to
stick around and pay some attention
because you're gonna get a shot at
actually winning one of these so let's
go ahead jump inside the box and see
what this Refresh Raider is all about so
the first thing you're likely to notice
is the San Francisco Giants branding
besides being a great addition for
sports fans there's a more specific
reason but this Refresh Raiders
appearance this season Coors Light in
conjunction with the Giants will be
giving away one of these babies every
single time the Giants hit a home run
full details will be at the end of this
video as well as down in the description
but why would you even want one of these
oh I don't know maybe because it's one
of the coolest beer fridges on the
planet the refresh rate err features a
gravity-fed beer delivery system similar
to a vending machine you simply load it
up slap the button on the front and the
refresh rate ER will deliver an icy cold
beverage for your consumption it's got a
48 beer capacity and a silver bullet
chamber this lets you hide a couple of
beers away from the general population
of cans guaranteeing a couple of extras
in an emergency beverage situation
loading it up is easy to do and it's got
temperature control so you can hit that
chilly sweet spot but the main
attraction at least in my opinion are
the lights and the audio each time you
hit the button on the front an LED will
flash along with a specialized audio
message the original refresh rate er had
some comedic beer specific messaging
with each push for this San Francisco
Giants version the messaging has been
customized to reflect the partnership
between Coors Light the Giants and most
importantly drinking beer while watching
baseball let's go ahead and check out
the brand new messaging
so there you have it in awesome addition
to your mancave
the special edition San Francisco Giants
refrigerator from Coors Light
anyways that wraps up this episode
thanks as always for watching and I'll
catch you on the next episode later guys</div></body></html>
