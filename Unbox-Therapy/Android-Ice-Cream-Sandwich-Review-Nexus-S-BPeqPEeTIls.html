unbox therapy and I've actually got a
very cool video for you this is my Nexus
S Samsung or Google Nexus S and I have
been able to port over to an Ice Cream
Sandwich this is obviously a port of the
SDK that's going to be released on the
upcoming Galaxy Nexus and everything is
not functioning 100% but believe it or
not most new features are and there's
quite a bit we can learn by looking at
what's being implemented here and we can
really get an idea basically of how it's
going to run on this Nexus S a lot of
people are gonna be waiting and hoping
for that upgrade potentially on this
platform as well as other smartphones
Android smartphones that are hoping for
the update so the first thing you notice
is this different lockscreen here we can
go straight into the camera or into the
unlock we're gonna go into the unlock
for now that's so that you can improve
the speed of your access to the camera
now something you're going to notice
straight away probably one of the
biggest changes is the the way that you
load the app drawer here rather than
scrolling up and down you've got left to
right now and another really nice thing
is you've actually got widgets right
within that space and that includes
widgets from third-party applications
that you've installed another nice thing
about widgets is that they are resizable
so you can select any widget here's a
real nice scrollable Gmail widget and
then you can obviously resize that to
suit your needs as I mentioned before it
is scrollable and everything is really
smooth believe it or not that surprised
me considering the fact that this is a
single core device unlike all those dual
core devices as well as obviously the
beast that's coming out that's going to
be called the Galaxy Nexus now another
thing that you can do in ice cream
sandwiches you can make folders well you
could always make folders in Android but
they look a little different and behave
a little differently now all you've got
to do is select an app and drop it on
top of another one and just like that
you've got a pretty little stack of
applications and then when you select it
boom they just pop open a very nice neat
little you know animation they're
actually by default you've got your
Google Apps down here and there in a
little stack themselves a lot of the
applications have had minor redesigns
Google Plus for example has been minorly
redesigned within within Ice Cream
Sandwich but the main thing is that it's
been implemented well across the OS for
you know sort of updating you know from
other elements from other places for
example the camera and so on and so
forth there's a lot of built-in
functionality for google plus the other
app that has changed as YouTube the
YouTube app is now a lot lighter and
brighter than it was previously it's
obviously a lot darker currently on
Gingerbread and or any of the older
Android platforms that you might be on
this one's really clean everything is
surprisingly smooth you can obviously
take videos and upload them to YouTube
directly from here as well another thing
that has been getting some press and
obviously has been getting more press on
the Apple side which is a voice
recognition now if you're in messaging
something special about this voice
recognition is that it comes up
instantly now you're probably saying
what does that mean instantly what
happens is rather than sitting there and
attempting to figure out what you're
saying and then come up with it later
this one can do it as you're speaking so
I'm going to keep speaking and you're
going to notice that it keeps on taking
down my words
it's pretty crazy actually let's go
ahead and try an actual message I'm
gonna I'm gonna say I'm done here
because I'm probably talking faster than
I would be if you know I was sending a
text obviously this is for the sake of
this review here but let's go ahead and
try that again I'm going to be late for
the meeting I know I said I was going to
be 30 minutes instead I will be one hour
I mean there it is it's perfect guys it
absolutely
it absolutely nailed it it's actually
pretty crazy as long as you take a
little bit of time in between your words
I mean you can't speak as fast as I
normally do which is probably a little
bit faster than usual but it hammers it
right away and it's nice to get that
immediate
feedback from the device showing that
it's taken it in now all the other you
know voice recognition software is that
I have tried they take a little while to
think and that's kind of a turn-off even
if it doesn't last too long the browser
has also got some changes within it
you've got a new style of tabbed
browsing in fact if you click this
button up here you'll see you've got
these different windows that I've got
open something that you can do as well
is if you click the options down below
the options are a little different than
they used to look you actually get a
list now you can open incognito tabs for
you know that those private browsing
sessions you can also save pages for
offline reading which is really cool you
just do do it like that and then all of
a sudden that stuff's available to you
if you're going down on the subway or
somewhere that you're not gonna have a
connection some other things worth
talking about the camera has seen a
slight overhaul you know obviously this
is a Nexus S so the camera is not super
amazing to begin with it can do
panoramas now you know the there's some
editing functions available as well that
are a little bit different let's see if
I can show you some of those so yeah
right away you notice here if we go into
landscape you've got some sharing
options that come up right away
depending on what you've got installed
on device the device it's really easy
and quick to share if you click on the
image one more time then you're going to
notice that you get some options for
editing here you can select this
particular device you're going to have
to still select the menu button you're
going to get some options there
including details rotate left crop if
you select this edit button this is
where things get new you've got some
really cool little features here and you
can toggle them with this little
joystick on the right so some cool
little mini editing functions for your
you know many snaps kind of Instagram
like features you can then save your
changes and it will also save an
original this cool little traffic widget
which I hadn't seen before in the way
that it works you get a little green
light you see the little green light on
there telling me that my regular route
to the places that I normally travel is
is going to be a green light and if you
back out it'll actually give you a
reading of the amount of time and
estimate there it is right there so
it'll say 35 minutes my regular route
from my current location to downtown
would take 35 minutes given the current
traffic situation so a really cool
widget there otherwise you know I mean
it's more of the same
obviously the fonts have all changed the
notification system has changed you know
you've got some things that other
launchers offered like you know launcher
Pro and stuff offered some of those
resizable functions the dialer has
obviously changed for the phone we're
gonna expect new fonts coming this this
one hasn't been completely updated
there's a lot of multimedia as far as
pictures are concerned contacts are all
you know visually based which is really
cool and you know it's just an overall
more polished experience and I think
that once the official release comes out
it'll probably get even more polished
I'm amazed and functions as well as it
does port it in this function over here
couple of issues if you're considering
doing the same thing bluetooth is not
currently functioning on this port and
neither is 3G data I'm on Wi-Fi right
now so I did this port just in order to
give you guys a preview a preliminary
review of what to expect on this device
once the official upgrade comes out and
becomes available or once the Galaxy
Nexus hits and I give you guys a review
on that alright guys hope that helped
out hope you enjoyed this content if you
did hopefully you can like and favorite
this video as you know it helps me out a
bunch and until next time and as always
thanks for watching later guys
