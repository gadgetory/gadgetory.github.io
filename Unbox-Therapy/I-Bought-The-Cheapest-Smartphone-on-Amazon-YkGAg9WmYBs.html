high-profile expensive smartphones that
are out there you know you get the
iPhone pen
you got the galaxy stuff in my pocket
right now is the pixel to excel a
significant investment to purchase any
one of those in reality not everyone has
the capability at least not immediately
go out and buy one of those in many
cases when I end up looking at
affordable phones here oftentimes the
radio is built into those international
devices might not work so well here
domestically in North America
I wanted to seek out the most
inexpensive smartphone on all of Amazon
now I had a couple of rules it couldn't
be used it couldn't be from a
third-party seller
pick up fall and that was available via
Amazon Prime it had to have LTE which
this one does here it had to be a smart
phone and presumably it would be running
Android as this one is I paid $49.99 for
this one it's the Alcatel OneTouch ideal
judging from the appearance here on the
box it's got some old-school Android on
their functional I'm sure but some
old-school Android flipping it over to
the side 4.5 inch 854 by 480 resolution
4G LTE capable as I said five megapixel
rear camera 2 megapixel front camera 1.1
gigahertz quad-core processor Android
version is 5.1 we're taking a few steps
back in time there this is the important
part the various bands which are
supported for both W CDMA and GSM 850
900 1800 1900 most people in North
America can pop any SIM card into this
thing and it's gonna work and it's 49
jump inside and see what we're working
with at this price point stop thinking
about all those pretty phones that cost
10 times more than this one we get the
device first no battery removable
battery they have so if it'll mock up on
the front so you can see what it is
going to look like a micro SD card slot
little bit of versatility also a
headphone jack
couple of features that your flagship
might not have how about that micro USB
on the bottom no need for symmetry at
all they just where do we need to put it
we'll put it off to the side nope
no quick charge I'm guessing battery is
here and it is a 1780 milliamp hour is
this even on Amazon here's the backplate
so it is AT&amp;amp;T branded what's the rating
on Amazon is like three and a half stars
yeah three and a half stars I think some
people need to adjust their expectations
at the price point that's my feeling was
being realistic it's all very
straightforward and there we go to boot
it up no one was cool tip bezel city big
bezel on there once upon a time this was
no big deal
kind of reminds me of the new pixel non
Excel I might have been below the belt
and write very large capacitive buttons
popular amongst the older generation
consider me Miles Davis no glass back no
wireless charging battery out of the box
oh my goodness this screen is so dim not
the quickest so far on the keyboard look
at the difference here also I'm trying
to connect to Wi-Fi and they're telling
me you can take up to two minutes well
wait what
I can tell them tip at the exact same
angle the $50 phone has completely
vanished please tell me we have some
more brightness to what we have lots of
brightness to work with that got better
guys same comparison I mean it's not
OLED 49 I got to keep reminding you 49 I
paid 49 for this let me defend this a
little bit we've got some bloatware my
AT&amp;amp;T Direct TV is on their drive mode
it's not quick all right time to check
out the camera little nerve this year
some shutter lag there as well the photo
is terrible I mean there's like no
dynamic range either lit or it's
completely gone
the selfie situation equally horrendous
I'm guessing there's like no skin tone
there it's just a zombie mode loo but a
couple of beard hairs there's a zoom but
there's no tap to focus by default I
mean that's just that's not a good
picture let's test the speaker could be
good could be a disaster
the latest unbox therapy this is a
Facebook ad just come use Facebook like
have you heard of it yet have you heard
of Facebook yet
guys that's full brightness 480p baby
volume this is the situation where it's
it's firing for the back and you can
cover it by accident what do you think
Jack can you see the speaker doesn't
sound terrible it's not loud he's not
the best experience you could watch
YouTube you could live sheesh um what
can I say
what was the model name the OneTouch
ideal I mean I know why this phone
exists for people who just need a
smartphone they just need to get in the
game and for those people this might be
fine I mean it does the things you need
a smartphone to do Lou where is the
sweet spot we don't want to have a $49
phone if we don't have to but maybe
we're also not in the market for seven
eight nine hundred or even 500 at the
low-end I think what you start to see
you do find a point at which major
improvements take place on Amazon in
North America it's definitely not 49
it's probably somewhere closer to a
hundred and there are some phones that
make drastic improvements on this one
I'm gonna say avoid this one maybe as a
burner phone a backup phone no hate on
this device though man to deliver
something like that for 49 Jack can
barely buy lunch for 49 she would this
guy's lunch looks like disgusting
