got a very exciting video for you I have
teamed up with the folks over at
quarterly to ship an actual package full
of cool things out to you guys the
subscribers and that might sound a
little confusing or complicated it
really isn't think of it just like
YouTube where you subscribe to get all
my latest videos at quarterly you
subscribe to get physical items from me
that I have hand-picked things that I
enjoy from the consumer electronics and
tech world as well as tech culture it
does remain a surprise until you receive
it but I can guarantee you that I will
be reaching out to my partners in the
consumer electronics space to make sure
that you get an incredible value if you
happen to be one of my quarterly
subscribers so if you want to know more
about the service just click through a
link down in the description you will
land on my profile page which will give
you some more details on how the service
works as well as what to expect to
receive from me now you probably also
notice these two boxes beside me an Xbox
one and a Playstation 4 and yes there
are consoles in each of these two boxes
so I'm going to do something special to
sweeten the deal for all of you early
subscribers to my quarterly I'm going to
send one of these consoles out to one
lucky subscriber it'll be your choice
you can decide between the PlayStation 4
and the Xbox one but it will be
exclusive for individuals who subscribe
to my brand new quarterly so I'm excited
about this the people that quarterly are
excited about this and I hope you guys
the subscribers are excited as well we
are turning you guys into the boxer and
you will get to do what I do
take some cool out of a box so that
wraps up this video thanks as always for
watching guys I appreciate all of your
support and I will catch you very
shortly on some brand new unbox therapy
