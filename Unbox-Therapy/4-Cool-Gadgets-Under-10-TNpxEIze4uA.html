starting now you guys know I love making
this show and I hope you love watching
it I'm on the hunt I'm like a private
investigator gadget version staring at
Amazon looking for the potentially
coolest gadgets that are cheap because
who doesn't love cheap in front of me
are four things that I think you'll find
useful and every single one is under $10
every single time I speak about a gadget
on this show it sells out you gobble it
up first things first we have something
called the bat max aluminum portable
power bank extends your talktime up to
12 hours
there we go 33 50 milliamp hour it's got
a carabiner clip on it so you can just
hook it to whatever you like hook it to
a backpack hook it to a keychain there
she is
it's like a lipstick container you see
that that is very small and because it's
cylindrical that's right it's not poking
you fits in your pocket don't get poked
in your pocket you got to respect the
fact that in your pocket is not going to
stab you or poke do because it's
circular very nice okay USB and micro
USB now the micro USB is to charge this
guy up and of course the USB is to
charge up your device whatever that
happens to be as you can see this tiny
little carabiner is inside the package
as well and look at that keychain
backpack you name it they included a
cable as well micro USB to USB like this
you're charging it up like that and
you're charging your cell phone who
doesn't want more juice okay next up a
logo keyring splitter compatible with
headphones and 3.5 millimeter plug
earphones now this one is near and dear
to my heart it's about music and I love
music in fact I have a second channel
here on YouTube dedicated to music
back in the day you're discovering music
you're hanging out with friends people
are introducing you to the latest and
greatest the hot new whatever it might
be and you want to listen while they're
listening it might be difficult to do
that by playing it on some loudspeakers
somewhere so that's where this little
guy comes in yo you're on an airplane
you're watching a movie on your laptop
somebody sitting next to your brother
Jack whoever it might be they want to
get in on the movie you weren't prepared
this one from a logo this headphone
splitter fits onto your keychain like a
normal little key always ready for you
to share spread the love with a loved
one there's a little cap on the bottom
to protect the main connector here this
guy goes into your headphone jack here
and of course you end up with two
headphone outputs instead of one that's
a nice little design right there the
thing that you think you might need at
some point but you might not need right
now
a logo splitter next up this little guy
right here thin charged also under $10
this tiny little thing keyring USB
connector Lightning and their magnetic
look at that anytime anyplace you can
charge look at that this would actually
be good for this guy right here come to
think of it like that into your iPhone
that's a nice combo right there and of
course your charging up pull this guy
out pull this one out
grab your keychain back up slide it
through no big deal ready to rock and
roll
you want a table in your pocket never
tangled always ready and magnets to boot
last up they're all the rage they're
called pop sockets what a name op socket
who doesn't want to pop socket reminds
me like a hot pocket
ya rabbal pocket filled with delicious
what about a pizza puck or a pizza pop
there's a lot of pockets and pops and
they put pop and socket which makes you
think about pocket well you might want
to put this pop socket in your pocket
this supposedly makes your phone much
easier to handle to manage you might
have a little dainty hand you're
dropping it you're smashing the screen
apparently this is going to solve that
problem you've seen them around
look at those donuts those are like
Simpson caliber donuts you tell me Jack
when Homer Simpson have his way with
these yes or no it's a grip it goes on
the back here it looks a little weird at
first but apparently for those that use
these things they become incredibly
addicted they can't live without them it
pops twice closes flat and it's movable
so let's try this out it has a sticky
back to it obviously you place it on the
back here we're pop socketing now Oh
twice that's a double pop pop socket now
it has to pop points
that's the pocket version of the pop
socket step one all right it's up a
little bit
step two all the way up all the way up
that's like that hit that rap song oh
I'm all the way watch this kaboom
superhero status oh you like to be in
bed lying and reading look at this
landscape portrait I'm kind of into it I
feel like I get even shadowbox with the
pop socket haha it's very comfortable oh
my goodness this might be exceeding my
expectations I might be converted I
might be carrying a doughnut sticker
around with me now what's happened to me
watch this oh my goodness it's a stand
to Sun believable look at that you can
even it's even a fidget spinner now see
you
pap√© sake if you haven't heard of it
yet there's a reason it's all the rage
for cool gadgets not three bonus round
we gave you four cool gadgets under $10

forget that thumbs up down below or else
