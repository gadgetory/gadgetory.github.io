you a contraption a little mini spinner
type deal that could take any beverage
that happens to be warm and make it cold
in like 60 seconds and not just cold
like oh that's a little bit cool no like
ice-cold so you didn't need to have it
in the fridge so someone could come over
to your house bring a case of let's say
beer if you're into it and not have to
worry about refrigerating it instead
cooling it down on demand go watch the
video you could you can tell for
yourself but it required wall power so
it wasn't super portable it's a little
bit large you know it took up some space
and for some people is a little bit
pricey today I'm about to show you
another one of those things
a portable drink chiller it's way less
expensive the link will be in the
description it's completely portable and
it can run off batteries it's called the
spin chill this is what it is it's
handheld chills drinks 20 times faster
ridiculously cold drinks it will do a
can of beer in one minute a bottle of
beer in three minutes and they'll even
do a bottle of wine maybe you got a nice
little up a nice little dry white wine
if you've ever drank beer before you
know that ice waters are down in fact
ice waters down any drink so if you
could chill this way you can have a more
chill time what's happening with the
spin and the reason the spin is
important is it because it moves the
warm liquid from the center to the to
the outskirts of the can moves the
liquid around to the outside there's a
greater surface area that warm liquid
that interacts with this cold liquid
I've got the infrared thermometer I'm
gonna be a blasting what happens if I
shoot them can they think are they blind
now did I just destroy the sensor on the
camera who knows maybe I'm gonna be
measuring the exact temperature of the
beverages prior to going in here for
their little bath a little ice bath and
then afterwards so that's it
that's the spin chill right there for
doublea's that's the action simple
spinny action bowls and Canadian of
course I mean I guess that's roughly the
temperature room temperature really just
clips onto the top check that out and
then
bathtime haha so we're gonna dunk it and
we're gonna start spinning ha ha ha look
at that little guy go
what oh yeah all right that should do it
all right
hit the button Oh 19.7 is that good
enough for any of us not for me I'm
gonna put it back in I like a nice cold
beverage and I'm not messing around when
I say ice cold I mean you could drink it
like that and it's now a cooler beverage
than room temperature but if you want
ice cold take the extra minute right
okay
let's check it out now 16.5 celsius 61
point 9 Fahrenheit okay let me crack
that and see how ice-cold that is a lot
of people said no way how can you just
crack it open what about the spinning it
does not affect the carbonation in the
can look nothing no foam mm-hmm okay 15
degrees Celsius is plenty cold actually
do me a favor ride go grab me a fridge
beer where do a comparison around
fourteen point fourteen and a half is an
ice cold fridge beer this was a fifteen
point nine I could get it down to
fourteen probably with another minute in
there I would say it also works for
bottles there's a circle in the center
which is sized up for the top of a
bottle bottle is twenty two point eight
thirteen point two does it work yeah it
does
it's not gonna be a minute it's gonna be
a couple of minutes it's gonna be way
faster than just dunking your can in
here which gonna take a long time you
know if you just show up at a party you
want to drink your specific beer your
favorite beer and that wasn't in the
cooler yet but you can kick it off
straight away you'd be the coolest guy
at the whole place with the spin chill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
