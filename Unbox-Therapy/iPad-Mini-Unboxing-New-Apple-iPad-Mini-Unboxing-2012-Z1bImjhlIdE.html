therapy and I've got Apple's latest iPad
products in front of me right here for
you to enjoy the fourth generation
full-size iPad the iPad Mini and an iPad
Mini Smart Cover in this video here is
dedicated to the iPad Mini but don't go
anywhere keep it locked hit the
subscribe button if you're not yet a
subscriber because the other two items
are going to follow this one on the
channel you don't want to miss those
videos and most importantly you don't
want to miss my mega huge comparison
video where I'm gonna pit the full-size
iPad with a 6 X processing power and
Retina display up against this little
guy right here the iPad Mini I'll be
doing pros I'll be doing cons and
hopefully I can help you figure out
which iPad is the better buy for you so
here is the mini the little brother of
the world famous iPad I'm gonna put it
to the side for a moment talk about the
other items included in the box
you've got the familiar Apple power
adapter with USB on one end power prongs
on the other very small portable perfect
for travel really next you've got a
little bit of paperwork this stuff is
really straightforward you've got an
iPad Mini Quick Start sheet but you're
probably not gonna need to read it
because operating an iPad is dead simple
most of you already know that next
you've got the Apple stickers that
everyone gets excited for let me know in
the comments what do you do with all
these Apple stickers I've got too many
of them lying around what do you do with
yours when you receive Apple stickers
next you have the brand new lightning
cable and what's convenient here is if
you've got an iPhone 5 already that's
the same cable you're gonna be using for
your iPad Mini so you can have a couple
lying around and use them
interchangeably so here's a look at the
back the slate finish of this iPad Mini
of course the iPad Mini also comes in
white with a more silver finish on the
back here's a quick look at the iPad
logo followed by the Apple logo that's
also on there you've also got a camera
on the back of the device it's a 5
megapixel or rear-facing shooters camera
on the front as well show you that in a
second
you've got 2 speakers on the bottom of
the device as well as your port for
charging the Lightning port that I
mentioned earlier as I flipped the
device around you'll notice the familiar
home button that's on every single iPad
as well as a forward-facing 720p camera
to be used for video conferencing or
really to use however you please
you have your power switch up on the top
as well as your headphone jack and
there's a microphone there too which
once again is going to be used most
likely for video conferencing Skype etc
there's your hold switch on the right
hand side followed by your volume up and
down and that pretty much covers the
entire exterior of the new iPad Mini so
I'll go ahead and boot it up here but
rather than make you guys sit through
the entire setup process I'm gonna skip
forward just a little bit and get into
the actual operating system that way I
can boost up the brightness give you an
idea of how this screen performs now
some people are sort of thinking that
this should have had a Retina display
and that's a valid argument but what you
need to remember is that the iPad twos
resolution is what you're actually
getting in here and because this is a
smaller form factor with a 7.9 inch
screen you're gonna get a much better
PPI to be honest with you this PPI here
measures 163 which is not all that bad
and like I said before in a 7 inch form
factor it's reasonable if you can deal
with it especially at this price point
being so much more affordable than the
full sized iPad so here you can see I
can fit it in one hand it's a bit of a
stretch if you want to grip it on both
sides but it is possible of course if
you had small hands that might not be
possible so I just want to remind you
guys right now this is coming up next
the big bad boy the a6x packing
full-size iPad as well as the iPad Mini
Smart Cover and Projekt RED so if you
haven't subscribed yet do it now I'm
reminding you just one more time because
I'm gonna have all the comparison videos
you need all the action you need on
these latest generation iPads I'll be
breaking it down real simple and giving
you some advice so you can make the
right purchasing decision anyway guys if
you enjoyed this content please remember
to leave a like and favorite down below
as it does help out a bunch and I'll
catch you real soon on the next videos
