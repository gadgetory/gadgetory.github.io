another video today I've got something
unusual I guess it's a case it's an
iPhone 6s case but it has something I
haven't seen before it actually adds
notifications through the form of a
light or lighting to your iPhone on the
outside of the case it's a notification
case this company loon case they've been
in touch with me a number of times they
like Lou make a video our stuff is cool
we're gonna start with this icon right
here nice simple packaging I do
appreciate that and on the inside I am
different you can see when you got a
phone call coming in a message how does
it do it it's so thin and slim and
that's the whole thing right there okay
on the inside of the case reset on-off
Bluetooth icon so obviously it's going
to use Bluetooth to connect and then
what does get power from the phone or
what insert the phone and find out do I
use like a little a little pin to turn
that on you think you think I go in
there with like a pencil tip and not a
button you know it worked really well a
sim a sim card tool yes
hey hey we got it whoa connecting simple
stuff yes I'd like to pair Oh that was
kind of cool see that guy I'm picturing
in your bedside table
if you if you're sleeping with somebody
else Jack doesn't know anything about
that one but if you are and you don't
and you're that person to wake up and
theoretically you could have your phone
completely on silent and still see a
text come in as a case it's it's pretty
straightforward you've got cutouts for
all the important things it's kind of
got a soft touch plastic type vibe to it
it's pretty good the next one this case
the cult look at that thing
you get like this that's for people with
a little bit more attitude the eyes of
the skull flash three times four calls
or two times four messages turn this guy
on oh man those eyes are flashing red
already pitch-black Oh on the skull
version you're not going to know
immediately if it's a message or a call
not a huge fan of that leg it's it's
essentially two blinks or three blinks
it's kind of hard to distinguish they
are fairly dim so I really think this
becomes more interesting in a dark
environment as I said bedside table
don't want to disturb the other person
and all of a sudden now even in silent
mode you're going to see if you're
getting a text or an incoming call
that's kind of the concept here guys
want to check out pricing and
availability on these I'll drop a link
in the description there you have it
external notifications on your iPhone
