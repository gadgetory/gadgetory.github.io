something very cool to share with you
this is an unusual product for the
channel but I thought you guys would
definitely want to check it out what
you're looking at is the emulator from
Smiths and Martin and it is a gigantic
multi-touch interface for dealing with
audio production deejaying etc or really
anything you might want to do with a
gigantic multi-touch interface right
here you're looking at my good pal
Genova 7 also one of my favorite music
producers on the planet you could check
him out through a link down in the
description and he was manipulating a
number of different pieces of very cool
software including liquid rhythm from
wave DNA I'll link that down in the
description as well there's a free trial
if you want to get into the business of
producing some music here you can see
him using Logic Pro so essentially
anything you can use on your computer
you can convert to a touch environment
so that you're not mousing around if you
don't want to be or if you're in a
performance environment where you want
to be standing on a stage in front of an
audience and they can actually see from
the back what it is that you're working
on now this interface here
has been developed by Smithson Martin
specifically for the emulator this is
their control interface for DJing as
well as you know giving you the ability
to control anything like lights or you
know really anything you can control
with MIDI in order to use their
interface you don't necessarily need to
pick up the emulator itself because it
isn't cheap the new one is around 15,000
bucks you should check it out on their
website but if you want to still step
into this control interface you can
actually install it on a computer
all-in-one type PC and then you can get
some of these features in a smaller form
factor but still start to recognize some
of the benefits of multi-touch for music
production and performance so anyways
big thanks to all the people that helped
put together this video or at least
helped get me access to this product to
play with it and take a closer look so
those are the people from wave DNA and
liquid rhythm of course my good pal
Genova 7 and of course also the people
from Smiths and Martin definitely check
them all out through the links down in
the description and
