Galaxy S nine plus here on unbox therapy
that doesn't make any sense this phone
is not out yet it hasn't even been
announced yet so what is this box right
here then well it's what I think is a
high-quality knockoff of the eventual
Galaxy S nine this was shipped to me
from China it's around a hundred bucks
and I have three colors here look it
even has this Samsung logo at the top
here do not accept if seal is broken but
like that's not even sealing anything
the font looks a little off the real box
for the s9 doesn't exist yet so that
phone just turned on in the package I
just heard a chime they claim it's an
AMOLED display I'm very skeptical of
that for $100 dual pixel 12 megapixel
cameras they copied what they think the
s9 box is gonna look like and it's
honestly it's pretty close this wouldn't
be dipped in like that
Oh in the gold the power brick looks
exactly like the Samsung power brick a
headset USB type-c whoo reasonably high
quality feels heavy enough the thinking
at this moment is that the fingerprint
scanner is gonna move to this location
here there was a lot of criticism about
the placement on the SAS 8 plus because
it was placed next to the camera and it
was the same shape this design here
seems much better it also looks like the
dual lenses are recessed a little bit
more into the body of the device could
you grab me an S 8 that's the old
location and you can see it was next to
the camera lens button layout is
identical though USB type-c headphone
jack is still there and a speaker you
can assume that they've gone in and
tried to skin it as closely as possible
this is definitely not stock Android
it's meant to look like a galaxy s 9 the
haptic feedback has a little more buzz
to it since it is $100 device there's a
little bit of lag there that's
perceivable you would not expect this to
be at the top performer all things
considered can't be
though it's obvious now this is
definitely not OLED from my angle this
display is very dim you see look at
you've got quite a bit of a bigger chin
there no one expects to see that in the
finished product how are you gonna get a
bigger bezel now never mind the camera
that's worth trying out too crazy slow
shutter that's not as bad as I expected
the camera app itself that's not what
Samsung's app looks like I can't imagine
the eventual s9 being this heavy I
should try out the fingerprint scanner
in that location there though because
that is one of the biggest developments
believe it or not this one over here got
so much criticism and I love that when
people complain about a particular
decision and then manufacturer goes back
and makes the adjustment all right so
that's the gold model you would never
pull out a brand new Samsung phone and
have these smudges on it but I got to
say the blue is kind of nice
that's the black right there it's pretty
close to the regular s8 black look at
how much of a fingerprint magnet the
real deal even is so these colors here
are informed by the history of Samsung's
color choices I think they called this
one champagne inor but it's also worth
noting that if this is the eventual
design it's kind of a more iterative one
it's not a huge adjustment to the
previous version it's not like they went
back and tried to reinvent the wheel
here of course with glass you also get
wireless charging capabilities and it
just seems to be the direction that
everyone's going in now now keep in mind
these are nothing but clones these are
this is speculation in a physical form
it would be unlikely for a manufacturer
to do that unless they were fairly
confident that this would be close to
the eventual model of course I do not
recommend going to buy these things
these things are crazy sketchy let's try
to play some YouTube here and see what
happens
to get better battery life we have to
have a bigger battery not good I want to
play the speaker on the real one might
as well it's right here way better night
and day I mean you got to give the
knockoff artist some credit though
ninety-nine bucks they put the package
together holy smokes
but I'm sticking to my guns here you're
gonna want to avoid this one and wait
for the real thing it has kind of piqued
my interest a little bit more in the
eventual s9 now I use the SA for an
extended period of time the cameras
really good of course to display all
signs are pointing to an improvement on
the previous version and that's really
what you hope to see now granted you can
always be out there wishing and hoping
that the next version of each phone is
like a completely new and shocking thing
but that's just not realistic once you
have something that's good it just makes
more sense to build on top of it but who
knows the actual s 9 or s 9 plus it
might be my favorite
we'll see can it knock off the pixel to
excel if Samsung's implementation of the
dual system is finally the kill or
implementation that everyone's always
wanted this phone could crush I hope
it's not a thousand bucks to start but
of course time will tell as I said don't
buy the clone kind of cool nonetheless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
