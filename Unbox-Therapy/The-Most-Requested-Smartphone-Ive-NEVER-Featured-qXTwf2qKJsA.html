devices from you guys - you know today
they've been hitting me up you've been
hitting me up Lou where's the love for
Xiaomi
we saw you did every other mix but what
about the og what about the originator
of this style that you claim to like so
much that is the Xiaomi mimics and this
is the new one the two 256 gigs of
storage little personalized message I
can't exactly understand it but I assume
it's something nice somebody down in the
comments can translate that for me whoa
all right we are inside the package I am
surprised to find out it is the North
American power prong that's kind of cool
Type C on one end and the classic on the
other nice weight to it a promising feel
in the hand as they like to say in the
business oh and a case there's also an
adapter cable type c2 mini jack sim card
tool we have a black one and it still
says something on it here mix designed
by xiaomi would you look at that holy
that is a fancy looking device this is
about as elegant as it gets these days
maximum clasp you can see the camera in
this location here mix designed by
Xiaomi
power switch as well as the volume
rocker above that the dual SIM card tray
right there on the bottom you've simply
got your type C port as well as your
speaker that is where your speaker will
live okay here we go
the almost bezel is smartphone and the
front-facing camera is hidden down there
as well I'm gonna do the fingerprint
though let's do this part lift it a few
times so it prompts you to pick a theme
right out of the gate I'm not sure that
I mind that I think that's a good start
so the display here is 2160 by 1080 it
goes brighter there we go that is max
brightness right there quick toggle
settings are quite a bit different than
what they would be in stock android
they've got a white backdrop here so the
reason that this back is so
I mean because that's a ceramic back
Gorilla Glass 4 on the front Android 7.1
out of the box it's got a snapdragon 835
and the primary camera has a 12
megapixel sensor with an F 2.0 lens the
battery is 34 hundred mill amp hours and
it does feature quick charge 3.0 now
like other 18 by 9 devices you end up
with black bars on each side it is a
pretty nice looking IPS and of course
IPS tech has some great off-axis viewing
angles what about the speaker though
okay for dialogue in YouTube that's
actually louder than I expected
I do want to check it with music of
course oh okay
you know what is pretty clean and it's
pretty loud got a bit of a speaker on it
let's see what we're working with here
oh wow very quick response to tapping
the shutter not a half-bad image either
now generally speaking when you have a
lower megapixel count it means greater
sensitivity at least hopefully and you
get a little bit more light in there so
that might be more useful for some
people as opposed to just having more
pixels Conor McGregor as well let's try
to frame him up real quick and check
that one out there's Jack as well tilt
shift effect a straighten effect a quick
snap mode gridlines if you like there's
even an option here to enhance low-light
photos automatically fingerprint shutter
use the fingerprint reader as your
shutter button and you didn't even make
adjustments to the contrast saturation
and sharpness and I can go in and not
just change the color temperature from
warm to standard and cool also go in and
change contrast from automatic I can
increase it or I can go to a more
standard more subdued mode in video you
can trigger time-lapse or slow motion
and then within the settings here you
see I can go all the way up to 4k also
so let's do that now so we are now
recording some 4k video on the mix too
so I move around here through the jungle
hey grab focus whoo it does and of
course I take a look at you guys horse
Jack as well the friendly Jack when you
trigger the selfie mode so you simply
flip your phone around like this it'll
frame you up just like as if the camera
was a long top that's a bit of a sell
feature I try the fingerprint I feel
like I haven't tried it yet fingerprint
oh it is the second I touch it it's I
don't know it might be the fastest this
the fastest I've ever tried holy it's
the second you touch it that is so
satisfying it's the fastest that I've
ever tried the build quality is is very
high-end the speaker better than I
expected
soft we're not close to stock I'm not
too happy about that of course you could
always alter that the fingerprint
situation is a bit out of hand
you pop the case on say good night to
finger prints this is kind of soft I
don't she don't mind this case there is
something about this particular design
here is a rectangle it's mostly screen
no weirdness going on so I hope
manufacturers continue to go forward
with this it is worth mentioning though
that this device is converted price is a
little bit expensive it's over 500 bucks
so that's something worth considering
but I have to say my initial findings
are pretty positive this type of build
in the past was something you really
only expected from Samsung and possibly
Apple and now here it is in the me mix 2
and other phones as well but it's
definitely here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
