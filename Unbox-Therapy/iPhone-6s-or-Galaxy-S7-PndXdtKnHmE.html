another video and as you can tell it's a
little bit unusual there are a lot of
phones on this table that's because I am
rebooting the massive phone giveaway
with a little bit of a twist
there was a video a little while ago I
did with a truck full of iPhones I had
the intention of giving away an insane
number of phones I didn't get a chance
to complete that not to the extent that
I would want a lot of people got new
phones but I wanted to do more problem
was I was having all kinds of trouble
with fulfillment I mean I have a back
and forth TM with some guy from Latvia
who won it ended up taking us over a
month to get him the right phone and a
winner in India where I just ended up
buying the phone off Amazon and sending
it to them directly just because I
didn't want to be bothered with sending
one of these then on top of that the
scammer is the fraudsters people who
were hitting up other individuals in
boxes on YouTube claiming that they had
won in order to extract information from
them and exploit them or get credit card
info a lot of bizarre stuff was going on
that video was just so popular that I
had to shut it down I had to put it on
pause but the intent was always to get
back to it in fact I was preparing to
get back to it as you can tell one of
the criticisms last time was hey Lou
what about the Android fans in the
audience oh you may have noticed an
abundance of galaxy s7 s we've added
these to the mix just to make it one
step better now
how are we gonna do it right this time
how are we gonna make sure that there's
an efficient and effective manner for
picking winners and sending these out to
winners in a verifiable way so what I
did was I hit up my friends over at D
brand you don't know D brand they're
making all those fancy skins for phones
you've probably seen floating around
social media if not the link is down
below they ship phone skins all over the
world they are the worldwide shipping
people so I said can you help me out
they said sure we can help out that's
our expertise and so we together created
a dedicated website for tracking winners
and all these shipments for winners are
going to go out via FedEx trackable all
I'm asking from you guys is tweet a
picture or put a picture on Facebook put
something on social media
do you receive the device so anybody
looking into it can say okay that's a
legit phone just leave a comment down
below let me know if it's Android or if
it's iPhone maybe say why to spur up a
little bit of conversation then check
that special website on D brand again
the link down below where winners will
be published on a timeline on a clock
you're not gonna be sitting around
forever they are gonna be so much better
at doing this the right way than I was
I'm a video maker all right
the original giveaway was insanely
ambitious this one is too but that's the
beauty of it that's what makes it
special and that's what makes unbox
therapy different everything I just
talked about it's gonna be down in the
description so head down there these
phones will find new homes who knows
might be your home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
