probably noticed that I'm sitting in a
different location than usual and the
reason for that is because this video
here is going to act as a celebration
what the hell are we celebrating 300
freakin videos here on unbox therapy and
ten million total upload views those two
things happened at the same time and as
a result and as a way of saying thank
you for your guy's continued viewership
I wanted to up the ante I want to up the
game a little bit here in this episode
of unbox the repiy and the best way to
do that is through products because you
guys love to look at new products and so
what I did is lined up something
slightly more invigorating than usual as
you turn your heads to the right right
over here you're about to find out what
that product is come on take a quick
look alright guys so here it is the 2012
Nissan GTR this is the Black Edition
which gives you some upgraded rims and
some upgrades on the interior I'll show
you in a quick second now if you know
anything about this car you probably
know it's a beast if you don't know
anything about this car its nicknamed
Godzilla in Japan that's because it will
do 0 to 60 in 2.9 seconds you heard me
correctly basically no time at all it's
basically faster than lightning
four-wheel drive and surprisingly
affordable when you consider the
performance that it gives you let's take
a look on the interior here so because
it is that Black Edition you're going to
get these little red accents here on the
trim so on the door handle as well as on
the seats you can see it's got racing
style seats so you don't bounce around
too much when you're driving this thing
pretty quickly let's take a seat inside
and get her booted up so as you'll
notice it's a push-button start so the
key can live in your pocket and you can
just go ahead and put your foot on the
brake press down
and then you hear that baby roar
everything comes to life so you got the
GTR emblem here on the steering wheel
controls really for everything in terms
of your electronics we've got some some
music on there but up here this info -
does all kinds of wild stuff you know
including give you real-time feedback
about the cars performance in terms of
all kinds of different aspects from
braking to steering acceleration and
then these customizable views which
allow you to pre-program a number of
different aspects of the different
things happening within the car so you
can see them at a glance in this case
here you've got the coolant temp the
engine oil temp fuel and the range etc
you guys get the idea you got some nice
carbon-fiber accents along here all your
other electronics are controlled in this
section and down below is where you sort
of toggle in the cars performance this
is where you set up all the different
modes that the car is capable of so
first and foremost if you press these
buttons down here you can get a more
economical mode so you can get a more
decent gas mileage etc on a car with a
giant engine to be honest with you I
believe it's a 550 horsepower engine so
you got lots of power here and if you
toggle these down you can get a little
bit better mileage out of it you've also
got this one on the right which allows
you to put on the launch control and the
race mode by toggle but you got to
toggle these off first yeah there you go
and then you've got the race mode on
identified by that red light there which
is also going to give you as I said
before launch control and what that
allows for is an incredible takeoff off
the line that's what gives you that
crazy figure in terms of 2.9 seconds
right out of the gate and even though
it's a super sports car etc you still
get a back seat you can see the Bose
subwoofer there you got a decent audio
system in here and you get two seats in
the back which is kind of crazy for a
car like this there's even some decent
Headroom I'm 6 feet tall and I got lots
of room to breathe up in here you've got
a CD changer for anybody who still
listens to those you can see the Bose
emblem there so you do know that this
system is a bose system
course you get the paddle shifters up in
here obviously you can toggle those on
or off that's completely up to you so
that's giving you guys a quick look at
the interior let's jump to the outside
and show you more out there
alright guys so here's a look at the
exterior of the car as I promised before
I'll get you started down here with a
close-up on this rim that's done up in
this black style it's the v-spec style
from Nissan in fact and in behind there
you can see the copper color brake
caliper as well as the big brake disc
here's a closer look at the shape of the
vehicle and as you'll notice as I come
around front here I've actually got the
hood pop that's because I want to give
you a peek at this beast of an engine
generating roughly 550 horsepower now
the reason I said roughly is because
each one of these engines is unique the
reason being they're handmade so no two
Nissan GTR s are exactly the same some
produce a little bit more horsepower
others a little bit less all of them
plenty to get your groove on so I could
talk about the looks of this thing all
day long it does look pretty but it's
only as important as it drives so let's
jump inside and do what anybody would do
who had one of these vehicles
- can I get a cheeseburger please fabric
ng huh just a sandwich no that's
everything
nobody do driver please thank you thank
you here we go guys cheeseburger for the
road but in all seriousness we got to
take this thing out on the road and get
an idea of what it can do now obviously
I don't have a track at my disposal so I
can really lay the throttle down but
trust me on this one the next time you
see this car in a video I'll be pushing
it to the extreme so let's go ahead get
it booted up let's hit the open road
I'll get you guys a taste of what to
expect when I actually get this baby out
on the track let's go for a little
little spin just a little spin
alright guys let's check out the
performance just a little bit I got a
bit of a straightaway here like him a
little bit of gas to this let's see what
it can do
oh sorry guys that's about all I can do
there I mean this thing jumps up on you
real quick it's insane really having it
out here on the regular roads is it T's
it's a major goddamn piece I can't wait
to get this thing on a proper track to
check out what it can really do you know
because this is just this is a fraction
of the capabilities it's like a caged
bird right here you know the worst thing
about driving a car like this is waiting
at stoplights drives you crazy all you
want to do is put your foot back on that
gas pedal and you can't it's crazy you
know if you're just driving in everyday
car you don't really care so much you
don't really need to unleash anything
but when you drive a car like this it
speaks to you
alright let's here here we go green
light and damn nothing growls
there you go oh okay oh sorry uh I think
I squeal
you
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
