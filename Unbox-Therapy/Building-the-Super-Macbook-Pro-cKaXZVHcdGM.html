exciting announcement to make you may
recall a couple videos ago you may
recall a video a video from long ago we
talked about the ultimate workstation PC
that we're going to be building here in
the office to replace our aging Mac
Pro's our main studio system that's
obviously a Windows machine so I wanted
to show the Mac users some love by
throwing together a crazily upgraded
MacBook Pro now you might be thinking
MacBook Pros aren't all that upgradeable
especially the retina models and you're
correct the thing is the slightly older
style design style the unibody style is
actually quite upgradable you can
replace the drives on the inside you can
also replace the memory as I've done in
the past with the upgrades I've done to
my current MacBook Pro this time we're
going to take it a step further I've got
a bunch of components here from Corsair
including two of these bad boys yes
those are almost 500 gig SSD so why
would I have to because I'm going to
replace the optical drive and get an SSD
rate of almost a terabyte inside of this
system I've also got some RAM here to
separate 16 gig kits one of them is the
Vengeance the other one is Mac specific
we're going to try each one of these and
figure out which gets better performance
and which one works better so that you
guys know for your own purposes but the
main thing here is to put together
possibly the fastest MacBook Pro the
fastest MacBook Pro ever configured so
I'll be going to the Apple Store picking
up the top spec unibody model MacBook
Pro which is the slightly older design
for those of you that are unfamiliar
with it I've been saying for a while
that that is my favorite design for a
couple of reasons because of course it
has a little bit of user configuration
available to you so this is going to be
part of a series we're going to put
together a couple of different videos to
go along the process from the MacBook
Pro unboxing to the actual surgery video
in which I show you how to install this
kind of hardware on the inside of this
particular model macbook pro and then
the last video I'll be showing you how
it all works and what kind of
performance improvements you can see so
we're going to call it the super MacBook
Pro project and I hope you guys enjoy
leave a thumbs up
down below if you're excited I'm
actually going to go and buy this
MacBook Pro right now so expect updates
shortly this this project will probably
beat the other one only because we're
waiting on a couple of specific
components and buy the other one I mean
the ultimate workstation nonetheless
both projects are going to be happening
simultaneously so stick around stay
tuned to the channel to catch it all
thanks as always for watching and I'll
catch you guys on the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
