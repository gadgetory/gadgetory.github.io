make a lot of videos about headphones
are very popular part of your style
sound is important too but the thing is
how do you differentiate yourself
everybody's got some beats on or they
got Apple earpods are you're trying to
take you to some different place if you
want to stand out you're not gonna see
these every day that cause glow and they
are the world's first laser headphones
whatever that means the cords actually
are like they're bright they glow at
night if you're a jogger a biker late at
night now you got the protection of
being more visible so what do we got
here all right back in the box see the
rhythm the laser light in the glow
headphones pulsates to the beat of the
music that's cool
the brightest headphones around glow is
the world's first product to use
vibrance a special light diffusing fiber
from Corning the same folks who make
Gorilla Glass Jack and I use a corning
cable optical cable to share a
Thunderbolt Drive so there you go
Corning or in the family apparently give
me a call Corning they do come in
different colors I believe these ones
are blue and also they are not cheap
anything like this that's a world's
first is almost always gonna be somewhat
expensive so ooh
be bold be seen so you get this cool
case I guess that's a place to keep them
even after the fact I would think so
you're not gonna throw that out microUSB
cable would like the half style USB on
the other end earbud style pieces and
then there's also the ear hook style if
you're a guy like jack with the the
giant like with a very like the large
sized ears probably none of these will
work for you there's an app to go with
it Android and iOS okay cool
padded travel case and then a little bag
inside as well ooh okay you can see on
the inside here they're clear and then
there's these exposed obviously
fiber-optic wires and those are going to
be the things that glow so fiber optics
not just good for data transmission and
fast internet connections but also for
being flamboyant on the street
now the cable stops at this controller
here and then this terminates into a
braided 3.5 millimeter cable this
section here has a clip on it a switch
here for turning the unit on oh I saw
some blow okay okay okay okay I'm
getting pumped up now that's a pretty
nice fit it's an ear canal style so
that's pretty decent isolation so I'm
gonna play some music hold up oh my
goodness
you want dim some lights can I just say
like side note not just flashy but they
sound good I'm glad they didn't half
steppin these sound way better than a
stock earbud yeah remotes functioning
volume up volume down functioning
perfectly there are different glow modes
here it can glow to the music it can
pulsate just cuz it can be constantly on
and then off completely you can also set
the vibrance of it from low medium high
glow notifications that's cool
they call themselves glow their
headphones that glow how can you hate on
that you add a little glow to your
headphones and next thing you know
you're making a left where you used to
make a right talking to a strange woman
you're otherwise would have passed by</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
