another video and today we are checking
out something called the N cam which is
an attachment for your iPhone in this
case the iPhone 6 but it's also
available for the 6 plus and what it
allows you to do is have an
interchangeable lens system along with
external sound so that you can turn your
iPhone into a more professional camera
or at least that's what it promises as
you flip the flap open here flip the
flap you heard it here first learn how
to flip the flap as you flip the flap it
doesn't even feel right flipping the
flap Oh opening up this flap on the box
flap is just a bad word just flap
opening up the top flap on this box
you'll see how those lens adapters will
change the capabilities of your iPhone a
wide angle comparison iPhone on its own
with the wide angle lens and then the
macro lens comparison which will bring
you in tight much closer to an object
even closer than the regular iPhone
camera is capable of focusing and it
also comes with a silicone case to
protect your phone when you insert it
into the adapter let's go ahead jump
inside the box so there we go got this
little bag here what looks like a cap or
cover a little cleaning cloth and the
external microphone this is pretty cool
so if you use your phone as your main
camera for video you know that the audio
that comes out of it is not fantastic so
this will be interesting to test the
external microphone whoa this thing is
heavy
it's completely made out of aluminum the
entire body here feels like a real
camera a little bit of information here
in the QuickStart guide how to insert
your iphone how to mount this thing on a
tripod and over here we have some
accessories including a 35 millimeter
SLR adapter whoa a mini cart tiny little
dolly action card flash bracket
filemaker pro pack ok this is if you
want to get really serious
your phone so on the front you can see
that the unit is dominated by the lens
portion which is covered by this cap
that is a huge lens so this is the
wide-angle converter lens 0.45 X and I
assume you unscrew it here yeah and then
the macro lens lives below that so it
screws into the wide-angle converter but
if you want the macro close-ups you just
remove the wide portion and leave the
macro installed now the main component
here for installing your phone is this
silicon case here's an iPhone 6 right
here you see here there you go ok so
it's just a friction fit but it's pretty
solid when it's in there and it still
gives you the exposure you need to
access your different buttons on the
bottom of this unit you have three
different mounting points for your
standard quarter thread and then on the
top here you've got another one followed
by a cold shoe adapter so you can see
how the lens pokes through there and
then I'm going to go ahead and install
the macro lens first and open up the
camera app and just see what the effect
of that is whoa so yeah so immediately
you're able to focus super close you can
see my entire fingerprint in fact whoa
okay now I'm going to switch to the
wide-angle real quick and of course
that's totally different now we're
getting a super wide Wow that's cool now
you guys know I'm a big fan of
wide-angle lenses in fact I'm speaking
into a super wide right now I should
just show you real quick how the
microphone works plugs in here at the
bottom then you point it in the
direction you're shooting right so
you're shooting like this but you're the
one talking you can have it pointing at
your mouth but if you want audio from
the people that you are shooting you can
bend it out the other way so overall a
fairly robust package for people who
want to take their phone a photo game
to the next level and don't want to
spend a ton of money but I think for
some people this might just be the
perfect solution for a slight
improvement on their iPhone photo and
video game alright guys that wraps this
up thanks for watching give me a thumbs
up down below if you appreciated this
content otherwise I will catch you very
shortly on the next episode later guys
is this pretty cool huh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
