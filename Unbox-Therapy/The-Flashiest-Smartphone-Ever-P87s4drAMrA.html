the weird gadgets it's a product called
lumi duo mobile lighting studio so you
can be them you can be them don't you
want to be them would you look at that
in love enhances the portrait lighting
feature on your phone
hashtag lit by Lumi hashtag lit by lumi
this is part of fancy types this
actually might be kind of cool to be
honest with you see what the deal is and
see what the selfies are about but that
that's the case it's a bit fatter than
your average case look at that you know
it's real photography when you have the
wrist strap
I'll see you this area on the front has
to be translucent that's what the light
is going to shine through the back panel
this part which is black here is
available in a few different colors you
maintain access to the bottom to the
speaker and the microphone tap it once
you get the light on the front that's
kind of cool-looking look at that it's a
nice little glow to it am I pretty yet
to Jack hmm
click it again you're onto the backside
surprising little LED function there I
can just imagine I'm in there with a
screwdriver like I sweet there we go you
press down hold and you'll see it'll
slowly dim down to the lowest level the
case itself is not super cheap 60 bucks
according to will do I should bring in
you know a model someone who has been
sought after for nothing but their looks
alone no obviously I wasn't talking
about you regular guy with a regular
smile light is on oh cool see this is
what we end up with carry three wait
wait okay oh I think you took a
literally so my eyes are closed so
here's the thing
you want to achieve something like this
now we won't be able I mean is there's
only so much that the case can do for
you if you hope to get to this level
most of this is natural this is an
active just just let me just do one more
stop it man that's not even cool that's
not funny that's good
turn the lights off yeah turtlemom like
pitch-black there that's why hold on see
1 2 3 ok 1 2 3 4 5 now there's obviously
a shadow because we're in pitch black
okay one last one teamwork in one that's
not my nose looks crooked man alright I
can't hand this over to it I'm thinking
I'm pretty lucky yeah whatever have my
life Wow things are not in place all
jumbles like it's
it's not right hmm that's better that's
the best time yeah I'm okay with that
I'm cultural one my own skin oh yeah
this is obviously much better with the
light look at this picture that's a high
quality yeah that's good there's the
difference there that's the flash and
that's the delight case I don't know I
think it's kind of cool you're mad about
it but I think oh I'm not mad I just was
mad I was just saying he takes it a
certain person that's gonna for me
doesn't have a lot of value I'm I'll be
on I don't take pictures don't take a
lot of pictures I didn't see why what
what no I think girls would appreciate
something like that more than then guys
maybe not do you have any studies to
support this yeah that's all I got to
save with that are we done here I don't
know I don't I just I just I don't know
I don't know I don't know I'll be back
that maybe that wasn't the best one for
me I'm just the guy that you take the
pictures of right you next time
Wow man
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
