brought to you by Squarespace
what's up guys Lew here and I'm at the
Nvidia booth here at CES 2014 checking
out three awesome 4k displays that are
being powered by Nvidia graphics we're
gonna find out a little bit more about
what's going on over here
yeah this is for case around and like
you said it is three 4k displays these
are Panasonic displays right they are
running at 60 Hertz which is wives looks
so smooth we're actually running up to
60 frames a second dad looks awesome
these panels are powered by GTX Titan
there's four of them in this system 4
Titans are water-cooled in sli mode it's
all connected through DisplayPort to the
three panels Wow the resolution is 11
520 by 2160 the enormous amount of
things enormous amount of paper a 10.5
million a second Wow
yeah in the game is project cars awesome
lightly match Studios so I guess you
probably couldn't do this with with the
console a gaming console we could do
this with three Titans but that fourth
Titan gives us that extra berth ryuk it
really smooth like you see it that's
what it takes right it drive for me now
there's not too many 4k displays that
can do 60 Hertz am i right that's right
yeah the desktop displays do see 60
Hertz right this the TV's most of the
TVs are only in 30 Hertz right yeah no
sonic just relieves
this 4k 60 Hertz display right I believe
it retails for about 5,000 Wow so this
is a pretty serious setup what is this
setup worth right over here we figure
this setup is asking figures about
$12,000 Wow Wow
all right so I guess the next thing to
do is for me to check it out yeah hey
