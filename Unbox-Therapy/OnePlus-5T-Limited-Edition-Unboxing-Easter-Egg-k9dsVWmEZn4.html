recently I was in India it was an
incredible experience I met so many of
you guys yes
the unbox therapy viewers sunglass
shopping in India somebody told me that
this place is 150 yeah they told me that
- honey is my first experience at Indian
McDonald's Maharaja Mac the
international family in general had a
great experience now one of the reasons
I was out there was to help launch this
particular device in the Star Wars
limited edition 1 + 5 t now many of you
know I've been using that device for a
while it's right over here but of course
it's just the standard 5 T this device
here has in many ways been inspired by
the film home on I was told that the
white on the back here inspired by one
of the final scenes in the film is a
visit this planet with a really sandy
kind of ground what was the name of the
planet we'll look up the name of the
planet where the final battle scene is
the Star Wars nerds are so angry right
now they are mad crew it Kermit crate
the planet is called crate there's
texture on here all right a little more
grippy the Red Star Wars logo you'll see
the silent do not disturb switch
metallic red color with the texture of
course the volume rocker as well as the
power switch and the SIM tray are in
black a familiar look on the front the
standard 5 T a darker black reflective 1
+ logo a silver metallic on the standard
5 T you can kind of see the antenna on
the top and bottom on the limited
edition you do not see the antenna bands
at all kylo Ren inspired case inspired
by his helmet in fact Star Wars the last
Jedi this is if you are very serious
about your Star Wars fandom the - charge
brick must be tight see some stickers -
not just one + stickers but Star Wars
the last Jedi as
this is where things get kind of
interesting because inside the box here
there's a bit of an easter egg now when
I was at the event they apparently said
they spent all this time on this
particular piece of paper and I was like
well what's the big deal
there's a tiny little poem on the back
strive to rule the galaxy care to choose
your side and so on now apparently
there's more here than initially meets
the eye if you look at the first letter
of each sentence and read it downwards
scribble with pencil am I supposed to
scribble this with pencil Oh found it
some down here there's some words being
uncovered here whoa find the secret
compartment and check the weather
forecast on h2 and we have really dudes
attention now big time okay there's a
secret compartment in the box I guess is
it in the box oh it's here this is the
bottom of the box
what is yes Jack you remember this kind
of a thing I know what this is you know
what this is Jack we're gonna come back
to this in a moment there's a bunch of
custom wallpapers kylo Ren option black
and red
those soldier dudes the trooper helmet
that's the death trooper right don't you
remember this one has the beef with Finn
okay never mind
you kind of have to have that to go with
it since it is a special edition all the
quick toggles are red now red and black
including when you go to settings here
check that out
standard 5 T here so that's the
difference there so if you want to see
some camera testing and some other
functions of the 5 P you can go watch my
original 5 T unboxing video time for us
to look at this Easter Egg folds out
like this goes on to here comes down and
kind of locks it in that and then what
you think this piece goes on top
I think that's ready to go like that the
card told me check the weather forecast
so I'm gonna check the weather here
hatched oh ok here we go
yes put the holographic device on the
screen keep the prism at eye level whoa
may the force be with you how about that
for an easter egg everybody else step
your game up I got the prism I got the
hologram with the Star Wars vibe I mean
you saw the Leia hologram you remember
the classic scene this is deep you got
the oneplus logo that's a true
collaboration I mean don't just slap the
logo on you've got to embed the culture
into it and that's what they did there
so there you have it the 1 plus 5t
limited-edition Star Wars a very
compelling and unusual unboxing
experience with the easter egg and the
pencil since I picked this thing up
while I was in India what a time I had I
did shoot some video I'm gonna pile it
all together show you guys the
experience stick around and be ready for
that it really was an amazing trip
today's episode of unbox the area's been
brought to you by white stone dome glass
a screen protector that you can finally
install easily with no air bubbles none
of those dust particles you know the
issues if you've ever installed a screen
protector before it's not that much fun
now they've gotten a lot better they're
made at a glass and you have these
phones with curved displays that's a bit
of an issue with a lot of screen
protectors not with the dome glass full
cover with no lifting they make it for
the iPhone 10 the iPhone 7 8 plus the S
8 plus and no 8 they make them for all
kinds of devices so you could check that
out through the link in the description
but what really makes these special to
me you can install this dome glass by
using the installation jig that is in
the box that's right I said jig you
didn't come you're expecting me to say
that but I did kind of this little
contraption where you place the phone in
and it kind of does the work for you to
a certain degree then afterwards you use
this UV LED lamp to kind of solidify as
a whole process okay so there you have
it finished installation super clear
glass screen protector not a single air
bubble in sight you spend all this money
on a device throw a protector it's
terrible but not if you pick up one of
these the iPhone 10 is the one that I
installed they make it from
anymore I'll link them down in the
description thanks to them for
sponsoring this episode and if you're
worried about your glass get yourself
the dome glass protect yourself with the
dome if you know what I'm saying</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
