What's up guys Lew here, back with another video
And today, I've got something hot for you
Something you've probably seen nowhere else
In front of me today is a 24 karat, gold plated,
Nintendo remake. NES system
From a company called Analogue
That sounds crazy on its own,
But how about the fact, that it also retails for about 5000 bucks
This is for the person that has everything
This is for the person that has a pet tiger
Talking to you.
Now. I did do a video on the original Analogue.
This is the system over here
as you can see, this is the aluminium version of it
It's kind of like a modernized version of a classic Nintendo
Using those components,
to create a system
that can output to a flat-panel display
Old school games, New school life
24 karat gold, for all you maniacs
Let's see what this thing's all about.
Wohohoho!
First things first
There are white gloves in here!
Oh my goodness, this is why i got in to this business
Holy smokes, I feel like a surgeon right now
Say goodnight to this fingerprints
I feel like super Mario
Or maybe better yet, Luigi
'You know that's Lewis in Italian right?'
Oh! This is legit gold plated
Ohh! Comes with a gold Legend of Zelda cartridge!
Am i yelling?
Maybe the most classic cartridge, ever to be released
The Legend of Zelda, made in Japan
Ohhh my!
What a special day in Unbox Therapy history
Jack, get that in all it's glory
Oh my goodness. This might be the fanciest thing i've ever handled
I'm not sure what to say!
It's a bad mofo right there
It's like it belongs in a museum
If I show you the back here
You're gonna see all the I/O
So you've got a power switch in this location right here
You've got an HDMI port, that's the big one
NES, to HDMI, in one unit
They've also got some analog outputs as well,
couple of switches, and a power port
Now I just noticed something
On the bottom of this guy.
Ohh
You can see the actual circuit board here
Some of the ribbon cables
Jack, you need to check that out
My understanding here is that they're using all original components
Reworked into this layout.
It's a piece of art, that's the bottom line
Nobody tells you how much a Mona Lisa should cost!
At least you can play this, what are you gonna do with a Mona Lisa?
You're just gonna scare people
Off course, four ports for you controllers on the front
And everything just glistens, oh my goodness
Look at this bad boy.
So first up in the accessory departement
Is an HDMI cable. It's actually kind of cool, it's like a flat-style cable
Standard powerbrick, not huge.
That's good, plugs in to the back, you know the drill
What a love about it
is the way it kind of displays you game there, out in front.
Of course you can watch the original video
wich I will link down in the description
I Think I play some double dragon, I played some blades of steel, God knows what i do.
Moments like this is what Unbox Therapy was made for.
Incredibly special things that exist on this planet
And you get to see them here in all there glory.
And I get to wear white gloves.
