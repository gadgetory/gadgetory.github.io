therapy just got back from the midnight
launch of Skyrim this is the collector's
edition and as you can probably tell
it's taking up almost my entire unbox
therapy table here this is by far the
largest collector's edition of any game
that I've ever unboxed here on a channel
if you want to check out some of my
other game unboxings definitely visit
the channel to do so but this box here
is big and it's big for a reason that's
because there is a gigantic statue of a
dragon inside that's definitely the
showstopper of this particular
collector's edition so you definitely
want to stick around to the end of the
video to get a close-up look of that
baby the first two items that greeted us
here we're the art book of full-sized
art book the game and of course this box
within a box that's where that
showstopper statue is going to live
let's go ahead and slice into this baby
so we can get a better look at it now
from what I understand this thing is
bigger than any of the other collectors
edition figures that I've recently
unboxed as it should be considering the
size of this box but I'll be amazed to
see how it stacks up especially against
the Gears of War three statue because
that one was huge in and of itself so
there's a little bit of paperwork here
telling you how to set it up but you
really don't need that and you've even
got the Skyrim logo embossed right on
the styrofoam here in case you didn't
know and here it is that's the the
dragon portion and there's actually a
stand portion that was the reason for
the assembly picture you just gotta
place the dragon up upon the stand and
well the one thing I noticed was that
the dragon itself is significantly
heavier and more substantial than the
stand but I suppose that's to be
expected the details on this thing are
unbelievable I mean that there's a lot
of attention to detail here this is by
far the most elaborate statue that I've
ever unboxed as part of a game a
collector's edition of any game for that
matter from the paint job to the design
I mean it's it's pretty impressive so if
you're going to pick one of these up I'm
sure you'll be impressed if you're into
that kind of thing here's how it perches
up on that stand and you can place that
basically wherever you keep your
memorabilia if it's in your games room
or if it's in your bedroom I don't know
where you keep this stuff that's really
up to you so
let's go ahead and get a closer look at
the item as I mentioned before the
paintwork is crazy the details are crazy
he's got sharp teeth actually the whole
thing is pretty sharp you wouldn't want
to hand this to your small children no
now the base also has some details on it
some fake-looking
engravings as well as some
three-dimensional aspects the next item
in the unboxing is the art book now this
art book actually looks more like a
strategy guide based on size but it is
an art book you've got a nice
three-dimensional logo on the front it's
got a leather like finish to it and as
you guys know most collector's editions
include art books that are about half
the size of this one half the size in
height and width but a lot less thick as
well so you're definitely going to get a
nice appreciation for the amount of
artwork that went into the game and as
you guys know I like these books because
they help you to appreciate that the
amount of work I mean is absolutely
crazy the amount of imagination that
goes into these games and the books help
you to perceive some of that imagination
from where it started so the last item
in the box is kind of an important item
it's the game of course and once again
you've got that three-dimensional logo
on the front which actually is
protruding a bit so they've got that
nice cohesive feel between the different
items within this collector's edition
and it's looking like it's got two disks
inside because it is a little bit fatter
than your regular games case it's no
steelbook though I do like those
steelbook cases and so the first thing
you're going to notice is that it is two
discs you've got the game disc on the
bottom of course and above that you've
got your bonus disc which is going to
include the making of the game so once
again something to add some appreciation
to just how much work goes into the
production of these games that we enjoy
so much so there's a little bit more
paperwork in here some paperwork for the
upcoming preto we've also got the user
manual which is actually a fairly
legitimate user manual actually got a
fair number of pages in there if you do
like to read those things and the last
little surprise is this map here we've
got the I believe it's the province of
Skyrim is that what they call it at the
bottom yeah I believe it's called that
and it's made out of this cool kind of
papyrus like feeling paper although I'm
sure it's plastic but
cool nonetheless definitely quite
impressive so I decided to put up the
dragon statue against some of the other
ones I've recently unboxed from
collector's editions and as I mentioned
really the only clothes comparable one
is the Gears of War three statue from a
size comparison this thing is big so
