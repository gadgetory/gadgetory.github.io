important update regarding the Xbox one
some of you have probably already heard
but I felt compelled to make this video
because I have content that I made in
the past just a few days ago talking
about this specific subject matter and
so it's important for me to update you
now and let you know about the changes
that are going on I've got a document in
front of me from the official Xbox blog
this is news Xbox com I will link it
down in the description if you want to
follow along or read it for yourself but
there have been some changes to
Microsoft's official policy regarding
the Xbox one so guess what they heard
the community they heard your voices in
the comments section give yourself a
thumbs up down below because this is
huge not often does the community get
hurt and in this particular case listen
we've been heard so first and foremost
I'm going to read from the blog and then
I'm going to have a few questions for
you guys so just pay attention right now
this is the official terminology that
Microsoft has used on this page an
internet connection will not be required
to play offline Xbox one games what a
surprise I mean this is some really
quick backtracking going on here after a
one time system set up with a new Xbox
one you can play any disk based game
without ever connecting online again
there is no 24 hour connection
requirement and you can take your Xbox
one anywhere you want and play your
games just like you could on the Xbox
360 so for people with janky internet
connections people in the military
anybody who is concerned about this
always-on 24 checking situation in
Scenario you don't need to worry about
it anymore it is gone that's point
number one point number two is much
larger and more important I'm going to
read it word for word trade-in lend
resell gift and rent disk-based games
just like you do today there will be no
limitations to using and sharing games
it will work just as it does today on
the Xbox 360 so once again a major
backtrack from Microsoft on this
particular point obviously the things
that happened at e3 and the noise the
community is making has changed their
stance on this major major thing which
gamers take for granted or have taken
for granted
up until this particular point console
gamers especially there will be no
restrictions
you can hand a game to your friend and
your friend can go ahead and install
that game or not install it put it in
there in their tray play the game and
you know it'll work just as it would for
the original user this is this is a
really big deal means you're going to
own your disks there it's not like a
licensing agreement where you just have
the right to play it no in this case
that disk is just as valuable to you you
know a month later or to the next
individual to the next user there's
going to be used games now game rentals
will be untouched so this is a really
really big deal and as I said earlier
it's really a win for the community
because it you know we've been making
noise we've been talking about our
criticisms regarding their system I mean
not just us specifically but the entire
greater large community and Microsoft
listened they went back and they changed
some things so I'm going to give them a
thumbs up for that I mean that's that's
good but the major question remains is
this too little too late and this is my
question for you guys are you interested
in Xbox one now will you change your
mind in this console war that's about to
go on or is already going on are you
still on Team ps4 or have you moved over
to team Xbox one at this point now I'm
going to tell you I still have one major
criticism regarding the Xbox one I mean
it's not as major probably as a couple
of these but it really matters to me and
it's the fact that you must buy the
Kinect sensor with the console and I've
talked about this in previous videos I
think the better solution and you know
thumbs up if you agree with me I think
the better solution is to have a modular
system where you can buy the console on
its own and then at a later date get the
Kinect sensor if you want it rather than
being forced to buy it and forced to pay
for it I think if Microsoft really wants
to compete in this hyper-competitive
space that them not having that lower
price point that the ps4 has is really
really going to hurt them and meanwhile
they're trying to bundle this thing in
that you know truly a lot of people
don't want now I'm not speaking to
everyone obviously some people do but
that's why the modular setup is so much
better it means that you can pay for it
if you want it and you don't end up
paying for it if you don't want it so
that's the only other major thing that
I'm really focusing on now I don't know
if that's going to change
I mean I'm obviously making noise about
I don't know how many people are also
making noise about that particular
element on this particular console you
can trust that I'm going to of course
feature both consoles once they come out
on the channel because that's what I do
have feature brand-new products but once
again just to close out this video the
question now goes out to you because of
these changes the ones that have
occurred officially you can check them
out once again at the link in the
description because of these changes are
you now in the Xbox one camp or you
still on the ps4 side or were you always
on the Xbox one camp and now you're just
a little bit happier let me know in the
comments section down below otherwise
thanks as always for watching guys I
just had to make this update because
I've done so much on this particular
topic and it's important for me to let
you know exactly what's happening in
order to replace some of the information
on those previous videos because guess
what that information is changed now I'm
surprised you know I read this yesterday
I was like I have to make a video I was
busy all all night last night but I have
to make a video so I'm doing it today
thanks as always for watching guys and
I'll catch you maybe on the next update
who knows what's going to happen at this
point but I'll definitely catch on the
next video thanks again later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
