everyone's over this no you're just oh
your dude who's bashing Apple and love
Apple I have so many Apple products all
right I don't I don't live my life to
bash Apple I love Apple products I use
Mac books jack has a macbook kirk has a
macbook Willey dudes looking at a
macbook right now we got them Apple is
taking so many dollars from me why don't
you hear me how this is the new MacBook
Air I was excited about this in fact I
made a video where I said that this
might be the best laptop for most people
I have a problem with the keyboard on
this that's driving me bananas
this was my everyday laptop who's
sitting at my house I was getting things
done and all of a sudden the keyboard
started to misbehave in such a fashion
that could just drive you nuts I went on
Twitter and I was like anyone else
experiencing issues with the butterfly
key switches on the new MacBook products
pop aah pop aah pop the replies came in
this is a thing it's it's like fairly
widespread like people have had issues
with these butterfly key switches on the
MacBook Pros before this and it was
supposed to be fixed
they put a membrane in here which was
supposed to protect this keyboard from
similar issues that had plagued the
previous versions now you might be
sitting there and saying okay that's a
new laptop we watched the unboxing video
Lou like you can just go to Apple and
have them fix it but there's a lot of
people out there who buys one of these
things and then a year after you've had
it you start to experience something
like this okay what is my issue that's
driving me nuts it's the kind of issue
where you're just getting work done and
then you go back and you look at the
email you just craft it and you're like
that's not what I typed check this out
hopefully Jack can see this we can look
at this real-time my issue is with the e
key something weird happens where I'm
getting extra ease or spaces when I'm
using ease let me show you what I mean
look at this this is insane
you have no idea when or where it's
going to present itself it's something
to do with the iki and sometimes you'll
just get two key presses instead of one
and sometimes look at that sometimes
it'll like miss a key press let single
press to e sometimes three and this can
pop up in sentences unexpectedly there
that's what it does more often than not
that's what it does you get the extra e
then you hit the space then it delivers
another Aeon the beginning of the next
word there that's what it does that's
that's what it does unexpectedly you get
this weird situation where after an e
you hit the space it delivers another e
there boom same thing if you're writing
a paragraph or something this inevitably
pops up at some point and because it
creates another word the autocorrect
doesn't really work properly because it
doesn't know what gu is like in this
case obviously this applies to all kinds
of various circumstances and it's some
correlation between the e key and the
spacebar fee but the point is it's
triggering an unnecessary e at some
point later on see see
Oh see that the e thing this is the
worst case scenario look at that
boom you're skeptical of everything that
you type especially in this case where
it delivers another e after the space
that drives you particularly nuts
because there's no autocorrect that can
deal with that particular issue so
certain strings of character certain
sentences end up worse than others
nonetheless you will be going nuts when
this is happening to you there's really
a headache it's surprisingly frustrating
it's the weirdest kind of problem like
in a way you just wish it was some
dedicated problem that was always there
so you just be like okay I'm not gonna
even try to use that but I stare over at
this laptop in its location I'm like oh
I'm gonna go search something and then
it's like right look I'm gonna take it
in I'm gonna get it fixed I'm sure Apple
will fix it up but after calling this
thing possibly the best laptop for most
people I just felt like I couldn't leave
it there having experienced this issue
myself this may pop up for you a year
from now and you might not have any
warranty coverage and you might have to
go out of your way to buy another system
and you might not have the money for
that so it's hard to continue to call
this thing the best laptop for most
people at least in my personal
circumstance I'm sure there are units
out there that are working completely
fine this is not one of them if you're
in the market to buy one of these things
it's something worth knowing now if you
are somebody who's been affected by this
you should definitely leave a comment
down in the description hopefully yours
is not affected but there you have it
here's the thing there's the thing
that's the problem
too many E's that's the thing
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
