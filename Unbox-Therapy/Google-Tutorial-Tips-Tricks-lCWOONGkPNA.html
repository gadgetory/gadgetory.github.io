therapy and the purpose for this video
is to give you guys an idea of some of
the tips and tricks that can help you
become a better user in Google Plus
Google Plus being Google's new social
network now a lot of people by this
point have tried other social networks
and have probably gotten used to how
things work and function within them
Google+ being new is a little bit
different but not too complicated and
after you've watched this video you're
probably going to feel a lot better
about using it on a daily basis so
without further ado let's get straight
into it the first and maybe most
important tip that I wrote down here is
how to mention people now this is
important because that's what you're
constantly doing is interacting with
others hence the title social network so
the way to do this in Google+ is
different from Twitter you know in
Twitter you use an @ symbol on Google+
you're going to use a plus symbol what a
surprise how cute so you start with a
plus symbol and then begin to type the
users name that you want to mention or
reply to in a comment section for
example and if they're in your circle
they probably come up even before you're
finished typing their name at that point
you type your message and they receive a
notification from there that you have
mentioned them or reply to them super
simple easy to do I'm happy that you
know now that people can start doing it
properly because to this point people
have been all over the place at least in
my network the next thing I want to
mention is the ability to edit posts
this is unique to Google+ other networks
did not have the ability to do this up
until this point and this is important
because you might type a long post and
then not want to go back you know delete
it and rewrite it if there's an error
this way you can go in fix the error and
then leave the post up or in my case
delete it because maybe it's a dumb post
to begin with so you can do anything
like that from this little drop-down
menu and I personally think it's an
awesome feature I really wish the other
networks had it as well the next thing I
want to talk about is private messages
now a lot of people have asked how do I
private message they're used to the way
it's done on Facebook or Twitter and
this one is
a little bit more complicated I think
Google needs to fix this but at the
moment it's the only way that it can be
done some are calling it a hack but I
mean it's not too hard to do I wouldn't
I wouldn't go so far as to call it a
hack so what you want to do is you want
to share a post the way you normally
would identify the individual that you
want to send the message to or mention
in the post but you don't want to share
it publicly and you don't want to share
it with your other circles so make sure
that they're just selected from there
you want to share the post and then
after the post is shared if you select
the drop down menu from there then you
can select to not make it shareable from
that point so that will sort of close
off the post it'll leave it there dead
the only person who can access it is the
one that you originally mentioned so
that's a way of keeping a message
private until Google does something
other than this system for private
messages the next thing that I want to
talk about is how to turn off circle
sharing this is something that I did
after a bunch of people started having
my family members and whatnot to their
circles so you can do that very easily
by clicking over here underneath the
your image your profile image and you
can turn off either the sharing of the
circles that you're in or the people
that have you in circles or the only
other way around whatever the hell I'm
saying this whole circle system it's a
little bit mind-boggling not really but
anyways yeah you can make certain
aspects of circle sharing private from
that window there the next thing I want
to mention is how to get a more
attractive URL for your Google+ profile
at the moment it is a long string of
numbers and numeric profiles are cool
they're just not cool anymore so what
you want to do is go to a website called
G+ tio of course you could go to any URL
shortening website but this one's a
little bit cooler and cleaner and
specific to Google+ so you want to go to
G+ tio and from there you want to put in
your string of numbers that currently
identifies you along with your desired
nickname and then from there that will
give you a public location that's a
little bit cleaner when you are sharing
that profile elsewhere in emails or on
places like YouTube etc
because as we know those big huge URLs
are not very attractive and nobody wants
to click them nobody wants to click an
unattractive URL so I think I've got one
more thing to mention yes that is the
ability to format posts you can do
things like put words in bold or italic
and this is kind of cool just to maybe
have your posts stand out over other
things or other posts that are in
people's newsfeeds you know and this is
very simple to do I'll give you an
example using the word bold here all
you've got to do is put stars on each
side of the word bold and boom it's
gonna come out bold so that's cool a
very basic feature I don't know how many
people are going to take advantage of it
but good to know nonetheless anyway guys
I hope these tips and tricks help you in
your transition from those other social
networks and if you haven't jumped on
Google+ yet then I'm gonna put an invite
link down in the description of this
video so hopefully you come over there
if you have any trouble with that link
or if the link runs out of invites then
hit me inside my inbox here on YouTube
or email me or whatever you want to do
and I'll try my best to get you over
there I'm excited about this social
network it's gonna be a big player and I
think everybody should get a head start
on just how to use it so once it goes
public and everyone comes over you're
ready to go anyway guys until next time
