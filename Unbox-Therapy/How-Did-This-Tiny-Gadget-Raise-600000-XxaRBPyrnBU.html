product from the wild world of Willy
dude he's the guy he's out there on the
Internet
he's a surfer a professional in fact
he's looking for the next big wave this
is probably not it maybe it's it I don't
know
I'm optimistic today this is another
product that he saw online that you
thought might be interesting it's called
knobs control your volume
excuse me wet I control your wet analog
personal volume control whose volume
what volume what are we talking about
audio music no but the real world audio
control for your life ah I know
confusing in fact I said to Jack we're
gonna do a video on audio control for
life and he was like it's confusing
that's why we need to address it they're
out there on the internet saying that
they've solved everything you know how
it goes with these startups it's all
these they found the best thing ever
this is some kind of thing you stick it
in your ears like her she's cool it's
usually what I knobs is the world's
first volume button for your ears our
acoustic hearing solution offers you
total control over the sounds that
surround you filter out respectively 10
DB 20 DB and 30 what no lag no radiation
no gimmicks radiation sheesh it's an ear
plug obviously there's no radiation my
hat has no radiation did you didn't know
that though
holy well you got to talk to about the
market okay talk to them about the
market and get back to these people now
I travel a lot I do wear ear plugs bit
of an aficionado I feel like they could
be used more in certain environment can
be really helpful for focus and things
like this that is what it looks like
that's crazy that's cool on its own and
then this turns and it locks in at
different points I suppose for each
different settings so you get a couple
of knobs they are labeled left and right
and they have this kind of stage adapter
which I'm a fan of holy smokes but they
didn't end it there
foam tips this is that I believe it's
called comply foam some people you're
the only Union have the same size ears
you can actually have one size for one
year another for the other
that's it here's how you position it and
then you start to control the volume
sort of feels like you bought a pair of
earbuds when in reality they're just
super high in earplugs how much are
these we'll know we'll just told me
these are hundred dollars and that's
rude let me try them on uh oh okay I
mean I certainly I hear everything let
me make an adjustment here okay okay
maybe this is the wrong tip for me I'm
gonna go with the comply phone here I
think I got a big canal boys okay now
we're talking I don't know if these type
of tips make very much sense now I have
the comply foam tips on there I'm not
hearing a lot of bass in my own voice
air conditioner sound is not as loud as
with them completely off right now well
maybe you should get in here this is
your thing you got to stand by it if
you're gonna put your mouth where your
money is then you better put your money
where your mouth is that's well you this
is your doing does it work though is
this a game to you will are you here
it's all fun and games to you will yeah
you come in here you're playing games
now yeah do I look like I play hey do
you feel like you're in a suction yeah I
sorta decide you know there's a fishbowl
effect happening now I'm going to go to
the final setting Oh Jeremy your voice
is is much more muffle now this is the
equivalent I think of the full effect of
if you just took this a full effect of
the isolation right now right right
does it mess around with your inner ear
like does it make you queasy or anything
like that
hello this again this is ridiculous this
maybe people are working in these open
office environments but I think most
people are gonna have headphones on this
is gonna be listening to something yeah
I mean especially at $100 I could be
like that's a product that should exist
if it was like maximum 25 and like skip
the cool box and marketing money on the
lingo and you make it seem as though
you're buying something that's like more
than it is if it's gonna cost $100 to
make something like this and you're
gonna put that up against something
that's $2.00 that's that the ratio is
too much you can't have this product
it's just so imperative that the price
reflects the functionality absolutely I
totally agree I mean a hundred bucks is
like a good pair of earbuds that play
music mm-hmm it's cool that people are
out there trying to solve problems
ultimately I answer to them maybe you
can bring these to a concert and then
adjust your volume like that instead of
just wearing full-on earplugs I've seen
those on Amazon before that are cheap
yeah I just feel like the promise is
better than the delivery I gotta give
you something all right you tuned in you
trust me you put me here you're gonna be
mad at me if I told you to get that no
hard feelings here
well cut at all no need for the whole
emotional tirade maybe after they see
this video they'll offer up a discount
code I don't nops if you're listening
I'm not saying it's a bad product I'm
saying it's a bad price and I do this
for my people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
