that he threw it in front of me he's a
crazy guy I know it's not a laptop it
can't be a laptop it's too small it's
too tiny
Otis quiet time Otis the question is is
this thing actually cool called the
Gemini 4G this thing it runs Android or
Linux probably a bit of a novelty factor
going on oh look at that
hello a keyboard actually looks kind of
enticing right now ooh
that's tiny need a new laptop Jack there
you go
type-c USB cable okay cool interesting
Gemini by Planet computers here we go Oh
what this has me thinking about a Sony
product I believe it was called the vile
P and when I was a kid I thought it was
the coolest thing the hinge is
interesting watch it you know what you
know what I kind of like it
I mean it's tiny don't get me wrong I'll
probably crazy type in on this thing
every day this is like the power switch
over here USB type-c connector in this
location that looks like a microphone
I'm guessing this is a speaker grill
which would be kind of a cool design I
see one of these grills on each side
another type-c connector over here and a
headphone jack it's the same number of
inputs as the MacBook Air
in this package that is a pocket
computer right there
alright so I have this thing booted up
they had me fooled on the power button
the on/off is over here in the Escape
key I thought for sure this was the
power button apparently that's the smart
button this has a micro SD and micro SIM
card slot this is the startup screen
courses is touchscreen as well so you
just reach up and all right we're in
look at that Jack there it is it's a
little Android laptop something called
app bar I think you just you can remove
the apps that show up when you drag up
from here I'm assuming that's how that
works they have a Notes app which I
guess is kind of tuned for keyboard
input now otherwise it's look
pretty standard Android to me let me
connect to the Wi-Fi real quick unbox
therapy I've typed on worse things
before I do have to say who's
advertising against unbox every Apple is
how does that make you feel Jack are you
happy about that
are you upset so that's cool everything
is available via function keys function
for volume function for brightness
function for emojis speakers all the way
up now let's see what that's about
let's see if the function pause work to
function pause the bezels are there
there you know you have for the forehead
the chin it's weird it's a bit
off-center as well it's not symmetrical
anyhow I think the most surprising thing
about this for me is how usable the
keyboard is I'm kind of amazed they were
able to cram something dysfunctional
into a package like this over the fence
look that's perfect
I nailed that i hammered that out and I
had no business doing so it vibrates
which with each key press a slight
vibration and an audible top talk boom
like there's something cool about that
there is a camera on here front-facing
actually sort of decent okay not the
best I've ever seen
does it do the trick maybe yes so sort
of what are you really gonna use this
for though this is not for Instagram
photos oh yeah let's see what the smart
button does here we go it's a Google
assistant which shows up in portrait
mode but it made a really cool sound
effect whoa whoa discovery mode that is
insane look at that you hit this little
button that's to let the planet button a
whole dock comes up
oh my hello hey nudie laddie
it's your it's your aunty how can you go
on
well give me your laptop so you tell me
who's cooler in this situation you could
be this guy or you could be this guy
it's the same size is the trackpad on
the macbook pro so there's some
different processors available for this
mediatek cortex a7 t2 there's a couple
of quad-core options also four gigs of
RAM 64 gigs of storage inside of it I
did mention that is expandable there's a
micro SD card slot on here as well it's
around 650 bucks
and does that feel pricey I don't know
maybe probably it's not gonna replace
your laptop as far as I'm concerned and
it's probably not gonna replace your
smartphone so it puts it in a really
weird zone I think it's totally worth
looking at I think will do did well on
this one
well done Willie do you continue to show
people things they never knew existed
including this right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
