therapy and today we're taking a look at
the HTC One x+ this currently represents
the top of the range in the HTC lineup
at least in the Android camp and that's
because it packs some pretty serious
specs including 4G LTE it's got a Tegra
3 processor at 1.7 gigahertz and that's
a quad core processor 64 gigabytes of
storage one gig of ram and a 4.7 inch
Super LCD to sporting 720p in terms of
resolution it's also got a nice camera
at 8 megapixels with an f2 lens which is
fairly wide at 28 millimeters that's a
lot of information to swallow right
there let's jump into the unboxing and
get a closer look at the device also
we've got to go through of course the
other items included in the box so put
the device to the side for a moment and
then we'll look at it in great detail as
the video moves forward so also included
you've got a couple of stickers not
really sure what these are for there's
also some paperwork from HTC as usual
and you've got a small little device for
inserting and extracting your SIM card
here's what the power brick looks like
actually not much of a brick at all here
it's pretty comfortable to hold and
fairly portable as well and here's your
USB cable standard micro USB to USB for
charging from the wall or from your
laptop or anywhere else you can plug in
a USB this just goes over the specs one
more time as you guys can see this
device is beats branded so you're
supposedly going to get a little bit
better audio performance out of it maybe
a slightly improved headphone amplifier
maybe a slightly better speaker on the
back of the device one of the most
striking things to me here is how
unusual the surface on the back is
instead of going with a glossy finish as
we see in most devices
HTC has chosen to go with a more
rubberized rugged kind of finish here
it's still soft and smooth but it looks
like it's going to be more durable and
resist fingerprints a little bit better
as you can see the camera dominates the
top portion of the phone there's also an
LED flash there and if you look at the
front then you're gonna see basically
all screen or at least mostly screen
this is your 4.7 inch 720p display as I
said earlier the forward-facing camera
is on the front of the device in the top
corner that's also where your speaker is
for making phone calls of course and on
the bottom you'll find three capacitive
touch buttons with dedicated back lights
on the side is where you'll see your
connection port for charging the device
that's your microUSB and on the other
side is where your volume rocker is the
top is home to the power button as well
as your headphone jack and the bottom is
of course where your microphone is so
people can hear you when you're speaking
as I said earlier the capacitive buttons
are backlit and dedicated so let's go
ahead and power on the device and as you
guys know anytime you power up a new
device there's gonna be a setup process
so rather than make you guys sit through
that boring stuff I'll do that
off-camera and then we'll jump back to
the actual home screen you know actually
being booted into the device so you guys
can get a sense for how snappy it is so
here's a look at HTC's Sense UI which I
know a lot of you guys are already
familiar with so you've seen this all
before it's fairly snappy after all
you've got quite a bit of hardware here
to push out those animations as you flip
between screens etc and the screen is
actually really nice - really bright
this isn't full brightness you're
looking at right now it would have been
incredibly overexposed if it was full
brightness so getting a nice screen as
well now I'm gonna go ahead and use the
web browser here to boot up YouTube take
a look at how it performs this is on
Wi-Fi of course I actually don't have a
SIM card in the device right now so I'm
gonna go actually to youtube.com slash
beast feed and if you don't know what
that is that's actually my second
channel here on YouTube and it was
neglected for a little while but I'm
back into it now I just made two videos
in the last week so if you guys haven't
checked those out if you haven't
subscribed to my second channel please
go do that now I'll put a link down in
the description you probably will enjoy
it if you enjoyed this show if you enjoy
unbox therapy you might just enjoy my
second channel the beast feed and if
you're looking at the screen of the
phone right here you can see that this
thumbnail right here is fairly enticing
on its own that's the thumbnail from one
of my most recent videos so go check
that stuff out let me know what you
think I appreciate you guys going over
there
so show me some support and subscribing
to my second channel as well so let's
talk more about this phone let's take a
closer look at how it compares to the
Nexus 4 and to the Galaxy Note 2 at
least in size terms you can see that
it's about the same size as the Nexus 4
but I think it's a little bit thinner
definitely a little bit more comfortable
to hold the curves are all in the right
location it is packing that 8 megapixel
camera with a nice f/2 lens so you know
it's gonna perform fairly well when it
comes to photography and video
performance as well it'll do HD video
and it has a forward facing camera as I
mentioned earlier this is gonna be
perfect for your video conferencing
Skype etcetera so I'll go ahead and flip
around the camera real quick so you can
get an understanding of how that
operates there you can see my camera and
my shooting setup that's because we're
activating the forward-facing camera
here so pretty straightforward stuff
this is just an unboxing afterall so you
get a basic idea of how the device works
and how the device looks and at this
point you know the most striking thing
for me is probably the build quality of
the construction and how it fits in your
hand for a large device it feels
incredibly comfortable and yes I'm still
calling 4.7 inches large even even in
the current scope of things I'm gonna be
going to CES on Saturday and I've heard
a number of huge devices that are going
to get launched so who knows if we're
gonna call 4.7 large in the future but
as of right now that is still on the
larger side side of things as far as
devices are concerned anyway guys I hope
you enjoyed this unboxing if you did
please remember to leave a like and
favorite as it does help out a bunch and
as I said earlier in this video please
go and check out my second channel the
beast feed the link is in the
description I really appreciate you guys
support on that project as well alright
thanks as always okay catch you on the
next one later</div></body></html>
