video right there's drawing involved
it's the second generation but I never
had a chance to even check out the first
it is the Microsoft Surface studio it
kind of just looks like an all-in-one
system from this perspective but you
spin it around and you realize what is
special about it it's all about being
artist I Spit on them being artistic
using the pen and of course touch input
that's associated with it has this crazy
base that allows you to set it up in
this number of different angles
including this wonderful drawing angle
right here it's a 7th gen Core i7
processor one terabyte of SSD storage of
course you can configure if you want to
32 gigs of ram and this one has a gtx
1070 with 8 gigabytes of vram so you can
actually do some gaming on this
futuristic it's cool you can imagine it
in certain environments Oh 4500 by 3000
is the resolution and how big is it 28
inches okay so that's a legit desktop
replacement scenario look at that this
just wants to say hi would you look at
that there is stopping at every angle
all the way down we have the pen wham I
love it can you put on the other side
you can all right ambidextrous left
right it's a slender keyboard scenario
ladies and gentlemen it's a little bit
Matt it's a little bit flat
1 2 3 4 USB ports a wired Ethernet jack
the power port a type-c connector an SD
card slot and a headphone or audio
output through three point five
millimeters booting up what are all
these front-facing cameras well ah hello
face authentication camera
the other is a 5 megapixel camera couple
of microphones as well by the looks of
it we're gonna oh it's picking up Jack
over there got you there we're gonna try
the face unlock so here we go get man
got me cool
the real magic it happens here in just
how smoothly you can adjust the working
angle I'm envisioning you know creative
professionals who generate a ton of
pen-based arts the whole thing feels
super high quality to be honest like it
is solid and weighted let's see here
it's an interesting way to work
something I'm noticing right away is
that even though it's touch from the pen
it's doing a good job of rejecting my
hand as well I can really rest my hand
on there just getting around the OS it's
very fast I just realized that this has
a dedicated eraser and it's clickable
and it actually works to like
launch other things you see that wow
that's cool and what if you just turn it
around it becomes eraser becomes an
eraser anyhow Willie do we're gonna
bring him in he's gonna evaluate this
he's gonna look at the ABCs and the one
two threes and he's gonna pull no
punches so if you're a sensitive viewer
now's the time to leave all right I'm
gonna try to attempt to draw Ryan from
memory
in here
yeah just got the eyes it's always got
the nice smile here that's something
he's still a growing boy yeah there you
go there it's not bad I dig it
it works that's kind of cool yeah are
you cartooning right now a little bit
you are it's pretty fun we get a little
time to yourself
yah yah yah yah the screen is huge which
I like because you watched us be it's
kind of fun yeah to Bitcoin is this the
full brightness no whoa that makes a
huge difference
holy that is very bright now it's a
different experience I think cuz it's at
a desk he feels like kind of like work
architects engineers that want to draft
some drawings and you know what's nice
about this you do you know you're
working mm-hmm you're doing what you're
doing and then it's just a quick oh here
you want to check this out yeah that's
true it's now we're talking about it
yeah now there's a presentation there
now they're spreadsheets
there's PowerPoint the only issue is
price yeah so it starts around 3500
bucks the spec we have here would be
even a little bit more with the bigger
SSD mm-hmm I mean if you're a
professional
that's a chump change so your desk is
normally like this you know you're
working away and then you just you pull
it in close every so often yeah get
intimate I just read you can even have
it come off the table a bit and you're
just kind of you know and never did I
feel that the hinge was too loose oh
it's all the times like that one oh yeah
solid even at the top edge yeah but the
question is does it fulfill the rest of
it like would you put it on your desk
would you try to play a game yeah I
don't see why not
boy 28 inch screen you would you would
play a game would you watch some Netflix
on here you would you would yes what
would you watch on Netflix there's a new
one that's actually pretty good I
recommend it
evolution of us yeah sure but it's it's
pretty good sure bud
one thing we should mention you were in
here in the drawing up and I saw you
doing a lot of this action a lot of
pictures there is an accessory the
little turtle yeah which sticks to the
display and depending on the app you're
in it can it can modify certain
characteristics it can mod it can bring
up certain tools you can add that
accessory as well mm-hmm let's turn up
the volume let's check out the speakers
a type-c cable a Type C audio adapter
maybe you could expect something louder
because the thing is so big but one
thing I will say is very clear I mean
it's gonna get the job done you do still
have a headphone jack on here and audio
output if you want to go to other
speakers or to a set of headphones yep
you know you got to give it to Microsoft
sort of even for a person who might not
think they want to use the pen input
that much they may get into these things
and still have a computer at the same
time and then all of a sudden next thing
you know they're Willy do the surface
studio you can have your very own studio
and you can draw pictures of Ryan on the
beam or you could do something a lot
better yeah no offense none taken</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
