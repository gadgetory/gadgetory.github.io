wanting to test and own for a long
period of time but I just never pulled
the trigger on actually ordering one of
these it's called the Nereus Ares pro
and what it is is a wireless hdmi
transmitter and receiver so what this
means is you could take any source any
video source and send that video signal
to a display off in the distance as you
can see on the front of the box I mean
they are even showing a drone here
whatever video signal you want to send
even from a production perspective like
the various angles that we shoot for the
show you could send to a display for
monitoring but this one caught my
attention above and beyond the other
stuff that's on the market because they
claim watch on HD TV with no latency at
1080p now you know why no latency is
important because a lot of people are
going to want to use something like this
for gaming you can imagine you've got a
console or something far away from a
display or just the way you have your
stuff wired up for cable management
now finally wireless hdmi supposedly far
as this company's concerned is capable
of getting there without a wire so I got
a few tips from people on Twitter saying
Lou you got to try this out I'm going to
test this out today with a Nintendo
switch and a display that's about how
many feet away is that over there Jack
that's like 40 feet 30 feet as they say
in the box this is the pro version which
has a hundred feet apparently of clear
wireless transmission so Nintendo switch
in the dock I will send the signal all
the way over there and we'll see if it
actually works or will see if they have
overstepped over overstep or
does the Nereus Ares pro suck so since
the transmitter receiver power adapter
five foot HDMI cable and so on what do
they show here so obviously this will
work with any video source you can see
they've got a laptop hooked up play
high-definition video games from your
desktop PC laptop ps4 Xbox one or while
anything really zero latency they sing
zero let's crack this open
gonna need a knife I just peeled the
tape anyway look at that unbox therapy
and none of the professional unboxing
equipment you would expect I just peeled
the tape off all right don't try that at
home
plug it into the wall plug it into the
display plug the transmitter into an
HDMI port that's it
look at this slick little guy so this
looks like the receiver I believe this
will sit near the location of your TV
it's got an HDMI output on it you can
also wall mount it some LED indicators
as well to let you know if you're linked
up this model comes with a super-slim
transmitter so this guy here as you can
see goes into any HDMI port it has also
a mini USB on it this entire package
would be very easy to travel with in the
past I've wanted to like watch a UFC
fight on a projector but maybe I don't
have the source that I want going to
wherever the projector is mounted now
boom you just as long as this guy is
down on ground level whatever you want
to stream from click that baby in could
be an Apple TV could be you know the
deal in HDMI cable this is to go from
the receiver to the display a nice right
angle adapter a mini USB cable which is
going to power up the transmitter so
let's get this thing hooked up and see
what it does
alright so I have the Nintendo switch in
the dock and I've got the HDMI going out
to the transmitter now something to
mention because of the way the dock is
set up I had to use a little HDMI
adapter just to extend it a little bit
it's now going into the transmitter
there was a blinking light on the front
of the transmitter which is now solid
it's solidly lit up which i think means
that it has linked itself to the
receiver on the TV all the way over
there so Jack's gonna swing right now
and as we mentioned before this TV is
somewhere between 30 and 40 feet away
from where I'm sitting right now so I
got the pro controller the docked
Nintendo switch I'm gonna power it up
right now
Oh Zelda oh my I don't think there's any
latency I'm not sensing any I think they
weren't lying man let's go for a little
Glide real quick here Oh baby
totally playable honestly I don't notice
any kind of an input delay beyond
playing the game normally and I've been
playing this game a lot recently this is
a really cool madness when you see this
happen it's a very magical moment am I
gonna have enough stamina to get to the
top probably not maybe I've been mostly
upgrading stamina made it barely here we
go that's legit they weren't lying I
mean they said zero latency there's zero
latency the question of the video
wireless hdmi does it suck no not
anymore keep in mind it's 1080p so
you're getting full res like I said you
want to go to a different display just
grab this thing and move that there's a
bad guy right there yeah how you like
that well you can use his own arm to
beat them up haha
check these guys out it's the real deal
man it's the real deal it's magical
what magic is this right Tom there he is
there he is</div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
