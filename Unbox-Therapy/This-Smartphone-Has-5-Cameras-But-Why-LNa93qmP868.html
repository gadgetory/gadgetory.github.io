guys no I look at a lot of smartphones
and I'm always on the lookout for some
type of differentiation from what we're
used to seeing the v40 thinkyou from LG
it has five cameras this is the kind of
thing that seems like a concept like you
would see some image floating around
Twitter but now it's it's a real product
and it comes in price wise just a little
bit under some of the others it's still
gonna be expensive depending on the
market that you're in close to a
thousand bucks but not quite a thousand
bucks
we of course have snapdragon inside and
you can see this DTS logo as well
something else that's exciting about
this particular device is the fact that
they kept the headphone jack and they're
very proud of the DAC that they're using
on that headphone jack for higher
quality audio than what you could
achieve through wireless headphones a
microfiber cloth is gonna greet us first
we have a six point four inch OLED
display qhd+ it also has a dedicated
Google assistant key in the place where
other manufacturers have put their own
assistance that is a very light smart
phone granted I think part of the reason
is because the battery in here is not
huge it's not like Galaxy Note huge I
believe it's around 3300 milliamp hours
let me put this down for a second also
in the package some paperwork fast
charge power brick that's a must we also
have a type C cable to keep it charged
up and because of that headphone jack we
actually have some pretty high-end
earbuds here in ear design as you can
see interchangeable ear tips to get a
better fit also this color is black but
depending on the angle you have it on it
kind of goes a bit blue so what you have
back here is a wide angle a standard
lens and then an optically zoomed lens
each with its own aperture they've also
got the fingerprint scanner right here
where I like it where your finger lands
naturally it also has wireless charging
bottom of the device you'll see USB
type-c connector this is the
aforementioned
headphone jack that so many people are
excited about power switch is over here
on this side and then the dedicated
assistant button is right below your
volume buttons
real quick before we turn it on let's
get a look at the not set up standard
selfie camera as well as a wide-angle
selfie camera
I should mention on the SIM card tray
here dual slot so you do have expandable
storage on there as well it takes a nano
SIM and a microSD now this is kind of
interesting they're giving you the
opportunity to turn off the knotch right
within the setup in fact it's the very
first screen that you see the other
interesting thing they're not calling it
a notch they're saying second screen
that's my preference right there and
then notch city alright it's up to you
maybe for the purpose of this video I'll
leave the notch on I don't know no I
want to go that's my taste alright
that's my flavor this doesn't bother me
that much Apple you know I've been using
the iPhone 10s Macs for a while now I
wish they gave you this option we'll go
ahead and set up the fingerprint scanner
it's definitely not the fastest I've
seen Wow there are a ton of settings in
here so I have boosted up the brightness
on the OLED now now their settings
layout is a little bit different of
course this is running a skin as well
which may or may not be to your taste
these are the display settings and
there's a ton so second screen here
that's what standard looks like and then
within custom you can actually change
the color of the notched out portion if
you want to go rainbow you can even
change the shape of it for the app
corners look at that screen resolution
that's also up to you by default it's at
23 40 by 1080 you can toggle in your
color temperature based on the RGB
levels you can fine-tune there's also
tons of presets I love the level of
configuration they give you here though
because then it's up to you screen looks
pretty good first glance definitely OLED
based on viewing angles that I'm seeing
here alright let's check out the audio
here I'll turn this video up wait that's
for dialogue we're getting most of our
sound out of the bottom grille and maybe
a little bit out of the earpiece regions
I don't know the sound it seems to look
a bit dull let me see here if I go to my
equalizer and try to boost the high-end
up and see what happens
potato you can that's way better taste
it sounds better than the iPhone when I
would the customs
it's for somebody who has you can fix it
now of course the speaker is not even
really what LG is happy about on this
device it's all about that headphone
jack so let me try out the included
headphones now that I have these plugged
in it's gonna light up all kinds of
extra options as you can see here okay
so we're gonna turn on DTS and we're
gonna turn on high v quad DAC so this is
mostly for music so let me go ahead and
load up some music real quick you
probably already know this but there's
no substitute currently for a wire when
it comes to audio like this is still if
if audio quality is a major focus of
yours you've kind of got to be looking
at this phone alright now I realize at
this point I have not covered I have not
told you about the most important
features in this phone and they live in
the camera Department of course okay so
by default I booted into the camera app
here that's your default focal range
right there and as you can see over on
the side here you have many more options
the top you have a zoom represented by
this icon showing a zoom and on the
bottom is the wide okay now this will
give you a real quick representation of
the differences as you can see there it
is a ton of focal range that you're
gonna cover and it's optical right this
is not digital at all there's also an AI
cam this is the AI photo version of the
wide you can see it break it up a bit
actually
alright now switching over to the selfie
camera it's a similar situation you have
two lenses on the front oh wait a second
there was a beauty by default how dare
you I thought I told you no it's okay at
least I can turn it off look their
settings for it so this is the contrast
that I'm generally looking for it just
looks more like me like me here you know
what I'm saying I'm gonna try the AI
selfie see what they're doing if they're
doing anything fancy there is actually
pretty nice it doesn't mean definitely
doesn't look like I'm wearing makeup
this is the group selfie button but of
course this could also be used to
capture something that's behind you like
if you travel a lot and you're like look
where I am I meant to Taj Mahal there's
your wide one and that's not so wide
it's not as much of a jump as I would
like to have seen it's definitely more
in a frame it's wider but still not
crazy wide the two cameras actually look
quite a bit different too from
perspective a contrast perspective it's
interesting I actually prefer the look
of the white one now something that I do
think is cool to have directly in the
camera app is google lens and so they've
done that here and that allows you to
just you know hold up an object like
something in front tap on it Molson
Canadian nails it
it's a beautiful look I get the alcohol
percentage and so on
now speaking of Google they also have
this dedicated assisting key you just
hit the button done all right but a
dedicated key is kind of nice the only
criticism I have about that key why not
make it configurable there's so many
other configuration options like with
the audio and the display and so on but
as of right now it appears that it's
just Google assistant now obviously this
is a very unique device because of that
camera setup the headphone jack
sticking around and being a priority it
has piqued my interest personally maybe
even to the point of testing it out over
an extended period of time as my main
device if that's something you would
like to see you can let me know by
leaving a thumbs up down below I'm just
curious how I would use all these
cameras and the types of photos that I
would create and if I would actually end
up utilizing this headphone jack after
all like would I plug in for a little
extra quality of course there's some
things I'm a little worried about with
this device including the battery I mean
it's definitely not the largest in the
flagship department especially compared
to something like the new note and then
also the skin it's definitely not stock
Android otherwise the specs here look
good the phone is super slim and light
but anyhow there it is the LG v40 thin
queue right now it's promising it has my
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
