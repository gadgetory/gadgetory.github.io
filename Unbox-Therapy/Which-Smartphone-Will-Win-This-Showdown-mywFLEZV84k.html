on the new razor phone the razor phone -
which features two front-facing stereo
speakers now if you've been following
the channel for a little while
you may remember some test that I did
with the previous version of razor phone
because at that point when that phone
came out it had some speaker performance
that for me was unprecedented in the
smartphone space now one of the things I
frequently test in my smartphone videos
is speaker quality and speaker volume in
the razor phone - video I kind of had
the sense that the speaker was improved
the speakers were improved from the
previous version initial impressions
here a lot of sound coming out of there
but I hadn't tested them yet not
extensively last time around with the
razor phone one I came up with a
scientific test using this right here a
decibel meter check mate SPL meter and
this will tell you how loud a signal is
I used a signal generator a frequency
generator in order to figure out how
last year's flagship smartphones
performed and stacked up against one
another so I thought now would be a good
time now that we have our hands on the
latest razor phone which should be might
be possibly is the new speaker champ we
should do the tests again to see where
these smartphones stack up so in front
of me I have of course beat razor phone
- I've also got the iPhone 10's max and
then on the far side I have another
impressive speaker performer at least it
seemed that way in the unboxing video
this is the pixel 3 XL it also has two
forward-firing speakers now in the last
test I found the iPhone the iPhone 10 to
be very surprising as well from a
performance perspective but then when I
tested out the 10s max I saw an
improvement at least my impressions were
that it was also improved so he should
see bigger numbers from all of them but
the main question is which one is the
biggest which is the loudest performing
smartphone speaker of these
three I will place each smartphone in
this location here I'll then initiate
the frequency generator and we will
watch the meter to see how it reacts to
the signal coming out of the smartphone
now the reason for this exact setup is
to replicate what it would be like to
sit in front of these smartphones so if
you're wondering it you'll maybe right
now you're like look Lou on iphone not
all the speakers are firing forward it's
true they're not but your face is always
going to be forward right like this is
where you would be enjoying your content
so this is the important measurement
from this location right here and the
iPhone does have some sound coming from
the earpiece region and that is firing
forward as well we'll start with the
iPhone now another thing to note these
are going to be running frequency from
20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz this is the
human audio spectrum and I have all the
different videos coming out of the
YouTube app and playing back in the same
quality because yes the quality settings
on YouTube
do also affect the audio quality there's
a few different settings on this SPL
meter you can pick between 40 70 60 90
and so on but if I recall last year I
think most of them were in the 80 to 110
DB range so I'm gonna use that setting
for this test so let's go ahead hit the
play button and watch the meter
okay so the test has been run you have
seen the numbers and surprisingly all of
these devices are closer than I expected
them to be in the maximum SPL output now
of the group the raiser is the only
device with the built-in dolby effects
so you can go in and select equalizers
and also bass boost and and other
aspects for the test we actually had it
in dynamic mode with the bass enhancer
turned on now something I noticed too
you know to my own ears outside the
realm of the meter is that with the bass
enhance on specifically there was a bit
of a sort of a garbling effect at
maximum volumes so in a way I feel like
maybe the Razr device needs a bit more
tuning or maybe they're attempting to
push it too far in terms of volume at
the expense possibly of some quality now
it's important to note that these
devices were outputting volume at the
lower frequency range it just wasn't
enough to trigger the sensitivity of the
SPL meter so what I notice with my own
ears is that the lower frequencies the
Razr device was the only one that was
discernible especially at the ones that
are barely audible to the human ear at
the beginning of the frequency generator
so I could pick up some volume coming
out of it which leads me to believe that
this device is probably outputting the
most sound at the low end but the funny
thing is that when I line them up here
with some music like a regular user
might and I hold them in front of my
face the most pleasing is not
necessarily the loudest and that's where
we get into the land of my own judgement
I actually like the razor phone the
least it's a bit bizarre
to me there's a bit of crunchiness there
at certain aspects with certain
instruments in a song almost like it's
clipping granted this is a brand new
device maybe some of this can be tuned
via software but still a little bit
upsetting considering that I was
expecting this to just blow these other
ones out of the water especially when
you're sacrificing so much screen real
estate for these giant speaker grilles I
mean it might be a software thing it
might be an optimization thing but for
me these two are actually better these
two are actually better sounding than
the razor phone - that's weird that's
not what I expected to say granted on
overall total maximum output that the
SPL meter could pick up yes the razor
phone - was capable of outputting the
most sound so I think it might have the
potential but as it stands right now in
front of me it's the least pleasing
audio that I'm hearing yes it's
forward-facing yes it's stacked up
against some pretty good performers here
they're all way better than some other
options on the market and it seems that
smartphone makers are taking speaker
performance into serious consideration
when it comes to these other two on the
right hand side it's a bit of a toss-up
everybody in the studio here was
listening and was like I don't know man
and I kind of liked the pixel I kind of
liked the iPhone I would probably give
it to the pixel just because both
speakers are forward firing as opposed
to the iPhone but then the iPhone
because it does have the down firing
speaker on a table it kind of resonates
more it almost amplifies off the table
to make it seem like it has more low-end
than it might so if you're the type of
person that likes to just leave a phone
on the table have a little have a couple
drinks have a party or something that
might actually be the better choice so
is it really tough to say they're all
crazy speakers amazing speakers for
smart phones I had really high
expectations for the Razr speakers and I
don't really think they're there yet
good on both Google and Apple for taking
speaker performance seriously and
delivering these type of products as
they both sound pretty amazing they
might be the
sounding smartphones that are out there
right now I think the razor has a chance
I don't know what they can do via
software but I hope they do something
cuz right now they're really missing out
and I don't think it's strictly a
hardware thing we'll see what happens
right now it's not the most pleasing
sound coming out of there even though it
happens to be loud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
