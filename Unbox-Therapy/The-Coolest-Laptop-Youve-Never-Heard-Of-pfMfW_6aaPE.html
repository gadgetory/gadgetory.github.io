like that just it's like ytp more butter
sus sus a brand new company a brand new
concept company's called Eve look at the
oh that's a poster this will look good
in Jax dining room so the computer is
called the V and what's special about
this is was crowdfunded it was made by a
team of eight people working with
Scandinavian industrial designers
Chinese manufacturers American designers
and the rest of the project team there's
6,000 members in the Eve community and
somehow with all those Minds I don't
know why they say the 6,000 members but
only a thousand minds it's not a
one-to-one ratio mind to member mmm mmm
mmm members first crowd developed
computer 1,000 minds voluntarily came
together to the eve community and
decided each spec one by one look at
that resolution 2880 by 1920 48 watt
hour battery 0% bloatware they're trying
to stick it to the man what are we gonna
do we're gonna stick it to them arm up
against the surface Pro 1599 core i7 16
gigs of ram they think they got a
compelling product here you can pause
here if you want to know absolutely
everything about it
in this little box they've included all
of the international adapters so that's
kind of cool Jack can update the
wallpaper in his dining room
BAM developed by 1000 minds with the
cult-like symbol please oh they listed
all that that's cool they listed all the
names of the contributors this is the
device whoa
brushed aluminum finish on the back very
important docking connector we have a
headphone jack couple of type-c
connectors traditional USB and over on
the other side another USB port a lot of
connectivity for something so slender
and it looks like the speakers fire out
of the top one and two ooh
Jack you never saw that's that type of
suede before you'd love to wear a jacket
made out of that Oh
Type C power brick C 2 C cable quite
long and then also the pen much like the
surface pen but of course black BAM
fold it down carry them together rub
down your sort of suede and boom that's
your setup I can have this thing all the
way down here tapping away the oops
button this is personality
never mind backspace we're going with
hoops look at that made by them cross
that out us whoa one of those type sees
is a Thunderbolt 3 in case you were
wondering it has a micro SD card reader
look at the way they hit it it's in
there the power switch that is also a
fingerprint reader oh there we go we're
in it's kind of like a V for Vendetta
thing and our key he's just waiting for
your manifesto right now did you know
that well touch input kind of nice I
want to hear these speakers that's a
pretty nice display 2880 by 1920 plenty
of pixels to play with here for video
what about the sound though the sound is
yeah man let's try some music you guys
can beat a judge alright moving low
closer to you
I don't think you're buying this thing
for the speakers I got to be honest with
you Jack wasn't happy keyboards good
actually
it's got enough travel in the keys that
you know you feel fairly confident
typing on it it's not a super bright
backlight there it is it is not a super
bright backlight
all right so God is this how bright it
is normally oh so the light doesn't
exactly come straight through the key
very well it bleeds out to the side a
little bit I wish it was a little bit
more powerful you could do your
sketching you could get creative very
precise but I think it's gonna be
popular for those type of purposes now
obviously this is not a gaming laptop
but because it does have a Thunderbolt 3
port you could hook up an external GPU
and really boost the performance of it
now the main focus here is to give you
something in the same neighborhood as
the surface product with a similar spec
for quite a bit less have they achieved
that I kind of think so pick this up and
all of a sudden it's a tablet and I'm
sitting on the couch and I'm sketching
I'm watching Netflix if you're in the
market for a surface you definitely need
to be aware of this thing's existence
because you can get 90% of the way maybe
even more than that at quite a bit less
with a similar spec the V computer as
they call it from new company Eve I
think it's probably worth some
consideration or you could just buy it
to rub the suede it's probably what Jack
would end up doing how long can you do
this for I'm prepared to sit here
smiling for four hours that's a
reference for Willy do and any of you
that are doing YouTube right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
