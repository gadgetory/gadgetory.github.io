welcome back to a fresh installment in
the popular internet series does it suck
I saw these things on Amazon and I was
like I have gum right now I can't have
dumb Jarius what am i doing music rap
transformable speaker i don't remember
they may have had decent reviews they
create a personal sound field at first
glance they look like headphones they're
obviously not headphones transformable
speaker is how it's described you can
see here on the side like kind of wind
them up put them wherever you need a
speaker even act as kind of stereo
speakers for your phone like a little
stand
maybe it's cool maybe it sucks well
that's why you're tuned into this
episode and that's why I'm doing this
why I can't wait to crack into it the
world's most versatile listening
experience that is a significant claim
personal sound field by neck wearing
okay we're getting into the
translational territory now lightweight
allows you rapping music to go eight
hours battery music non-stop IP x5
water-resistant that's good easily pack
by folding into pocket-sized hands-free
speakerphone I don't know maybe you keep
this thing beside your bed on on the
nightstand
you know smartphone speakers are not
that great maybe what you need is
something in between like the music wrap
smartphone speaker got you down have we
got the solution for you
I think they come in a couple different
colors too but you know me I got the
lime-green microUSB I hope they have
some juice to begin woo-wooo a nice
material actually look at look at that
is weird
that's a weird one you can see the two
speaker units here power switch LED
light plus - and then a stop button play
button and then also a USB port which is
covered by this flap so now you're
starting to understand why this is
water-resistant maybe what do you do
maybe you hang this in the bathroom near
the shower or something it's a it's
rugged-looking this feels weird by the
way like Jack the picture that's on
Amazon people are kind of doing that
they're making a personal sound field
another way as you saw on the box
they're like this am i doing that right
of course
facing this way oh oh and you're ready
for the party goes the other way so wait
wait wait
get the speaker's like that little
stereo sound for your image what if they
do in the pic here we go so they're
gonna fire up words like that whoo check
it how high-tech yeah if that's on your
coffee table or your kitchen table
that's not an issue that's good that
works let's connect them Oh juice music
rap m25 mm-hmm
connected so we'll do a YouTube video
first smartphone you may have never
heard of before it's got the magic from
honor and the reason you probably it's
not good enough he was never released
here in North America
Jack I'm worried right now brother I
show you that's maximum volume
unbelievable positive thing you signed
up to this channel and being a
technology fan in general it means
better than the phone speaker mer lady
is like you're getting a little more
low-end but barely what are we doing go
into space you might think I'm talking
about oh maybe Jack Attack is right it
beeps - like identify that you've turned
the volume up all right okay okay maybe
that's a little quick there
all right yeah
it's better than your phone speaker for
sure it beeps every time you turn the
volume up it doesn't give you any kind
of indication to let you know you're all
the way you just click in a million time
I thought the beep was like you made it
to the end I show you something so
unbelievable better than your phone
that's about it you got if you had a
Bluetooth speakers even a small one with
blowing these things away I think first
and foremost this is about doing this
it's about whatever whatever this is
about I don't know I mean you're walking
I don't know that's so weird
you like that look there Jax I don't
know 20 bluetooth speakers you can wear
on your necks
oh it's plenty loud when you have it
here it's versatile innocent like I
could wrap this around whatever I want
just have sound somewhere but when you
start doing that it's like any Bluetooth
speaker is pretty much better than this
maybe it's better for your ears
long-term hearing damage god I don't
know if I want to say it sucks because
maybe for somebody they can immediately
see like all men this would be perfect
for this maybe you need to be aware of
your surroundings you want to listen to
something but you need to be aware of
your surroundings what would that be
riding a bike I'm not gonna say they
suck I'm not saying they suck jacks what
I think the proper application for this
is is when you're doing something else
you have a podcast on but you're like
playing a video game at the same time
create your own like audio mix I don't
know an electrician or something you
can't be shut off to your surroundings
with headphones but you want to hear
something that's not going to disturb
everyone which a big speaker would do as
you move further away from it this is
what it's for I'm in the right
neighborhood now lunchtime comes Austin
you're watching unbox therapy I'm
talking about your favorite Brad do I
wish that they were a little bit louder
a little bit better sounding and sure of
course if we're putting them in the
headphone category there's a ton of hip
hello hi dear
whoa yes I'm coming home right after
this super early so you'll be home in
like now yeah yeah believe it believe it
I know you guys are screaming at me in
the audience right now you're going put
on headphones I don't get it man what
about putting one year but it I know I
get it
I'm just trying here it's my it's my job
to try to see why these things exist
they don't suck they could have been
better
how much do they cost let me how much do
they cost current price on Amazon
sixty-three bucks it's a little much for
this if I show up to work like this if
Jack's wearing these comes to work
wearing this how am I not do what what's
going on here man
don't use them like this by the way
that's what we're used to headphones
it's gonna be a tough one to overcome
you're not getting style points here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
