for this video is that I just picked up
some brand new fresh RAM for my MacBook
Pro yes my MacBook Pro has been stuck at
4 gigs since I bought it and it's really
feeling like a bottleneck now in terms
of performance when I'm using Final Cut
Pro 10 etc I've been wanting to upgrade
it for a while and I saw a good deal on
some Mac memory from Corsair that's been
designated for use with Mac books IMAX
Mac minis etc but the purpose for this
video is to tell you that you don't
necessarily need to buy mac designated
memory to upgrade your Mac and
oftentimes you'll pay more than you
should just to have a sticker that says
mac memory on it the only thing that you
need to worry about when buying
replacement memory for your Mac is that
the timings and the voltage match up at
least those are the two most important
things to attempt to match the other
thing of course is the RAM speed but I
assume already that you know what you're
looking for in terms of RAM speed
depending on your Mac you'll either need
ddr3 if you've got an older Mac you'll
need ddr2 in this case it's 1333
megahertz but anyways there's going to
be a number of different rams available
at 1333 megahertz and what you're going
to want to look for is the timings now
in this case I'm not sure if you can
read this or not but the timing is 9 - 9
- 9 - 2 4 and that timing matches up
exactly with the Samsung Ram usually
it's Samsung Ram that ships in your
MacBook Pro iMac etc so when these
timings match up you know you're going
to get stable performance out of your
new Ram if you've got a ddr3 RAM that
are memory that doesn't match up from a
timing standpoint or a voltage
standpoint you might get unstable
performance you might get kernel panic
panics etc so it's not so much about
finding Ram that says Mac memory on it
or ordering it from a company that has
you know pre-qualified it to be used if
you know what you're looking for in
terms of timings then you can pick
something that matches up and you know
is going to perform correctly the next
thing to mention is that
at the voltage is 1.5 volts there are
some Rams in this range of ddr3 notebook
memory that will have like 1.3 voltage
or varying voltages you want to match
that up as well so you want to be
looking for 1.5 voltage so anyways I
hope this has helped you guys out a
little bit I'm gonna be driving home
right now installing this memory into my
macbook pro it's much needed I'm going
all the way from 4 gigs to 16 gigs as I
said before I'll probably run some
performance tests as well to show you
guys why having more memory is important
especially for video editing or you know
multimedia intensive tasks or other
tasks for that matter I'm sure that a
lot of you probably know that the more
intensive your computer use the more
need you have for memory so anyway guys
that's just been a quick update to let
you know about some of the content
that's going to be coming up today this
is going to get us started I'll do an
installation video show you just how to
install these as I said a second ago and
I'm repeating myself now so anyway guys
I'll see you on the next video and stay
tuned to the channel okay later</div></body></html>
