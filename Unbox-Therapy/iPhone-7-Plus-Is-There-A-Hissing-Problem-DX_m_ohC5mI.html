without a teeny little bit of
controversy what's the latest I've been
getting hit up on Twitter by a bunch
people ask me Lou what's happening with
this hiss gate and I was like this game
what do you I have no idea what you're
even talking about so sure I've recently
unboxed all the different iPhone 7s and
seven pluses and I didn't notice
anything myself but then people were
showing me evidence of these phones
making weird noises and I was like what
that can't be right that can't be
possible I got to run a test I got to
show the people what's actually
happening I've got an iPhone 7 plus an
iPhone 7 and even an iPhone 6s for
comparison so what is this hiss it's
this kind of little clickety clackety
staticky sound out of the back of the
new iPhone at least allegedly if you
hold it up to your ear with the Apple
logo sort of right in front of your ear
when your device is under load watching
a video playing a game there's some
sound involved you're playing sound so
you really got to go looking for this
hiss but then what if you're holding up
your video camera your phone is your
video camera and that internal hissing
gets picked up by the microphone which
is located right beside that location
and then I was like oh that might be an
issue
without further ado you're gonna hear
for yourself how this hissing sounds on
the various devices and you can then
determine whether you think it's a major
issue or not so let's kick it off with
the iPhone 7 plus
so there you have it the iPhone 7 and 7
plus tested here for his skates I had a
very elaborate microphone setup I wanted
to make sure that the test was identical
for each of the devices cranked up the
gain in order to find it I don't know
you guys tell me what you think if you
didn't quite hear it go back turn up
your headphones put headphones on in the
first place and listen back to it you
can identify the unusual sound coming
out of the iPhone 7 is it overwhelming
does it matter I guess it's gonna be up
to you that's what this video is for so
you can make the judgement let me know
down in the comments what you think is
this gonna affect your purchase maybe
you're going to avoid an iPhone 7
because of this I'm not sure that's why
I want to hear what you have to say down
below thank you very much for watching
if you missed my unboxing video I showed
you every single iPhone 7 and 7 plus
that's every one even though it's jet
black versions so go watch that video
I'm even giving a couple away so you can
have your your very own his fist thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
