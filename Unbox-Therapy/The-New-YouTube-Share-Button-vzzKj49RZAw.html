another video and today it's a little
bit different
I am unboxing something in the digital
virtual realm I'm going to show you a
new feature on YouTube that you didn't
know existed unless you're one of the
super cool kids that did know that it
existed there is a new feature a new
function in YouTube that's been hiding
right under your nose and I am here to
bring it to light it is the new share
button in the YouTube app maybe you
don't see it yet maybe you haven't been
invited but that's the cool part of this
video I'm going to be inviting you all
to share more often using this button
now normally along the top pre share
button what you had was home trending
subscriptions and then your own channel
page now one of the things YouTube's
trying to do is get you to share and
talk and converse within the app itself
and that's what the share button is all
about so here is a way to privately have
your own thread regarding a video that
you can share with your friends have
your own conversations and so on so
under the share button you can see a few
things have been shared with me already
a few videos and so on now I have this
view contacts button now right now I'm
not sure how this list of people showed
up who I might know whether it's from
the old YouTube contacts section or
whatnot but you can go ahead and add
anybody to this list even people who
don't have YouTube accounts so when I
click add more contacts it'll bring this
up and there is the special link by
which you can invite people to your
private share feed of all the videos
that you're sharing and talking about
that link I'm going to drop it where am
I gonna put it I'll put it on my Twitter
go check me out follow me on twitter at
unbox therapy that link will be there so
you're now invited you can use this
feature as soon as you click this link
as far as I understand it so go there
for the exclusive invite and why not
share this video as your first Youtube
share talk about sharing after you share
its meta share sharing is caring you've
heard that before
let's see for example here mark has
shared something with me ok if I click
on that you'll see I end up in a in a
different kind of zone here a different
kind of space I can watch the video here
but at the same time I can heart this
independent Ascenta heart as unbox
therapy ok you get a heart mark as there
you go let's just you know what for the
sake of it let's invite some random
person let's list I'm gonna add a
Detroit Board here we go I just invited
him and just like that he now should
have the share button now as far as
sharing to this area it's actually
really easy to do so if you are ok let's
say you're on Red Hot Chili Peppers over
here right the share button here what
you've always seen before but normally
you would have only been able to share
it to other social media Twitter
Facebook and so on in this particular
case here you can see now I can share as
on box therapy and say something and I
can send it directly to this list of
contacts who as I said will become your
tight-knit social group that you share
with specifically privatization I guess
of your YouTube experience making it a
little bit more exclusive and allowing
you once you click that link the invite
link that's on my Twitter to share with
me to share your favorite videos with me
and vice versa I might be sharing with
you very soon this is what Apple's
charge case should have been</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
