moving into this new studio this really
big space that you guys have seen in
previous videos is that I can now test
out these unbelievably strange electric
vehicles the world of bizarre electric
vehicles has expanded to a great degree
which one is the best which way is the
fastest easiest to ride I don't know I
should make a playlist of all the
different electric vehicles I've rode
around down there and today is no
exception today I'm looking at what I'm
thinking might be one of the most
difficult ones I've ever rode unless you
unless you would consider those giant
legs those kangaroo legs whatever they
were it's called the in motion STV v8
it's a unicycle style so it's just one
tire it looks kind of like a bicycle
tire and you've got to balance it out is
this the final episode of unboxing is
quite possible with this thing I'm going
flying right through the garage door
alright let's crack this open see what
it's about have I got this right serious
packaging here or what they have like
lights on it or something oh except the
charger whoa that thing is serious
that's like it's like a military charger
or something right there these look like
pads probably to make the things
slightly more comfortable ankle
protection pad if you're going barefoot
I mean that is a different level of
aggressiveness if you're going barefoot
on this thing a carrying bag that's kind
of cool
put that on there cover it up when it's
not in use oh oh my goodness that is an
actual bicycle tire on there not silica
gel Jack Sunter dry Oh No
Jack oh man I can tell already I'm in
trouble oh my goodness Wow oh my
goodness these are where your feet go
you step on it like that it's kind of
got griptape like a skateboard on it
there's a handle on the top Oh check
that out like a way to guide it if you I
guess if you're not riding it this is
your recharge port up at the top there
oh there's a light on it as well and
here's the power switch right over here
let's take this thing downstairs and see
what I'm made up
all right oh look it's taina starts to
balance itself oh do we need some kind
of instruction here this is how you do
it right now how aggressive the lights
are so people know are you out of your
goddamn mind this thing is more intense
than I originally imagined there's a
learning curve here and I'm at the very
bottom of the curve it's awful
full Wow whoops oh oh
obviously this is not the way they
expect you to reveal what I'm doing here
can they expect me to just pick that up
out of a box and immediately know what
they're doing I guess not guess that's
not the point this is more of an extreme
vehicle than the other stuff that's for
sure like 100% this is way more extreme</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
