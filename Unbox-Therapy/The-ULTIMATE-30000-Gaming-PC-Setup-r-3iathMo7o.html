time
he's a moment act now I have spent my
life traveling across the universe
inside my mind I hope that science and
technology will provide the answers but
it will take people human beings with
knowledge and understanding to implement
these solutions we are all time
travelers learning together to the
future we brave the determined overcome
us that can be done all right so I told
you did I tell you we're trying to put
together crazy things and today I think
we've done that so in a previous video I
showed you a set up with a really
special chair kind of been upgraded it's
been replaced by something even more
outlandish by what I think by what I
know is the ultimate gaming /
workstation setup I've ever seen
experience been a part of yes it will
blow your mind yes it is completely
bonkers that's the point
now I unveil to you my current top tier
top of the food chain place to sit right
here oh my goodness
excuse me it's too much Lou I can't
handle it I can't deal with it deal with
it you shall if you sat there you would
know what I was talking about that one
in the middle 4k LG Display 42.5 inches
and then blanket with a couple portrait
mode displays which is exactly what I've
done right here yeah 24 it's almost a
hundred inches cuz you want to get
immersed you're not allowed to sit here
Jack and of course we need the right PC
to drive it all we brought over the side
X PC from the other setup we have a
Playstation there as well because
there's multiple inputs to this set up
that's what the ultimate set up needs
its RGB everywhere of course we got the
snack cart Sun Chips got the pirate
cookies healthy diet this
chair here was made by a company called
Imperator works and I imported this
thing it's kind of the heart of this
setup about this light on the front you
slid it in there rigged it up it's
called nano leaf that just went in there
for even more RGB and then over here we
got the fridge you need to grab
something you're gaming
baby you're streaming in here I'm
getting thirsty maybe it's an iced tea
maybe it's a beer or maybe it's a Coca
Cola unbox therapy edition I mean the
choice is yours
night night this is where you want to be
in life at most moments so from this
spot you can control everything you hit
the zero-g the whole thing moves like
this a nice little recline going on I
could be here a week the chair even has
a massage built into it so you could get
the nice little vibe going on this is
the moment I have to give a big
shout-out to SteelSeries for sponsoring
this episode and also making such
amazing gaming peripherals this headset
is the Arctic's pro game DAC this guy
right here gives you a mix I have DTS
that I can turn on and off and if I hold
this switch right here I have even more
settings there's a mic that comes out
from here this is the rival 600 super
comfy pull off these side panels and
adjust the weight of it each one of
these units is four grams four of these
on each side of the mouse now the
keyboard is the M 750 the same lighting
that you would get on a full-size but in
something that's more compact
now you also probably noticed this
playstation controller sitting up front
you might want to play a console game in
here the PC gamers out there in the
audience to like a setup like this and
you're playing on a console I'm offended
who cares it's the ultimate setup it
should have everything right the cool
thing with this main displays it has a
ton of inputs DisplayPort multiple HDMI
2.0 so up to 60fps in
okay even with the playstation up on the
main display you still see the portrait
displays on the side showcasing your
gaming pc so from a Productivity
standpoint were you in an entertainment
standpoint you could be multitasking
here oh there is your mind brother I'll
come for you you you are mine brother I
will come for you it won't hit him it
won't it won't hit them at all you don't
use an SMG in the long range brothers
and sisters as you can tell the game is
now across all three monitors believe it
or not little bit difficult to do when
you have portrait mode monitors on the
side I've mapped it pretty well here you
could play with the middle monitor and
do the kind of productivity
entertainment thing that I mentioned
earlier you can see we've got a decent
frame rate here over 80 fps mostly
there's the worst Hill ever - you get
that real kind of twitchy whoa I found
this secret area accidentally here he
comes oh boy I mean what can I say I
can't think of a better spot in the
world the possibilities are endless
everything is right where it should be
and you really feel like you could be
here for a while before fatigue sets in
it's not gonna be for everyone it's
obviously outlandish yes it's expensive
but sitting here is a very special
experience I promise you that so there
you have it the most insane setup that
I've ever put together courtesy of Steel
series they fit right in couldn't
imagine not having the proper
peripherals to go with a setup like this
I don't know you let me know if you've
seen a crazier setup than this I don't
think you have how about this you
keep this ball rolling step this up even
further do more crazy setups let me know
by leaving that thumb love down below
this one right here don't forget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
