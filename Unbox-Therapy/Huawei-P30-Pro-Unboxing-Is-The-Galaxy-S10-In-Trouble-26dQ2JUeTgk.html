it's the Huawei P 30 Pro and this one
claims to be the camera champion the P
stands for photography I mean you've got
Pro in the name as well you got like on
the box and it's a quad camera setup
they are squarely aiming at smartphone
champion status in the camera department
it's got a front-facing 32 megapixel
camera selfie so a lot of camera tech
inside of here but also other flagship
specs this model in front of me
breathing crystal 256 gigs of storage
and eight gigabytes of RAM it's got an
OLED display it's got a tiny little
cutout let's just get into it and see
what makes up Huawei's latest competitor
in the flagship smartphone space and I
guess figure out whether or not it can
dethrone the Samsung Galaxy S 10 s 10
plus that just recently came out because
that seems to be what it's kind of
targeting here's the color let's check
that out real quick whoa that's a color
Wow as a bit of a pearl to it there's a
violet into a sky-blue type of situation
man they got innovative with the colors
you get you have to admit that you have
a USB type-c cable to charge this thing
up of course it also has wireless
charging and wireless charge sharing
just like the bigger mate device that
Huawei makes and a quick charge power
brick as well okay so let's look around
the device real quick you can see Huawei
has the little red identifier once again
on the power switch volume rocker up
above there bottom of the device you
have your SIM card tray as well as the
type-c connector also your speaker unit
the other side is completely clean
there's like a an edge design to this to
this deal it's a similar to what Samsung
is doing but maybe even a little more
slender hang on a second you just
grabbed the s10 real quick maybe maybe
even more curved to the back of the unit
and the front side so it kind of both
front and back curved into this edge
it's got a slender fee
to it especially for a device that's
this big six point four seven inches on
the display
according to Willie do so that's I mean
these displays are getting huge
considering the form factors that
they're being fit into this is
reminiscent of the essential cut out the
essential phone and oh if you guys
recall that particular device all it is
is a camera lens though so unlike the
previous version Huawei devices that
featured more high-end face recognition
tech similar to what the iPhone is doing
they opted for a smaller notch in
exchange for just a simple camera to
take selfie pictures with obviously okay
there's the look Kirk in case you're
wondering you get a quick look at the
cutout alongside the slim bezel around
the whole device bit of a chin there but
impressive screen to body ratio
nonetheless this is an in display
fingerprint scanner it's using optical
technology so it's gonna illuminate the
finger similar to some other products on
the market this is a comprehensive scan
here
now there's also face unlock in here but
remember when it comes to image based
face unlock it's not the most secure
form of locking your device so use it at
your own risk
wow that was quick setup complete holy
moly
alright we're gonna do direct on lock
are you ready looks for the face boom
Louis for the face boom I mean there's
something so nice about the speed at
which this tech operates but as I said
you just need to understand the
limitations with this security method I
mean that time you don't even see the
lock screen it just goes right in when
it's looking at me
fingerprint on the other hand let's give
that a shot whoo all right that's pretty
quick these are getting better they're
definitely in a territory right now
where you could get used to it and you
could live this particular life right
here so this is 23 40 by 1080 resolution
you can see I mean that's fibrin colors
it's OLED the notch is tiny it's barely
there you can decide aesthetically how
that stacks up for you compared to the
hole punch cut out so there you can see
the difference
it definitely reaches down farther and
therefore it pushes the status bar a
little further down as well in the case
of the whole bunch but it is off to the
side so again to each their own alright
let's open up the camera here let's take
a peek at this it's a it's this
collaboration you get the the like a
brand name on here now this camera setup
is just bananas there's so much going on
here we have a 40 megapixel camera with
a typical focal range a wide angle which
becomes obvious given the amount of
glass that you see in there and then of
course the 5x optical zoom in telescopic
camera setup on the bottom that's pretty
wild and then this other time of flight
lens over here which is used mostly for
depth recognition a little bit more data
information within the photo frame now
the AI is picking up that this is a
portrait and it's blurring everything
else around I don't necessarily want to
do this I'm gonna X that out now this is
1x so this is just your general 40
megapixel smartphone camera boom there's
your photo now this is the 5x that's a
huge jump from one to the next it
doesn't in there because you can keep
zooming in it just goes digital at a
certain point so as you can tell quality
here on the main shot is very similar to
the 5x zoom then it starts to degrade as
you use the digital zoom to get in
closer now on the flip side you've got
the wide let's peel this all the way
down so we can get quite wide here on
the widest setting to me this is the
most useful extra camera lens situation
on any of these smartphones because
there are circumstances in which you're
trying to take a picture of a group of
people let's say or possibly some
architecture you're traveling and
whatnot and I like seeing it on all
smartphone cameras I've been using it on
the s10 used it previous to that on
other devices as well and now you know
it's here I think it's useful so to give
you one more breakdown standard focal
length 5x optical zoom digital zoom at
10x it goes even further than that
and then of course the wide-angle let me
turn the AI back on dog it got it can
you see that Kirk it knows a dog oh no
see taking pictures of dogs is hard oh
he's he's lit well there that's fine
look at that what a star you can see
various settings here so lots of control
if you happen to want it
settings for video mode will take you
all the way up to 4k UHD and you can
shoot in h.265 for higher efficiency at
that higher resolution more interesting
to me is night mode I first checked this
out on a huawei device and it blew my
mind once upon a time and of course it's
still here in the p30 Pro and this I
mean this is just capable of shall we
hit the Lights real quick it's kind of
incredible you saw that happen there
Kirk the lights went out and somehow
this thing I mean it's he's better than
I do right now I'm in pitch black and it
still sees a plant here look at this is
the plant in real life takes a couple of
shots merges it together and I mean it
makes day out of night
it's incredible alright so obviously
lots going on in the camera department
the sheer diversity of ways to interact
with the various cameras the options the
manual mode the night mode and so on
things are looking promising at the
moment selfie camera let's do a quick
one
whoa it's a detailed selfie ladies and
gentlemen are you seeing this right now
that is a 32 megapixel sensor this is a
realistic-looking selfie like that's
what I look like
you understand the beard hair test holy
moly
this thing's doing selfies the eyeball
Kirk just had an interesting point he
says the knotch
is not as hidden in the official themes
like apples trying to do so if you were
curious about potential knotch
distraction during video watching this
should give you an idea of how much it
interrupts your video stream it ain't
much let's play some music real quick oh
boy
Saturday morning cartoons I mean awesome
tunes obviously ghost notes the
speaker's not that loud I don't know I'd
say it's average really the speaker it's
clear it's doing the trick place not
it's not blowing me away or anything
like that it's just doing the trick so
what can I say about this phone I mean
in this some Posse it's pretty it's a
beauty look at that I think it's gonna
turn some heads people gonna be like
what are you rocking right there that
that nice little gradient going on the
whole unit has five cameras if you
include the front one the front one well
you saw what it did to my face it's all
very promising I mean it's a good time
to be a smartphone fan that's really the
take away when I see products like this
I feel bad for Apple people because they
only get to really you don't have one
moment per year like they get one option
like holy smokes from month to month the
flagships just slapping you in the face
hey you mean it forces these guys to
bring the eight-game all the time it's
all a game we got to shrink the notches
we get to hole punch OLED everywhere
more cameras how many cameras I don't
know ten cameras long-range short-range
wide-angle portrait algorithms
computational photography AI color
gradients slim batteries did I even
mention the battery on this 4,200
milliamp hours gotta get that in I mean
I should say this guy's expensive but I
should definitely mention that flagship
territory also price-wise this is a
thousand euros to start they do have a
cheaper model the p30 it's only two
hundred dollars less look out for a
video on that it strips down this just a
little bit at a lower price point
because that seems to be what the
flagships are doing now they got the
flagship and then the sub flagship and
that might be the better deal
nonetheless you got to pay to play in
this department it's an expensive phone
that's for sure
but you gotta admit it's kind of pretty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
