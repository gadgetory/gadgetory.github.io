tell the space is a little cramped right
now that's because I have teamed up with
Best Buy to put together the ultimate
back-to-school gadget guide these are my
picks and I've got a reason for every
single one so stick around and let's get
into it this is from the RL series
thank you I chose this one for a couple
of reasons it's an incredible gaming
monitor it has some of the best input
lag or lack of input lag of any monitor
on the market that means when you have
an input on your controller some kind of
instruction a button press etc it's
going to happen on-screen incredibly
quickly that's different than response
time but when it comes to response time
this thing is quick as well one
millisecond to be more specific so it's
a 27 inch display it's got dual HDMI so
a couple of different sources is another
cool feature which is this little hook
on the side and this is used to house
your headphones they always know where
they are and they're up off the desk and
out of your way on the back you also
have a headphone out and aligned in sort
of act as a mini receiver if you will
it's also got a DVI port and traditional
VGA port so there are some options for
interfacing with other stuff I almost
forgot to mention is this little Ridge
here this might just look like a design
feature but check this out there's
actually some rubber up here and that's
going to be the perfect spot to house
your controllers a really
well-thought-out little feature you're
always looking for a place to put these
BenQ RL series my monitor choice for the
ultimate Dormer next up we have a mouse
this is my favorite right here the MX
master from Logitech incredibly
comfortable these are sort of the
leaders in the space when it comes to
precision mousing I said precision
mounting plus this can use bluetooth
over receiver to work on Mac or PC and
it can be paired to multiple devices at
once this thumb wheel on the side for
horizontal scrolling you've also got
this really unique free spinning wheel
in your traditional scroll wheel section
here very satisfying clicks this is just
a fantastic package up to 40 days of
battery life if you want the best in the
business it is probably the MX
master from Logitech so this gets my
vote for the mouse choice in this
ultimate back-to-school gadget guide
what do we have next AJ it's an external
hard drive I know not the most exciting
thing in the world but you're gonna be
doing a lot of work and it's not any
good to you if you lose it all
so this is a place to back it up it's
also a place for all your multimedia you
know I'm always thinking about the
entertainment side as well this is a one
terabyte Thunderbolt bus powered drive
and in this case that means up to 110
megabyte per second transfers it's a
little bit rugged as well so if you do
drop it bump it it has a little bit of
extra protection
lastly the cable is built right in it
sort of just slides around the outside
and then there's a little is it a flap
it's a cover that keeps it contained say
you happen to go to your friend's dorm
room and they don't have Thunderbolt
capabilities on their computer but you
still want to share files this still has
USB on it USB 3.0 to be specific so no
matter what computer you're interfacing
with you are covered so I talked a
little bit earlier about entertainment
and I think it's important for your dorm
room lifestyle your back-to-school
lifestyle it really all starts right
here this is a PlayStation 4 I'm sure
you've seen one before combo kit comes
with the new Batman Arkham Knight heard
fantastic things about this game this
was a very tough decision going with the
PlayStation 4 over the Xbox one
obviously there are very passionate
people on either side of the console
spectrum there are many cross-platform
games available and I think the most
important thing to consider when
deciding on the console you want to take
with you off to your college just
consider which one are your friends on
which one are they gaming on and then
that's probably the best one for you in
my case it's Playstation headphones very
important have a very intimate
relationship with my headphones this is
the new version of a pair of Sony's that
I've been using for a year now maybe
over a year the MDR is ZX 7 7 0 bTW this
is their latest in wireless bluetooth
headphones now the reason I've chosen
these is because they're versatile they
can be used with a wire or without they
also don't feature active noise
cancellation I've never been a huge fan
of active noise cancellation requires
more battery life gives you that odd
sense of compression on your ears at
least for some people now this is this
is subjective they make an active noise
cancellation it's got a microphone in it
too so when you pair this with your cell
phone you can go ahead and answer phone
calls now this is going to work with
your Playstation as well as your laptop
with or without cables and as you can
see here it even has NFC that's one of
my favorite features it means that when
you want to pair with a new device say
your phone for example I hope it
features NFC simply tap the two you are
then paired and you're listening to your
favorite podcast or whatever it is that
you do with headphones these are capable
of up to 17 hours battery life and in my
testing they get very close to that so
as you'd imagine you're not charging
them that often and you pretty much
always have juice when you need it
17 hours could go to Tokyo can I get to
Tokyo 17 hours
Tokyo baby you're probably going to need
a backpack to carry all this stuff
around this one is from a company called
dual I hope I'm pronouncing that
correctly they're out of Sweden this one
sort of checks all the boxes for things
should be looking for and it includes
something that's a little bit unusual
this safe zone up here which is like a
hard portion for storing something like
sunglasses or important electronics and
gadgets as you can see here you put
sunglasses back here you put your phone
up top it's also water-resistant so if
it rains you should be okay
on the inside of this little pocket here
you can feel there's like a coating a
plastic coating so that water hopefully
been penetrate and zippers themselves
very satisfying you have a big
compartment in the back for a laptop as
well as an iPad and this front
compartment here some organizational
stuff for pens various school related
stationery and then there's a really big
main compartment as well you'll likely
be using for textbooks
unfortunately sound
very important I'm a big fan of sound
and this is going to improve it compared
to say the speakers on your phone or
your laptop it's the JBL pulse and
what's special about it compared to
other Bluetooth speakers is that it
lights up you're at college and you
might do a little bit of partying and
when you show up with this thing people
are going to know I'm going to see the
the lights moving along like an
equaliser they're going to know that you
mean business party business now often
people think that a Bluetooth speaker
will only work with Bluetooth but many
of them like this one actually have an
auxilary input as well meaning you could
connect this to the stationary setup
that I proposed earlier with the BenQ
monitor and even the laptop and
PlayStation and everything connected you
can take exhilarate out from the monitor
and that will essentially take both of
your HDMI inputs from your computer as
well as your PlayStation and send that
audio through to this speaker which is
going to be better than either of those
things independently that said this
works incredibly well as a Bluetooth
speaker also so somebody comes over to
visit you and you're set up they might
be visiting your set up first and then
you the thing that can connect via
bluetooth on their smart phone and
stream music that way so it's a
versatile solution without the need for
a lot of outboard gear something that's
easy to travel with now this one is not
something that you absolutely need this
is just something that I'm really into
in a very intense way this is the new rx
100 from Sony pretty much the best
pocket camera ever made the perfect
companion to a wonderful college
experience this thing has an incredible
lens an incredible sensor it now shoots
4k video and high frame rate video for
slow-motion stuff with the giant
aperture on the lens you're going to
have a much easier time taking pictures
in low light which is probably what
you'll be dealing with at those parties
I'm talking about the new rx 100 mark or
from
another camera this is a different kind
of camera meant to actually stay in your
space it's the new camera from nest
which has an incredibly wide field of
view this is going to help you to
protect all this stuff I'm talking about
very important comes with a slick
application for checking in on your
space right
you know seeing if anything unusual is
going on you can also set up alerts so
you're the first to know if anything
fishy is going down why have all this
cool stuff if you're not even going to
protect it
cables a necessary evil but believe it
or not something that I'm incredibly
excited about I like innovations in the
cable space a few of these here are
representations of that one of my
favorite manufacturers happens to be
tilt for that very reason you can see
this flip duo here is not only both a
microUSB and lightning cable but it also
now has a reversible USB connector so
you can't plug it in the wrong way that
is a win my friends also from tilt this
flat short cable which believe it or not
is incredibly convenient it'll never be
tangled when you're looking for it and
when you don't need that extra cabling
this is a way to stay organized we've
also got this battery pack one of my
favorites again it's very slim and it
has built-in cables so built-in
lightning as well as micro USB this fits
in your back pocket incredibly slender
one of my favorites a couple of extra
HDMI s and audio cables can't go wrong
with those and then my new favorite
accessory this surge protector from
Belkin which features a rotating look at
this rotating outlets so no matter how
big your power bricks are you can
actually use all the outlets that you
paid for you know the drill you need
power a phone this is the bonus round
you might already have a phone but if
you don't and you're looking for one to
complete the ultimate gadget setup for
back-to-school this is probably it this
is my favorite this is what's in my
pocket
it's the s6 active a tough rugged
version of the galaxy s6 from Samsung
this one is going to give you water
resistance it's going to give
you a little bit of extra shock
resistance as well overall great package
fast incredible camera that's my
smartphone choice for the ultimate
back-to-school gadget guide so there you
