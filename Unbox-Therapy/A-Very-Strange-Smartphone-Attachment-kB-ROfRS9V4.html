different take sort of an unusual
product pow
I guess POW is the company it's an
expandable phone speaker universal click
mount and wallet you get a click case
click mount wallet and then the speaker
itself itself is called mo pow mo it has
this thing called an audio expansion
chamber there is no substitute right for
you need some space for sound to
resonate so really small portable
bluetooth speakers you'll want two
things right they either don't sound
very good or they got to get large this
is trying to do both they're trying to
be compact and then also pop into
something that can resonate can give you
decent sound I'm assuming this is gonna
clip onto here I don't know how many
different devices they make the case
component or house big authentic sound
comes from popping up the wave Blum
audio expansion chamber wave bloom
that's like a startup that's like your
next startup you know I mean it's Wave
blue of course it's wave blue let's do
what we do and get to the bottom of it
listen to this thing here and see what
it's all about see if it's worth our
time worth your money oh these people
obviously think so they're having the
time of their lives this is how Willie
do likes to party it has some weight to
it and at first you're like okay so it's
less portable if it has weight true but
you get sound what do I have multiple
components it's one of these situations
you slide up that's not bad okay this oh
my goodness gracious there's so much
going on here so this is a sticky piece
if you don't want to use this case then
you would stick this guy left that would
be a commitment like this there we go
and then your accessories would click to
this after you've got either that or
this case installed then your in wallet
territory you put in a couple cards
there slide them out and then lastly you
have the speaker unit this is what I'm
interested in you can see here it's
folded flat so it's it's actually quite
compact and then how does it pop out
hole did I do that right
it takes some force so you seen that so
that's in it's like a vacuum in there
you got to really look at that
I really pull on it type-c connector is
over here there's a dedicated Bluetooth
button and a power button check this out
that's how do you daisy
Oh said POW did you hear that pal we're
in pairing mode very Oh pal mo connected
I get the feeling that it actually
benefits from being on the table quite a
bit the way that it reverberates so
maybe the point here is like you play
the track and you maybe that's why the
whole thing sticks together like this
definitely has sound comparable to a
much bigger Bluetooth speaker now he
need the pocket test on me on the box
I'm gonna do my own pocket test here
Jack can be the witness so uh you know
what
definitely pocketable it's doable if you
knew you were heading somewhere you
wants to have music with you and you
wanted something better than your phone
speaker this is in a different realm
than your phone speaker ah you can't
cover this as little vac this little
valve so you put your finger to the side
of the valve over here and then it comes
up easy without covering the wave
expansion port so yeah will is spreading
the rumor that these things can be daisy
chained together which could be pretty
cool if possible oh did it just did it
so you you press and hold the bluetooth
and they flash green instead of blue and
the beeping is like synced up okay
United we expand press and hold the
Bluetooth they find each other and
linked up and then by the looks of it
it's one so like one is paired to the
other one and then this one attempts to
connect independently let's see if this
works yeah yeah yeah
why seagulls were dancing all around
whoa wait a minute we'll come into the
come on in we'll come on in we'll we
can't let this happen where it goes this
long without you
you know gracing let me do I'm anything
but in sight expertise I don't know
about that
Audio Engineering these things are 80
bucks it's doable right let's do that
the people wanted 50 and you brought 80
get the hell out of here
you know what I could gene cost will you
know what this photo costs quite a lot I
would imagine you know what this guy
right here costs to get him he you got
to get a guy who can do that move yeah
he's pretty prime for the portability it
listen I was like across the room it
sounded great no no the speaker it was
clear yeah I completely agree with you
the speaker sounds better than I
expected
yeah but I don't know if they need all
the accoutrement yeah I don't think
that's necessary I think just having
this and then having it on the table I
think it's good enough and the fact that
it's really heavy I have to say that's
you know this thing is just your fluff
right here yeah it's all this is for
this is hard this is very hard to open
hey man just open it up dude what you do
is it's a two-way deal so you go that
way first and then out like that even
then it's just like the grip it's so
tiny
you're not getting it up right now no
there you go I mean it's tough it's okay
the white ones harder is the other way
one Oh
they go hey go Willie how do these
gentlemen
so yeah sounds good surprising sound it
is a bit of money it's 80 bucks you said
it's 80 bucks there's gonna be people
that just want a cheaper Bluetooth
speaker I fully I understand that but
you can't really this is one department
where if you know what you're looking
for you know what you're listening for
you can tell the difference between a
cheapo Bluetooth speaker and one that
costs a little bit more and giving the
form factor of this thing I feel like
it's in the same territory sound wise as
much bigger speakers yeah you're gonna
get a much smaller package delivering
bigger sound than it probably should
definitely moe moe so like when people
ask you oh that speaker you got you beg
it be like I gotta pick it up what's it
called you like Moe they're not gonna
remember that
what Moe don't ya I feel like they could
be some work on that as well but pretty
cool nonetheless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
