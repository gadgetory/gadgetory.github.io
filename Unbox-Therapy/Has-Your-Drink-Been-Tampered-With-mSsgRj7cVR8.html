I'm telling that I'm just telling the
audience at da duh
so today's product is something called
Brio smart coaster and to be honest I
mean I don't really use a coaster but
then I read a little more I dug a little
deeper this company claims that this
product right here can prevent you from
having your drink tampered with so this
video is getting very serious right now
you're at the bar you got the pint glass
like this you know you're just you're
having a good time you leave it there
you go to the bathroom I don't know what
you do you're you're partying you're
having a great time
whatever how do you know someone's
putting something in there to mess you
up
you don't know apparently it's on the
coaster and any kind of tampering you
get a notification so we're lucky we can
really put this thing to the test
because we and we having to have a
professional drink tamper our here and
that of course is Tom's so there is yeah
you can come join yeah come on yeah yeah
yeah
yeah well point to the easy work then
there's the easy word big Tong it's been
a while brother you're all grown up now
aren't you
what are you so mad about with the arms
I've none let me get going
where you going for some drinks
can you trust a face like that no you
can't and you already knew that can't
trust a guy like that all the makings of
a of a great party that's most nights
for you right Tom just for your
heartburn they'll ruin the taste is
drink but nobody gonna pass out from it
you want them to pass impose this is a
placeholder this will dissolve in the
drink this is going to represent what it
would be like to stamp but they Pat you
down at the door and they find this
thing and they're like what is this and
you're like oh I'm just extra
precautions I don't get roofie you won't
get in yeah okay so it's kind of big if
you do bring this with you you have to
be real committed to the idea but I
don't know I don't know what it's like
to be a woman for example well if you're
a woman how paranoid are you I feel like
you'd have to already be a victim to
start buying this and carrying around or
you're just super paranoid oh you wore
the watch today yeah some days I'll show
it to Jax
these guys sponsor Rogen's podcasts
maybe they should sponsor us I don't
know Ryan do something about it Tom you
just gave him a free sponsorship one
more time
it obviously is a little more advanced
than a regular coaster and the top part
I guess is replaceable you replace the
paper part so I guess if this gets one
oh wait why does that spin so well which
one do you go for what was that oh and
merry Christmas to you
and another brew look at the style you
can add to it here
that was cool that's what you go with
yeah install the battery place the
battery inside the battery well and
twist the battery cap to seal attach the
magnetic coaster and login to the app
it's like one of these watch batteries
twist it there you go that's it and
we're gonna get the app here you have to
allow it to send you notifications
because that's the key here
if this buzzes and it's your app and say
hey man something happen to your drink
boom you don't drink it this is a
serious issue mm-hmm is it we hear that
this app is so cartoonish I was just
thinking that it's like a serious thing
and look at the app what is going on
group who city whoo look at that one hot
love what this thing is confusing tap me
whoa wow that's actually cool so we are
connected to this Bri oh now that was
actually really quick strobe what
happens look so I don't know I think
this is just that one's called sad
whoop-whoop ladies ladies whoop Saturday
night Saturday
lady digit spinner activate the digit
spinner then flick whack quack
spin the bottle tap the image to spin
the bottle that seems like an
inappropriate game oh look spin the
bottle
what the beat goes to the beat keep
track of your drink guard mode watches
your drink when you need to walk away
and alert to suspicious activity that's
the main things get started okay so we
have a beer okay so I had my students so
I'm having a good time if you're
actually gonna tamper with this drink
you have to convince me that's nothing
that's insane you want me just like that
there you go you can't that's like the
guy who apologizes but doesn't really
apologize I'm so boring sorry doesn't
count actually you behaved like an idiot
sure so let's imagine
I'm drinking you just tap this to
activate you take your drink off flip
this guy on top I activate the guard
mode gives you a little buzz
you see it's green now and if you take
that off I'm gonna know about it you
hear me this is where I would go to the
bathroom or what whatever I have to do
and and even though I was talking to Tom
like I feel like I trust Tom at this
point I should not be trusting Tom so
now I I go I walk away I'll be right
back I'll be right back
don't you dare don't even think about
I'll be right back police police he
trying to cause me me what if you do it
the thing buzzes like crazy and doesn't
stop till you deactivate it I know what
you did know everybody might just take
it off like an animal they might slide
it if hear is somebody trying to tamper
with someone else's drink and you see
this you're probably not gonna know what
it is you're probably just gonna remove
it kaboom and get caught but of course
immediately both of us are like well
what if you just or if you just slide it
off a little bit that would give you
enough access so we hit the button let's
arm it if I just
look at that that's enough room - that's
plenty of room so I don't know if this
away it can become more sensitive this
is probably already a big slow that did
it we slide it over whoo go ahead dude
there's no way anyone's doing that it's
not perfect it's a hell of a deterrent I
kind of wish it was more nondescript on
top you would catch so many more people
because they would just think it's one
of those rubber ones you know how some
bars have those rubber coasters at least
if I do this it's going on yeah and if I
don't know what this thing is I doubt
I'd be so sensitive with it if you
really what does suck though if you're
like a decent guy and you're on a first
date and you it pumps it or something
somebody walks by bumps it yeah you're
screwed yeah you're not getting a second
you know like I bumped it let's be
honest anybody who's carrying this thing
with them in advance on their way to the
bar is already fairly paranoid it's a
weird situation to be in socially I
completely agree with that
it comes with its complications if this
can save your one person from some sort
of outcome that's significant I don't
know so there you have it
the Brio it's I mean it's probably the
most high-tech coaster out there most of
them don't do anything it's like a piece
of paper I wish is a little bit more
sensitive but who knows for the right
scenario a bar a club you don't know who
to trust it's gonna be better than
nothing
keep secret big make a good news anchor
team you and I yeah you're always
breathing down my neck do you have to
care for these things you can't be
touching me if I'm bleeding it's over no
bloodshed
no we can't harm the results are in
somebody's getting their head shaved
it's gonna be Willie do oh he's gonna be
all right
Tom bring in the result please first of
all if you haven't seen the original
video go watch that right now these two
did a drawing contest they tried to draw
me the whole thing was a fiasco go watch
that video and you'll understand why one
of the two is having their head of the
results are any award goes to
Rion Rion bus so we tallied up the votes
as should have been the case of course
Willie do one Ryan he went for a more
abstract approach complete failure
yeah thanks well I've not I'm not
Picasso or whatever the hell you call B
in that video I know I don't draw
anything I only know I lost my drinking
so I wasn't surprised that came out the
way it did I I would I would do better
if I had another chance I think maybe
maybe no I I don't know maybe I wouldn't
maybe be just as bad maybe worse anyway
yeah I isolated shave my head so go
ahead shit the original deal was that
the loser will get shaved by the winner
will do will be shaving Ryan's head now
you'll have another chance to get him
back some other video I'm not worried
about that but here's the thing I don't
want to be left out of the fun so I made
a side deal with Willie you so I get to
do a little bit of the job here just be
gentle
I will just be careful you said one
strip hang on
you know what the problem with the head
shaving things get the hairs in the back
it's all itchy I couldn't go to the
barber all right that wasn't that bad
actually let's finish her off make sure
you get the burns to you take them right
