hall and I am very excited about this
Liu stepped out and kind of let me hop
in his seat and I talked to Jack and he
said I could unbox whatever I wanted I
really wanted to eat something and I
love pizza
I'm gonna be unboxing a pizza very
sturdy it's got air holes here here we
go nice hinge and look at that pie look
at that pie that looks nice
perfect wilting going on nice pockets of
cheese pretty good paper placement now I
like this crust you can tell hand-tossed
nice and soft I don't know if you can
hear that's what the crust sounds like
look at how this separates that it just
pulls apart so easily and now this is
something that I always look at with
pizza is how did they distribute the
toppings you can see it's not very even
on this one these two pieces do have the
wilted greens this one's got a tiny one
but that is not sufficient and this one
has none so that is the weak link
just want to get that in place so it
doesn't cause a problem I'm gonna do a
classic fold and then just it's so soft
you almost don't have to use your teeth
the crust gets a little bit firmer nope
not right now
shoo-shoo what's that what's over there
stop there you go back to the pizza
moving on to slice number two this one
has that wilted green down down maybe
later
real spiciness it's a it's a zesty pie
I'm gonna keep moving give it that
classic fold and then gum and lip it
very similar flavors as a first two
slices and then we're gonna move on to
the biggest slice slice number for the
finale I got a lot of cheese on that one
I like that and I'm gonna give the crust
a try
light and spongy and crust like very
good I'm gonna meet it like a pair of
lips slice number three and four I can
feel the powder on my lips so that was
unboxing a pizza my name is Brad Hall
blue we'll be back at some point
but until then enjoy a pizza pie always
good to have leftovers a lot to eat for
dinner I always say stop eating when
you're on the brink of feeling full then
you're gonna get hungry again then
you'll eat again is that Talent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
