be so you heard about the Apple watch
yes I have to I made a few videos on it
I've got one right here
you know it was a big deal everyone was
talking about it I never really ended up
wearing it every day I stuck to my
classic g-shock as you can see right
here and there's a reason for that
I like a bigger watch I like a tougher
watch I don't want to baby this stuff
around I don't want to you know treat it
like it belongs in a jewelry box it's
nice I'm glad it's stainless feeling all
that but I'm not really a fancy type of
dude I mean if it comes to my gadget
sometimes maybe I want to kick it a
little bit fancy but for the most part
I'm rugged I'm banging it I found this
the LunaTik EPIK rugged protection for
Apple watch this is the the military
version of the Apple watch if such a
thing existed so this guy fits around
the standard watch and makes it more
like this one more like a g-shot so if
you like me and you like something on
your wrist like this represents you a
little bit better maybe this is the
middle ground right here so let's crack
it open and see if we're feeling just to
touch more manly then when we got here I
know that's hard to imagine oh man I
like it already
I look how fat that strap is this is
what I'm talking about man what's it
saying here reinforced polycarbonate
impact absorbing pads rugged canvas
field strap soft suede backing look at
what I'm saying to see even this got
bigger over here comparatively speaking
you see now we're in the right
neighborhood there was probably a tool
or something in there that I threw away
yes do not overtighten rules words to
live by
okay little wrench in here many of you
know the Apple watch it already has
removable bands they kind of just slide
out they just slide out like that
I actually replace the band on this one
with this cool leather one put one on
one side one on the other that's my
guess right now just a good
old-fashioned watchmaker here okay we're
going to pull this out
easy I did a DIY video on how I got this
strap that's not from Apple onto the
Apple watch I'll link that if you want
to go check it out but that's not quite
as easy very small little pins these are
more robust here all right
slides right in there like that yes sir
and then this one over like that feed
this guy through just get it to that
snug get it to that snug and then leave
it alone move on with your life there we
go now look at the difference now oh
look at this the crown works see that
now your unobstructed as far as touching
the actual device as well you still have
access here to the microphone is a
cutout for the grille this thing is a
lot less elegant than it used to be and
that's what I like that's what I'm going
for here here's a g-shock comparatively
speaking
oh now you're probably wondering what
about charging it look at the cutout on
the back boom didn't change your life at
all now you just need to be a lot less
nervous about your Apple watch right oh
man look does that not look like it just
suits me more immediately for me you
know that's what I'm going for like I
said nothing too fancy or delicate just
as you know on a higher-end Apple watch
you're already working with a much more
durable display you've got the the
sapphire infused type of glass I made a
bunch of videos on that as well now you
put something like this on to protect
the the actual body of the watch this
isn't gonna be for everybody let's let's
be straight here I mean you're not doing
that with a suit right but I you're not
gonna see me in a suit either I go on
the red carpet in my pajamas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
