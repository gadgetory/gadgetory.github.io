headphones very seriously I know I
consider myself to be fairly well versed
in the land of headphones I know a lot
of people want to upgrade to something
Wireless if you go to the gym or you
like the job you travel you don't
necessarily want to wire going down
there all the time of course a wired
connection is always going to be great
for sound quality how much were those
final headphones almost 4 grand on a
pair of headphones today I have a
product that is not only Wireless but
it's also one of the more affordable
wireless headsets that I've seen ever
I've been using the IQ buds big fan of
those I kind of like dried but again a
higher price tag I don't even say it yet
they are the bullets Wireless the new
bullets wireless from oneplus they're 69
bucks they're trying to do what they did
to smartphones in a way bringing that
price point down but still delivering
value now obviously at this point I
haven't heard these yet they have
magnets and you know I love magnets you
power these things on and off just by
clicking them to one another and then
unclicking to turn them on they recharge
super quick kind of like the oneplus
smartphone according to one plus five
hours of battery life on here in a 10
minute charge they're actually currently
sold out on the oneplus website so keep
that in mind
oh nice little presentation but what is
this
oh that's satisfying it's a little
carrying case for your buds what is that
Zomba here's the charging cable USB
type-c ooh various ear tips very
important that you get the right fit
it's already got an ear hook and an ear
tip pre-installed they clip together
when not in use and that powers them
down and then when you take them apart
they power up like this hanging out
right like that something like that and
it's definitely better than a switch of
any kind here you can see the USB type-c
connector the total run time for music
playing is about eight hours on these
headphones you can also answer an end
phone calls from the remote in this
location oh yeah it shows up right away
oneplus bullets Wireless sits a little
deeper in your ear than something like
an air pod or ear pod if you're used to
that it lets play some music
so far so good you know for the price
point I'm starting to sniff some value
here I'm feeling comfy right now there's
something nice going on here at $69 I am
gonna test the the magnetic pause I clip
them together okay the music stop
so they power down you can see the
Bluetooth connection up there I'm gonna
disconnect these Wow
instantly these ones feel a little more
lightweight than what I'm used to and I
think I could probably have a more
extended session is this magnet gonna
hold up yeah they're not coming off
what do we do here do we just set what
we do I mean that's kind of convenient
now they aren't fully waterproof but
they are water-resistant I'm not a
hundred percent decided here on what is
the better approach to the wireless
earbud of course the price consideration
is the biggest thing I don't know of a
fully wireless earbud that I would
currently recommend at 69 bucks now
obviously these are not meant to replace
a headphone like my pxc 550 from
Sennheiser so I'm not necessarily
stacking this against those I'm trying
to put it in the right framework of what
this product is at this price and
whether or not I think that's a good
value my initial impressions here are
pretty good I don't want to try these
out a little bit and see how much the
small cable bothers me or maybe it won't
as a headset for taking phone calls
should I do a phone call hey well quick
phone call test you sound good but the
question is how do I sound really really
clear you see so that's the benefit
right there you have the microphone
right gear for the phone calls that was
a super clear phone call it's got a
little bit of everything it's not gonna
be the best at anything but it's $69 who
knows maybe I'll use them a little bit
you can ask me on Twitter if I if I'm
holding up my end of the bargain and if
these things are holding up their end of
the bargain
69 you got to think about it think they
deserve a little bit of attention
