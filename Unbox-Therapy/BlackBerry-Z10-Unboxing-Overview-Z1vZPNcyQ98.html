brand new z10 from blackberry I just got
back from the event that they were
having here in Toronto they're having a
number of events around the world they
announced this new phone as well as
another one and they launched it in the
UK for now it's going to be releasing
here in Canada on the 5th of February in
the u.s. in mid-march but we've got one
right now so why wait let's go ahead and
do an unboxing this is going to be a
little bit Rhynie compared to my other
unboxings but I want to get it up for
you guys quick because this device has
just come out so let's go ahead and take
a closer look at the product so as you
guys can tell this is not a retail
experience this is something that we got
as part of the BlackBerry experience at
the event so the retail unboxing might
be a little bit different although I'm
not sure of that as you can see here z10
on the top of the box and on the inside
you've got the device as well as this
velvet or felt like finish actually a
pretty nice presentation here the device
is surprisingly light but that's because
it has something that I didn't know it
had which is a removable battery so
let's go ahead and remove this
protective cover first there you go so
you can see the texture on the back it's
actually got a pretty grippy texture as
well as the new BlackBerry logo they are
not called rim anymore they officially
change their name today to BlackBerry up
here you've got your camera as well as
what looks like an LED flash and moving
to the front of the device this is where
your screen is go ahead and remove that
one got a blackberry logo on the bottom
forward facing camera speaker there's a
notification light in there that I saw
on the demo unit let's go ahead and look
at some of the other items in the box
before we take a closer look at the
device a little bit of paperwork saying
thank you very much from blackberry how
does this come out dad there we go okay
in here we have more paperwork not going
to bore you guys with that there is a
microUSB cable for charging the device
of course followed by a headset which is
good not all manufacturers are including
a headset anymore you've also got a
fairly small power brick pretty portable
there a carrying case which you know you
don't see that very often anymore so you
are gonna get
little carrying pouch with your z10
cleaning cloth as well microfiber
cleaning cloth the battery this I
believe is an 1800 milliamp hour battery
when we were at the event they were
actually showing off an external battery
but since this is removable you can
carry a couple of these and actually
improve your battery life that way so
the back does come off of this device so
anyways that gives you a look at what's
included the back is removable like I
just said so I might as well show you
guys what that is like it's a little bit
tough to get off there so that's what
the interior looks like and you can see
that there's actually some removable
storage as well looks like a microSD
slot which is always a nice addition and
then taking a closer look around the
device you could see the port's here
we've got the this one actually is your
HDMI micro HDMI followed by your micro
USB charging port syncing port etc as we
move around to the other side here
you've got your volume rocker and then
in between is your mute button
convenience button they're calling it a
believe it's programmable on the top you
have your power switch as well as a
headphone jack and a noise cancelling
mic now something to mention here is
that you know you might be annoyed
having your power button or hold switch
up at the top of the device I know I
never like having it in that location
but something cool that this phone
features is the ability to unlock your
device with a swipe up so that means
that you're going to be able to not have
to reach up like this and put your hand
in an uncomfortable position for
something that you do so commonly on a
smartphone so you can just swipe
straight up and it'll unlock so anyways
I'll go off camera for a quick second
and then boot up the device okay so now
I've got the device booted up and as I
said before you can unlock just by
swiping up that gesture right there the
entire OS is very smooth much smoother
than I expected it to be and really so
far it's been a pleasure to use the main
sort of feature here the thing that
they're talking about most is this
function here where you swipe from left
to right and you get access to
blackberry hub which is essentially your
notifications this is the place where
your text messages emails etc are going
to live so it's a really quick way of
getting in and out of there and
jumping back into real time applications
that are you know functioning in the
background here or not in the background
I guess right in the foreground of your
homepage you've also got a section here
for more traditional looking icons for
your apps a very exciting new OS in a
space that's been dominated by basically
a couple of OSS for a while now so I'll
probably go into more detail on this
device right here in future videos if
that's something you guys want to see
make sure to leave a thumbs up down
below if you enjoyed this unboxing also
please remember to leave a thumbs up
down below and subscribe if you haven't
yet and yeah hopefully I'll get you guys
some more coverage on the new z10 from
blackberry and maybe the other new
BlackBerry the q10 as well
alright guys nice as always for watching
and I'll catch you on the next video
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
