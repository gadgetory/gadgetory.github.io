it was a regular backpack it's highly
unlikely that I'd be showing it to you
here on unbox therapy where your
expectations are up here they're out of
the frame they're so high you look at my
videos they're like loose show me the
hot thing well here's the problem
showing you the hot thing then you want
the next hot thing and then your heat
meter it gets up here but that's okay
that's the way I want you to be because
that's the way I am I'm like what is
that next cool thing and how cool is it
show me show me what you got so this
backpack does something special it's
called the most pack moss pack most pack
there's a power situation happening in
here now we've seen backpacks previously
that have built-in batteries how did
they approach it first off it's a high
quality backpack canvas it's got all the
pouches you would expect spots in here
for your various pens devices but then
things start to get a little bit more
interesting you open up your first
pocket and there's something you notice
there's a little slot where you can push
cable through this little pouch here is
meant for your phone and the cable to
keep your phone chargers meant to go
through there Lou you're showing me a
backpack right now yes I am this thing
is all about keeping your gadgets
charged and the way that it does that is
by having you plug the backpack in not
the individual gadgets but the backpack
itself there's an actual charger a power
cord in the bottom of the pack you want
your battery pack itself to be modular
you don't necessarily want the battery
pack always in the same bag the battery
pack can become a component in the
backpack you still have access to your
ports and you can keep that charge so
how do you keep this charge at the very
bottom of this bag is an actual power
brick a slim power brick which fits down
there nice and you don't notice it when
it's tucked away a power port so you can
actually send power out to a laptop and
then some decent space for your USB
chargers as well now this is important
because the power port is probably going
to be used for a laptop power brick
right let's imagine for a second you got
the laptop plugged in as well I'm going
to tuck this back down here
and then you use these little cable ties
here to manage the length you don't have
all that cable floating around you take
your little power and that goes like
that and the whole thing closes up right
so now it's like you're out you're
traveling if you like me you travel a
lot you're needing juice for all your
different stuff what do you do with this
bag how do you charge up everything how
do you charge up the the battery bank
how do you charge up your phone which
might be in the front how do you charge
up your laptop okay this is the
beautiful moment right over here you
unzip down the side check this out
access to your cable right there I mean
that's it's a simple thing but it makes
perfect sense plug the bag in and
everything is juicing
I mean what's better than getting juice
for one thing it's juicing it all my
strategy here is you put the battery
bank in and then that goes to your
various USB components and now you've
got juice on top of juice now your
portably juiced and this guy like I said
it just goes back in there and it zips
as a backpack you've got some nice
straps some padding here you got the
chest strap if you're carrying more
weight a waterproof section for a water
bottle so what you'll see is it'll pop
through and then plug that in and now
you're juiced up there as well so you
got juice to this front compartment
through that pass through there's
nothing worse than being without the
juice when you need it this makes sure
that you don't have to remember to
charge each independent one yank out the
power cord juice it all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
