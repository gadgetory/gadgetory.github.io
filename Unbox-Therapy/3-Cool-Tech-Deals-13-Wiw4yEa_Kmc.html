together are you ready 3 2 1
what's up guys Lew here back with
another video and today we're talking
tech deals Tech talking about deals
three of them technically four of them
because I don't follow the rules
sometimes
today is one of those days to kick it
off we're starting with D brand good
friends over there we hang out sometimes
we get lunch sometimes they skin my
devices whether I like it or not well
they have a new product it is a skin for
the ath m50x headphones as you can tell
you can customize these babies I'll put
them on for you guys if you have a pair
you can now get a custom appearance so
they don't look like everybody else's
but just for unbox therapy viewers 10
lucky buyers of skins at this 25%
discount are going to receive a free
pair of these exact headphones as you
can see right there ten random orders
today will include a free set of ath
m50x headphones it says it right there I
don't even need to say it they're saying
it we're saying it but of course this
show is about many tech deals so it does
not stop there next up we have the blue
vivo air LTE smartphone that I featured
fairly recently I will link that video
in the description if you haven't seen
it yet but this thing is a hundred and
forty-nine dollars right now it was
relatively affordable at $1.99 now it's
50 dollars less now something special
about this device is it happens to be
the world's thinnest LTE smartphone I
believe certainly at the time I did my
video it was got a headset cable comes
with a screen protector and a case 50
bucks off and already affordable super
thin LTE Android smartphone that's a lot
of words combined together next up this
is for PlayStation 4 owners it's for
the ps4 I've got more than one ps4 and
in every single situation where I have
one set up there are never enough
controller charging capabilities this
little stand right here it's 18 bucks
$17.99 at the front section there
there's a little docking station which
will charge two controllers just by
setting them in there then on the side
you have three more USBs so you could
theoretically be charging five
controllers at once or other devices
maybe you need a spot to charge your
phone or your friend is one of these
guys his phone is never charged you can
ever reach him send it send a couple
texts who knows he doesn't get them
stuff goes badly goes wrong he gets into
a car crap what well just fender benders
wonder what a fender bender I bet you
that terms have been around for a
hundred years
the old fender bender the reviews are
good so it obviously works it's also got
a fan in it they're gonna keep your
Playstation a little bit cooler than it
would otherwise be maybe extend its life
a little bit in general I like it cool
put my uh my polar bear friends penguins
arctic fox snow owl moose we have one
more deal this one is the WTF moment it
is the lab see I bed tablet stand I'm
looking at this you know kind of
laughing a little bit but then I'm
really thinking about it and I'm saying
you know what I might actually would it
be so weird if I actually use something
like this here's the thing you picked up
my Netflix or whatever you're holding it
there your hand is falling asleep you
can't concentrate pins and needles this
stand lets you just lay underneath it
look at that that could be you a little
bit of an angle some adjustment you're
holding it above your head you slip its
falls down maybe it cracks you over the
eyebrow
now you're getting stitches you got this
giant scar people call you Scarface
you move to Miami you start to import
cocaine on those little cigarette boats
now you're in jail for the rest of your
life it's kind of weird and it does look
like a toilet bowl I thought it was just
I don't know I thought it was funny
there you have it the I beg solving all
of your first world problems there you
have it five cool tech deals it's only
four
everyone's doing the math on me here
they're like that was 17 deals we do get
your bonus here
it's like two-for-one pizza who's gonna
complain today I only ordered one all
right um I've said enough one more thing
if you're still here at this point in
the video then you're probably a pretty
good fan like you probably really like
these videos and maybe you might just
even like me like as a person it's
possible if that's the case then what I
want you to do is come check out a new
channel that I started and I was
contemplating whether or not I was going
to even say this on unbox therapy at all
because there's like this really nice
little community on this hidden channel
right now but I figured it would only be
fair to let you guys know what's
happening that's why I'm doing at the
very end of the video only for the
superfans only for the attention spans
yeah it's like it's it's a musical
experiment I used to be really into
music I stopped doing it I started to
mess around again uploaded a few things
if you think you might be into that
come check that out I'll put a link in
the description say what's up if you're
not feeling it no hard feelings you just
carry on with your unbox therapy love
because that is already more than enough
kind of having like unbox therapy
flashbacks on that channel as far as
like having this small group of people
that I'm like commenting back to you and
it's it's it's manageable in a different
way it's kind of special you could be
one of those first few
people to say hey I was here man I was
here when it all went down thank you
I appreciate your time sincerely I will
catch you on the next episode later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
