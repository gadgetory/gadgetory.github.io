smartphones boxes I've seen in a while
it's called the armored 2 from this
company EULA phone I kind of knew what
it was about
based on the name water resistance shock
resistance and dust resistant baked
right in ip68 waterproof Helio p25
octa-core processor 6 gigs of ram 64
gigs of storage it's got a fingerprint
reader it's running Android 7 one is 13
megapixels the other 16 5 inch 1080p
display 4700 milliamp hour battery so
it's going to be quite substantial it's
solid it needs to be it's military stuff
I'm gonna put that down for a second a
little bit of paperwork headphone
adapter type c2 mini jack a rather nice
type C charge cable they've also
included a type C 2 micro USB adapter
quick charge power brick and a
screwdriver what do I need that for oh
that's a man's phone right there
alright so fingerprint reader there on
the front by the looks of it also a
front-facing camera on this side we have
the power switch push-to-talk button
works with a particular app with walkie
talkie like functionality tactical stuff
right there this is a dedicated camera
button and then on the other side we
have volume up and down 2 persons there
and even a dedicated SOS button type C
port is deeply seated in there fits in
there with a gasket so it's all sealed
up they just want to make sure that the
cover is on the type-c connector and
also that this plate on the back is
screwed in this is where your SIM card
is gonna go I presume wow that's cool
also with a gasket on it 2 separate SIM
card slots and a micro SD card slot
that's kind of cool I'm noticing here
that they didn't really do much to
Android it's pretty straight up Android
7 here there's a few apps outdoor
toolbox Wow look at that sound meter
compass flashlight heartrate picture
hanging bubble level I mean it's all
tool there's an SOS app that's pretty
obvious what that's for and then this
Zelo app is the one that you will use
with that push-to-talk button if you had
like a team of guys on a jobsite who all
had this device or even other devices
who use this app now you just hit that
button over over and
out you know I'm saying come to the
coordinates Willie do what's happening
man over we can have walkie-talkies in
the office here guys downstairs is kind
of far away all right well that's a cool
app on its own I could see all kinds of
people would be like a park ranger guy
who works on a Conservation once you do
get me dialing everyone all the time you
need quick SOS over and out come in
Mayday look at this yes we're wondering
about other things what about the
speaker what about the camera you got to
use those still let's check out some
unbox therapy here getting a better idea
for the audio here this is not the
brightest screen I've ever seen but it
does look pretty good I mean this this
ain't OLED boys and girls the speaker is
not terrible it's not the worst I ever
heard but you can cover it up quite
easily it's right here
bye-bye thing is it fires to the back as
well built in circuits that's the part
that makes this cooler than your average
screen protector an adhesive coating if
it's on the table
it actually amps it up a little bit more
by bouncing off the surface it seems
like it's intended to be used that way
I'm guessing because you would have it
on your desk your dash or something if
you were doing like speakerphone on here
and you will be able to discern more
likely let's play some SoundCloud real
quick oh wow I have a really loud
cheetah on the dash
I take back what I said about the
speaker actually when his maxed out is
pretty loud it really benefits from just
being on the table the camera oh my
goodness single lens on the back this
might be the most surprising aspect for
me is that the camera is actually decent
it's not the fastest shutter I've ever
used obviously you can tell just a
Conner lurking in the bushes hiding from
the mob does he still fight or no if I
was to switch over to pro mode Wow a lot
of settings there saturation brightness
contrast exposure ISO white balance
there's a digital zoom function it also
looks like there's an HDR mode self
timer GPS location you can change the
size of the image by default it's the
full 16 megapixels there's also a face
detection pretty decent but the role of
a device like this is absolute
ruggedness 4700 milliamp hour battery in
it if it's just standby you're looking
for that could mean a ton even screen on
time I predict would be good on this
device it is relatively small by today's
standards display at 5 inches and it's
1080p so it's not some crazy high
resolution plus you have all these
tactile buttons you can access quickly
even if you were wearing a glove which
you might be doing if you're outdoors
military-style fishing camping hiking
even if you were to put an otter box
kind of case let's say on an iPhone or
something like that it's still difficult
to access the buttons if you need to be
wearing gloves a device like this this
could be a really cool idea for somebody
who needs something rugged that's built
to be out on the job you add in the
dedicated walkie-talkie functionality
and I think it's actually pretty cool
240 bucks kind of in a gray area there
it's not super cheap but not super
expensive once again it's the armor 2
from EULA phone I'll link it down in the
description so you guys can check it out
for yourself but if you're in the market
for a rugged device that can go where no
man has gone before
would it work on the moon jack doesn't
even believe we've been to the moon so
how about that Flat Earth Society</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
