holding it is the iPhone six-plus from
the bend test video that I did a little
while ago if you haven't seen that video
I'll link it in the description but I
think most you have I have a feeling
that most of you have now the reason I'm
holding it today is not just to show off
how beautiful it is the purpose is to
talk about this which is a new case from
a company called incipio the supposedly
bend proof iPhone case as you can see on
the front here now I haven't chose to
use the words Bend proof it's actually
written right on the front of the box
innovative craftsmanship exceptionally
strong defend against the bend now
obviously I'm very skeptical about what
this case is going to be capable of but
I do have an unbent perfectly
functioning iphone six-plus and we're
going to put in the case and test that
theory so let's go ahead open up the box
and take a closer look at the case
itself and begin to speculate on whether
or not it's going to be strong enough to
withstand the force of these right here
so inside the package you basically have
the case itself and that's it now the
case doesn't look very complicated it's
got these metal bars on each side I was
told at first they were made of titanium
but then I think it turned into just
regular steel obviously any kind of
reinforcement is going to improve the
rigidity of the device I'm pretty sure I
could just bend that in half really the
case has all the necessary cutouts for
your headphone jack charging port your
speaker as well as your camera on the
back it's made out of a hard clear
plastic and then the sides are a TPU
style plastic so let's go ahead and
install the 6 plus and as I mentioned
this is a completely functioning 6 plus
powered on there so you can see that so
here we go again guys we're gonna
see what this case is made of now I
don't I don't think this case is going
to do any it feels like it's bending
quite easily be honest with you you can
see I mean it's not tragic it's
certainly not like the other one but it
is beginning to bend a little bit I
don't think it's been proof I'll say
that obviously nothing has really been
proof and they probably shouldn't be
using that wording Bend resistant maybe
I do think the case is enhancing the
rigidity a little bit did not expect to
find these results I thought this thing
would be weaker to be honest with you
now again you know what I can bend it
but it takes a lot of force I'm
impressed
let me do it one more time I know
there's so many people in the comments
going dude I don't believe you can
certainly bend in it it's harder man I
swear to be clear the case is bendable
if you ply it or break it it looks like
I've shattered the steel in there yes
definitely when you go back and forth
enough times you can break it but that
doesn't change the fact that it is going
to enhance some up the rigidity of your
device Bend proof hell no I mean look at
that
I'm bending the damn thing right here
it's obviously not been proof not a big
fan of the wording but going to make it
harder to inadvertently bend your six
plus when it's in there and honestly a
lot of it just has to do with the
rigidity of the plastic as much as these
metal rods have to do with it
