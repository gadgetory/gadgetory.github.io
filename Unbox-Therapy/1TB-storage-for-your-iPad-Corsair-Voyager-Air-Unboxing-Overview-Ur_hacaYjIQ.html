and today we're taking a look at the
Voyager air from Corsair this is the one
terabyte model and even though at first
glance it looks like your standard
everyday external hard drive this packs
in a lot more in terms of functionality
it is a mobile wireless storage device
with Ethernet that will give you the
ability to stream a ton of content to a
number of different mobile devices
including the iPad for example so I'm
going to give you a quick breakdown on
how that works in the real world I'll
give you an example as you guys know you
have limited storage on an iPad at most
even if you get the most expensive
version you only get 64 gigabytes of
storage which for people who are media
hoarders like myself that's actually not
a ton especially for HD video content so
you get a device like this which has a
built in network interface and this will
give you the ability to have access at
all times to your entire media library
now since this also has a built in
battery capable of providing up to seven
hours of continuous video streaming that
means that you can take this thing with
you in a portable sense while you're on
the go whether you're going on a road
trip doing some air travel you can stick
this in your backpack have all your
media with you and never have to worry
about offloading that content from your
iPad you know moving some video files
off moving some music off and then
rearranging everything that's really an
annoyance so even though this will work
as your standard one terabyte drive what
makes it special is that ability with
the built-in battery and the ability to
stream content from it in fact you can
stream up to five separate video streams
so it'll even work with your friends you
know if you've got multiple iPads in
your environment let's talk about the
unboxing the first thing you saw was
actually a little adapter for the power
brick it just clips in as you can tell
this is a universal brick so depending
on your region you'll get the subsequent
prongs that match up this also comes
with a car adapter which is pretty cool
I guess they understand that this will
make a lot of sense to use in your car
on a road trip you've also got a
proprietary cable looks like it's a
proprietary cable with USB on the other
end this does support USB 3 so you're
going to get some really quick file
transfer it'll allow you to copy Full HD
movies in seconds to be more precise the
device is black and red which are two of
my favorite colors especially when used
in combination and other than that it
sort of looks like your standard
external hard drive portable one that is
because I'm guessing it's got a two and
a half inch disc hard disk drive in the
inside you get a little carrying pouch
as well this is a soft microfiber like
cloth with a drawstring to keep it's
safe from dust and whatnot when you
happen to be traveling with it there's a
closer look at the USB cable as well as
your power adapter you're going to plug
this into the wall when you're using it
at home but also to recharge the device
when you're ready to take it on a trip
now this is useful up to 90 feet or 30
meters in terms of range so you can
actually be a fair distance from it and
still be streaming back content you can
see you've got LEDs on the front which
will notify you of the functionality of
the device whether it's powered on
whether the Wi-Fi is turned on for
example this will work with iOS it'll
work with devices like the iPad iPhone
iPod Touch and Android tablets and
smartphones so regardless of what you
use you're going to be able to get
wonderful streaming and one terabyte of
wireless storage for any of those mobile
devices I'm pretty sure that you guys
are either using Android or iOS actually
let's go ahead and do a quick poll right
now are you using Android for your main
device or are you using iOS like an
iPhone or an iPad as your main mobile
device or maybe you're using neither
maybe you use Windows Phone or something
or maybe you're on blackberry I don't
know let me know down in the comments
let's have a quick little tally of how
many users are on each platform it would
be cool to go through the comments and
take a quick peek at that
anyways that wraps up the first look at
the Voyager air this is your solution
for content for media when you're on the
go so you can take all those wonderful
video files with you I'm not going to
ask where you got all those video files
from that's completely up to you but
this is going to give you the ability to
take like full seasons of shows and not
be limited by the storage that's
included on your mobile device which
generally speaking isn't all that great
if you're interested in pricing and
availability on the Voyager air from
core
Sayre I will drop a link down in the
description that will show you all that
information thanks as always for
watching guys if you enjoyed this
content please remember to leave a
thumbs up down below it means a lot and
other than that we'll catch you in the
next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
