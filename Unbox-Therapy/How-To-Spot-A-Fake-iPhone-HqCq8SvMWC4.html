iPhone you take a glance around here
iPhone 6s the back looks the same I mean
it looks like an iPhone but it ain't an
iPhone this my friend is a high-quality
high-caliber Chinese iPhone knockoff
let's go ahead and find out what the
differences are maybe there are none
maybe they'll fool me completely
maybe we should all be using enough I
highly doubt it so the first thing being
a guy who has unboxed a number of
iPhones the first thing that that'll tip
you off that you've got a fake is this
little bag here this tray they have
something similar to that let's look at
it the device actually wow that's a
pretty good fake here's a real one and
here's a fake one whoa
okay another thing I noticed is where
the front-facing camera is it's a little
bit more pronounced on the knockoff and
also oh the writing here it's a few more
FCC do not dispose type logos there but
otherwise man okay you can
that's another spot so on the real
iPhone you've got this type of cut out
on this one there's a line almost drawn
into the aluminum also is it a little
bit lighter that area there is pretty
much identical and this area here is
pretty much that is that's amazing
there's a ridge here you can kind of
feel it with your finger that doesn't
exist it's much more smooth on the real
deal I don't know man to to the
untrained individual that baby might
pass Wow Chinese writing there bit of a
giveaway ah lightning cable to a
European plug and then some ear pods oh
my
Oh a little bit slower it displays a bit
of a giveaway as well
much more dim but look at this now this
thing is obviously running some kind of
Android right but it's skinned with this
iOS look-alike there's the Settings menu
the font is a little bit off when I use
the ringer on this one that's what it
looks like on this one slightly
different something tells me the camera
image quality is not gonna be as good
okay there's one off fake iPhone real
iPhone yeah that's another giveaway
image quality on the camera I mean what
happens if you go to the iTunes Store
here the iTunes Store takes you to
Spotify okay that's a bit of another
giveaway but let's be honest man if
someone's trying to swindle somebody on
Craigslist or something and they don't
go in and check everything we're all
face times that bring me to Skype or
something oh just the dialer there's a
little vibration as well that's
prominent on the fake unit okay let's do
a little video slash speaker test here
interesting a bag of chips here in there
on the rare occasion when you're not
eating kale okay
knocked off sounds like a knockoff
specifically snacks to come in bags you
might not finish the whole bag all
through my tempted true regular iPhone
selfie time versus oh definitely not of
the same caliber here my rules real
versus fake the screen should be bright
and vibrant this one's a little bit
washed out check the camera the quality
should be obvious check the app store
the fake one will take you to Google
Play and of course the iTunes Store
which takes you to Spotify don't be
fooled by that either but otherwise they
might have you fooled don't send your
grandma to buy an iPhone
off of Craigslist she might come back
with a fake one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
